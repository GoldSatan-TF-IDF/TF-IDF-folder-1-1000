harry turtledove liberating atlantis book i i if not for the floorboard that came up at one end it might all have happened differently or it might never have happened at all how do you measure mighthavebeens frederick radcliff never found an answer to that and the question was in his mind much of the time hed never known a slave in whose mind that question had not taken root and flourished frederick radcliff was a slave himself a house slave on henry and clotilde barfords plantation thirty miles outside of new marseille he was of middle height but uncommonly broad through the shoulders by his complexion he was somewhere between griffe and mulattohe had more than a quarter white blood in him but less than half he never used his surname where the master and mistress could hear him do it legally the surname didnt belong to him legally nothing belonged to any black or copperskinned slave in the united states of atlantis legally the whites and the occasional free blacks and copperskins who owned them also owned everything that was theirs regardless of what might be legally true plenty of slaves claimed descent from radcliffs or radcliffes the great white clan descendants of the english fisherman whod founded the first settlement in atlantis had flourished mightily in the four hundred years since henry barford claimed a radcliffe connection on his mothers side clotilde nee delvoie claimed a kersauzon connection on her mothers side the descendants of the breton fisherman whod led edward radcliffe to atlantis but whod settled here after him had also done well for themselves the radcliffs and radcliffes and indeed the kersauzons had been fruitful and multiplied and they hadnt been shy about lying down with slave women to do it after four centuries in atlantis some of edward radcliffes descendants had flourished more mightily than others of course there were radcliff and radcliffe drunkards in the gutters of towns all over the usa there were radcliff and radcliffe butchers and bakers and candlestick makersand farmers always farmers there were radcliff and radcliffe doctors and lawyers and preachers and there were radcliff and radcliffe leaders as there had always been in atlantis more than a quarter of the consuls whod headed the united states of atlantis since the war for freedom were radcliffs or radcliffes and quite a few others had the blood without the name victor radcliff had commanded the atlantean assemblys army in the war against england after the war was won he became one of the two first consuls isaac fenner the other was descended from a crewman on edward radcliffes fishing boat every atlantean schoolboy knew the first consuls names as well as he knew his own so did frederick radcliff although slaves to put it mildly were not encouraged to acquire an education and frederick radcliff had a stronger reason to remember the first consuls names or at least one of them than a schoolboys fear of the masters switch victor radcliff was his grandfather so his mother had told him over and over again the story was that victor radcliff had come down into southern atlantis to join up with the marquis de la fayettes french army and that fredericks grandmothers owner lent her to the general so he wouldnt have to sleep in a cold bed nine months later his father was born frederick didnt remember his father nicholas radcliff had died when he was three years old hed stepped on a rusty nail outside and lockjaw set inso fredericks mother said shed been a house slave too and taught frederick what he needed to know so he wouldnt have to go out to the fields and work under the hot sun and the overseers lash he knew he lived pretty soft for a slave he was friends with the cooksalso slavesso he got plenty to eat maybe he didnt dine quite so well as the master and mistress and their children now married and out on their own but he knew how the field hands envied his rations he slept in a bed one of the masters sons had used before him his bedclothes were ones the white folks had almost but not quite worn out all that use only made the linen softer no not bad at all for a slave but if his grandmother had been white no wheedling cooks then no handmedownsno stuff other people didnt want any more or didnt need no swallowing his pride to keep from angering people who could do anything they wanted with him including putting him up for sale like a horse or an anvil if he were the white grandson of one of the first consuls of the united states of atlantis he would be a rich man he would be an educated man people would respect him admire him because of who his grandfather was he might be getting ready to stand for consul himself he might already have served a twoyear term instead instead he had a meeting with that floorboard he was never the same afterwards neither were the united states of atlantis henry barford didnt have many friends he would hunt with his sons or other neighboring planters every now and then he would drink with them every now and then too frederick had learned just how much brandy to pour into his coffee the morning after one of those drinking parties a shot and a half was about right to take the edge off the pain in the masters hair clotilde now was social butterfly not social caterpillar she was always clattering off in the carriage to visit the neighbor ladies they gathered to sew or read books together to stuff themselves with fried chicken or starberry pie to pour down barreltreerum punch they didnt drink as hard as their husbands but there werent many teetotalers among them and always to gossip and when clotilde wasnt clattering off to visit the neighbor ladies they were clattering in to visit her frederick supposed she made a good guest he knew she made a good hostess she was as plump as a pillow and as friendly as a puppyto her equals anyhow she wasnt especially hard on the house slaves not so long as everything went well sometimes only a few neighbor ladies visited the plantation three or four times a year though clotilde would invite everybody from miles around if you were doing well for yourself you were expected to show off a bit or more than a bit whenever one of those grand convocations came along henry barford would take a jug and either secrete himself away in an upstairs bedroom or go pay a call on the overseer the next morning frederick would make a point of correcting his coffee it was a sultry sticky summers day people who knew said the weather in the southeast on the other side of the green ridge mountains was even worse but this was bad enough for all ordinary use frederick woke with the bedclothes sticking to him in weather like this he slept bare but for drawers helen his woman had on only a thin cotton shift a slave preacher had made a marriage ceremony for the two of themmore than half a lifetime ago nowbut it had no force of law the barfords could sell or give away either one of them any time they chose with a sigh frederick said hate to climb into the monkey suit today gonna roast my bones for the sake of swank helen looked at him you sooner go out and weed amongst the cotton plants howd you like to swing a hoe all day oh ill wear the monkey suit frederick said resignation in his voice but i dont have to like it if the other choice is worse you better like the one you got helen said she was in no way an educated womanshe could barely read and could not even sign her namebut she had her share of common sense and then some frederick stubborn and more hottempered had just enough sense to realize helen had more he sighed again reckon youre right he said and leaned over to give her a kiss she brought up a hand and rubbed first her cheek and then his better shave tooyoure all scratchy miz clotilde shell yell at you if she got to tell you that once more it wasnt as if she were wrong i shaved yesterday frederick protested feebly helen just looked at him he let out another resigned sigh and scraped his cheeks and chin smooth with a straight razor he had a heavier beard than most negro men did and as for copperskins that probably came down from his white grandfather like the rest of his inheritance from victor radcliff it did him no good at all he kissed helen again after he finished she smiled and nodded that was worth a little something anyway then he put on the white shirt with the tight collar the cravat the black wool trousers the black wool jacket the black socks and the tight black shoes that pinched his feet dont you look fine helen said sweat was already running down his face maybe i do he said but i sure wont be sorry to take this stuff off again come the night he left it there his woman was right wearing the monkey suit had to be an improvement on a field hands shapeless colorless homespun an earlyrising woodpeckers drumming punctuated the dawn stillness the cooks already had coffee boiling in the kitchen frederick and helen gulped big snarling cups only partly tamed by sugar a cook gave them bowls of cornmeal mush and chopped salt pork a couple of young colored maids were in there eating too soon theyd be off on one last orgy of sweeping and dusting everything today had to be right feathers flew in the kitchenliterally black hands plucked chickens ducks a terranovan turkey and a couple of oil thrushes the master had shot in the woods the day before the wormeating atlantean birds made mighty fine eating they couldnt fly and they had no great fear of man they were so tasty and so stupid they grew ever scarcer in a way frederick pitied them how could a man who dared not run away not pity a flightless bird pity them as he would though he ate of them whenever he got the chance and if that doesnt suit me to be a slaveowner may i be damned if i know what would frederick thought he poured himself more coffee outside another rhythmic thunking noise joined the woodpeckers percussive syncopation one of the field hands was chopping firewood as frederick poured down the strong brown brewdarker than he was if not a great dealhe nodded to himself no matter how warm the day the kitchens would go through a great plenty of pine and cypress today hed heard white men newly come from england complain about the lack of hardwoods oak and maple and hickory they said burned longer and hotter than atlantean lumber he hadnt noticed that the lack made them pack up and go back where they came from all it did was give them something to complain about he understood that everybody needed something of the sort a slave by the nature of things had plenty to complain about the only trouble was complaining didnt do him any good clotilde barford swept into the kitchen in a rustle of silk the dress she wore was a pretty good copy of what had been almost the height of fashion in paris eight or nine years earlier she wasnt yet attired for receiving company before her guests arrived she would put on a pretty good copy of what had been almost the height of fashion in paris year before last that would be plenty to let her keep up with the other women now she was dressed for cracking the whip get moving you lazy niggers she snapped almost all the house slaves were negroes whites trusted them further than copperskins that shamed frederick more than it pleased him the mistress didnt care one way or the other sitting around lollygagging the nerve of you people frederick glanced over at helen helens eyes had already swung his way they carefully didnt smile the mistress was in a state all right she got this way every time her friends and neighbors gathered here the abuse mostly didnt mean anything mostly she pointed a pale pudgy forefinger at frederick aiming it as henry barford must have aimed his shotgun at the oil thrushes everything better be perfect when they get here perfect you hear me yes maam he scooped up his last few spoonfuls of mush doublequick so she could see he was hurrying like any sensible slave he moved no faster than he had to why should he when he was working for someone elses benefit rather than his own sometimes though you had no choice if the mistress or the master stood over you you had to step lively and clotilde was liable to have her beady little blue eyes on him every livelong minute till her gathering proved the triumph shed known all along it would beknown all along it had better be anyhow frederick took a heroic swallow that drained the coffee mug and almost drowned him he hurried out of the kitchen helen wasnt more than half a step behind him he wondered if the mistress would pursue them not yet she stayed in there and laid down the law to the cooks as if she were moses and they the children of israel most of them had heard the speech before frederick certainly had that didnt stop clotilde barford from coming out with it again stop her it didnt even slow her down she does go on helen said and on and on and on frederick agreed rolling his eyes they both smiled but they also both spoke in low voices and neither one of them laughed you never could tell who might be listening you never could tell who might be tattling either the house slaves had been scouring the big houseso called in contrast to the overseers cottage and the slaves shacksfor more than a week now wood glowed with oily strongsmelling polish the good china had been scrubbed and scrubbed again even the silver had been polished and shone dazzlingly in the sun and more than well enough in the shade but of course everything had to be done one more time on the day itself the housemaids bustled around dusting and shining they slowed down whenever they didnt think frederick could see them as he feared they might tell on him for saying unkind things about the mistress so they worried he would tell on them if he caught them slacking as coal and wood fed a steam engine so fear and distrust fed the engine of slavery careful there one maid warned another who was swiping crystal goblets with a rag you drop one of them itll come out of your hide dont i know it the other one replied now why dont you find somethin for your own self to do stead of standin there playin the white man over me playin the white man over me fredericks mouth twisted overseers who were slaves themselves commonly failed and often ended up hurt or dead negroes and copperskins didnt care to follow orders from their own kind they thought their fellows who tried to give those orders were getting above their station they were right about that what they didnt see was that whites who ordered them around were also above their station whites had more than looks on their side of course they had the weight of centuries of tradition behind them and if that weight turned out not to be enough they also had whips and dogs and guns with such cheerful reflections spinning inside his head frederick nodded respectfully as he had to nod to henry barford as his owner came down the stairs mornin master henry he said mornin fred barford replied he was dressed in a shirt that had seen better days and trousers that had seen better yearsthey were out at both knees he hadnt bothered putting on shoes or stockings he often didnt he seemed happy enough to let his hairy toes enjoy the fresh air maybe his wife would talk him into dressing up for her guests more than likely hed stay comfortable and sit this one out with a jug the way he did most of the time he caught fredericks eye again clotildes already in the kitchen checkin up on things is she even if he hadnt known her habits anyone not deaf as a stump would have had no trouble figuring out where she was and what she was doing frederick nodded economically yes sir well shed better turn davey loose long enough to sizzle me some bacon and fry up a couple of eggs in the grease thats all ive got to tell you barford hurried past frederick the view from behind showed his pants were out at the seat too frederick couldnt imagine how much trouble hed get in for wearing such disreputable clothes no he could imagine it much too well but the master did as he pleased that was what liberty was all about henry barford took it for granted back in victor radcliffs day the proclamation of liberty had announced to the world that atlantis was free from england had the atlantean assembly convening in the little town of honkers mill noticed how many people the proclamation of liberty left out not many of the laws the united states of atlantis had passed since gave much sign of it there had been uprisings here in the southern parts of atlantis where slavery remained a legal and moneymaking operation assuming there were differences between the two planters and farmers and white townsfolk put them down with as much brutality as they needed and a little more besides to give the slaves second thoughts next time once or twice the atlantean army helped local militias smash revolts what were the odds the army wouldnt do the same thing again frederick sighed one more time you couldnt win not if you were colored you couldnt even break evennot a chance and they would hunt you with hounds if you tried to run off to the north where negroes and copperskins were free they werent sure to catch you but they had a pretty good chance hed never had the nerve to flee things werent too bad where he was he could tell himself they werent anyhow the top circle of hell wasnt supposed to be too bad either good pagans went there didnt they the only thing they were missing was the presence of god frederick nodded to himself yes that about summed things up the first carriage rattled up to the big house before ten in the morning a black man in clothes as fancy as fredericks drove it a frozenfaced negro in an even more splendid getuphe looked ready to hunt foxesrode behind when the carriage stopped he jumped down and opened the door so veronique barker could descend like clotilde barford she was from an old french family that had married into the nowdominant englishspeaking wave of settlers whod swarmed south after france lost its atlantean holdings ninety years before henry barford wasnt a bad fellow by everything frederick had ever heard benjamin barker was a firstclass son of a bitch sure enough clotilde had changed into her new gown by the time veronique arrived the mistress swept down to greet her guest in blue tulle and a cloud of rosewater almost thick enough to see so good to have you here dear she trilled then she switched to bad french to add you look lovely oh so do you sweetheart veronique answered in the same language spoken about as well frederick could follow themhis own french was on the same level here in the southern atlantean states most people had at least a smattering though english gained year by year arm in arm chattering in the two languages clotilde and veronique went into the big house veronique thought nothing of leaving her driver and footman standing there in the hot sun fredericks mistress probably would have been more considerate but there were no guarantees pointing frederick told the driver why dont you put the carriage under those trees horses can graze there if they want and they wont cook i do that the driver agreed marcus and me we wont cook in the shade neither thats a fact said the footmanpresumably marcus before too long well bring you out something to eat something to drink frederick promised got me somethin to drink the driver pulled a flask from one of his jacket pockets then quickly made it disappear before anyone white could see it foodd be mighty good though when the white ladies gits together all the niggers who takes em gits together too thats a fact marcus said again when he reached into his pocket he pulled out a pair of dice instead of a flask me i aim to head on back to master barkers with some of their money good luck frederick said wondering how much luck would have to do with the dice games ahead maybe those were honest ivories then again maybe the footman had reason for his confident smile frederick decided he wouldnt risk any of his small precious hoard of coins against marcus odds were hed be too busy to get the chance even if he wanted it here came two more carriages almost bumping axles as they rolled up the narrow path side by side they rode that way so the women inside them could talk together a handkerchief fluttered from a carriage window as one of those women made some kind of point out came clotilde barford again to greet the newcomers the women went in talking a blue streak they hadnt even begun on the punch yetthough the guests might have got a head start before leaving home one driver had another flask the other produced a deck of cards the practiced way he shuffled them made frederick leery of getting into a game with him too were there no honest men anywhere any more once upon a time frederick had read a story about a greek whod gone looking for oneand ended up with nothing but a lantern to light the way and a barrel to sleep in that didnt much surprise him the world would have been a different and probably a better place if it had carriages kept coming before long clotilde got tired of going in and out to greet each new arrival that happened every time she threw one of these affairs she told frederick you just send em on into the house you hear ill say hello to em when they come in yes maam he answered she said that at every gathering too as long as he could stay in the shade on the porch between arrivals he didnt mind in their dresses of white and red blue and green purple and gold the women might have been parts of a walking flower garden some of them were young and pretty frederick carefully schooled his face to woodenness helen would tease him about it tonight he knew that but it was all right but if any of those young pretty white women noticed a black man noticing them that was anything but all right an incautious negro could end up without his family jewels if he showed what he was thinking but when a wellbuilt woman was about to explode out of the top of her gown what was a man of any color supposed to think whatever frederick thought it didnt show on his face one of the housemaids tried to sneak past him to join the colored men under the trees he sent her back into the big house saying wait till the white ladies are eating the mistress wont pay any mind to what you do then spoilsport she said gatherings like this let slaves from different plantations get to know one another frederick only shrugged dont want you getting in trouble dont want to get into trouble myself either she made a face at him but she went inside again he watched the sun climb to the zenith and then start its long slide down toward the western horizon the broad hesperian gulf lay in that direction but frederick had never once glimpsed the sea dinner was set for two in the afternoon he figured just about all of mistress clotildes guests would be there by then chatter and punch were good enough in their way but he didnt believe any of the local ladies wanted to miss a sitdown feast when the sun said it was about one he went back into the house and sidled up to clotilde barford how we doin maam he asked everythings going just the way it ought to she answered she didnt say things like that every day the gathering had to be doing better than shed ever dreamt it could what juicy new tid bit had she just heard about some neighbor she couldnt stand good maam thats good on the whole frederick meant it if she was happy everything at the plantation would run more smoothly for a while she glanced at the clock ticking on the mantel it said the hour was half past one frederick didnt think it was really so late but that clock the only one on the plantation except for henry barfords pocket watch kept the official time the mistress said youll start bringing in the food right at two however you want it thats what ill do frederick said which was the only right answer a slave could give he didnt like playing the waiter he thought it beneath his dignity to a white woman a slaves dignity was as invisible as air shed want to show off to her guests and a welldressed slave fetching and carrying was part of the luxury she was displaying as if to prove as much she said theyll be so jealous of this place by the time im through their eyesll bug right out of their heads so you make a fine old show when you lug in the big tray you hear yes maam frederick said resignedly shed want him to load it extra full every time he brought it in too so he could show the ladies he was not only graceful but also a nice strong buck one arm and shoulder would hurt tomorrow but would she care not likely she wouldnt feel a thing in the kitchen they were straining broth through cheesecloth more swank it would taste the same either way but the mistress wanted it clear so clear it would be if that made extra work for the cooks what were they there for but work you watch those oil thrushes the head cookdaveycalled to a scullery maid who was turning the birds spits over a fire watch em i tell you anything happens to em ill serve them fancy ladies a roast nigger with an apple in her mouth you hear me eyes enormous the maid nodded she couldnt have been more than twelve frederick wouldnt have been surprised if she thought the cook would really do it frederick knew davey might be tempted at that the kitchen was his domain the mistress might intrude here but only in the way storms or fires intruded on a bigger domain once the storm blew over or the fire went out the place was his again how soon you be ready frederick asked davey she wants me to start serving at two oclock sharptwo by the clock the head cook looked outside to gauge the shadows then he looked up at the roughly plastered ceiling adjusting between what the sun said and what the clock claimed the whole business took no more than a few seconds his gaze came back to frederick we make it he said thats all right then frederick asked no more questions when davey said the kitchen would do this or that it would and it did the cooks put chopped scallions and bits of spiced pork back into their marvelously clear broth the tray frederick used to carry the bounty into the dining room was at least three feet across grunting he got it up on his left shoulder and steadied it with his right arm watch the doorway now davey warned as he headed out one of the undercooks held the door open for him oh im watching frederick assured the head cook obliged he added to the undercook as he eased by he tried to imagine what would happen if he stumbled just then his mind shied away from the notionand why wouldnt it hed give the white women something new to talk about he was similarly careful easing into the dining room he had no actual door to worry about there but the doorway was just wide enough for him and the tray both all the ladies broke off their talk and stared at him as he came in thats a finelooking nigger one said to her friend the other woman nodded frederick felt proud even though he knew she might have said the same kind of thing about an impressive horse or greyhound he went around to the head of the table so he could serve mistress clotilde first he stood a couple of steps behind her for a moment did he want the assembled white ladies of the neighborhood to notice him even to admire him he supposed he did he never would have admitted it out loud though not unless he wanted to hear about it from helen for the next twenty years pride goeth before destruction and an haughty spirit before a fall frederick often read the bible he knew that was the proper line though even preachers often clipped it hed always thought the good book was full of good sense now he found out how very full it was but in a way that made him wish hed stayed ignorant forever after posing for the ladiesmost of whom sadly paid him no more attention than the furniturefrederick slid forward so he could start serving and as he slid the toe of his left shoe unexpectedly came up against the end of that loose floorboard had he stumbled in the course of his ordinary duties that would have been bad enough it would have humiliated him and infuriated his mistressshe would have lost face in front of all her neighbors she would have found some way to make him pay for his clumsiness she had her good points but shed never been one to suffer in silence henry barford could testify to that yes an ordinary stumble would have been a mortification a dreadful misfortune what did happen was about a million times as bad everything seemed to move very slowly as it does in some of the worst nightmares fredericks foot met the floorboard he thought it would keep sliding ahead but it suddenly couldnt the rest of his body could and did of itself his torso bent forward he tried to straightentoo late the heavy tray lurched forward on his shoulder he tried to steady it with his left hand he couldnt he grabbed for it with his right hand too late instead of the edge of the tray which might have saved things his hand hit the bottom that made matters worse not better a back pillar on mistress clotildes chair caught him in the pit of the stomach oof he said as the breath hissed out of him and he could only watch as the tray crowded with bowls of soup flew out of his hands and fell toward the fancy lace tablecloth that had been in clotildes family for generationsas she would tell people at any excuse or none it seemed to take a very long time it seemed to but it didnt frederick hadnt even managed to grab at his own abused midsection before the tray crashed down bowls full of hot soup went every which way a few of them flew truly amazing distances frederick was amazed all right appalled too some soup bowls smashed others landed upside down but intact in welltodo ladies lapsor in one disastrous case in a busty ladys bodicethereby delivering their last full measure of savory liquid devotion dripping women shrieked they sprang to their feet they ran here there and everywhere some of them ran into others which sent fresh screams echoing off the ceiling others swore at the world in general or at frederick in particular hed heard angry slaves cuss hed heard white muleskinners and overseers too for sheer concentrated vitriol hed never heard anything like clotilde barfords guests his mistress didnt jump up and start screaming slowly ever so slowly she turned on frederick soup soaked her hair half her curls had given up the ghost and lay dead plastered against the side of her head a green slice of scallion garnished her left eyebrow another sat on the end of her nose imperiously she brushed that one away she couldnt see the other so it stayed she pointed at frederick he noted with abstract horror that the soup had made the dye in her almostuptodate fashionable gown run blue streaked the pale flesh of her arm you goddamned clumsy son of a bitch she snapped a statement of the obvious perhaps but most sincere mistress i frederick gave it up even if he hadnt had most of the wind knocked out of him what could he possibly say the crash and the screams made slaves from the barford estate and those gathered under the trees rush into the dining room to see what had happened one of them laughed on a high shrill note it cut off abruptly but not abruptly enough whoever that was hed catch it and so would frederick veronique barker fixed him with a deadly glare youll pay for this she said she wasnt his mistress which didnt make her wrong ii the morning after one of the more noxious phrases in the english language it must have seemed pretty noxious to henry barford hed come downstairs the afternoon before to view the catastrophe unless you were dead you couldnt help coming to take a look at something like that he hadnt been dead but a wobble in his walk said hed already been tight hed looked shaken his head and gone back to his bedroom and hed finished the serious business of getting drunk and now on the morning after he was suffering on account of it his skin was the color and texture of old parchment red tracked the yellowish whites of his eyes the way railroads were starting to track the plains of atlantis east of the green ridge mountains only a few reached across them the southwest was the usas forgotten quarter his hands shook his breath stank of stale rum and of the coffee hed poured down to try to counter the stuffs effects his uncombed hair stood up in several directions at once he looked at frederick with a certain rough sympathy on his face the negro felt at least as bad as the white man but what frederick knew was fear for the future not regret for the past well son henry barford rasped i am afraid you are fucked im afraid so too master henry frederick agreed mournfully he was a year or two older than the man who owned him but that had nothing to do with the way they addressed each other the brute fact of ownership made all the difference there matter of fact barford continued i am afraid you fucked yourself dont i know it frederick said that goddamned floorboard take oath on a stack of bibles piled to the ceiling sir i didnt know the end had come up i believe you henry barford said if i didnt believe you youd be dead by nowor more likely sold to a swampclearing outfit so as i could get a little cash back on your miserable carcass anyways frederick gulped slaves in that kind of labor gang never lasted long the men who ran the gangs bought them cheap from owners who had good reason for not wanting them any more they fed them little and worked them from dawn to dusk and beyond if that didnt kill them off the ague or yellow fever or a flux of the bowels likely would and even if those failed the swamps were full of crocodiles and poisonous snakes and other things nobody in his right mind wanted to meet barford paused to light a cigar a black nasty cheroot that smelled almost as bad as his breath he sighed smokily i believe you he said again but no matter how come it happened what matters is it did happen my wife shes mighty mad at youmighty goddamned mad frederick hung his head im sorry master henry im sorriern i know how to tell you i tried to apologize to mistress clotilde last night but she didnt want to listen to me honest to god it was an accident he hated crawling if he wanted to save his own skin though what choice did he have one more time fredi believe you barford said what i believe right now dont matter one hell of a lot something like that happens when were sitting down to dinner by our lonesomes maybe you can say im sorry and get away with it maybe shit goes wrong i know that everybody knows that when you go and ruin somethin clotildes had her heart set on for months now and when you make her look bad in front of all of her friends and we aint even talking about how much all the fancy dresses that got ruined cost not yet were not how close had he come to selling frederickand maybe helen toofor whatever he could get this was the first time in his life frederick was halfway relieved none of their children had livedthey would have been sold too gowns of silk and lace and endless labor didnt come cheap frederick knew that all right he remembered his mistress complaining about how expensive the dress shed worn to the gatheringonly one of the gowns frederick had wreckedwas all the money hed saved he didnt offer it it not only wouldnt be enough it would be so far from enough that the very offer would seem insulting henry barford blew out another ragged puff of smoke so i got to make you sorry for real he said wont be any peace in this house till i do and you know youve got it coming cant hardly tell me you dont reckon ive got somethin comin frederick said cautiously but what do you mean make me sorry for real well his master stretched out the word in a way he didnt like my wife and me we spent some time last night talkin about that most likely clotilde had spent the time talking and henry listening he stared at the coal on the end of the cigar and at the thin column of smoke rising from it he doesnt want to tell me frederick realized and ice spidered up his back at last barford spoke again what we decided was we got to give you five lashes and send you out to the fields dont like to do it fredwish like hell there was no need got to though damned if i can see any way around it ohhh the air wheezed out of frederick as if hed been hit in the belly hed known they would have to punish him but is that really fair master henry i didnt hurt anybody and five lashesre sure gonna hurt me got to do it barford didnt sound happy about it to give him his due he didnt enjoy hurting his animate property as some masters did but he did sound very firm and he explained why isnt just on account of you mucked up clotildes fancy gathering those dresses you ruined only way i can keep some of those damned biddies from going to law with me for hundreds and hundreds of eagles is to show em i made you sorry clotilde wanted i should give you ten but i managed to talk her down some ill frederick bit down hard on what was about to come out of his mouth ill run off was the last thing a slave wanted to tell a master especially when it was true biting down hard didnt do him the least bit of good youll do no such damnfool thing henry barford said as if frederick had shouted the words in his face as if to underline that barford drew a flintlock pistol from his belt it was an overandunder affair with a bullet in the top barrel and a charge of buckshot in the lower one percussion revolvers could fire many more rounds but at short range a piece like that one would kill a man quite nicely now you come along with me well stash you away till tomorrow mornin dont do anything stupid or ill be out even more jack what about me frederick asked bitterly as he got to his feet hey i wish you didnt do it his master said but you did so this is what you get step livelybut not too lively you dont want to know how good a load of doubleaught buckll ventilate your carcass believe you me you dont frederick did believe him a bullet as fat as a finger wouldnt do a body any good either tied to the whipping post the plantation had one frederick couldnt imagine a plantation without one but it didnt get used much yes henry barford might have made a much crueler master which of course did frederick not an eagles worth of good or even a cents i should have tried to run away last night he thought as the overseer stripped the shirt off his back and shackled his wrists to the post but the slave cabin where theyd stuck him was fixed up to make it next to impossibleand it had been guarded too house slaves and field hands watched the proceedings with wide eyes frederick didnt want to think about the expression on helens face and he especially didnt want to think about the expression on clotilde barfords he understood helens anguish but the masters wife looked as if she was right on the point of reaching a climax would she when the lash began to bite frederick feared hed be too busy to notice after hed been manacled henry barford slipped a thick piece of leather into his mouthcut from a belt or maybe from a harness bite down on that there the master said its supposed to help a little how do you know frederick wondered he couldnt even ask not unless he spat out the strongtasting leather he didnt instead he settled it between his jaws as best he could anything to distract him from what was about to happen barford stepped away reckon all of youve heard why we got to do this he said to the assembled slaves doesnt make me happy you know me i like it when things go smooth but when they dont you got to set em to rights and thats what were gonna do here you ready matthew sure am the overseer replied he didnt sound pantingly eager the way some men in his line of work would have instead he was as matteroffact as if barford had asked him if he were ready to shear a sheep whip a nigger all part of a days work his voice seemed to say that might have been more daunting than if he had seemed to look forward to it all right then barford said five lashes well laid on frederick closed his eyes well laid on why say such stupid things what else was matthew going to do tap him with the whip frederick wished the overseer would but what were wishes worth snapcrack frederick jerked and groaned that wasnt a lash was it it had to be fire across his back without the rude leather mouthguard he might have broken teeth biting down for some reason he wasnt much inclined to be grateful to henry barford one the master said solemnly snapcrack frederick had told himself he wouldnt scream so much for good intentions the leather muffled his howl but didnt block all of it two henry barford intoned snapcrack more of the shriek escaped this time frederick wanted to die and he wanted to kill everyone whod had anything to do with this clotilde barford henry barford matthew they could all perish horribly three snapcrack as these things went matthew was merciful he didnt lay stripe on top of stripe which would only have added to fredericks torment but these things didnt go very far in that direction frederick howled like a dog run over by a brewery wagon four henry barford said snapcrack shrieking louder than ever frederick hardly realized it was over the flames consuming his back ate up the whole world he slumped against the post utterly exhausted tears and snot and sweat ran down his face something wet ran down his back too he barely cared if he was bleeding to death back there if he was everything would be over soon five barford said thats the end of it let him loose matthew and help him to the cabin i expect his womanll take care of him from there right you are matthew was as businesslike unlocking the manacles as he had been fastening them or delivering the whipping when frederick spat out the piece of leather henry barford had given him he didnt quite spit it at the overseers feet you need to lean on me to walk matthew asked him let me see frederick managed a couple of steps away from the post the world swayed around him seeing him so shaky on his pins matthew grabbed his elbow with a strong right hand to steady him the hand that whipped me frederick thought he was glad for its support even so the overseer steered him toward one of the field hands cabinsnot the closest but one that had stood empty since the old man whod lived there gave up the ghost shows over henry barford told the rest of the slaves get on back to work it aint like you got nothin to do frederick heard him as if from very far away three rickety wooden stairs if not for matthews hand under his elbow frederick might not have made them but he did it was dark and musty inside the cabin a couple of stools a cot and a chamber potthat summed up the furnishings lay down on your belly the overseer said your gal shes got a pot of ointment to slather on you youll be ready to go out and weed in a couple of days frederick wouldnt have lain down on his back for all the gold in terranova the straw and maize husks in the mattress rustled and crackled as his weight came down on them the bed creaked he wondered if it would break but it held the musty smell got stronger sharp things poked him through the wornout mattress ticking so this is how field hands live he thought dully i got to go keep an eye on things the overseer said soon as youre up and about ill be keepin an eye on you he clumped across the floor and was gone softer footsteps came across the cabin toward frederick you were brave helen said you stood it as good as anybody could have ill kill them all frederick whispered in a voice no one who wasnt right beside him could have heard every last one of them you see if i dont course you will sweetheart helen answered as if he were a little boy now you hold still while i put this stuff on you she dabbed it on with gentle fingers it hurt anyway frederick jerked and twitched at every touch almost as if he were under the lash again whats in it he asked as if he thought it hurt him because of what it was made from lard and honey helen said got it from one of the cooks he said itd soothe yousome anywaysan itd make the stripes less likely to fester maybe frederick said through clenched teeth meaning you must be joking nothing could soothe his poor abused flesh wishing he could drown the plantation in white mens blood came closest but even that was no more than a momentary distraction how bad does it look how bad does it feel helen countered one question with another couldnt feel any worse frederick said which wasnt quite true this ache was bad the venomous sting of the lash striking him that had been even worse youre gonna have scars helen said sadly she made haste to add aint like youd be the only one plenty of slaves do scars theyll pay for every damned one so help me god they will yes rage was almost enough to vanquish pain what would victor radcliff have thought if he could have seen his grandsons split and bleeding back would he have been proud of the united states of atlantis hush helen told him just you hush now dont go talking crazy talkdont go talking stupid talk you land yourself in even more trouble than youre in already that was good sensible advice good sensible advice came easy when you hadnt just taken five lashes well laid on frederick didnt want to listen to it whether he wanted to or not some sank in didnt only get me in trouble he said dully got you thrown out of the big house too i could go back mistress clotilde aint mad at me cept cause im attached to you master henry he aint hardly mad at me at all yeah i could go back helen set a careful gentle hand on fredericks shoulder well away from any of his welts sooner stay longside of you though tears welled up in fredericks eyes pain weakness fury love all of them together probably even so he said you wont think that way when you got to start doing a field hands work it wont kill me helen answered her voice calm and she was likely right a smart planter and a careful overseer didnt work field hands to death what was the point of that you couldnt get any more work out of them if they died and you wouldnt be able to sell their corpses either god bless you frederick said i love you you must frederick didnt say what they both knew work in the fields might not kill a slave but it was harder than any job in the big house and they wouldnt be eating pretty much what the barfords ate any more maize meal barley meal molasses bitter greens every once in a while some smoked sowbelly or bacon it was enough to keep a body going it wasnt much more than barely enough over the years slaveowners had learned exactly how little they could get away with feeding their twolegged property you heard about fat house slaves all the time you even saw them every so often but frederick would have bet all the little he owned that nobody in the history of the united states of atlantis had ever seen a fat field hand sooner or later theyll call you back to the big house when they do ill go too helen said me i bet its sooner aint none of the damnfool niggers there can do for the barfords like you do theyll see they cant help but see once they get over bein mad with you frederick hoped she was right but hoping wasnt the same as believing what he believed was that clotilde barford wanted him dead five lashes werent enough to make her happy ten lashes wouldnt have been either hed humiliated her in front of all the ladies for ten maybe twenty miles around theyd seen her sit there dripping with a scallion on her eyebrow after that she probably figured even killing was too good for him maybe shed enjoy watching him sweat and fumble in the fields till he finally wore out he was sure shed enjoy it more than recalling him to the big house hows your back helen asked worrying about mistress clotilde had almost let him forget his pain for a few seconds almostbut not quite hurts he said well i reckon you dont care to know what it looks likebest believe you dont helen said want i should put on more ointment let it go for now he answered the less she touched it the less he would be reminded of it maybe i can sleep if he could sleep he wouldnt feel a thing unless he started to roll over onto his back try as he would though he couldnt make his eyes stay closed he hurt too much for that an undyed unbleached cotton shirt loose enough so it wouldnt cling to the wounds on his back an undyed pair of trousers of wool homespun thick wool socks undoubtedly knitted by one of the slave women on the plantation stout shoes that were more than a little too big a ratty straw hat put it all together and it was the outfit a field hand wore matthew the overseer delivered it to frederick and its feminine equivalent to helen here you go he said cant weed cant pick cotton when the times comes not in your boiled shirt and monkey suit tomorrow youll be out there with everybody else dont reckon i can keep up too good frederick said im sore and im stiff like you wouldnt believe oh yes i would i know what a whipping does the overseer said ill cut you some slack at firstfor the whipping and on account of you dont know what youre doing and you got soft hands like a girls but thats only at first mind you dont want me to get the notion that youre a lazy nigger believe you me boy you dont understand boy frederick was at least fifteen years older than matthew but slavery succeeded not least by denying that negroes and copperskins could ever be men unlike his grandfather frederick would never be mister when his hair went from gray to white he would go straight from boy to uncle he still had to answer im not lazy sir he said showing none of the useless hopeless rage that stewed inside him matthew might get his goat but the overseer would never realize it frederick went on if you dont believe me you can ask master henry the overseers eyes were gray and chilly chillier than the weather in these parts ever got master henry can afford to be soft matthew said hes the owner and he can do what he pleases me im just the overseer so i got to be rough and im the fella youre dealin with from here on out not master henry not no more me have you got that boy oh yes sir frederick said at once i understand you real good ill do everything i can for you till i find out how much i can get away with not doing anyhow you better matthew nodded to himself yes sir you better cause i got me all kinds of ways to make you sorry if you dont he said not a word about helen or about any of the unfortunate things that might happen to her if frederick left him dissatisfied he just walked out of the little slave cabin like any effective tyrant he knew the people under his control could form pictures in their own minds far more fearsome than any he could paint for them frederick looked down at his palms they were paler than the rest of his skin as any negros were closer to the color his grandfather had been all over closer to the color matthew was all over too but frederick didnt think about that he had some calluses on those palmshe didnt sit around the big house doing nothing but his hands werent as leathery as that chunk of tanned cowhide hed bitten down on during the whipping field hands who used shovels and hoes and rakes year in and year out got palms on which they could stub out a cheroot without even feeling it well maybe youll get palms like that too frederick thought gloomily what he would get beforehand was a bumper crop of blisters he hoped helen had some more of the ointment shed used on his back his hands would need it too and so would hers slowly almost of their own accord his hands folded into fists he made them uncoil even here inside the cabin such a gesture of defiance could be dangerous if anyone walking by saw him and told the overseer or master henry no frederick didnt want that to happen but if i ever get the chance to hit back he broke that off short too even though he hadnt said it very loud hed already told helen what hed like to do and spoken defiance was reckoned worse than a gesture a slave who talked defiantly could also plot defiantly the whites feared plots above all else because they feared them they ruthlessly stamped out every one they found and because they were so ruthless they spawned more plots maybe they didnt realize that maybe they did and accepted it as part of the cost of doing business the way they wanted to frederick had hardly been in a position to ask if i ever get me the chance he broke it off even shorter this time but the thought stuck in his mind as a burr might have stuck to his trousers and once stuck it would not be dislodged the morning horn sounded like a dying donkey up till now frederick had always heard it from the house from a safe distance in other words it hadnt had anything to do with him hed pitied the poor sorry field hands who had to get up and go to work under the hot sunor sometimes in the pouring rain never send to know for whom the bell tolls it tolls for thee fancy talk but fancy talk with a point sharp as a carving knifes now that horrible horn brayed for frederick and for helen we got to get up she said i dont want to he mumbled now that his back was finally letting him sleep he wanted to make up for all the time hed spent awake because hed hurt too much to shut down we got to get up helen repeated you want matthew to reckon youre a lazy nigger after all frederick groaned he groaned again when he sat up on the edge of the miserable cot his stripes were better than they had been when he first got them but they were still plenty sore he didnt want to put on the shirt matthew had given him but what he wanted counted for nothing in the plantations scheme of things helen wore a wool skirt a cotton blouse and a red bandanna on her head her shoes were every bit as formidable as fredericks all things considered they were well off frederick knew of plenty of plantations where the field hands wore rags and got no shoes at all that might have made his outfit and helens a trifle better it didnt come close to making them good they ate cornmeal mush and drank coffee that helen hastily made then they went outside all the cabins were rapidly emptying whoever came out last got in trouble frederick had heard that a hundred times up till now it had never mattered to him it did today he didnt want the overseer screaming at him not when he was sore and slow and didnt know what he was doing copperskins and negroesmen and womenlined up in loose ranks seeing their ragged formation an atlantean drill sergeant would have wanted to kill them all or possibly himself but matthew didnt complain about that slaves werent supposed to look or act military if they thought they could fight that would make them more dangerous to their owners a copperskinned couple were the last to try to sneak into the formation their furtiveness had a plaintive air to it as if they knew theyd get caught and get caught they did the overseer put his hands on his hips and looked disgusted so its ed and wilma this morning is it and youre mudfaces not even niggers you sure act as lazy as if you were the copperskins hung their heads frederick muttered to himself if the last slaves out had been negroes chances were matthew would have called them savages and asked them if theyd spent the time in their cabin putting on war paint something like that anyhow whites played blacks and copperskins off against each other whenever they could if you didnt trust the slave working next to you you were less likely to plan together and rise up more likely to betray each other before your plot ripened into revolt well youre here at last matthew still sounded as if he hated every last one of them frederick wouldnt have been surprised if he did overseers might have godlike powers over slaves but they werent much in the white mans world planters were what mattered there what woman from a good family would want to marry an overseer had matthew owned slaves of his own but he didnt and he wasnt likely to he pointed towards a shed come on god damn the lot of you grab your tools and get to work with rakes and spades and hoes over their shoulder they looked something like an army as they trudged out to the cotton fields again though a drill sergeant would have contemplated murder or suicide no one tried to stay in step with his neighbors or to hurry if the slaves had moved any slower matthew would have shouted at themor else whacked them with the long firm switch he carried in his right hand they knew all of them but frederick and helen how much they could get away with the two new field hands had to pick it up by watching and listening one of the first things frederick noticed was how heavy and clumsy his hoe was all the tools were like that even so henry barford complained about how often they got broken frederick hadnt understood that before he suddenly did why should a slave care how he handled tools that belonged to his master make those tools extra sturdy helped but only so much the overseer pointed frederick down a row of cotton plants you make goddamned sure you get rid of the weeds hear he said but dont you dare hurt the plants any im gonna keep my eye on you see how you make out reckoned you would frederick said he bent and assassinated something small and green pushing up through the dirt near the closest cotton plant his breath hissed out of him as if he were a snake moving hurt like blazes and the heavy iron head on the hoe made it clumsy to swing other slaves advanced up rows to either side of him to his amazement he had no trouble keeping up they werent getting over a whipping why couldnt they move faster again the question was no sooner asked than answered why should they it wasnt as if theyd get anything for themselves if they did more work when matthew was shouting down at the far end of the slave gang the negro in the row to fredericks left paused for a moment and told him you dont got to stay even with us man he see you workin like that after a whippin whats he gonna want from you when youre all right again sides he see you workin like that whats he gonna want from the rest of us frederick duly slowed down if a few weeds got missed well how much would that matter in the grand scheme of things not enough to get excited about he might have slowed down but he couldnt stop thwock matthews switch came down on a copperskins back damn your miserable shriveledup honker turd of a soul to hell and gone bill but you got to do somethin the overseer shouted you stand there with your thumb corkin your asshole you reckon i aint gonna notice bill didnt say anything all the same frederick wouldnt have wanted any man looking at him like that if matthew noticed he affected not to in his own way he had nerve slowly the copperskin got back to work sweat ran down fredericks face it also ran from the backs of his hands to his palms and stung the blisters that had swollen and burst there and it stung the lash tracks on his back his shirt didnt soak it all up his shoulders and arms started to ache from the continued unfamiliar motion of swinging the hoe a copperskinned boy who couldnt have been more than nine came by with a jug a tin dipper and a cup shaped from the dried skin of a gourd want something to drink he asked frederick lord do i ever the negro exclaimed the boy filled the cup with the dipper how many other mouths had drunk from that gourd when was the last time anyone washed it frederick wondered about such things afterwards in the moment he cared about nothing but the lukewarm water sliding sweetly down his throat he didnt want to hand back the cup he thought he could have emptied the jug but the halfgrown copperskin had other people to water he wouldnt want to go back to the well and fill up the jug again too soon reluctantly frederick returned the gourd water the boy asked the slave in the next row the one whod warned frederick not to push too hard the slave made a production out of pausing to drink not even matthew could possibly doubt that he deserved his moment of rest so his manner proclaimed anyhow frederick had the feeling the overseer could doubt anything he set his mind to doubting if you were going to be an overseer doubting was a talent you needed to cultivate a couple of pregnant women carried food out to the work gang when the sun stood at the zenith the rolls were made from barley which wouldnt rise like wheat they were dense and chewy frederick didnt mind too much he thought he was getting more food this way he hadnt realized how hungry he was till he ateand discovered that what he was getting wasnt enough to do more than take the edge off his appetite watching the way things worked he noted the plantations efficiency the women with the bulging bellies couldnt weed but they could fetch and carry the boy who brought the water jug around again was still too small to swing one of these heavy hoes that didnt make him too small to work and work he did had the overseer set up this system frederick had known about it before of course but he hadnt known about it as a house slave he hadnt been caught up in it like a grain of wheat between millstones had henry barford worked it out or his father before him or was it part of the lore all slaveholders knew the lore theyd put together over hundreds of years frederick couldnt have said for sure but it looked that way to him on a harsher plantation the midday meal might have been smaller or there might have been none the break might have been shorter henry barford wasnt cruel for the sake of being cruel and neither was his overseer they were cruel simply because you couldnt be anything else not if you intended to own slaves and to get work out of them a handful of free negroes and copperskins had slaves of their own from everything frederick had ever heard they made sterner masters than most whites they had totheir animate property was less inclined to take orders from people of their color they had to use colored overseers too that lowered the respect their slaves had for the overseers but what other choice did such owners have no white overseer would lower himself to working for someone he thought he should be bossing around and so come on people matthew shouted you done wasted enough time get to work and put your backs into it for a change whatever fredericks thought had been it flickered and blew out like a candle flame in the wind his joints creaked as he started hoeing again he wasnt used to this kind of workno indeed he didnt know whether he dreaded getting used to it or not getting used to it more was this all he had to look forward to for the rest of his days a hoe and a row a shovel a big sack at harvest time if it was wouldnt he be better off dead iii when the horns bray woke frederick for his second day as a field hand he didnt feel a day over ninetyseven every part of him ached or stung quite a few parts ached and stung as he had the afternoon before he got about a third of the way toward wishing he were dead hed fallen asleep right after supper hed come that close to falling asleep in the middle of supper with his mouth hanging open to show off the cornmeal mush or the chunk of fat sowbelly hed been chewing when his mainspring ran down somehow hed kept his eyes open till he and helen got back to the cabin but he didnt remember a thing after the two of them lay down beside him helen groaned as she sat up she rubbed her eyes she had to be as weary as he was the first words out of her mouth though were hows your back sore he answered better than it was not as good as its gonna beor i sure hope not anyways he made himself remember he wasnt the only one with troubles how you doin sweetheart well i thought i worked hard back in the big house she shook her head at her own foolishness only goes to show what i knew dont it she didnt call him twelve different kinds of stupid clumsy jackass for costing both of them the soft places theyd enjoyed why she didnt frederick had no idea if it wasnt because of something very much like love he couldnt imagine what it would be the horn blared out again this time matthews warning shout followed last one outs gonna catch it frederick had taken off only his hat and his shoes putting the straw hat back on was a matter of a moment shoes were a different story his fingers were stiff and crooked his hands sore he had a devil of a time tying the laces then he had to help helen her palms looked even worse than his shouldve put your ointment on em he scolded i was savin it for you well dont confound it he told her he also kissed her on the cheek not least because he knew she wouldnt listen to him yes that was love all right even if the words the colored preacherd said over them didnt mean a thing in the rarefied air the barfords breathed they werent the last ones out the overseer unbent enough to nod to them as they took their places with the field hands with the other field handsfrederick corrected himself ready for another go matthew asked im ready frederick said shortly he resolved to die before admitting to the white man that he was anything less well all right matthew was taciturn too but he could have been much nastier maybe he was wondering if frederick and helen would go back to the big house before too long if they did they would be personages even an overseer had to reckon with was he hedging his bets now frederick could hope so that might make life a little easier and even a little seemed like a lot when a negro couple didnt come out matthew went into their cabin after them the shouting and screeching and carrying on made everybody in the labor gang smile i slep through the blame horn the male slave in the cabin wailed youll sleep in the swamp with a rock tied to your ankle if you dont get moving you stupid toad the overseer said in less time than it took to tell both the slave and his woman were out there if some of her buttons were still undone if he had to bend down to tie his shoes matthew wasnt fussy about such things they were there nothing else mattered frederick wolfed down his breakfast he wished he could have got twice as much he wouldnt starve on a field hands rations but he would wishhe would always wishhe could get more mosquitoes buzzed around him as he ate they were worse in the close little cabin at night so the raised itchy places on his arms and ankles and the back of his neck insisted though he didnt remember getting bitten they were worse then yes but they never went away he wondered if he could get some mesh or screening for the windows or would matthew think something like that was too good for field hands slapping at a bug that landed on his wrist frederick thought i can find out the overseer glanced at the ascending sun with a theatrical shake of the head he shouted at the slaves eat up you aint porkers master henry aint fattening you up you got work to do a negro pointed to the path that led from the big house to the road to new marseille whats goin on there he said dont waste my time with your silly games lou matthew snapped you he broke off lou wasnt playing games not this morning dog my cats if them aint soldiers another negro said cavalry a copperskin named lorenzoa power among the field hands as frederick had already seenadded with precision it wasnt just that the men were on horseback infantry could mount horses when they needed to get from here to there in a hurry but the soldiers gray uniforms had yellow piping and chevrons not the blue foot soldiers would have used the troopers es corted two supply wagons smaller versions of the prairie frigates settlers in terranova used to cross the broad plains there the copperskins who lived on those plains didnt care for that but when a folk that had to buy or steal firearms and ammunition bumped up against one that could make such things the end of the struggle was obvious even if it hadnt arrived yet matthew watched the wagons and their escort come up the path absently slapping at a mosquito he said never seen the like in all my born days i wonder what the devil they want frederick had never seen the like either and hed lived on the plantation much longer than the overseer were he still back at the big house he would have come out onto the front porch and asked the soldiers what the devil they wantedthough he would have been more polite about it than that as a field hand with stripes on his back all he could do was stand there and watch henry barford came out himself he was barefoot and wore homespun wool trousers not much better than his slaves though his linen shirt was white he hadnt combed his hair as usual when he hadnt it went every which way he looked like a drunken stumblebum but the unconscious arrogance with which he bore himself declared him the planter here what in tarnation are you doing on my land he shouted to the incoming cavalrymen their leader wore two small silver stars on either side of his stand collar a first lieutenants rank badges he gave barford a crisp salute sorry to trouble you sir but were bound for new marseille with a cargo of rifle muskets and ammunition he waved at the wagons behind him much as i hate to say it three of my men are down with what looks like the yellow jack a low murmur ran through the slaves the morning sun was already hot but frederick shivered all the same he wouldnt have wanted to take men with yellow fever into new marseille what would they do to an officer who let a plague like that get loose in a city frederick wouldnt have wanted to find out and evidently the lieutenant didnt either none of which appeased henry barford not even a little bit he jumped straight up in the air as if a scorpion had stung him on the ankle he let out a wordless howl of fury as if hed been stung too then he did find words you mangy son of a bitch take your stinking sick soldiers and get the hell off my property how dare you bring the yellow jack here my apologies sir but i cant do that the officer said stolidly the men need bed rest and we happened to see your place here yellow fever doesnt kill everyone who comes down with itnot even close and i assure you that you will be generously compensated for your time and trouble how can you compensate me when im dead and buriedif anybodyd have the nerve to plant me barford said go on get lost or ill grab my shotgun and blow some sense into you the lieutenant nodded to his healthy troopers in the twinkling of an eye they all aimed eightshooters at henry barfords head and midsection meaning no disrespect sir but dont talk silly talk the officer said were here and were going to stay until my men recover or until you put them six feet under barford said but he made no sudden moves and kept his hands in plain sight frederick hadnt thought anyone could make a mistake worse than his in the dining room if master henry made one now though hed never make another he glumly eyed the revolvers dont look like i can stop you no it doesnt the lieutenant agreed his voice turned brisk now you wont want me to quarter jenkins and merridale and casey in the main residence will you in the big house i hope to spit i wont maybe barford said spit what you ought to do is put em in tents way the devil away from anybody no the lieutenant said in a hard flat voice theyre good men they deserve the best we can give them i suppose your slave quarters will have to do if my niggers and mudfaces come down sick ill take compensation out of your hide barford said i understand sir the lieutenant said of course if the slaves came down sick he was liable to do the same thing himself if he did hed be in no condition to compensate henry barford barford was also liable to come down sick the officer didnt say anything more about that neither did the planter matthew barford bawled yes mr barford the overseer said put up the sick soldiers in one of the cabins make sure theyve got themselves a wench to take care of em well do the best job we can but you know as well as i do theyre in gods hands now barford might be talking to his overseer but he also aimed his words at the lieutenant if your men die it wont be my fault he meant ill see to it matthew turned to the cavalry officer can your men tote em into the cabin theyve already been around em id thought it would be slave work but the lieutenant nodded grudgingly yes that does seem reasonable let it be as you say he barked orders at his men they obeyed more readilycertainly more quicklythan slaves obeyed an overseer and they were all white men too oh one of them was swarthy and had a spanishsounding name but he remained on the good side of atlantis great social divide the sick cavalrymen werent quite so yellow as the trim on their uniforms but they werent far from it the soldiers who carried them from the wagons to the slave cabins didnt look happy about their work frederick wouldnt have been either nobody knew how the yellow jack spread come to that nobody knew how any disease except the pox and the clap spread handling someone who already had the sickness seemed as likely a way as any and more likely than most the copperskinned woman matthew chose to care for them wasnt thrilled about the honor either somebodys got to do it the overseer said why not you abigail abigail had no answer for that in her place frederick didnt suppose he would have himself he would have looked everywhere he could to find one though he was sure of that matthew faced the rest of the slaves well come on he said get your tools and head on out to the fields or do you want to hang around here with the sick soldiers they headed out the pace left stiff sore frederick struggling to keep up it also left the overseer goggling had he ever seen slaves move so fast had anybody since the beginning of the world if the other choice was sticking close to people down with the yellow jack even weeding a cotton field under the blazing subtropical sun didnt seem bad at all dragging back as the sun went down frederick wearily shook his head going out to weed under the subtropical sun might not have seemed so bad doing it all day even at the slowest pace the overseer would let people get away with was something else again if it wasnt hell on earth he didnt know what would be the yellow jack maybe one of the troopers died two days later a copperskin and a negro dug a grave for him in the plot back of the cabins where they buried their own frederick and helen had lain two small bodies to rest there the lieutenanthis name was peter torranceborrowed a bible from henry barford and read the twentythird psalm over the mans body the barfords and their slaves and the cavalrymen all stood around the grave together listening to the somberly inspiring words and now and then brushing and slapping at buzzing bugs wish we could go on to new marseille a soldier grumbled after the service broke up well we damned well cant a sergeant answered angry puffs of smoke rose from his pipe weve got to stay put till were good and sure we aint gonna make the whole damned town sick dont want to get sick myself neither the soldier said you run off theyll call it desertion and hang you the sergeant said you aint like the slaves hereyour carcass isnt worth an atlantean while youre still alive the inflated paper money of the war against england lived on in memory im not going anywhere the soldier assured him goddamned right youre not the sergeant sounded very sure of himself but it was the sergeant who fell sick the next dayand the copperskin whod dug the dead troopers grave came down with the yellow jack the day after that the copperskin rapidly got worse his kind sickened more readily than whites who seemed to sicken more readily than negroes a copperskin with smallpox was almost sure to die where a man of some other breed might pull through henry barford was incensed as frederick had known he would be you are a son of a bitch he shouted at lieutenant torrance torrance seemed more distracted than offended sorry mr barford he managed at last that didnt come close to placating the planter sorry i dont think so barford said im going to write to my senatorthats what im going to do the atlantean officer looked through him mr barford you may write to the pope for all i care and much good may it do you my back hurts and so does my head if i have not got a fever i should be very much surprised henry barford stared at him in undisguised horror lord love a duck youre coming down with it too he edged away from the lieutenant if that offended torrance he hid it very well or more likely he had other things to worry about i fear i am i hope i am not but i fear i am he muttered to himself then spoke aloud again i wish we could have got these rifle muskets to new marseille before long the garrison there will commence to wondering what has become of them frederick heard thatthe two white men were talking outside the big house after the work gang came in for the day frederick was healing and was also beginning to get used to the work he wasnt collapsing the minute hed had supper the way he did the night after his first day in the cotton fields what torrance and barford said didnt fully register not at the moment but he took it in so it could spend the time it needed in ripening you could send somebody to let em know barford said not that far to towneven closer to the nearest place where you could send a telegram wires were beginning to crisscross atlantis the telegraph was new in the past ten years so the process wasnt complete yet but it seemed to pick up speed year by year because the device was so obviously useful lieutenant torrance shook his head i stopped here to keep from spreading the sickness any farther oh and a hell of a job you did too my boy barford exclaimed as if on cue his wifes voice floated down from their bedroom henry are you out there henry sure am he answered whats going on i dont feel well henry by the way clotilde barford said it it could only be her husbands fault but that wasnt quite true was it it could also be lieutenant peter torrances fault if hed picked a different plantation how much difference would it have made maybe not muchwhen yellow fever spread it could spread like wildfire but maybe it wouldnt have come here at all you never could tell and if that wasnt enough to drive you crazy nothing ever would henry barford absently slapped at a mosquito then wiped the palm of his hand on his trouser leg dont feel good how he asked ive got a headache my back hurts too and im warmi swear im warm clotilde said she didnt give her symptoms in the same order as lieutenant torrance had which didnt mean they didnt match frederick realized that right away barford took a few seconds longer and then delivered a double take worthy of the stage oh you son of a bitch he snarled at the atlantean lieutenant he rushed back into the big house torrance just stood there he swayed slightlyhe looked as if a strong breeze or even a breeze that wasnt so strong would blow him away he caught fredericks eye you come here what you need sir frederick asked as he walked over he didnthe couldntmove very fast chance were it didnt matter the lieutenant looked through him too i didnt mean to bring the sickness here he said after a long long pause who would mean to do something like that sir frederick said which seemed safe enough the answer seemed to focus the lieutenants attention on him frederick wasnt nearly sure he wanted it whats your name torrance asked frederick the negro answered automatically but a heartbeat later something made him add frederick radcliff most white men would have laughed at him for his pretensions at a different time or place in different circumstances lieutenant torrance might well have laughed too now he gave frederick his full attention i can see why you say so torrance observed you have something of the look of one of the first consuls to you he was my grandfather frederick said easy enough to claim the officer answered but he held up a hand before frederick could get angry it could be soi already told you you have the look victor radcliffs grandson a field nigger frederick didnt bother hiding his bitterness i cant do anything about it lieutenant torrance said i cant do anything about anything if i am alive a week from now i shall get down on my knees and thank almighty god if you are alive a week from now he ran down like a watch that wanted winding what frederick asked the lieutenant pressed his palm against his own forehead frederick had always found you had a hard time telling whether you had a fever that way because when you did your palm was also warmer than it should have been but torrances grimace said he didnt like what his own flesh told him i am from croydon he said out of the blueor so it seemed to frederick yes the negro said wondering if peter torrances wits were starting to wander no slaves in croydon the lieutenant said so he had been going somewhere after all we dont put up with that kind of thing up there we havent not for a mans lifetime and longer doesnt always stop our traders from making money off of what slaves do but we dont keep em ourselves some folks think that makes us better but ill tell you something frederick radcliff whats that if folks dont want you to be free you can still take care of the job look what your grandfather did against england he made it sound easy maybe he thought it would be or maybe his wits were wandering but he didnt realize it yet running off was deadly dangerous and much too likely to fail rising up fredericks mind shied like a frightened horse at the mere idea even if slaves did rise up from time to time they had never yet failed to regret it and the reprisals vengeful whites took were designed to make the survivors think three times before trying that kind of thing again lieutenant torrance shrugged if you are your grandfathers grandson youll find some way to be worthy of his name and if you arent he let that hang too after touching one finger to the brim of his black plug hat he walked back to the tent hed run up he wasnt steady on his legs and it wasnt because hed had too much to drink what did the white man want helen asked when frederick came back to her dont quite know he answered tell you somethin thoughdont reckon i ever talked with anybody like him before is that good or bad dont quite know frederick repeated he wished he could spend more time ciphering it out an enormous yawn soon put paid to that notion he wasnt so exhausted as he had been that first dreadful night and his stripes didnt pain him so much but they did still hurt and he was still weary he and helen headed back to their cabin he woke up in the night needing to use the chamber pot as he lay back down several itchy new mosquito bites reminded him again that he hadnt screened the window they kept him awake a little while that was one more mark of progress the first night he hadnt even noticed he was getting eaten alive no one blew the horn the next morning not till the sun stood higher in the sky than it should have and when the horn did sound it always reminded frederick more of an animals bellow than of a product of human ingenuity but this morning it reminded him of an animal in pain he soon found out why matthew was blowing the horn and he had no more idea how to do it than frederick knew how to paint portraits what happened to jonas frederick asked several other slaves said the same thing as they came out of their cabins down sick matthew answered economically he looked toward the newly sprouted tents those miserable stupid soldiers then he sighed shifted the chaw in his cheek and spat a brown stream of pipeweed juice theyre paying for it but so are we mistress clotilde there was no sign of master henry either frederick supposed he was tending to his wife but he might have come down with the yellow jack himself and lieutenant torrance didnt come out of his tent only a couple of soldiers did emerge they cared for the horses with the air of the stunned whod lived through an annihilating battle worse there was no guarantee yet that they had lived through things and they were bound to know it they went through the day without anyone falling over in the fields to frederick that seemed something worth celebrating and he might have celebrated if he werent so stiff and sore and tired and if he thought the overseer would let him get away with it later he realized matthew might have the white man also seemed delighted to have got through a days work with no new catastrophes wonder what thingsll be like when we get back to the big house he muttered as the gang shouldered tools and started back for supper things were not so good soldiers and house slaves had dug a grave for another of the troopers whod been sick when the cavalry detachment arrived at the plantation had lieutenant torrance read the bible over this dead man too frederick had his doubts the lieutenant was likely to be too sick to get off his cot or blanket or whatever he was lying on henry barford came out to watch the slaves return he hadnt combed his hair or shaved frederick thought he had done some drinking or more than some clotildes mighty poorly he announced from the front porch mighty poorly frederick didnt know whether to be sorry or not hed spent a lot of years with the barfords most of the time hed got along well enough with the mistress of the plantation but she was the one whod had him whipped and degraded she was the one whod wanted to give him more lashes than hed got why should he sympathize with her now because anything that can happen can happen to you he answered himself because you could be moaning in a sickbed just like her a day from now or god forbid so could helen he ate more supper than usualnot better but more quantity had a quality of its own no one had thought to tell the cooks to make any less than they would have without sickness tearing through the plantation they hadnt made any changes on their own if you waited for slaves to show initiative youd spend a long time waiting so the same amount of food was shared among fewer people fredericks belly appreciated the difference another cavalry trooper came down sick not long after supper the men still on their feet had all kinds of worries we got enough men to post a guard on the wagons one of them asked hell with the wagons hell with everything in em another soldier replied any of us still gonna be on our feet by the time this goddamned plague gets done with us the first soldier didnt say anything to that frederick wouldnt have either it was much too good a question he glanced over toward the wagons sure enough there they satthey wouldnt go on to new marseille any time soon but so what the united states of atlantis were at peace with the world for the most part theyd stayed at peace since the war that set them free no invader was likely to descend on them now what would the rifle muskets do but gather dust in some armory frederick had been a boy when atlantis got into a brief second scrape with england redcoats had suppressed the terranovan risings that accompanied atlantis revolt against the mother country the terranovan settlements rebelled again a generation later when england was distracted by the great war she fought against france atlantis covertly aided the terranovansbut not covertly enough and so england declared war on her former possession atlantean frigates won their share of glory in what people these days called the war of but england had the greatest navy the world had ever known a navy that spanned the seven seas despite her endless troubles with france english ships bombarded freetown and pomphret landing and english marines burnt the latter town to the ground and slaughtered everyone who didnt run away fast enough another force landed south of avalon but word of an armistice reached them just as they were about to engage the garrison there atlanteans these days sang songs about the battle that never was no new marseille had no urgent need of those rifle muskets frederick had trouble seeing why the soldiers even bothered mounting guard over them were he still a house slave he probably would have gone on having trouble seeing why as a field handas a field hand with the marks of the overseers lash still no better than half healed on his backhe suddenly understood they didnt want the weapons to fall into slaves hands and he understood why too slaves with fancy new rifle muskets could rise against the whites who put stripes on their backs who lay down with their women whenever they pleased and who could sell them like so many sacks of beans no slave rising yet had succeeded but the chance was always there you awake he whispered to helen when they lay down in the muggy little cabin that night not me she answered i done went to sleep an hour ago frederick laughed softly i been thinkin he said you shouldve gone to sleep an hour ago too helen said and he couldnt very well tell her she didnt have a point but she relented enough to ask what was you wastin your time thinkin about his voice dropped lower still them guns he said if those two words reached henry barfords ears it wasnt a lashing matter any more frederick would die quickly if he was lucky but more likely with as much pain and cruelty as his master could mete out even talking about uprisings was a capital crime helens sharp intake of breath said she understood as much you out of your mind she said you pick one of them up you cant never put it down no more i know frederick said but do you reckon victor radcliff wanted his grandson to be a field nigger i reckon victor radcliff wanted his grandson to be a live nigger helen said lord jesus frederick first one of those other field hands you talk to hes liable to sell you down the river for whatever master henry give him thirty pieces of silver i reckonthats the goin rate if were gonna rise up well never find a better time to do it frederick said says who helen retorted way the yellow jacks goin around half your army may be dead week after next if it gets us like that itll get the white folks were fighting the same way frederick said which was trueor he hoped it was anyhow he went on thats not what i was talkin about anyways well what was you talkin about then helen asked pointedly you know that lieutenant the one whos down sick hes a croydon man from way up north they dont have slaves up there he just about told me i had to free myself if i ever wanted to be free frederick said fever mustve scrambled his brains helen said i wish to heaven you wouldve just dozed off like you should have most folks from croydon hate slavery frederick went on as if she hadnt spoken i hear tell theres even niggers and mudfaces who can vote in the state of croydon and consul newton hes from croydon too everybody knows he cant stand the notion of one man buying and selling another one if hed hoped to impress his wifeand he hadhe failed well ladeda helen said and consul stafford hes from cosquer down here on this side of the slave line hes a planter his own self hes got a bigger place than this here one and he works more slavesn master henry ever dreamt of owning gotta have both them fellas on the same side to do us any good negroes and copperskins in bondage could no more vote than they could fly which didnt keep them from paying attention to atlantean politics frederick grinned there in the dark most of the time sure he said the senate passes a law that says all the slaves are free consul stafford can veto it and nobody can say boo but suppose we rise up now consul stafford says the united states of atlantis got to send soldiers over there and put those slaves down an the soldiers come an they start killin niggers an mudfaces its happened before helen agreed it has frederick agreed but i bet it wont happen this time on account of all consul newtons got to do is hes got to say i veto it and nobody goes anywhere he do that helen didnt sound as if she believed it and she knew why she didnt even white folks who dont like slavery that dont mean they do like niggers an mudfaces the whites down here start screamin loud enough she had a point frederick would have been much happier if she didnt but she did he paused a while in thought listening to mosquitoes buzz and to more distant crickets trill and frogs squeak and croak at last he answered what we got to do is we got to fight clean like its a war not an uprising cant go killing women and children for the fun of it the way they do in uprisings cant go raping white women for the fun of it either he thought that happened in every slave revolt what vengeance was more basic reckon itd make any difference helen still sounded dubious bound to make some frederick said reckon slaves with guns in their handsll want to let them folks go she knew which questions to ask all right they will if their commanders make em frederick answered and then just before sleep took him at last he added if i make em he was ready whether anyone else was hed find out iv matthew blew the horn again the next morning as frederick came out to eat breakfast and go on to the fields he looked at the overseer in a whole new way he had to be careful not to let it show matthew took it for granted that he could hit or whip frederick or any other slave without worrying about reprisal if he realized frederick didnt take it for granted he would do his best to kill him right away and he could if he got any kind of chance he had his switch and a knife with a blade long enough to gut a man like a hog frederick didnt think he was a coward either life would have been simpler if he were but no there was plenty to eat fewer and fewer field hands came out to work but the cooks went on making as much as they always had more than one slave patted his belly and grinned after he finished eating frederick was surprised matthew hadnt noticed what was going on and done something about it but the overseer hadnt it wasnt as if he didnt have other things on his mind and so did henry barford the planter looked like a man bathing in hellfire when he came out onto the front porch eyes wild he pointed at one of the cavalrymen guarding the precious wagons wheres that lieutenant of yours the goddamned son of a bitch bastard sir lieutenant torrance is sick hes mighty sick the trooper answered he cant see anybody right now whats the matter whats the matter whats the goddamned matter barford howled my wife is puking up this horrible black gunklooks like coffee groundsand you ask me whats the matter your miserable stinking lieutenant is whats the matter thats what bringing the yellow jack to my plantation i dont want to see the lousy bugger i want to horsewhip him well sir if it makes you feel any better hes heaving up black stuff too the soldier said i dont think hes going to pull through too bad barford said which surprised frederick till he added i wanted to kill him with my own hands but i reckon the yellow jackll have to do though why a merciful god would take my sweet clotilde too he turned and lurched back into the big house sweet frederick shook his head mistress clotilde was about as sweet as vinegar she was the one whod wanted to give him more lashes than master henry that was just like her too did her husband really believe what he was saying or was he trying to make the trooper feel worse from inside the house barford shouted ill sue the government for every last eagle its got you wait and see if i dont the cavalryman only shrugged he scratched his nose as if to say it was no skin off that organ unless the planter came out shootingor unless the soldier got yellow feverit wasnt his worry come on matthew called to the field hands grab your tools the work doesnt go away the work never goes away i know were shorthanded but weve got to keep at it otherwise the harvestll be bad and then well all go hungry he wouldnt master henry would yell at him but that was all the field hands really might go hungry in a bad year or barford might have to sell some of them which would be almost as rough frederick snorted quietly he had other things on his own mind besides what the master might do after a bad harvest you aint said anything to anybody helen said as they walked out to the cotton field with tools on their shoulders hopefully she added you gone and changed your mind nope not me frederick answered people said stubborn as a radcliff by that standard alone he might have guessed he shared blood with one of the first consuls even henry barford had sometimes seemed more proud than annoyed when calling him a hardheaded smoke but frederick also had other things than that on his mind sometimes all the talking in the world doesnt do a cents worth of good sometimes you got to show people instead helen clicked her tongue between her teeth oh fred what are you gonna do burn my bridges frederick thought but that wasnt what she wanted to hear all he said was what ive got to do helen shook her head but she didnt say anything more either maybe she hoped he would change his mind once they settled down to work part of him hoped the same thing the part that had lived a quiet pretty easy life all the way up into middle age well his life wasnt quiet or easy any more by all the signs it never would be again and if it wouldnt why not act the way samson had in the philistines temple what did you have to lose he worked for a while chopping and moving forward chopping and moving forward by now he had no trouble keeping up with the slaves working the rows of cotton to either side of him he methodically weeded till matthew came along to see how he was doing going all right frederick the overseer asked frederick straightened and stretched though he kept both hands on the hoe handle not too bad sir back easing up a bit frederick stretched again matthew nodded more to himself than to the negro in front of him told you it would whippings are like that yes he thought of them as nothing more than a rather unpleasant part of plantation routine and so they wereif you held the whip if you were on the other end fredericks hands tightened some of what was going through his mind must have shown on his face at last you dont want to look at me that way matthew warned you dont want to look at me that way by god he started to raise the switch then seemed to realize it wouldnt be enough he dropped it and grabbed for his knife instead too late frederick swung the hoe in a deadly arc an arc powered by a lifetimes worth of smothered fury smothered no more the heavy blade tore away half the overseers face blood gouted astoundingly red in the bright sunshine matthew let out a gobbling shriek the knife fell in the dirt as he clapped both hands to the ghastly wound he tried to stagger away from frederick frederick hit him again this time from behind the heavy hoe blade bit into matthews skull the overseer crumpled he thrashed on the ground frederick hit him one more time the thrashing slowed then stopped the white mans blood soaked into the thirsty soil the slaves working to either side of frederick gaped at him in commingled astonishment horror and awe lord jesus one of them burst out what did you go and do that for were all in trouble now the other one added he stared at matthews huddled corpse big trouble i mean not if we grab those guns in the wagons frederick answered more calmly than his drumming heart should have let him speak not if we make all the white folks pay for what theyve done to us matthews dying cries made more negroes and copperskins hurry over to see what was going on they all eyed the overseers bloody corpse with the same look of disbelief as if theyd never dreamt they might see such a thing and yet how many of them would have wanted to slaughter him themselves theyre gonna kill you a copperskin said a moment later he mournfully added theyre gonna kill all of us they will if we let em frederick said so lets not let em lets do some killing of our ownas much as it takes till were free the way were supposed to be the united states of atlantis are so damned proud of their precious proclamation of liberty but they reckon it stops with white folks dont you think mudfaces and niggers deserve their share too he waited still clutching the gorespattered hoe their other choice was to kill him now if they did that they might convince henry barford they hadnt had anything to do with murdering matthew they might or the planter might decide they had had something to do with it and were using fredericks death to cover their own guilt or barford might be down with the yellow jack himself by now the way things were going nobody could guess anything he couldnt see do you want to stay slaves the rest of your days frederick asked wouldnt you sooner be free they looked at him they looked at matthews body flies with metallic bodiesblue green brasswere already buzzing above it dont seem like we got much else we can do a negro said slowly they gonna kill us any which way might as well kill some of them before wes dead one by one the other slaves nodded it wasnt the grand war cry frederick had dreamt of but when did reality ever measure up to dreams hed made them move that much anyhow hed foreseen lets go he said we got to get those guns leaving the overseers corpse where it lay though frederick took the dead mans knife they marched on the big house frederick did remember to plunge the hoe blade into the dirt to clean it and to rub more dirt on the handle to hide the bloodstains he didnt want to alarm the atlantean soldiers till the slaves got in among them he also didnt want to alarm henry barford he didnt hate his owner he hadnt even particularly disliked barford till he got shackled to the whipping post and then sent to the fields but he saw no way to let the planter live not in the middle of a slave rebellion too badbut a lot of things that happened were too bad what do we say when they ask us how come were comin back in the middle of the day the copperskin called lorenzo asked well tell em a snake bit the overseer frederick answered hed been wondering about that too tell em hes mighty bad off he chuckled grimly an he damned well is the squat redbrown man grinned in admiration you think of everything if im gonna run this whatever it is id better dont you reckon frederick said lorenzo nodded nobody else challenged fredericks right to lead the uprising maybe that meant all the field hands thought they could have no one better at their head perhaps more likely it meant they figured he was the one on whom all the blame would land and it would all land on him but it would land on them too whites had never shown any mercy to slaves who rose up in their place frederick didnt suppose he would have either there was the big house there were the wagons with the precious rifle muskets without them the revolt would be stillborn a couple of troopers dug in the burial plot if that didnt mean lieutenant torrance had died frederick would have been very surprised too bad he thought even though the slaves would have had to kill the officer had he pulled through torrance might personally disapprove of slavery but frederick had no doubt the croydonite would have done his professional duty against any rising a soldier puffed on a pipe in front of one of the wagons sure enough he became curious if not exactly alert when he saw the slaves straggling in from the cotton fields whatre you doin here so goddamned early he askedthe very question lorenzo had foretold you know anything about curin snakebite frederick asked in return coral snake done bit the overseer an hes in a bad way son of a bitch the trooper exclaimed i bet hes in a bad way those bastardsll kill you deadern shit he might be foulmouthed but he wasnt wrong coral snakes didnt go out of their way to bite people as some of the bigger poisonous snakes did but like a good many frogs in the south of atlantis they wore bright colors to warn enemies that trying to make a meal off them wasnt a good idea if a coral snake did bite you you were much too likely to die whiskey or rumll make his heart stronger the cavalryman said as the slaves came up to him that and prayingre about all i know that can help him no he wasnt suspiciouscertainly not suspicious enough he let the slaves surround him he couldnt believe they meant him any harm but what you believed didnt always match what was real frederick got behind the trooper and stabbed him in the back the white man lurched he groaned he tried to draw his revolver but another negro clamped a hand on his wrist and didnt let him when he screamed more blood than noise came out of his mouth his knees buckled a sudden foul stench said his bowels had let go down he went frederick grabbed his eightshooter get his knife too he said one way you got to give orders was by coming out and giving them if people followed them you could give more and theyd be more likely to follow those lorenzo took possession of the dagger what do we do now someone else asked lets go get the ones whore digging in the graveyard frederick answered doesnt look like they noticed anything goin on here and thats good he stuffed the pistol into the waistband of his trousers and let his shirt droop down over it well try and do with them like we did with this fellow shootings noisywe dont start till we have to lorenzo reckon you can let the air out of one while i do the other turn me loose the copperskin said confidently all right frederick grinned but listen everybody if they look like theyre gonna pull their guns just jump on em any which way if they start shootin they can hurt us bad got me he waited for nods as soon as he had them he nodded at the troopers who werent digging much faster than slaves would have soon as we bag them master henry next that got everybody moving toward the atlantean cavalrymen frederick might not especially dislike henry barford but some of the field hands did your poor lieutenant die frederick called as he and the slaves with him neared the sweating troopers they seemed willing enough to rest on their shovels for a while thats right one of them said mopping at his red face with a big cotton handkerchiefcotton that for all frederick knew might have come from this plantation once the fever got a grip on him he went downhill quick he was pissing blood and puking up black stuff his face twisted in disgust maybe in fear as well for he had to know that could happen to him too its a shame frederick said he was a good fellow that he was the soldier agreed wont catch me saying it real often not about officers but its the truth with lieutenant torrance was the truth i mean hey the other trooper said suddenly whatre you uh people doing here anyway how come you aint out there workin like you have been frederick told the story about the snakebite again this time he didnt stumble even a little had he heard the tale from his own lips without question he would have believed it some liesinspired liessounded better than truth he thought so anyhow to his surprise and disappointment the troopers didnt seem to how come you didnt send one fellow back while the rest of you stayed out there asked the one whod wondered why theyd returned he was the man frederick was closer to leaving the other soldier for lorenzo frederick answered the question as if replying to an idiot on account of the snakes still there huh the trooper said scornfully he looked around in alarm why are you people crowdin around us like this watch yourself stu somethin funnys goin on things happened very quickly after that lorenzo knifed stu as neatly as frederick had killed the sentry by the wagons of guns frederick stabbed the other trooper less than a heartbeat later but the man screamed like a hurt shoat and went for his revolver one of the slaves tried to stop him but he shook off the negro the pistol cleared the holster another slave grabbed his arm and dragged it down so he fired a shot into the dirt at his feet the noise was horribly loud and if one shot had already rung out two wouldnt make any difference frederick held the muzzle of his own pistol against the side of the struggling troopers head and pulled the trigger hed seen bullet wounds on animals henry barford was proud of his skill as a hunterand well he might have been because he helped feed the plantation with it but frederick had never seen anything like this if he was very lucky he never would again either the troopers head might have been a rotten melon dropped off a roof it blew apart brains and blood and bits of bone splat tered frederick and all the other slaves close by the atlantean cavalryman had fought despite a nasty knife wound but now he dropped like a felled redwood lorenzo already had the other mans pistol another copperskin had got his knife now a negro took this troopers eightshooter and helen pulled the knife off his belt frederick smiled at that it was good that his wife should have a proper weapon theyd all have them as soon as they unloaded the wagons but why shouldnt helen take the lead the gunshots brought house slaves running out to see what was going on to fredericks heartfelt relief they didnt bring out any more atlantean cavalrymen the rest of the troopers must have been either dead or too sick to care the house slaves their eyes went wide with shock looking down at himself frederick saw why the cavalrymans blood and brains splashed his shirt and trousers he looked as if hed just come from a hard days work at a slaughterhouse what what happened a housemaid quavered as if she couldnt see for herself in case she really couldnt frederick answered were free now were really free now and were gonna stay that way the hell you say that furious roar came from henry barford his wife might be dying of yellow fever for all frederick knew mistress clotilde might be as dead as lieutenant torrance but the idea of a slave uprising brought the master out onto the back porch a shotgun cradled in his arms his overandunder pistol stuck in his belt and hell is where ill blast the lot of you too he started to raise the shotgun to his shoulder housemaids scattered squealing frederick aimed his pistol too he knew he would have to be lucky to hit master henry at this range while the master with that shotgun wouldnt have to be lucky at all to hit him thunk speaking of slaughterhouses that noise came straight out of one davey stood behind the master the chief cook had buried a cleaver in the back of henry barfords head barford stood there a long moment looking absurdly surprised the shotgun slipped out of his hands then his knees buckled and he fell over his feet drummed on the planking that wouldnt last long no one could hope to live with such a terrible wound slowly frederick lowered his eightshooter obliged he said wishing his voice werent so shaky davey sketched a salute any time he stooped and picked up the shotgun now i got me a piece too i know some folks who could use two barrels worth of doubleaught buck i expect take master henrys pistol if you want but dont worry about the shotgun frederick said davey frowned not following frederick pointed to the wagons thosere full of guns thatll hit from four or five times as far away as any shotgun ever born remember fancy government muskets bound for new marseille thats right the cooks heavyfeatured face cleared reckon well need em too reckon we will frederick agreed but for now this here plantation is ours what did generals call it when victory had been won but the fighting wasnt quite over mopping upthat was what they said the slaves still had to mop up knocking the cavalrymen down with yellow fever over the head was quick and easy a couple of them were near death anyway frederick told himself his people were doing the whites a favor by ending their suffering he didnt have much trouble making himself believe it clotilde barford also still clung to life in the upstairs bedroom three housemaids got into a catfight about who would have the privilege of holding a pillow over her face till she quit breathing for good it was a real brawltheir nails drew blood lord jesus frederick exclaimed after some of the men separated themand got clawed in the process lets settle this fair and square how you gonna manage that one of the women asked dabbing at her bleeding cheek with her apron frederick dug out henry barfords deck of cards heres how he said you all draw one high card does the job the housemaid whod asked him won the draw the other two swore at her as she proudly climbed the stairs to finish the last white person on the plantation when she came down she was grinning from ear to ear that bitch aint gonna give nobody grief no more she declared everyone cheered frederick held up his hands listen to me he said you got to listen to me he wasnt sure they would some of them had already got into the mastersthe dead mastersbarreltree rum and whiskey listen to him damn it that was lorenzo he seemed to be the one the copperskins on the plantation heeded most and he had a fierce bass voice that made people pay attention to him eventually most of the field hands and house slaves looked in fredericks direction were free now he said then he couldnt go on because everybody started cheering again he held up his hands once more this time hoping for quiet after a while he got something close to it he continued were freetill the first white mandrummer or preacher or neighbor doesnt matter which onedecides to pay a call on master henry then theyll find out what happened here and theyll try and kill us all well fuck em shouted a housemaid with a whiskey bottle in her hand fuck em in the heart the stinking shitsacks she got a cheer too easy to say frederick said when he could get a word in edgewise not so easy to do way it looks to me is we got two choices we can slip away by ones and twos going every which way some of usll get free if we try that odds aresome of us but not everybody we could go off to the woods and the swamps a copperskin said runaway slaves of all colors scratched out livings in places where whites judged pursuit more trouble than it was worth well we could try frederick said when they find out we killed the whites here though theyll come after us a lot hardern theyd chase ordinary runaways or does anybody reckon im wrong no one said anything if slaves killed white people other whites would hunt them down no matter what every slave understood that it was one of the pillars on which slavery rested so slipping away doesnt look so good frederick said only other chance i see is we gotta fight and we gotta win we got the guns by god daveys voice was as deep as lorenzos anybody figure there aint some white folks around these parts who still need killing lorenzo himself added no one left alive on the plantation believed that and when we liberate a plantation what happens to the mudfaces and niggers who were slaves on it frederick answered his own question before anyone else could ill tell you what happens to em they join our armythe liberating army thats what well call it and then we go on and we free up the next plantation down the road and the slaves there they turn into soldiers too that was one of the housemaids whod lost the draw to kill mistress clotilde by the excited way she said it the possibility hadnt occurred to her till that very moment it probably hadnt frederick had never thought she was long on brains excitement surged through the assembled slavesno through the newborn liberating army they had rifle muskets and ammunition for several plantations worth of slaves after that well frederick couldnt imagine any plantation without firearms both for hunting and for keeping twolegged property in line those weapons would arm more negroes and copperskins and what happens when the liberating army goes up against the army of the united states of atlantis frederick wondered what do we do for cannon what do we do for grapeshot well he didnt have to worry about that not yet and as long as he didnt have to he didnt intend to borrowing trouble never did anybody any good and if you were a slaveeven more if you were a slave trying to rise up against white mastersyou already had plenty of troubles and didnt need to borrow any more where do we go first that was davey trust the cook to come up with a good practical question frederick had been chewing that over too way it looks to me is first place we ought to set free is benjamin barkers he answered its close and he doesnt treat his slaves real well so theyll be ready to swing our way and and his wife that veronique shes an even nastier cunt than mistress clotilde an thats really sayin somethin interrupted the handmaid whod just snuffed out clotilde barfords life from everything frederick had seen and heard she was right he made himself nod she sure is he said and thats one more reason the slaves on the barker plantation will see things our way theyd better or this will be one of the shortest uprisings in a history thats seen a lot of short ones he looked around anybody got a better idea the people who really counted were lorenzo and davey if either of them thought the liberating army should pick a different direction frederick would have to listen carefully he might have to change his mind they both paused thoughtfully considering at last almost in unison their heads went up and down benjamin barker deserves whatever happens to him davey said in the tones of a judge passing sentence he does lorenzo agreed and so it was decided they took the rifle muskets out of their crates then they had to figure out how to use the percussion caps that came with the cartridges all of the firearms on the plantation were flintlocks but several slaves had heard about the percussion system and had a notion of how to fit the thin copper caps over the nipple on each musket some of the field hands used beatup old shotguns of their own to kill varmints and hunt small game the fancy new muskets impressed them enormously see the thing of it is a flintlockll misfire maybe one time in five lorenzo explained to frederick and even when it doesnt theres always that wait while the sparks set off the priming powder and the priming powder starts the main charge so you miss what you were aiming at cause its not there no more not like that with these guns frederick said his shoulder was sore from a rifle muskets fierce kick soon as you pull the trigger and the hammer comes downbang his ears were still ringing too i hope to shit its not like that lorenzo said enthusiastically were gonna kill us a lot of white folks with em thats right frederick saw the need but he wasnt so eager the color of his skin reminded him of the white blood that flowed in his veins so did the thick beard that rasped under his fingers every time he rubbed his chin lorenzo pressed ahead how are we gonna get there we march down the road with guns on our shoulders peoplell figure out pretty damned quick theres a slave uprising think so do you fredericks voice was dry looks to me like theyll figure it out pretty damned quick any which way lorenzo grinned he had strong white teeth and his fierce expression made them seem uncommonly sharp looks the same way to me but do you want to let the whole world know right away like were some traveling medicine show well frederick didnt need long to think that over no and so they went crosscountryall but the precious rifle muskets they werent using themselves and the even more precious ammunition those rolled down the road guarded by slaves with eightshooters taken from dead atlantean cavalrymen the negroes and copperskins slapped paint on the wagons before setting out so no one who saw them would think of the united states of atlantis one of the slaves who took the lead wagon down the road pulled a black felt hat of henry barfords low on his forehead so the brim was barely above his eyes it was the perfect touch especially since he was also smoking one of the dead masters cheroots if he didnt look like a teamster frederick had never seen anybody who did theyll get there ahead of us davey said in worried tones as the rest of the liberating army started tramping from one big house to the other frederick shook his head dont think so hope not anyways i told em to hold up by the side of the road a couple of times white folks going by wont think anything of that you know how they always go on about how lazy niggers and mudfaces are oh hell yesusually while theyre pilin more work on our heads davey said then they get mad on account of we dont finish as fast as they want he muttered something under his breath the look in his eyes went as dark as his skin after a few seconds though his face cleared he set a hand on fredericks shoulder thats good the way you set it up seems like you got a notion of whats likely to happen next fellow whos runnin this show he better do that yeah i know right now main thing im tryin for is not to do anything outandout stupid frederick answered sooner or later he would do something stupid too you couldnt help it any more than you could help needing to piss every so often he just hoped his mistakes wouldnt be too bad and wouldnt hurt the liberating army too much he was glad davey seemed willing to let him lead the head cook was one of a handful of men who might have wanted to run things himself lorenzo was another he also seemed content with fredericks leadership well of course they are frederick thought nothings gone wrong yet so they cant hang any blame on me a rail fence separated master henrys land from benjamin barkers maybe it was fredericks imagination but he thought the crops on the far side of the fence grew taller than they did on this side nothing not even cotton plants dared give benjamin barker a hard time he remarked on that as he clambered over the fence and came down on the other side now its official now its an invasion he thought helen answered him before anyone else could were gonna give master benjamin barker a hard time by jesus and his stuckup bitch of a wife too thats right several negroes and copperskins said the same thing at the same time womens voices were loud in the chorus frederick knew nobody liked veronique barker very much considering what was likely to happen to her that might be just as well hey now what are you slaves doin on barker land an officioussounding negro demanded andthe fellows voice suddenly wobbledwhat are you doin with guns in your hands this here is the liberating army frederick answered proudly were here to clean things out thats what were here for are you with us or against us lord jesus the negro yelped if he said he was against them he wouldnt live long and maybe he didnt need much persuading youre gonna do for master benjamin his snooty ol veronique too helen said you really are benjamin barkers slave might have discovered it was christmas in summertime count me in you got a spare gun i can shoot not yet but we will pretty quick frederick said if barkers negro wanted to think that meant they aimed to plunder the big house he was welcome to for the time being let him prove himself before he got a rifle musket of his own well come on then he said now and he sure seemed enthusiastic ill take you straight to him i will v they hadnt gone very far before they came upon a work gang weeding in the fields fredericks back and shoulders twinged sympathetically hed been doing the same thing himself a couple of days earlier and making sure the gang actually worked of course was benjamin barkers overseer he was older and tougherlooking than matthew had been matthew had been a man who wanted to rise the kind who dreamt of owning a plantation himself one day this fellow was out of dreams all he wanted was to go on doing what he was doing already hed never rise higher than overseer and he knew it instead of a switch he carried a lash in his right hand and where matthew had had a knife on his belt a pistol rode this overseers right hip his hand dropped to that pistol as soon as he saw strange slaves all right you bastards he growled youve got three shakes of a lambs tail to tell me what the hell youre doing on master barkers land cmon make it snappy he had to die frederick wasnt the only one who realized it half a dozen rifle muskets rose as one and trained on the overseers chest and head it wasnt anything personalbut then again it was frederick had trouble imagining a field hand who didnt want to shoot an overseer son of a bitch this white man exclaimed you lousy stupid idiots are trying to rise up with startling speed his pistol cleared the holster with startling speedbut not fast enough before the overseer could pull the trigger those rifle muskets spoke together a couple of the conical bullets the longarms spat might have missed him but most struck home a round that caught a man square in the face drastically rearranged his looks and not for the better scarlet flowers blossomed on the overseers shirtfront too he pitched forward and lay facedown in the dirt benjamin barkers slaves gaped at him and at the men and women of the liberating army frederick paid no attention to them for a little while he was reloading as fast as he could only after a new percussion cap sat on the nipple and a new powder charge and bullet were rammed down and firmly seated in the barrel did he start to notice their exclamations whatd you go and do that for a mulatto woman asked shrilly her knuckles pressed against her mouth davey laughed you gonna tell me an overseer didnt have it coming not likely but the womans gaze traveled to the blood soaking into the ground under the dead white man then quickly jerked away you went and shot him just like that you went and shot him lorenzo laughed at her nothing gets by you does it sweetheart hed also reloaded before worrying about anything else gunfire might bring benjamin barker at the run intent on finding out what had happened what you gonna do with us a copperskinned man asked set you free give you guns frederick answered nobodys gonna sell us any more not ever again nobodys gonna horsewhip us any more neither not ever again this here is the liberating army from now on were our own people not anybody elses not ever again the copperskin looked at him as if hed just declared himself god almighty youre gonna get us all killed is what youre gonna do several of benjamin barkers other slaves nodded somber agreement frederick also knew that was possibleand feared it was probable even so he said best thing we can do is whip all the planters around us and make our army bigger the more people weve got fighting the better our chances maybe we can lick some of the planters a negro field hand here said we aint never gonna lick the atlantean army frederick brandished his rifle musket the long sword bayonet glittered in the sun we got these from atlantean soldiers he said proudly he didnt mention that most of them were down with the yellow jack he also didnt mention that the liberating army might have brought the sickness with it instead he added nowwho wants to see master benjamin dead no matter what barkers field hands thought about the ultimate fate of the uprising they did want to see their master dead and mistress veronique too one of the women saidthe one whod been so horrified when they shot the overseer yes benjamin barkers wife had found a way to make herself remembered all right well lets go get em frederick said and then scouts forward he wasnt going to run into any nasty surprises not if he could help it he could see the big house in the distance it was larger and fancier than henry barfords place veronique barker had always thought herself above mistress clotilde now frederick saw why the barkers had more money and with money came status it was that simple noit had been that simple now there was a new game complete with new rules one of the new rules was a white man couldnt get rich off the labor of negroes and copperskins benjamin barker was about to be taken to school by the liberating army he would remember his lessons for the rest of his life however long that was here he came toward the fields a big sturdy man with streaks of gray in his black hair he cradled a rifle or shotgun in his arms behind him strode his son who was thinner and not yet graying but otherwise a good copy of the planter the younger man was also armed seeing strange copperskins and blacks heading his way benjamin barker shouted in a great voice what kind of riffraff is this he sounded more disbelieving that such people could invade his land than angry his son reached out to pluck at his shirtsleeve frederick couldnt hear what the younger barker said it wasnt meant for him anyhow but benjamins response to it left frederick in no doubt about what it was drop those guns this minute or itll go even harder for you than it would otherwise the planter bellowed frederick almost started to lay down his rifle musket the habit of obedience to whitesespecially to whites who gave orders in a loud voicewas deeply ingrained in him as it was in all atlantean slaves one of barkers men send back an answer we dont got to listen to you no more youre gonna git what you deserve thats what you think ivanhoe barker yelled he raised the longarm he carried to his shoulder the gun roared ivanhoe screeched and fell over clutching his side give it to him frederick said urgently all the slaves turned their rifle muskets on barker and his son the guns stuttered out a ragged volley the younger barker clapped both hands to his breast as if he were in a stage melodrama but the blood on the front of his shirt was real as the overseer had before him he fell facedown in the dirt somehow all the bullets in the volley missed benjamin barker the man at whom they were aimed he reloaded with almost superhuman speed and fired again this time he hit one of his own copperskins unlike ivanhoe the second slave didnt make a sound he simply crumpled shot through the head more bullets flew at benjamin barker these didnt bite either as slaves went frederick wasnt superstitious he had more educationand more sensethan most bondsmen but even he wondered if the planter didnt have a snakeskin or a rabbits foot in his pocket shaking his fist barker turned and ran back toward the big house another volley pursued him yet again every shot missed if that wasnt uncanny frederick couldnt imagine what would be he also couldnt imagine letting the planter get away that would be whatever was worse than a disaster about as bad say as tripping over a floorboard that had come loose maybe even worse come on he said weve got to do for him how a copperskin asked if bullets wont if bullets wont well burn down the goddamned big house frederick said savagely i dont want to do that on account of the smokell draw a crowd where we dont need one but i will if i got to we aint gonna let that man get away his determination pulled the rest of the slaves after him he realized it didnt have to be a white man giving orders in a loud voice anyone would do as long as he sounded sure of himself being right plainly wasnt essential or slaves would have stopped obeying masters hundreds of years ago beingor seemingsure just as plainly was benjamin barker got inside he fired at the oncoming liberating army and dropped a second copperskin a moment later another gun spoke from upstairs veronique barker didnt aim to sit around and let herself get slaughteredor suffer the proverbial fate worse than death frederick didnt think she hit anybody but she was making the effort i need five or six men to come into the house with me frederick said the rest can go on shootin make the white folks keep their heads down im with you lorenzo said at once me too davey said got to finish that fucker frederick soon had his volunteers as the rest of the liberating army banged away they rushed toward the front door benjamin barker appeared in a window like an angry ghost he fired and vanished again the bullet cracked past fredericks head much too close for comfort involuntarily he ducked he hoped that wouldnt make his comrades think him a coward whether it did or not he couldnt help it his shoulder hit the door oof he said and bounced off he might have known it would be locked hereill settle it lorenzo fired two shots from a captured revolver into the lock then he rammed it with his shoulder he fell down as it flew open davey sprang over him and dashed into the big house he took a shotgun blast full in the chest and sank without a sound benjamin barker howled laughter thought it would be easy did you he fired again this time with a pistol a copperskin beside frederick screeched and clutched his leg frederick had never thought it would be easy if slave uprisings were easy one of them would have succeeded before this but he thought it might be possible and one of the things that would make it possible was killing planters who got in the way he shot benjamin barker in the neck barker gobbled like a turkey he clapped a hand to the bleeding wound why doesnt he fall over frederick wondered but the answer to that was only too obvious because you only grazed him thats why he ran forward sure as the devil barker wasnt badly hurt he pulled a knife off his beltno a razor the edge glittering even in the dimness inside the big houseand slashed at frederick but a razor in a desperate mans right arm couldnt match the reach of an eighteeninch bayonet at the end of a fivefoot rifle musket what frederick had was a spear and he used it so he stuck barker in the chest the bayonet grated off a rib before sinking deep that finishes him frederick thought but it didnt benjamin barker went right on fighting killing a man wasnt so easy as it looked it was a horrible messy business frederick stuck the planter again and again and still almost got his own throat slashed only when lorenzo brought his pistol up against the back of barkers head and pulled the trigger did the white man quit struggling whew frederick said that man had no quit in him barker was still thrashing on the floor but he plainly wouldnt get up again who cares lorenzo answered long as you can make him quit thats all that counts another shot rang out from upstairs if veronique had fired on the invaders from the landing she could have done a lot of harm frederick looked around to make sure his surviving companions were all right then he said we better find out what that was all about cautiously they climbed the stairs the door to the barkers bedroom stood open veronique barker lay on the bed the muzzle of a pistol still in her mouth the back of her head was a red ruin that soaked into the bedclothes lorenzo grunted when he saw the corpse huh he said she mustve known what she had comin i never stuck it into a white woman before but i sure would have serve her right you knowpay her back for all the shit she done piled on her slaves frederick hadnt wanted the liberating army to do things like that what would helen have said had he joined in the gang rape of the planters wife would she have screamed at him or would she also have thought veronique barker got what was coming to her frederick didnt know and he wasnt altogether sorry not to find out one way or the other shes done for now he said this whole plantations done for lets drag the bodies out of the house let the barkers slaves know theyre free for sure veronique barkers corpse left a trail of gore down the stairs her blood and benjamins stained the rugs on the floor of their front room frederick pushed the bodies off the front porch with his foot they rolled bonelessly down the stairs and came to rest in the dirt see frederick said theyre really and truly dead we done killed em they wont ever trouble you any more the barkers slaves stared at the corpses with terrible avidity frederick hadnt particularly hated the barfordshed just hated being anyones piece of property things were different here how very different he didnt realize till the newly freed negroes and copperskins surged forward and took their own vengeance on the bodies it wasnt pretty they kicked them and beat them and hacked at them with gardening tools a couple of men undid their flies and pissed on the bodies the rest of the barkers slavesno the new recruits to the liberating armywhooped and cheered they hung the corpses up by their heels veronique barkers skirts fell down over her head that drew more whoops and some lewd jokes moving faster than they would have under an overseers glare the copperskins and negroes piled firewood into a pyre for the barkers someone poured lamp oil on the wood to help it catch as soon as it was burning well the newly freed slaves cut down their late masters and threw them on the fire they cheered again loud and long as the stink of charred meat joined the cleaner odor of wood smoke in a way this is good lorenzo said watching the barkers people caper and cavort after they do somethin like this they cant say they didnt mean it and we made em join up with us who would they say that to frederick asked lorenzo looked at him as if his wits could have worked better to the white folks of course he answered sure enough he might have been speaking to an idiot child he might have been but he wasnt patiently frederick said only way the white folksll get a chance to ask em questions like that is if we lose i dont aim to lose i been waiting my whole life to get free white atlanteans they take it for granted they dont know how lucky they are theyve got no idea but i do on account of ive seen it from the other side nobodys gonna stop me from being free not any more how about you by the look on lorenzos face frederick had startled him that saddened frederick but it didnt much surprise him i dont want to go back to being a slave no lorenzo said after a pause but i dont know what kind of chance weve got of really winning either if we dont theyll kill us all frederick said wishing the copperskin hadnt come out with his own worst fear if we do weve got to kill them all lorenzo said otherwise they aint gonna let slaves who rose up live they never have and i figure they never will frederick also feared that was much too likely to be true even so he answered main reason white folks didnt is that when slaves rose up before they just wanted to murder all the masters they could and you dont lorenzo pointed to the fire consuming the mortal remains of benjamin and veronique barker got to do some frederick admitted but the white folks even the ones without slaves live pretty damned well in atlantis how come we cant live the same way proclamation of liberty set this country free from england dont you reckon its about time atlantis lived up to all the fancy promises it made itself a long time ago dont i reckon so of course i do lorenzo said that aint the question though question is will the white folks reckon so ive got to tell you friend it looks like long odds to me youd better run off now then on account of thats the only hope we got frederick said if it is weve got no hope at all lorenzo said but i aint runnin neither cause thats no hope skulking in the woods the rest of my days like a damned honker he shook his head i dont think so shitwho knows maybe we can lick the white folks maybe he didnt sound as if he believed it though frederick didnt believe it either sometimes you had to rise up whether you believed you could possibly win or not if that wasnt the measure of a slaves damnation frederick had no idea what would be the liberating army had plenty of rifle muskets to arm benjamin barkers slaves barkers own arsenal would give several more slaves weapons hed kept far more guns in his big house than henry barford had in his why does one man need so much firepower lorenzo asked he couldnt shoot em all off at the same time not at the same time no one of barkers men a negro answered but if he needed to shoot himself a snake or a hawk or a fox or a deer or one o them big ol lizards in a river he had the right piece for it or if he needed to shoot himself a nigger or a mudface he had the right piece for that too frederick said with a shudder or one of them the black man agreed his former owner had put up much too good a fight a halloo made frederick break off the conversation a warning shout followed the halloo somebody comin up the path oh good god frederick exclaimed that was the last thing he wanted to hear no one had called at the barford plantation even before the rebellion broke out maybe neighbors knew the yellow jack was loose there or maybe it was just that henry barford wasnt what youd call sociable even if clotilde was such musings blew out of fredericks head when lorenzo asked what do we do now that was a fine question show the visitor the pyre where benjamin and veronique barker had burned hed surely want to see that wouldnt he and what about the corpse of the barkers son and the dead overseer oh yesplenty to show off on the other hand if the slaves chased the caller away he would ride off and let the outside world know theyd taken over the plantation if they killed him more outsiders would come looking for him that might buy a few hoursmaybe even as much as a daybut it would also let the cat out of the bag in short order before frederick could decide what to do his sentries went and did it two gunshots rang out one after the other the first provoked a startled shriek the second abruptly ended it a negro trotted back to frederick with a big grin on his face we got us a new eightshooter jus like the ones the cavalry soldiers use he said proudly an that fella was ridin a mighty fine horse well good frederick said hoping it was by the nature of things you couldnt keep an uprising secret very long he made up his mind we go after the menand plantation next we move out tomorrow morningearly tomorrow morning and between now and then we post extrastrong watches all around this place lorenzo nodded he understood what was going on davey would have too frederick worried about how much hed miss the chief cook in the days ahead but the field hand whod brought word of the visitors demise scratched his head how come frederick sighed quietly you liked to think the people on your side the people you were leading into the sunlight of freedom were all clever and filled with natural nobility you liked to think so yes but they would disappoint you in a hurry if you did they were people no better and no worse than any others for too long masters had judged them worse than others that would have to change but they were no better either and so frederick had to explain somebodys gonna miss the fellow you shot somebodyll come and try to find out what happened to him oh the other negro contemplated that he didnt need long to find an answer that satisfied him then we plug that son of a bitch too that could work for a little while they wont keep coming one at a time you know frederick said gently they may not even come one at a time when this poor sorry bastard doesnt ride home oh the field hand said again he nodded with luck in wisdom reckon youre right i didnt think of that why am i not surprised frederick murmured lorenzos shoulders shook with suppressed mirth the field hand didnt get it frederick wasnt surprised at that either a swallowed sigh almost gave him the hiccups he gave his orders one of the new recruits to the liberating army a copperskin from the barker plantation said i dont want to do no more fighting long as im rid of the dirty snake who was crackin the whip on us id just as soon take it easy for a while several others copperskins and negroes made it plain they felt the same way no not everybody in the uprising was as bright as he might have been well you can do that frederick said i can all right the new recruit sounded amazed and delighted he hadnt expected things to be so easy and they werent yeah you can do that frederick repeated then he went on you can do that if you dont mind the white folks catching you tomorrowif youre real lucky maybe the day after dont you get it you goddamned fool weve killed masters white folks grab us now theyll kill us as slow and filthy as they know how only way we can stay alive is to keep on fightin and keep on winnin only way you got that through your thick head were the justfreed slave white himself would he have turned pale from rage or red with anger since he was not much lighter than frederick he didnt show what he was feeling that way his scowl said he was angry i got it he answered but who dyou think you are to play the white man talkin to me like that i aint playin the white man im playin the general frederick said liberating armys just like any other kindit needs somebody in charge right now thats me if im in this here army im still a slave then the copperskin said if you aint in this here army youre a dead man walkin frederick said behind him lorenzo cocked his revolver the click of the hammer going back sounded much louder than it really was if you aint in this here army youre a dead manperiod he declared the man whod been complaining gave back a sickly grin i was just funnin like he said cant you take a joke its like frederick saidthis here is an army when the general tells you to do somethin you dont make no shitty jokes lorenzo growled you do it right away no matter what the hell it is some other stuff you dont know nothin about may depend on it and somebody may blow your fuckin head off if you fart around me for instance understand what im talkin about uhhuh sure do the younger copperskin said he took the prospect of getting shot by his own people seriously anyhow even if he didnt have the brains to imagine that white folks might do it copperskins were supposed to be fierce and savage lorenzo used that to his own advantage even against one of his own kind and who could say for sure he might have shot the new recruit as a lesson for the others frederick almost asked him then decided not to some things he didnt need to know again the liberating army advanced on a new plantation crosscountry surprise still mattered even if it wouldnt for much longer the rifle muskets and their accouterments all fit in one wagon now it also went crosscountry if the whites in the neighborhood were alerted to the rising frederick didnt want them taking back a big chunk of his weaponry all at once whether the whites were alerted to the rising or not the slaves on the menand plantation knew something was up you gonna set us free they asked eagerly when they met the fighters from the liberating army in their cotton fields not exactly frederick answered their faces fell till he explained youre gonna set yourselves free he and jacques menands slaves had been talking in low voices when they heard that they let out whoops of delight not nearly far enough away a white man demanded whats that stupid commotion all about your overseer frederick whispered thats right answered a man who looked to be of mixed copperskin and negro blood sooner that goddamned son of a whore gets whats coming to him happier well all be amen added a man who looked like a pureblooded copperskin i dont reckon youve got long to wait frederick said can you lure him here they didnt even need to do that the overseer came forward of his own accord to see what was going on riflemusket butts bayonets and knives soon finished him offthough perhaps not soon enough to suit him his screams rose up into the uncaring air frederick didnt worry about that they wouldnt reach the big house where gunfire might have menands slaves proved hot to join the liberating army first we kill this bastard here whos been fucking us the copperskin said savagely then we kill all the other white bastards too the rest of the field hands nodded the men whod got the rifle muskets to the plantation passed them out by now they seemed as attached to the guns as any ordnance sergeants in the atlantean army you take care of this piece keep it clean or well take it away from you and shove it up your ass one of them warned the wideeyed copperskin to whom he gave the weapon you got that you bet the man answered ill do whatever i have to do long as i get the chance to kill me some white folks oh i reckon we can take care of that the negro said grandly as if he were personally responsible for it drill sergeants would have despaired at the way the liberating army advanced on the menands house the copperskins and negroes kept no kind of order one of these days well have to fight real soldiers frederick thought wed better learn how to do those things or theyll murder us but that day wasnt here yet at least the men advanced with high spirits as long as they kept doing that anything was possible no one fired at them from inside the big house everything was quiettoo quiet to suit frederick whats wrong with them he said they mustve seen us coming they reckon were here for a dance then one of the house slaves came out he was wearing a boiled shirt black jacket and cravat like the ones frederick had put on every day for so many years menands done run off he said you aint gonna catch em now howd they know in time to do that frederick answered his own question somebody came and told them youre a clever fellow aint you the house slave said a field hand he came runnin back here an palavered with master jacques when they hightailed it he went with em i bet he did frederick said stinking judas must know what wed do to him if we got our hands on him who was the son of a bitch his name is jerome hes a copperskin the house slave didnt try to hide his distaste frederick understood every bit of it house slaves always sneered at field hands and negroes and copperskins sneered at each other masters exploited all those differences if this uprising was going to get anywhere frederick would have to find a way to plaster them over menands tell you why they were going he asked the house slave master jacques said he didnt aim to wait around and get killed the other negro answered he asked if i wanted to go along but i told him no i reckoned id be safe enough he brushed two fingers over the back of his other wrist showing off his own dark skin but they got away lorenzo said that aint so good that aint even a little bit good tell me about it frederick said words gonna be out and that means the white folksll come after us no more surprises not now what are we gonna do lorenzo asked ive said it beforewe could try splitting up and disappearing into the woods and the swamps but youd best believe theyll come after us frederick replied slaves start killin masters the white folks dont forget about it only other choiceonly oneweve got is fighting em and whipping em we do that three or four anxious slaves negroes and copperskins both said the same thing at the same time damned right we can frederick didnt say they would only that they could he hoped they wouldnt notice the distinction they didnt seem to damned right we can he repeated sounding more confident than he felt first thing is we know what happens if we lose he waited mens and womens heads bobbed up and down they knew all right it wouldnt be pretty it would be as ugly as vengeful whites could make it masters had to be harsh with slaves who rebelled or theyd face uprisings every day of the week they understood that as well as the slaves did frederick held up a hand to show he hadnt finished other thing is with a little luck they wont know we got our hands on these fine guns theyll come along like were a bunch of noaccounts theyll figure they can lick us easy as you please are they right no the copperskins and negroes shouted i cant hear you frederick cupped a hand behind his ear the way hed seen preachers do when they were riling up their flocks tell me again peopleare they right no the men and women of the liberating army howled thats right theyre gonna stub their toes theyre gonna fall on their faces we are free niggers we are free mudfaces and we dont aim to let anybody take that away from us not ever again frederick said they shouted loud enough to make sure the trees and the rocks heard fredericks ears rang they had the spirit all right whether they would keep it once the white men started shooting at them reckon we can win one fight the way you saidwell take em by surprise like lorenzo said quietly but what do we do after that if we win one fight we get us more guns and more bullets frederick said thatll make us stronger itll give the white folks somethin to worry about and if word of the uprising spreads amongst em itll spread amongst the slaves too what you want to bet this wont be the only hot spot the whites got to pour water on hmm lorenzo contemplated that well maybe he said at last it better not be or were all as dead as honkers they say some of them big dumb thingsre still alive way off in the back country frederick said they say all kinds of stupid things lorenzo replied and even if its true not enough of em are left to do anybody any goodnot even themselves anybody who doesnt want to stay here can run off on his own ive told folks that before frederick said i want to be here i want to win lorenzo said good frederick answered so do i vi the liberating army could draw on three plantations for livestock and supplies that went a long way toward making sure the soldiers in that army didnt go hungry right away frederick had enough other things to worry about adding hunger to the list would have been part of what a general was supposed to take care of hed never thought he would be a general he wondered whether his grandfather had expected the job he supposed victor radcliff must have the white man had been a prominent officer in the earlier war the war where english atlantis and the mother country fought against france when it came time for atlantis to rise up against england who else would the atlantean assembly choose to lead its forces no one else and who but france would aid atlantis in her fight against the mother country politics could be a crazy business frederick wondered what his grandfather would think of his own rising neither victor radcliff nor isaac fenner the other first consul had done anything against slavery maybe theyd thought southern atlantis would promptly part company with the united states of atlantis if they tried or maybe they hadnt careda much more disheartening prospect well why should they have cared frederick thought the lash never came down on their backs it had come down on his the strokes had healed well enough but he could still feel them if he twisted the wrong way he would bear the marks till the day he died and he would remember the humiliation of being shackled to the whipping postand the terror of each snapcracktill they shoveled dirt over him too if they shoveled dirt over him if they didnt burn him or chuck him in a river or leave him aboveground as a feast for ravens and vultures and scuttling lizards once you raised your hand against the white man you couldnt expect mercy from him not even in death you gonna wait for the white folks to come after us or do you aim to go after them some more before they can lorenzo asked ive been wondering about that frederick also wondered if he should admit he wondered werent generals supposed to know everything didnt they pull answers out of the air the way a stage magician pulled coins out of peoples noses maybe white generals did they got a lot more practice soldiering before they became generals than frederick ever had he was reinventing the art from scratch and had to hope he wouldnt sink the uprising with some silly move a real general would have seen from a mile away sighing he went on looks to me like we ought to move again if we get used to sitting around on our hunkers the white folksre liable to just walk right over us once they commence to fight looks that way to me too lorenzo said an it looks like theyll commence to fight pretty damn quick too longer they wait more of their slavesll run off to us aint it the truth frederick said mudfaces and niggersre already coming in folks want to be free dammit and why shouldnt they look at what the whitesve got then look at what they give us who wouldnt want to be on the other end of that stick i want to say nobody wouldnt but that aint so lorenzo said unhappily that son of a bitch of a jerome who came runnin in to warn the menands and weve had us a couple of fellows who went and disappeared dont know where they went if it wasnt to tell tales on us to the white folks maybe they just snuck off to hide in the woods frederick said lorenzo rolled his eyes since frederick didnt believe it either he couldnt very well come down on his lieutenant for doubting he knew how the white folks worked to stop an uprising theyd pay spies as much as they had to they might even reward them with freedom frederick didnt think he could stomach freedom bought at the price of betraying other slaves some men might not have such a tender conscience though some might not have any conscience at all which way do you want to go then lorenzo asked gibsons are off to the east an the st clairsre north of here we go after anybody else wed have to march back the way weve come uhhuh frederick nodded i reckon we better hit the st clairs next if i remember right their land is on the edge of a goodsized swamp things go wrong thats a good place to hide white folks wont have an easy time digging us out of it makes sense lorenzo agreed things aint gone wrong yet though maybe they wont knock wood in lieu of wood he bounced a fist off the side of his own head no not yet frederick said but right when youre sure they cant thats when they do frederick knew that lucille st clair came to mistress clotildes socials and that she invited mistress clotilde to hers hed heard that ebenezer st clair was a slow man with an eagle but not an especially harsh master the plantation grew cotton and indigo from everything hed heard it made money maybe that was master ebenezer squeezing every eagle till its eyes popped whatever it was it was something not every plantation could boast and it didnt matter an atlanteans worth not when the liberating army was about to call on the place how would master ebenezer record an invasion in his ledgers hed never get the chance not unless he ran before the slaves whod freed themselves arrived the negroes and copperskins under fredericks loose command grumbled when he got them moving sure enough they were happy with what theyd already done they wanted to sit around and enjoy it for a while you gonna keep sitting when the white folks come and cut your throats he asked them you gonna wait around for them to do it you can do thatand i dont reckon youll need to wait real long you got to remember they know weve risen up aint a question that theyll try and smash us only question is when are they gonna come after us his warriors shouldered their rifle muskets they moved north after him if they werent especially enthusiastic that wasnt the biggest surprise in the world he didnt think any soldiers could stay enthusiastic about killingand about laying their own lives on the line but fighting came with their line of work and so they did it one of the slaves whod fled to the liberating army at the menands plantation came from the st clairs i think i can get you close to the big house without letting the field hands see you on the way if thats what you want he told frederick as they tramped north thatd be goodlet us get at the white folks without anybody warning em frederick said he paused eyeing the negro he didnt know you lead us into an ambush you may fuck us all the same i promise you wont be around to spend whatever the white folks said theyd give you you understand what im talking about sure do the other man answered steadily i dont want to fuck you i want to watch the big house burn is what i want to do how come he do somethin to you in particular frederick asked my womans gonna have his baby the negro said bleakly oh frederick left it right there that was one of the special miseries black and copperskinned men faced in atlantis if a white man set his eyes on their woman he could take her dreadful things happened to slaves who tried to resist but were you a man at all if you couldnt protect your woman of course this fellow might be lying looking for sympathy as he fooled the liberating army if he was he wouldnt get the chance to profit from it frederick had been in deadly earnest about that the man led them to a stretch of forest that ran alongside the fields for a little while frederick could imagine himself in the atlantis that had existed when edward radcliffe his howmanytimesgreatgrandfather founded new hastings ferns barrel trees a big green cucumber slug clinging to the trunk of a pine spicy odors in the air birds chirping no sign that anything had changed except for the weight of the rifle musket on his back and the pull of the sling against his shoulder hold up said the negro from the st clairs plantationhis name was andrew were almost there if you kind of scoot forward youll be able to see the big house through the ferns frederick scooted up till the leaves of the ferns started tickling his nose sure enough there was the big house the columned front porch would have looked incongruous to anyone who didnt take that style of building for granted but frederick did so he saw nothing strange in it chickens pecked in the yard between the big house and the barn an enormous hog rolled in its wallow and as frederick watched a dozen white men with longarms rode up to the house another white presumably ebenezer st clair came out to greet them damnation frederick muttered theyre getting reinforcements he called lorenzo forwardhe wanted the copperskin to see for himself when he had frederick asked can we take them if we cant wed better go home and let them do what they want with us because we dont deserve to win lorenzo said i do wish we wouldve got here before they went into the house killing em in therell be a lot harder howd they know to come here anyways maybe one of our runaways went and told them or maybe theyve sent people to the gibsons place too only stands to reason wed go after one or the other frederick said doesnt much matter either way theyre there and we gotta get em i wish wed beaten them here too but im not gonna fret about that now all im gonna do is im gonna make sure weve got our guns loaded he passed the word back to his followers they would vastly outnumber the whites inside the st clairs big house the defenders would fight from splendid cover though and they would be very determined frederick was sure of that how well would his own copperskins and blacks fight whites professed to believe slaves couldnt fightand did their damnedest to make sure slaves never got the chance well they had their chance now and they were at least as well armed as their enemies lieutenant torrance would be kicking himself if he could know or would he he was a croydon man maybe he was smiling down from heaven now as soon as frederick had the word that his followers would indeed be fighting with weapons loaded he said lets go get em then use the best cover you can find and get up as close to the big house as you can we may have to set it on fire to smoke those white bastards out of there id sooner not but i wont worry if it comes to that the secrets out the white folks know were in arms against em so now weve got to win come on they emerged from the woods and trotted toward the big house lorenzo led a smaller party over toward the barn that would give the liberating army cover almost as good as the big house offered the whites bang a gun barked from the big house a copperskin howled and clutched at his shoulder get down frederick called to his fighters get flat crawl get behind things to shoot reloading a rifle musket while flat wasnt quite impossible but it was a long way from easy on the other hand getting killed standing up wasnt so good either a bullet cracking past his ear persuaded him to follow his own order he wriggled forward through the grass a small yellowgreen lizard scooted away from him in horror or perhaps derision keep coming a white man yelled from the big house well shoot you down like the mad dogs you are the white didnt believe slaves could fight not down in his heart he didnt he stood at an open window to shout defiance at them half a dozen rifle muskets spoke in the space of a heartbeat he clutched at his chest and fell over if he wasnt dead he was badly hurt the negroes and copperskins raised a cheer whos next frederick called nobody answered him not the way the first man had reviled the liberating army frederick slithered towards a boulder once he got behind it he aimed his longarm at an upstairs window and waited sooner or later somebody would shoot from that spot sooner he judged it let a marksman look down on targets he wouldnt be able to spot from ground level was that movement there sure enough a gun barrel poked out the window he pulled the trigger when the hammer came down on the percussion cap the cap spat flame into the black powder in the firing chamber the rifle musket punched his shoulder yes the percussion system beat the devil out of any flintlock ever made no hang fire no delay nothing but instant murderif your aim was good and fredericks was the white man up there toppled forward when he was hit and hung half inside half outside the window several bullets spanged off the boulder after that the cloud of gunpowder smoke hanging above it might have said here i am shoot me off to one side the pig hed seen wallowing let out a squeal of agony roast pork after we win he thought a copperskin came out of the barn with a lantern in his hand fire and oil made a deadly combinationif he could chuck the lantern into the big house without getting shot down he raced toward the white mens shelter bullets whipped past him but he threw the lantern through a windowglass crashedand then turned to dash for safety a round caught him then in the small of the back he fell forward and kept on trying to crawl away more bullets bit him after that before long he stopped moving why didnt the big house explode into flame had the white men smothered the fire had it gone out frederick swore he didnt want his followers to give up their lives for nothing out of the barn trotted several men carrying a stout pole frederick realized at once what they had in mind a battering ram would knock in the front door if they could get close enough to use it shoot at the front windows fast as you can he shouted to his men everybody with a pistol nows the time to use it he pulled out his own the range was long for good shooting from a revolver but he could keep the defenders ducking right now that counted for more than accuracy he and his men banged away at the big house the copperskins and negroes with the pole thundered forward whites popped up to shoot at them one of the whites caught a bullet in the face he slumped back into the big house a moment later a copperskin on the pole grabbed his leg and fell the rest kept coming another man was wounded as they climbed the stairs to the porch come on frederick yelled charge if the battering ram broke in the liberating army would win the fight all at once if it didnt he didnt care to think about that he rushed toward the big house when you were running not thinking came easier his fighters were charging the place with him he would have been mighty lonely had they hung backbut not for long after that he would have just been dead thud after so many gunshots the noise of the pole slamming into the door didnt seem like much the door sagged in on its hinges but didnt open the men with the battering ram hit it again one more of them fell shot from behind the door but they knocked it in then they dropped the pole in the doorway so the whites inside would have a harder time shoving the door closed again frederick seemed to fly up the stairs a few men were ahead of him but not many a white stood in the doorway with a shotgun the twin barrels looked wide as a railroad tunnel to frederick but one of the slaves shot the white before he could pull the trigger he fell backward and sent the charge intothroughthe roof of the porch it blasted a hole big enough to pitch a turkey through it would have done the same to fredericks midsection yes not thinking was easier then he was inside the house blinking as his eyes adjusted to the gloom that was a mad melee the whites still on their feet swung muskets and shotguns clubfashionthey had no time to reload one of them smashed a negros head with a blow so hard it broke the stock off his weapon another negro bayoneted him he squealed like a stuck pig heres another one you fucker the black roared and another one and another one a man often needed a lot of sticking before he died that defender got every bit he needed and more besides another white man was grappling with a copperskin when frederick bayoneted him just above the left kidney he threw his arms out wide and went rigid it was the pose frederick imagined a man struck by lightning might take he didnt hold it longthe copperskin brained him with a hatchet something warm and wet splashed fredericks face he wiped it away with his sleeve which showed both red and grayish pink his stomach didnt turn over as it surely would have a couple of weeks before he was getting hardened to the horrors of fighting quite suddenly it was over a couple of whites still writhed on the ground but the men of the liberating army finished them off one with a bayonet in the throat the other with a bullet through the head lets go on upstairs lorenzo said as he took the chance to ram a fresh charge of powder and a bullet down the barrel of his rifle musket better make sure nobodys hiding up there frederick nodded do it a party of copperskins and negroes hurried up the curving stairway he didnt think they would find anyone whatever else you could say about the white men whod tried to defend eb st clairs plantation they didnt lack for courage but he hadnt thought things through the screams that rang out there were torn from womens throats and those screams went on and on a few minutes later andrew came downstairs doing up his trousers a sated smirk on his face never reckoned id get even with the master that way he said uhhuh frederick said uncomfortably looking up from the place where the defenders had managed to smother the fire from the lantern before it took hold he hadnt wanted this kind of thing to happen but he wasnt surprised it had even if it wasnt his idea of sport whether all the men had revenge on their minds or nothing more than a brief good time he couldnt have said what he did say was weve got to knock them over the head when were through with them cant have them telling tales on us thatd only make things worse if the white folks catch some of our people andrew nodded then he looked around at the ghastly aftermath of the fight best thing we can do with this whole place is burn it down then nobody outside will know for sure what all happened here frederick remembered that hed said he wanted to see the st clairs big house burn he had his reasons for what he was saying now that didnt make them bad reasons though and frederick found himself nodding back yes wed better do that and wed better make sure were ready to fight as soon as we do the white folksll figure out enough of what happened anyways and theyll send a real army against us the next time not just a little gang like this here one always the swamp if things go wrong andrew said i know frederick answered through the screams that still rang out from upstairs its there but how much good will it do us andrew took pride in setting the big house alight frederick made sure the liberating army salvaged all the weapons and bullets and cartridges in the place before firing it he had more people to arm ebenezer st clairs slaves were eager to join his force we got a lot to pay back we do a copperskin said the rest of the bondsmen and women nodded agreement even as the big houses pyre rose into the air frederick wondered from which direction the white folks would try to hit back if it was an army he guessed it would come openly like the small contingent that had tried to save the st clair plantation the whites wouldnt really believe their property could fight they wouldnt sneak through the woods to get close one thing we need lorenzo said we need to put stuff in front of us to stop bullets and keep the whites from spotting us he could have put it more elegantly which didnt make him wrong some kind of barricade would be a lifesaver and a spirit lifter if the liberating army put it in the right place in the wrong place it would be worse than useless now if only i were sure where the right place is frederick thought he had his guesses but that was all they were then he realized he could make those guesses more likely to come true he talked for a while with one of the young women whod seemed most zealous about getting her own back against everything and everyone that had conspired to make her a slave her name was jane what happens to me afterwards she asked when he got donealso the first question he would have thought of chance you take he answered honestly maybe you can find some way to slip off or maybe theyll reckon you were a poor dumb nigger who didnt know any better but maybe not too i cant make you go tell em lies all i can do is ask ill do it jane said at once dont think ill ever get a better chance to give em one in the teeth the story she would tell the local whites was calculated to make them move even faster than they would have anyway that meant the liberating army had to move fast too like lorenzo frederick wanted that barricade so badly he could taste it the negroes and copperskins he set to work building it promptly started complaining im workin harder here than i did in the cotton fields one man said everything you did there went straight into your masters pocket frederick told him everything youre doin here sets the white folks up for a kick in the balls which one you like better huh the fellow said and went back to work slaves from all over the countryside kept coming into the liberating armys encampment you got the white folks jumpin like fleas on a hot griddle one of them said theyre bellowin like bulls everybodys speechifyin goin on about what a mess theyll make out o you well they can try frederick answered it was what he wanted to hear which didnt mean he trusted it if he could send lies out to the white folks nothing stopped them from sending lies in to him when he explained that to helen her eyes widened its a wonder you trust a living soul she said i trust you i trust lorenzo id trust davey if he didnt stop that shotgun charge with his chest he said past that past that i make sure i cut the cards twice wouldnt you he had no reason to doubt that the local militia had been called up the only reason the militia existed was to crush slave uprisings if the whites didnt call it up they were fools and then word came that they were moving on the st clairs plantation frederick imagined a straggling file of men singing marching songs left over from the war where their grandfathersand his ownbeat the english maybe it wasnt really like that but that was how he saw it his own menand the occasional woman who carried a rifle musket or one of the oldstyle guns the liberating army had taken from the plantations theyd overrunstarted to grumble about staying close to the barricade you didnt want to build it and now you dont want to use it he said wheres the sense in that and then early the next morning a big cloud of dust rising from the road that went by the st clairs place warned that the white militiamen were getting close after that frederick had no more trouble getting his fighters to take their places he wondered if any of them would leg it for the friendly swamp he didnt catch anybody doing that anyhow he could see the militiamen pretty soon they were coming the way he wanted them to maybe they would have anyhow or maybe theyd listened to brave jane some of them wore gray uniforms like atlantean regular soldiers others had on ordinary farm and town clothes they showed no better order than his own followersworse if anything but he gulped when he saw them manhandling along a small fieldpiece he didnt have anything that could answer a cannon let them start shooting first he told his troops they think they can scare us away he hoped the whites were wrong if they were as overconfident as he thought they would get too close before they opened up that would make them easier targets and he told off a handful of his best marksmen shoot the fellows serving that cannon the faster you kill em the less harm itll do right one of them said tightly they were nervous well so was he but he had to do his best not to show it a white man with a flag of truce stepped out in front of the militias ragged battle line you slaves better give up now he bawled you do and well let some of you livethe ones who aint leaders or anything you fight though and therell be no quarter for you the negroes and copperskins crouched behind their barricade looked toward frederick if answering was up to him hed make things as plain as he could go fuck yourself he shouted back all right nigger the militiamens herald said in a voice like iron if thats how you want it thats how itll be he turned on his heel and walked back to his men he evidently trusted his foes not to violate a flag of truce anyhow frederick wondered why the white man pointed toward the barricade fire he roared his men delivered a rippling volley the cannon thundered the men tending it plainly had little expertise the ball flew high over the barricade and smashed into the st clairs barn on the fly a few musket balls struck people whod been peering over the barricade at the militiamen howls of pain rose into the humid air the liberating army had no surgeons they would have to learn battlefield medicine on the fly or do without the militiamen stood there in the open while they reloaded were they begging to get killed if they were frederick was happy to oblige them fire he yelled and drew a bead on the enemy commander whose coat was splendid with gold epaulets and buttons he missed the man stayed on his feet waving and shouting orders what those orders were soon grew plain he wanted his troops to charge the slaves barricade did he really believe the sight of white men advancing on themmost of the militiamen didnt even have bayonetswould make the copperskins and negroes crouching there break and run if he did he was too stupid to live even if frederick hadnt knocked him down at the first try boom the cannon fired again this time the ball flew just over the heads of the liberating army the men at the piece could be deadly dangerous if they got the chance to figure out what they were doing but fredericks sharpshooters were making sure they wouldnt last long enough in the whites wrath and inexperience theyd pushed the gun too far forwardit sat within easy riflemusket range one after another the artillerymen went down wounded or dead hardly mattered here as long as they couldnt aim and fire the field gun one would do as well as the other frederick looked for the enemy commander again he didnt see himsomebody else must have shot him the whites advancing on the barricade leaned forward as if into a heavy rainstorm but rain wasnt hitting them bullets were most of their foes had longarms better than the ones they carried themselves the copperskins and negroes werent great shots but they didnt have to be to do what they were doing a white man in a gray uniform tunic and wool homespun pants stopped to shake his fist at the rough wall from which fire and death spat you shitasses dont fight fair he cried as if the liberating armys fighters were supposed to no one stood up to answer him which might have proved his point he gathered himself and kept coming he got shot a few paces closer to the barricade maybe that proved his point frederick didnt care one way or the other fighting fair wasnt his biggest worry fighting to win was a couple of militiamen who seemed to know what they were up to remained at the cannon the men who tried to help them plainly had no idea what they were supposed to do the experienced artillerists shouted and gestured which made them more obvious targets for fredericks marksmen they went down one after the other the cannon kept firing after that but wildly some of the whites actually reached the barricade it did them less good than theyd thought it would the negroes and copperskins on the other side didnt run away they went right on shooting at close quarters they used the bayonet as frederick had seen inside ebenezer st clairs house it gave them a big reach advantage on men trying to fight with clubbed muskets godalmightydamn that was lorenzos joyful shout we really can lick these sorry sons of bitches some wonder was mixed with the delight had he doubted it before frederick sure had though it would have taken hot pincers to tear the admission from him the whitesthose of them still on their feettook longer to reach the same conclusion when they did it seemed to suck the spirit out of them fear swallowed fury they turned and ran back the way they had come some of them threw away their muskets and shotguns to run faster none of them frederick noted tried to surrender that was just as well he had no idea how he would have tended to prisoners of war his men were as happy to shoot their enemies in the back as they had been to shoot them in the chest happier now the whites werent shooting back a few militiamen escaped it took a lot of bullets to hit a man especially in the heat of battle when fighters werent aiming so carefully as they might have but only a few got away lord jesus frederick said in wondering tones we just shot down most of the white men for miles around serves em right lorenzo said they werent gonna worry about how many of us they shot i know frederick said but whatll they do now what can they do now they can leave us the hell alone thats what the copperskin said what else do we want except to stay free and live in peace aint gonna happen frederick said sorrowfully they cant afford to let us do that theyd have uprisings all over the slave states and slaves runnin off to come live with us instead of the white folks they belong to good lorenzos voice was savage good for us sure not so good for the white folks frederick said they arent stupid theyll see that for themselves theyll see theyve got to finish us off no matter what you should have thought of that before you rearranged matthews face lorenzo said oh i did frederick answered not a lot of hope here but no hope at all livin the way i was livin speaking of finishing off thats what wed better tend to with all the wounded whites on the ground lorenzo said frederick didnt need to give orders for that the men and women of the liberating army were tending to it on their own they climbed over the barricade and started looting the corpsesand making sure the bodies they looted were corpses bayonets were more useful for that than clubbed muskets would have been too they didnt just take weapons and money though those delighted them but they also harvested shoes and clothesmany of which would have to be soaked in cold water before anyone could wear them againas well as pocket knives and other such small prizes by slaverys modest standards the fighters were newly rich they didnt want to bury the bodies frederick had to cajole them into digging a long shallow trench into which they tossed them otherwise the stink and probably the disease would soon have become unbearable yellow fever hadnt followed them from the barfords plantation for which he thanked heaven he didnt want other plagues coming down on their heads gonna be a while before the white folks try and mess with us again lorenzo said proudly we learned em a real lesson by god we did we really did frederick sounded almost as surprised as lorenzo had before him for now he was master of all he surveyed for now book ii vii new hastings in august could be hot and muggy as if it belonged with the states much farther south or at the same season it could be the kind of place where you needed an extra blanket on your bed it all depended on which way the wind blew and that was also a good enough description of how politics worked in the united states of atlantis senators shouted and shook their fists at one another some of them brandished canes no one had yet pulled an eightshooter on the senate floor but it was probably only a matter of time up on the dais consul leland newton and consul jeremiah stafford eyed each other with perfect mutual loathing the quarrel on the floor was about slavery the senators quarreled about other things too but slavery lay at the bottom of most of them consul newton reached for his gavel at last he rapped loudly order he said there will be order king canute commanded the tides and look how much good it did him consul stafford said scornfully bang bang newton rapped again even louder this time there will be order the sergeant at arms has the authority to impose order on the conscript fathers and he will the sergeant at arms sat at the foot of the dais his person was inviolable any man who presumed to strike at him would be banished from the senate floor that gave him a certain prestige no other government official enjoyed all the same he didnt look eager to perform his duties and he didnt have to i forbid it stafford said which was all it took the sergeant at arms relaxed both consuls had to agree before anything happened back when the victors in the war against england framed the atlantean charter theyd arranged this system to make sure no one exercised too much power theyd assumed both consuls would pull in harness most of the time and that one would veto the others actions only in rare and extraordinary circumstances so it proved toofor about a generation after that they didnt see how the two halves of the country would pull apart leland newton thought bitterly he was a small sharpnosed man in his midfifties with very blue eyes he had radcliffe blood on his mothers side but so what most politicians did on one side of the family tree or the other consul stafford did too they might be cousins but they werent kissing cousins consuls consuls let an honest man address the honorable consuls cried senator bainbridge of new marseille oh do you know one went through newtons mind justinian bainbridge was as slippery as a sleetcoated sidewalk and everybody knew it but he had followed the rituals of the senateno mean feat in these turbulent times you may speak newton said jeremiah stafford did not forbid it why should he when bainbridge belonged to his faction i thank the honorable consul the senator said i rise to protest the governments impotence in the face of the vicious and cruel slave insurrection convulsing my state at this very moment that touched off the match under the powder barrel everybody in the chamber started yelling at everybody else somebody swung a cane someone else blocked it with his own the noise like a gunshotmuch too much like a gunshotcut through the rest of the furious racket it seemed to sober the senators at least for a little while consul newton turned to consul stafford may i speak to that his colleagues gaze was full of contempt you may as well yes since you are the main reason the government remains impotent putting yourself on the record would make a pleasant novelty i thank you newton as was his habit met contempt with irony he looked out at justinian bainbridge are you not the man who commonly trumpets loudest when the atlantean government proposes to do anything that infringes upon what you style state sovereignty i am bainbridge answered proudly he wouldnt have recognized irony had it tiptoed up to him and piddled in his boot but the circumstances differ this time if you say that in english doesnt it mean this time my ox is being gored newtons manner was pleasant his words and expression anything but my ox is being gored god damn it to hell yes senator bainbridge was ironyproof these miserable niggers and mudfaces running around loose as if theyre as good as white men killing stealing he broke off spluttering in indignation yes white men have proved remarkably good at killing and stealing newton agreed in his politest tones it must be surprising to see our colored brethren imitate us so well jeremiah stafford favored him with a glance that could have curdled milk stafford and bainbridge believed the same things bainbridge believed them because he believed themfor the same reason he accepted the mysteries of his faith stafford had carefully examined slavery and what it did for his section of the united states of atlantis having examined it hed found it good and he knew all the reasons he found it good and couldand didargue most cogently from them to newton that he could find it good to begin with was incomprehensible but the depth of the other consuls knowledge of the subject made him formidable in debate so did his native cleverness people didnt call him the greased snake for nothing may i ask my fellow consul a question stafford inquired in his politest and most dangerous tones by all means sir leland newton could also be formidably ironic he gestured in invitation you see i refuse you nothing why refuse when you can veto consul stafford shook his head never mind that was not the question i intended this is imagine sir if you will that an insurrection has broken out in the sovereign state of new marseille an insurrection marked by murder and arson and all manner of lesser crimes he doesnt need to imagine it justinian bainbridge howled its happening right this minute bear with me senator stafford said easily he turned back to consul newton now imagine that this insurrection is the product of white ruffians and robbers with not a single mudface or nigger attached to it if new marseille appealed to the senate of the united states of atlantis for aid under those circumstances would you prevent that aid from coming howls and whoops rose from the slaveholding states senators porfirio cardenas of gernika roared so loud he suffered a coughing fit one of his colleagues had to pound him on the back newton muttered under his breath he supposed it had been necessary to incorporate what once was spanish atlantis into the usa now the redcrested eagle flew over the whole midatlantic land mass but adding the new state gave weight to the proslavery side and the spaniards had a name for being harsh masters so did the atlanteans from farther north whod flocked into the new state to try to get rich quick newton had waited too long stafford called him on it you see against white rebels dragoons and artillery would already be on the way not necessarily newton said buying himself time to think oh how not stafford returned with ominous calm if white men rebelled because they were dreadfully mistreated because they could suffer any sort of punishment at their masters hands without due process of law because they were not allowed to take wives and because the women with whom they cohabited could be forced into a masters arms at his whim would we not applaud them would we not send them dragoons and artillery to aid their fight against injustice consul newton took a deep breath he got the same tumultuous cheers for his answer as stafford had for his question but not from the same men the senators from north of the stour the erdre southern men still sometimes called the river preserving the french name clapped their hands and shouted those who favored slavery tried to drown them out with hoots and catcalls but couldnt quite when something close to order returned jeremiah stafford said there is a difference you know oh and that would be newton asked simply that white men are of our own kind our equals by nature niggers and mudfaces are not and never can be such an assertion would be all the better for proof newton remarked i have a great plenty of it and should be delighted to give you as much as you require consul stafford said move we adjourn shouted harris mitchell of freetown his state bordered the stour on the north slavery had lasted longer there than elsewhere in the north of atlantis freetown wasnt neutral ground but came closer than any other state and a motion to adjourn was always in order half a dozen senators roared seconds the motion passed overwhelmingly everyone seemed relieved to stream out of the senate chamber one more day without blood on the floor one more day yes but it had been a damned nearrun thing when jeremiah stafford talked with officers in the ministry of war he was exceeding his authority under the atlantean charter consuls commanded an army in the field on alternate daysif an army was in the field if not they were supposed to fight shy of matters military you had to know where a man came from more than anything else that told you where he stood oh there were exceptions some northern officers despised negroes and copperskins enough to lean toward keeping them in bondage rather fewer southerners thought slavery morally wrong on the whole though geography and politics walked hand in hand major sam duncan was from cosquer consul stafford had known him for years duncan had radcliffe blood too which made them kinsmen of sorts stafford passed his latest news on to the officer do you know what the nigger leading the rising is claiming he says hes victor radcliffs grandson likely tell duncan said he was a solidly built man in his early forties with bushy muttonchop whiskers that didnt suit the shape of his face one of my brothers copperskins said he was descended from the holy ghost a good dose of the lash changed his mind in a hurry i expect it would stafford agreed when are we going to be able to send our soldiers over there and clean out those coons sir duncan asked the longer the government shillyshallies the more trouble theyll kick up liable to be insurrections all the way from the hesperian gulf to the atlantic coast you understand that major and i understand it and most men of sense do as well the consul said too many people though dont appreciate the difficulties inherent in the situation damn fools if you care what i think duncan said oh i agree with you stafford answered but our founders in their wisdomif thats what it wasmade it possible for determined folk wise or not to hamstring the government consul newton remains opposed to the national governments movement against the insurrectionists this being so nothing official may be done he waited hed always thought sam duncan politically astute that was one of the reasons hed cultivated the man but if the major didnt hear what he was saying he might have to change his mind duncan tugged at one of his muttonchops he didnt smoke the side whiskers gave him something to do with his hands while he thought his eyes always heavylidded narrowed further nothing official you say jeremiah stafford smiledinside himself where it didnt show he hadnt been wrong after all major duncan did have ears to hear unfortunately that is correct stafford said sounding grave as a doctor delivering a gloomy prognosis some unofficial things might be done though duncan by contrast spoke in musing tones give some fellows leave to return home say or transfer weapons to state militias without worrying too much about paperwork things like that if theyre done unofficially i dont need to know about them stafford answered no one needs to know about them not officially all right consul i get you duncan laid a finger by the side of his nose nobody will find out well do stafford held up a hand this discussion has been purely hypothetical you understand i would prefer that it stay that way what i have not heard i am not in the least responsible for i get you major duncan nodded i wouldnt be surprised if something like that happened well it might be interesting if something like that did now jeremiah stafford let the outside of his physiognomy show amusement he felt muscles creaking under his skin he didnt smile all that often i wager the mudfaces and niggers would think it was pretty interesting too thats the idea isnt it duncan sketched a salute a pleasure talking hypothetically with you your excellency always glad to visit with someone from the old stand stafford meant that to him new hastings was another world people here didnt see things with the same simple certainties they used down in cosquer they had their own convictions those often struck stafford as lunatic if not wicked but the locals clung to them all the same the consul left the ministry of war an impressive neoclassical marble pile with an even more impressive statue of mars done by a frenchman whod ended up quarreling about his fee in front of it in the streets around the ministry stood a number of eateries and other shops that catered to the soldiers and civilian employees who worked there if stafford ever needed a cavalry saber or a waterproof oilskin cape he knew where to get one a grayuniformed sentry came to attention as stafford loosed his horses reins from the hitching rail and swung up onto the animal then gravely nodding in return he rode back toward the center of town as the horse walked along stafford felt the weight of history pressing down on him despite the new in its name new hastings was the oldest town in atlantisfour centuries old now everyone learned the jingle in fourteen hundred and fiftytwo ed radcliffe sailed the ocean blue not everyone remembered that francois kersauzon a breton fisherman showed edward radcliffe the way to atlantis cosquer consul staffords hometown was a breton foundation but it dated from after new hastings the radcliffes and radcliffs always seemed to be half a step ahead of the kersauzonsalways when it mattered most anyhow and while cosquer grew it never thrived the way new hastings did only a few years after the first settlement people from new hastings had founded bredestown miles up the river from the coast theyd kept pushing west ever since too the great redwood church still dominated the center of new hastings built before the reformation it had begun as a catholic cathedral it stayed catholic for some years after england went protestant but eventually conformed to the anglican rite the atlantean assembly had met there to plan the war against england till the redcoats ran the conscript fathers out after which they carried on as best they could from the hamlet of honkers mill once victory was wonrather to the atlantean assemblys surprise unless stafford missed his guessthe countrys leading lights returned to hammer out the charter that bedeviled atlantis to this day stafford muttered under his breath maybe things would have gone differently gone better had the senate chosen to build a new capital away from everything instead of settling down in a northern city already opposed to slavery there was talk of it but it had seemed too expensive to a country bedeviled by debt from the war for liberty he muttered again the black grandson of victor radcliff demanding liberty for bondsmen jeremiah stafford knew it was possible the first consul would have been no more immune to the lusts of the flesh than any other man possible or not though it had to be denied if trueno if believed trueit gave the rising too much prestige a constable held up a whitegloved hand stafford halted his horse so did the other riders and drivers on his street the constable turned and waved letting cross traffic through after a while he held up his hand to stop it and staffords forward progress resumed not all of new hastings notions were ancient the consul quite liked the trafficcontrol scheme by contrast he could have lived without the railroad station it resembled nothing so much as an enormous sootstained brick barn the rumble from arriving and departing trains frightened horses and the smoke their engines belched fouled the air yes they made travel much faster than it had ever been before yes they could haul far more people and goods than horsedrawn coaches and wagons but they were filthy that was the only word that fit he wasnt sure he liked gas lamps either they threw more light than candles and lanterns true but they were also more dangerous when a gas line broke and caught fire several square blocks had burned in hanover two years before or was it three now telegraph wires crowded the sky they had their uses news that would have needed days maybe weeks to cross the country now raced at the speed of lightning the government could have taken advantage of that to help put down this insurrection quickly it could have but it hadnt that made the wires seem even uglier to consul stafford than they would have otherwise his lips moved as he silently damned leland newton well no matter what the other consul thought there were ways around things even if there werent ways straight through them hed started using some of those ways now he had to hope his machinations would let the local whites do the job that needed doing a moment later he found his own way straight through to the senate house and adjoining consular residences blocked a wagon had lost a wheel spilling barrels and clogging the street the pungent smell of beer hung in the air a teamster cursed in a sonorous brogue people milled about trying to escape the jam the way around jeremiah stafford thought he turned his own horse back the way hed come first to find the way out then to find the side streets that would eventually get him where he wanted to go consul stafford gave a newsboy a cent for a copy of the new days new hastings strand here you are sir the boy said handing him the paper thank you kindly newton held it out almost at arms length the print was small and his eyes seemed to have more trouble with it every month he had a pair of reading glasses but didnt like them they turned the more distant world to a fuzzy blur by wire from new marseille a story boasted it told of people fleeing to the west coast city from plantations and smaller towns to the east the rampage of the colored desperadoes only continues and intensifies the reporter in new marseille wrote local authorities seem powerless to quell their depredations while the national government does nothing anyone could guess where his affiliations on the question of slavery lay but the strand wasnt a proslavery paper there werent many of those north of the stour maybe it printed this story because the choice lay between printing it and going without news or maybe the strand had decided the uprising needed quashing even if mistreated slavesa redundancy if ever there was onehad finally had more than they could stand the governor of new marseille had proclaimed a state of emergency the piece went on he was drafting all ablebodied men into the state militia he wasnt quite begging the atlantean soldiers in new marseille to desert and sign up with the militia but he was quoted as saying were looking for men experienced in handling weapons governor donovan was also appealing for aid from other states that share our institutions and our dangers reading the rest of the front page consul newton doubted whether donovan would get as much help as he wanted insurrections were breaking out in the states of cosquer and gernika and nouveau redon like forest fires in a lightning storm after a long drought the slaveholding states east of the green ridge mountains might be too busy closer to home to send men or guns off to the west a man in a plug hat came up to newton and demanded what are you going to do about the niggers consul no one would have spoken to queen victoria that way no one would have addressed her prime minister like that either atlanteans were convinced they were as goodand as smartas their magistrates the united states of atlantis rested on that presumption of equality for white men the idea that men of other breeds might crave the same presumption hadnt sunk in not south of the stour it hadnt with a sigh newton answered right now friend i believe im going to wait and see what happens next a lot of the time you only make things worse when you move too fast how could things get any worse than they are the man inquired i dont know and i dont want to find out by experiment either newton said one thing im sure of the distance between bad and worse is a lot bigger than the difference between good and better huh said the man in the plug hat how about the difference between bad and good isnt that what were talking about here i dont know is it the consul answered what is good and how would you make what you dont think good better youre trying to confuse things the man strode off in disgust asking questions like that hadnt done socrates much good either if leland newtons foes got sick enough of him they wouldnt trump up charges against him and make him drink hemlock they were much more likely to ignore him to do what they wanted despite justice and atlantean legality the consul opened the paper to see what was on the inside pages one of the first things that caught his eye was a gunsmiths advertisement that made him pause for a moment back in socrates day no one had carried an eightshooter assassination was easier now than it had been then newton shook his head annoyed at himself if you let the hobgoblins of modern life get to you what could you do but spend your time hiding under the bed and quivering the hobgoblins were there they werent going to go away you just had to keep on as if they werent and sometimes they even worked for you when newton went to his office in the senate house his secretary handed him a sheaf of telegrams and letters what are these isaac he asked isaac ricardo paused a moment organizing his thoughts he was at least as clever and capable as his principal newton often though he might make at least as good a consul too if not for the impediment of his religion consuls secretary was as high as a jew was likely to rise in atlantis some of them are from the southern states calling you a hound and a swine and a snake in the ferns ricardo said more come from the north telling you what a stout fellow you are after you get through those lots the rest are the usual sort that want something from you nothing much out of the ordinary then newton said his mail had divided into those three categories even before this slave insurrection broke out from what jeremiah stafford said so had the other consuls the only difference was that people from north of the stour swore at stafford while those from his own side of the river praised him to the skies newton presumed the people who wanted something from stafford could come from anywhere not too much out of the ordinary ricardo was also relentlessly precise the tone of the political lettersnot the begging ones and the scheming onesseems much more impassioned than it did since the latest unpleasantness commenced cant say im surprised well ill have a look at them consul newton shook his head ever so slightly as he went into his inner office on second thought his secretary no matter how clever no matter how capable probably didnt have what it took to try to lead the united states of atlantis the latest unpleasantness isaac ricardo would have to become more impassioned himself if he aspired to be a political man newton snorted so far as he knew ricardo harbored no such aspirations odds were his secretary was too sensible for it there were timesmore and more of them lately toowhen leland newton wished hed been sensible enough to stay away from politics himself he went through the stack of correspondence from the slaveholding states first he already knew what the people who agreed with him thought the same as he did the people who disagreed did so in different ways some of them quoted scripture to prove he was an idiot others simply loaded up their pens with grapeshot and scrap metal and commenced firing no printer would have dared put several of the days letters into type not unless he wanted to spend time behind bars for obscenity a few of the missives seemed drooled onto the page ricardos impassioned didnt begin to cover it either one of the less incandescent letters read white men are superior black men and copperskinned men are inferior this being so white men have the natural right to rule over the other races any lover of truth can see as much the author one zebulon james appended a true christian gentleman to his signature well mr james any lover of truth can see youre assuming what you wish to prove newton murmured but if he wrote that back to the true christian gentleman would said gentleman understand it the odds seemed depressingly slim a wicked grin spread across the consuls face he inked a pen dear mr james he wrote i am in receipt of yours of the seventeenth ultimo for which i thank you before i can act on it i find that i require more information would you be good enough to tell me whether you yourself are a white man a black man or a copperskinned man in any of those cases i fear your opinion may be imperfectly objective if perhaps you are a yellow man or a green man you may have a more dispassionate view of the situation do let me know kind regards leland newton consul united states of atlantis if that didnt infuriate zebulon james the man was even denser than newton gave him credit for the consul supposed mr james could be but it wouldnt be easy newton also supposed his secretary would disapprove of sending out a letter like that well too bad if you couldnt have a little fun with your work every now and again what point to doing it here is the latest outrage perpetrated by the colored insurrectionists jeremiah stafford growled in the senate chamber they derailed a train bringing volunteers from nouveau redon to the state of new marseille then set the overturned cars on fire many white men were killed many others badly burnt or otherwise injured how much longer must this vileness persist before the national government is permitted to take arms against it he aimed the question at his fellow consul senators from the south cheered him senators from the north for the most part sat impassive though several of them looked troubled plenty of men who disapproved of slavery remained convinced that white men were better than their copperskinned and black brethren if consul newton was one of those men however he concealed it very well may i ask my distinguished colleague a question he said mildly how can i refuse you when we both know youre going to do it regardless stafford returned how right you are newton said my question is this what do you suppose those white volunteers would have visited upon the colored insurrectionists had they reached new marseille what they deserved by god consul stafford exclaimed why does it matter so much to you that these men have white skins and those men have darker ones newton asked are they not all men regardless by the angry rumble rolling up from the conscript fathers consult stafford knew a great many of them did not believe a man was a man regardless of the color of his skin stafford didnt believe it either white men made the united states of atlantis he said proudly niggers didnt nor did mudfaces in the wild theyre all savages and i will tell you something else sir since you seem to have forgotten it white mens ideas made the united states of atlantis too thanks to the greeks and romans we are a republic and a republic of laws rather than men no feathered chieftain rules us his every utterance the same as the word of god hear hear bravo well said the cries of approval and the applause that went with them made stafford smile not all of that came from southern men not by any means staffords eyes slid over to his fellow consul he wanted to see how leland newton enjoyed this if it fazed newton he didnt show it wouldnt you agree sir he said that one of the socalled white mens ideas weve built upon is the notion that white men are better than any other sort i would stafford said proudly for that claim is the truth white men are better than any other sort the proof of which may be seen in the way that white men conquer and prevail all over the world more applause echoed from the ceiling consul newton merely steepled his fingertips a few hundred years ago marco polo visited cathay his book tells of all sorts of wonders the people there had of which white men knew nothing the cities in cathay were bigger and cleaner and grander than any in europe the people used printing and paper moneynot always a blessing but they devised it first even the lowly noodle comes from cathay would not any reasonable man in those days have said that the yellow folk there were far superior to the barbarous white europeans you twist things stafford didnt like to let newton know his barbs stung but couldnt stop himself this time do i i think not what looks to you like natural superiority seems to me more like picking the present in place of the past and a bit of luck besides what does ecclesiastes say i returned and saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong neither yet bread to the wise nor yet riches to men of understanding nor yet favour to men of skill but time and chance happeneth to them all or will you tell me you reckon the good book mistaken i will tell you that the good book has as much to do with cathay as chalk has to do with cream cheese stafford snarled and i will tell you it has even less to do with mudfaces and damned niggers i am black but comely o ye daughters of jerusalem as the tents of kedar as the curtains of solomon like the devil consul newton could quote scripture to his purpose as far as jeremiah stafford was concerned the resemblance didnt end there he looked out onto the floor of the senate chamber some of the conscript fathers looked as furious as he felt others seemed more thoughtful than usual not all the men who did were northerners which alarmed him he said i suppose you will next tell me sir that the bible condemns slavery it does not and you must know it does not neither in the old testament nor in the new true enough but newton spoiled what should have been a telling admission by adding it does however mitigate the conditions a slave is forced to endure and liberates him during the jubilee the institution as practiced in atlantis does none of these things i suppose you will next tell me that it does consul stafford growled down deep in his throat his colleague was the slipperiest thing this side of a greased eel in biblical times men enslaved others much like them he said our system being different from theirs and based on the inferiority of those enslaved naturally has different requirements aristotle noted that some men are slaves by nature which we see proved here aristotle said all sorts of things newton answered easily quite a few of em have turned out not to be so maybe this one is true maybe it isnt but it sure isnt true just because aristotle says so and the only thing the slave system in atlantis proves is that white men here have the guns and the dogs and the whips and the colored men dont the bible talks about sowing the wind and reaping the whirlwind too you might do well to remember that you are helping the insurrection stafford howled me im just sitting here newton said when you should be moving when we should be but stafford couldnt make the other man see viii enterprising restaurateurs in new hastings brought fat frogs and big flapjack turtles up from the southern part of atlantis and served them in stews and soups to men from that part of the country men whod grown up on such fare leland newton hadnt oh croydon had its share of frogs and pond turtles too but they hardly ever got bigger than the palm of a mans hand there wasnt enough meat in them to bother with especially since they spent the cold seasons sleeping in the mud at the bottom of streams and puddles hed had flapjackturtle stew a few times since coming to new hastings when he was eating with southern men it was fine if youd grown up eating it these days as pro and antislavery forces found themselves ever more often at loggerheads a different kind of turtle altogether he felt less inclined to make such gestures when he ate at kingsleys chop house he ate mutton chops whoever wanted to gorge on turtles and frogs was welcome to his share a mutton chop with mint jelly some fried potatoes a glass of beer or burgundy or perhaps a tawny port that was a civilized way to make a midday meal if you had to eat something that swam salmon and cod were tasty enough which didnt mean the consul ignored gentlemen who had other cravings he was enjoying master kingsleys artistry with the mint jelly when a party of southern men took the table next to his he sat more turned away from them than not or they might have recognized him they were talking a blue streak when they got there and they went right on doing it his ear identified them as southerners even before they ordered like jeremiah stafford they kept the faintest trace of a french accentthe ghost of a french accent really he wouldnt have been surprised if they were all of english stock even so the tones of the first settlers lingered irishmen who knew not a word of erse spoke english with a brogue can you believe the nerve of those niggers and mudfaces one of them said before his friends could answer a waiter came up to see what they wanted their orders also showed theyd grown up on the far side of the stour after the waiter went away the fellow whod spoken before resumed a free republic of atlantis for their own kind sweet jesus dont make me laugh likely tell one of his friends scoffed its all talk to make the northern states keep putting the screws to us but we know how things really work we do he sounded more silly than worldly wise consul newton thought so anyhow the mans friends didnt i should hope we know that damned nigger will keep telling them what to do and theyll keep doing it that devil the first man had an uncommonly raspy voice the nerve to call himself victor radcliffs grandson yes the nerve his comrades echoed did their voices sound a little hollow newton thought so he knew his would have in their place where did all the griffes and mulattos and quadroons and their copperskinned equivalents come from if white men didnt lie down with colored women no one south of the stour would let colored men lie down with white women that was certain sure and hadnt victor radcliff been a man like other men no matter what the schoolbooks said consul newton figured the man who gave atlantis liberty had sometimes needed to squat behind a bush and clean himself with a handful of leaves hed probably needed to get his ashes hauled now and again too he might well have left a byblow behind the waiter came back with beer for the men at the next table your stew will be along soon he assured them not slow as a turtle eh one of them said they all thought that was funny which made newton wonder how much theyd drunk before they got to master kingsleys establishment not even the waiter answered and went away one of the men said i dont care if that nigger says alexan der the great is his grandfather aint gonna do him any good any which way well it wouldnt another one answered we could squash him like a katydid if the government didnt act like a honker with its head stuffed up its it doesnt matter not in the long run the raspyvoiced man broke in devil it doesnt said the fellow hed interrupted tell that to all the decent white folks whove had to run for their lives tell it to the ones who didnt get away too some of those poor ladies jesus god doesnt matter raspy voice repeated doesnt matter what the damnfool consul from damnfool croydon says either not a cents worth the aforesaid damnfool consul pricked up his ears leland newton was of the opinion that his opinion mattered if these fellows werent he wanted to know why and one of them obligingly spelled it out for him armys going to get new marseille what it needs to whip the slaves no matter what if they dont have to talk about it whos going to know the difference isnt that interesting newton thought he felt like thumping himself in the head the only reason he didnt was that it might have made the mouthy men at the next table notice him but he knew he should have realized the southerners might try such a ploy since he was an uncommonly upright man himself the idea of dealing from the bottom of the deck hadnt sprung into his mind right away but he could see the possibility once someone else pointed it out to him the waiter brought the southern men their flapjackturtle stew the heavy smell of the spicesand of the turtle meatreminded the consul of his efforts to accommodate other southerners by eating as they ate it hadnt worked he knew that he had tried though he didnt want to accommodate them any more he wanted to hamper their every move and they wanted to hamper him too if they couldnt get their way through the legal channels the atlantean government afforded them theyd do it any way they could yes he should have seen that that mightwouldhappen a barrister named ezra pilkington came up to his table pilkington was a croydon man too theyd known each other since they went to radcliffe college together tipping his hat the lawyer said eating by yourself your excellency mind if i join you he ignored newtons frantic but subdued shushing motions they must have been too subdued to do any good resignedly newton glanced over to the next table all the men sitting there were staring at him in dismay altogether unfeigned how much had he heard too much that was plain even more resignedly the consul said not at all ezra sit right down dont mind if i do pilkington didnt notice anything amiss in leland newtons voice either or if he did he had the skill to dissemble waving to draw the waiters attention he said what are the united states of atlantis going to do about that damned slave insurrection now the men at the other table listened attentively to consul newton he said as little as he could some of the things he was going to do he couldnt do officially but if he was going to start bending the rules he didnt aim to let anyone else know about it beforehand meeting by night in a dive in one of new hastings dingier quarters jeremiah stafford felt like a conspirator and with reason he was he sat in a dark corner nursing a shot of popskull and waiting impatiently for his fellow plotter to show up a woman as good as you paid her to be sidled up to him she must have seen a lot in her time and little of it good but the look he gave her sent her reeling away you could just say no she shrilled no he said she glared but she left him alone after that when major duncan appeared at last stafford had all he could do to keep from laughing the atlantean officer had swathed himself in a great black cape that covered everything from the eyes down a broadbrimmed black hat covered everything from the eyes up he looked like a woodcut in a lurid novel translated from the french a man larger than he was planted himself in his path what are you supposed to be the fellow demanded duncans voice came from behind the black cape as if from beyond the grave get the hell out of my way shitheel or youll find out the man let out a roar of rage and swung on him a moment later the fellow was on the floor it happened so fast stafford couldnt see what the major did whatever it was duncan had proved himself a man of parts for good measure he kicked the bigger man behind the right ear to make sure he didnt get up for a while then he looked around anyone else he inquired stafford wondered when the dive had last been so quiet into that silence the ring of the silver tenth sam duncan tossed onto the bar seemed double sweet duncan took his barreltree rum and strolled back to the table where stafford was sitting slowly slowly the tavern came back to life people stepped over or around the man the major had decked after several minutes the fellow stirred and groaned clutching the back of his head he stayed flat the dazed look in his eye said he didnt remember what had happened to him only that he hadnt enjoyed it that was nicely done stafford remarked thanks major duncan said all the same the consul continued why didnt you paint yourself blue and come in juggling flaming torches i didnt want anybody to know what i looked like duncan sounded aggrieved but the idea is to make sure no one wonders about you stafford said theyre not the same the major looked almost comically astonished hed lowered the cloak to reveal his faceand to be able to drink after pouring down his rum the officer gave his attention back to stafford be damned he said youre right fry me for an oil thrush if youre not have to remember that he waved for a refill do stafford urged cloak and dagger doesnt mean literally i havent got a dagger by god duncan said ive got an eightshooter in my belt and a doublebarreled derringer with a charge of shot in the bottom barrel too if that bastard gave me even a little trouble i would have ventilated his spleen for him you dont need to worry about that stafford said the tavern tough still lay where hed gone down hed barely wiggled he wouldnt be getting up any time soon someone bent over him perhaps to minister to him perhaps to pick his pocket the barmaid brought the major a new shot of rum she seemed to have to remind herself to linger long enough to get paid then she disappeared again consul stafford still had whiskey in his glass he raised it your health he said and they both drank then he asked whats gone wrong something must have or you wouldnt have come to meet me dressed like a damned fool but the last handful of words stafford kept to himself newton knows what were up to duncan delivered the bad news as straightforwardly as he would have reported a reverse on the battlefield but leland newton damn his black heart wouldnt let the atlantean army take the field against the colored insurrectionists if he was going to try to snuff out covert aid to the southern states as well how did he find out stafford asked my best guess is somebody blabbed duncan spoke in tones of resigned anger i have a notion who too some clerks from the ministry of war they all looked like they wanted to hide when people came around asking questions did they give straight answers stafford asked that could be inconvenient he was proud of himself duncan would have to go some to outdo his understatement instead of attempting it the major drained his glass then held it up and waved for another refill stafford finished the whiskey too he also waved for a fresh one maybe the first would have numbed his tongue enough to keep him from tasting the second so much and his brain needed more numbing than it had got yet only after major duncan got halfway down his third glass of rum did he say i cant tell you for certain consul the snoops made sure they questioned each man alone in their boots i would have done the same thing doesnt make life any easier for us though no it doesnt stafford said hed never denied newtons competencehed only regretted the other consuls adherence to the vile cause of equality for niggers and mudfaces have you got any notion how much they know more than they ought to thats all i can tell you for sure duncan answered knowing anything at all is too damned much so it is well i did need to know that myself and i thank you for bringing me word jeremiah stafford said we should leave separately it might help less than stafford wished it would anyone who saw the major wouldnt forget him in a hurry and might also remember his companion too well i was last in i should be first out sam duncan said why that followed eluded stafford but he didnt argue life was too short and so duncan gulped what was left of the rum stood up and draped himself in his cape once more he couldnt have been less conspicuous had he caught fire the man hed decked was just starting to sit up when he swept by stafford wondered whether duncan would flatten him againfor the sport of it you might say but the officer just walked into the night who was that crazy son of a bitch someone asked beats me someone else answered he may look dumbern a honker but hes nobody youd want to mess around withthats for damned sure aint it scrap iron scrap iron proved to be major duncans victim he rubbed the side of his head again then winced and thought better of it he better hope i never see him again he said but his voice lacked conviction and well it might the fellow whod addressed him laughed and said you better hope you never see him again thus do the heroes fall scrap iron got to his feet he needed three tries but he made it when he set money on the bar the man behind it poured him a restorative consul stafford slid out of the tavern he had a pistol on his belt too in this part of town you might need one better to have and not need than to need and not have gas lamps lit the streets and sidewalks in richer quarters of new hastings hereabouts the only warning a passerby gave was the glowing coal on the end of his cigar and if he didnt smoke a cigar he gave no warning at allwhich was just what footpads had in mind stafford didnt quite sigh with relief when he reached a lighted street a less disciplined man surely would have though he made his way back to his residence a couple of sentries stood outside the door one puffed on a stogieall of it visible under a hissing gas lampwhile the other sent up smoke signals from a pipe the cigar smokers rifle musket screaked on its sling as he shifted weight how many longarms just like that did the insurrectionists have one would have been too many and they had far more than one out late tonight sir the sentry said some business i needed to attend to stafford answered yes sir the sentry said but his eyes slid toward his comrades did they think his business had to do with someone perfumed and softly curved as a matter of fact stafford did not care one broad copper cent for what they thought his wifes opinion was another matter was annabelle sitting up in there waiting for him to come back a man might take a mistress but flaunting one was bad form here though stafford had done no such thing and all he smelled of were whiskey and pipeweedno perfume annabelle ought to notice thatif she was in a mood to notice anything she was waiting for him darning socks by the light of a lantern she was small and dark and sadlooking as any mother whod buried three babies would have been jeremiah stafford feared he might be the last of his line annabelle put down the sock she was working on she was shortsighted which helped her with the needle if not with the wider world and blinked up at him like the sentry she said you were out late business he said as he had before but he would explain to his wife where he wouldnt for a noaccount soldier sam duncan ah your friend she knew the name if not the man her voice didnt say whether she believed him he described duncans disguise and the way it concealed and proclaimed at the same time he also described how the major had rusted scrap iron annabelle smiled faintly quite a man she said yesalmost as much as he thinks he his if only he had more common sense to go with his courage and strength that costume good lord stafford rolled his eyes and why did you have to meet him in some low dive why wouldnt a walk around the senate house do as well annabelle asked because if anyone connected to northern senators or to my esteemed fellow consulstaffords tone turned the praise into a filthy liesaw us walking together he would understand why we were talking together whereupon trouble would immediately follow you know we are quietly doing what we can to aid the states against the servile insurrection well of course his wife had been born in the state of cosquer too down close to the border with gernika she came from a slaveholding family as he did in fact the threat of uprisings always seemed worse in that part of the country gernika had still been spanish atlantis when she was a girl and spanish atlantis always sizzled and sometimes exploded the dons squeezed all they could from their copperskins and blacks and squeezed out hatred along with everything else you see stafford said duncans news was that consul newton has found out about our quiet efforts having learned of them he is doubtless doing everything in his power to thwart them how wicked of him no wonder you went out then jeremiah annabelle said and something behind staffords breastbone unknotted whatever she had thought she believed him now she went on what can you do to stop him from disrupting things that question cut to the quick i dont know yet consul stafford admitted but knowing we have a problem is bound to give us our best chance of keeping it from getting worse before his wife could answer a clock that had been quietly ticking on a side table chimed the hour two in the morning annabelle yawned come to bed she said whatever your best chance may be you cant do anything about it till the sun comes up stafford feared the nighttime might prove better some of the deeds that wanted doing would be dark she was right about tonight thoughand her yawn was contagious sleep he said longingly things looked less bleary in the morning if not necessarily better stafford primed his pump with several cups of strong sugared coffee men from north of the stour were more likely to drink tea leland newton did as stafford had seen the consul from cosquer thought he got the edge on his colleague in the morning whether he could keep it might be another story consul newton was up and doing ahead of him instead of ignoring him as newton often did the other consul made a point of buttonholing him i have a question for you sir one concerning the safety of the nation newton said i have had a good many questions of that sort for you lately sir stafford answered you seem less than less than willing to answer them however but let it be as you wish for nowhow can i say no if youve ever had any trouble with the word you hide it marvelously well newton shook his head i will steer clear of gibes as i do hope for a serious answer from you my question is this if so many capable officers and men leave the atlantean army how shall we defend ourselves against some foreign foe does foreign war loom on the horizon if so against whom stafford asked adding i must confess the portents have escaped my notice you are being deliberately difficult newton sounded severe you are being deliberately hypothetical stafford retorted am i it could be but i think not newton said the army depends on professional soldiers of large experience if a number of them suddenly leave and must be replaced with less seasoned men how can it fail to suffer a loss of efficiencyto say nothing of effectiveness you will not allow the army to be used to reestablish order in the southern states stafford said this being so how can it surprise you that soldiers would sooner do what they see as their duty even without army auspices than sit idly by with the blessings of the ministry of war their conception of duty is defective newton said i do not for a moment agree with you but even supposing you are right so what stafford said leland newton frownedscowled in fact i did beg you for the courtesy of a serious response serious sir i am serious to the point of solemnity stafford said you must bear something in mind that your opponents are as much in earnest as you yourself their sense of duty may seem defective to you but it does not seem so to them they hold to it with as much devotion as you cling to the deluded idea of nigger equality i know you believe in that but i am damned if i know how he wondered whether newton would laugh in his face the other consul had a firm faith in his own beliefs and faith every bit as firm that his foes beliefs were only delusions after hearing stafford out he looked almost comically surprised well well he said and then upon my soul meaning what exactly staffords voice was dry you really mean what you say the other consul blurted i should hope so i am in the habit of it anyone looking at my career would be hardpressed to doubt it if you do i hope i may take the liberty of asking why stafford said he was surprised in turn when his colleague actually blushed i always assumed you were in the habit of saying what your constituents wanted to hear as most politicians are newton said that any man of sense could believe some of the things you have said i am going to say something now that you had best believe i find your views every bit as repugnant as you find mine note however that i do not do you the discourtesy of thinking you hypocritical stafford said i think you are every bit as misguided as you declare yourself to be thank you i suppose newton said since you then prefer to be judged a knave rather than a fool no stafford broke in sharply someone who thinks you are wrong is not a knave on account of that he is only someone who thinks you are wrong recognizing the differencenot necessarily liking it but recognizing itis important will you tell me you do not think me a knave newton demanded jeremiah stafford hesitated before answering which he seldom did personally no you have the courage of your convictions he said at last in what you are doing to my section of atlantis the effect intentional or not is knavish this is my view of your effect on atlantis as a whole consul newton said why not say of slaverys effect that is what you mean eh no slavery is altogether knavish while you are not yet you support the infamy nonetheless can you not see that this makes you worse not better stafford started to tell him he did not find slavery infamous to stafford true infamy was the idea that negroes and copperskins could presume to be equals but consul newton didnt wait for explanation like a banderillero in a bullfight down in gernika something consul stafford did find infamous but also something he lacked the power to root out leland newton planted a barb and walked away before his victim could gore him on account of it senator hiram radcliffe came from the state of penzance north of croydon as the english penzance its namesake lay close by lands end so the atlantean town that gave the state its name wasnt far from north cape where ocean finally won the battle against land penzance held hardly any copperskins or negroes penzance didnt hold all that many whites and the ones it did hold were of an uncommonly independent streak to say they didnt approve of chattel slavery would have been putting it mildly and so consul newton thought he would be glad to see senator radcliffe he had no idea from which branch of the founding clan the senator sprang only a genealogist could keep them all straight that didnt matter anyway whichever branch hiram radcliffe sprang from he looked nothing like the most famous modern member where victor radcliff had been tall and lean his distant cousin had a short wellupholstered frame and some of the most ornate whiskers the consul had ever seen his muttonchops grew into his mustache but he shaved his chinor rather chins consul what do you propose to do about the slave rising senator radcliffe asked at the same time sending up clouds of pungent smoke from his pipe why just what i have been doing newton answered i propose to keep the atlantean government from pulling the southern states chestnuts out of the fire for them the image had traveled across the sea from england the only chestnuts growing in atlantis were a few ornamentals likewise imported the land had none native to it nor any other broadleafed trees more smoke came up from radcliffes pipe thats what i thought he said and then amplifying thats what i was afraid of afraid of leland newton didnt dig a finger into his ear to try to make it work better but he caught himself barely in time to stop the motion why do you say that on account of its true radcliffe answered yes the slaves have their grievances lord knows i understand that but its still a damned uprising consul theyre burning and ravishing and killing new marseille doesnt seem able to put em down and brushfires are breaking out in some of the other southern states that is the point of the business is it not newton said the rebels are being as moderate as their circumstances permit even accounts from their foesthe only accounts we have rememberadmit as much they seem to aim to set up a colored republic of their own and what will they do with the white folks caught inside it radcliffe asked treat them the way theyve been treated themselves for all these years thats how it looks right now what if it is consul newton returned can you deny the justice in such a turn of fate you cant make your own cause just by murdering or tormenting folks on the other side even when theyve been doing the same to you since time out of mind even then hiram radcliffe said stubbornly one reason i want a national army down there is to get between the rebels and the militias trying to do unto them if the uprising stops maybe we can get around to talking sensibly about what made it start in the first place good luck meaning no disrespect sir but you will need it newton said expecting a southern white to talk sensibly about slavery is like expecting the sun to rise in the west you may if you so desire but you will be doomed to disappointment dyou suppose the copperskins and negroes are any more likely to radcliffe said seems to me theyre just the other side of the same coin would you not say they have two or three hundred years worth of pentup spleen to vent newton asked i would i would indeed but if they keep venting it they will make the white southerners decide the only way to stop them is to kill them all and if they set about it how do you propose to stop em they would do no such monstrous thing newton exclaimed but then he remembered his conversation with consul stafford how monstrous would disposing of negroes and copperskins seem to a man like that monstrous enough to keep him from trying it newton wished he could think so his face must have shown what was going through his mind because senator radcliffe said now you see what im driving at well maybe i do newton said but keeping an army like that on anything close to an even keel wont be easy you know the law as well as i do one consul commands one day the other the next against a foreign foe this is no great disadvantage since both men would naturally work toward the same end but where one aims to push while the other wants to pull consul if a croydon man cant slicker some poor slob from cosquer he isnt worth the paper hes printed on hiram radcliffe declared your confidence flatters me newton said dryly it had better your excellency on account of thats what i had in mind the senator from penzance replied not a bit abashed but you need to think about this whole business some more and im not the only one who figures you do i see and how large is your cabal leland newtons tone remained dry which didnt mean he didnt mean the question what kind of plotting had been going on behind his back large enough by god radcliffe said which conveyed strength without informing no doubt exactly the effect he had in mind he coughed a couple of times large enough so that if we have to vote with the southerners to get an army sent down there the size of the majority on the resolution will make your eyes pop it can be as big as a honker for all i care consul newton answered doing his best not to show how much the warningthe threatshook him hiram radcliffe was or had been on his side still trying to seem unconcerned he went on the resolution can be unanimous for all i care if i disagree with it it will not pass you know what the history books say about consuls who forbid measures just for the sake of forbidding radcliffe warned newton did know there had been a couple of consuls like that in the early days of the united states of atlantis the horrible bad example they offered dissuaded later atlantean leaders from imitating them all the same newton said let history judge me i will do what i think is right whats wrong with being able to ride down a road without worrying about whether youll get robbed or murdered before you get where youre going radcliffe asked if since time out of mind you have been robbing and murdering the people who have finally risen in arms against you maybe you deserve to worry newton said maybe by the way hiram radcliffe said the word he didnt believe it for a minute he took the pipe out of his mouth to lick his lips i hate to say it consul but youd better worry that people dont finally rise in arms against you newton had been in politics for many years he didnt miss much and he didnt miss the key phrase here in arms he echoed quietly senator radcliffe looked unhappyhe looked most unhappybut he nodded in arms he repeated well leland newton made a steeple of his fingertips i never looked to be threatened with assassinationnever so politely anyhow in the hurlyburly of the senate chamber anything could happen but this wasnt like that this spoke of dangers in a back alley in the middle of the night or maybe of poisonous mushrooms garnishing a plate of boiled pork i am not threatening you consul i am trying to warn you the senator from penzance said if you keep on with it more and more people will want to put you out of the way surely you can see that he sounded as if he was pleading i might have expected something like this from senator bainbridge or some other frothatthemouth southerner newton said bitterly but et tu hiram et ego radcliffe answered proving he remembered at least some of the latin hed had drilled into him as a schoolboy sometimes you need to have your friends tell you because you dont take your foes seriously enough weve got to do something down there leland doing nothing isnt enough any more so you say hiram radcliffe nodded so i say he heaved his bulk up from the chair in front of newtons desk and now i wont take up any more of your time does consul stafford know you came here newton asked not yet radcliffe said i hope i dont have to tell him and if you publish abroad whats personal private business i will damn you as a liar from here to avalon i assumed that newton said photographers had started capturing light if only there were some way to capture sound as well figured you did but even so good day to you your excellency radcliffe lumbered out of the office newton fought down the impulse to speed him on his way with a good kick in the breeches ix wait sitting up there on the dais in front of the conscript fathers of atlantis consul jeremiah stafford had trouble believing what his colleague had just said repeat that if you would be so kind he wasnt the only one to doubt his hearing either half the senators were staring at leland newton as if hed just disappeared an elephant right before their eyes one fellow dropped his glasses jaws dropped on both sides of the aisle in the senate house but especially among the men who came from south of the stour consul newton turned to stafford with an ironic smile you heard me correctly sir he said i spoke and i shall continue to speak in favor of using an atlantean army to interpose itself between the insurrectionists and the new marseille militiaand if necessary between the insurrectionists and the militias belonging to the other southern states a burst of applause echoed from the ceiling of the senate house some of it again came from southern men but othersfirebrands like radcliffe of penzancealso joined in the cheering that they did roused staffords evervigilant suspicions wait he said again what precisely do you mean when you say you want to interpose an atlantean army down there i mean what i say neither more no less newton answered blandly as you do sir i consider that an admirable habit in my opinion we would be better off if more persons in political positions followed our example we would also be better off if fewer persons in political positions were as exasperating as you make a point of being stafford said his colleague gave him a seated bow i am your servant sir stafford ignored that it wasnt easy but he managed in a game of chess for instance you may interpose a bishop between your king and your opponents castle newton beamed at him just so you see you understand perfectly so why were you so troubled a moment ago why ill tell you why stafford answered because an interposed piece does not necessarily capture the one that is causing the difficulty leland newton stopped beaming consul stafford got the idea that his colleague hadnt expected him to realize that quite so fast croydon men commonly thought no one was clever except their own kind comprehension took longer to dawn out on the senate floor than it did inside staffords mindwhich might have meant that consul newton had a point in case any of the conscript fathers missed anything stafford made ithe hopedunmistakably clear you want to put the national army between the niggers and the honest white men now fighting them you have not said one word about using the national army to fight them however why is that if i may enquire separating the opposing forces seems to me an excellent first step toward peace newton answered wait a minute senator bainbridge shouted from the senate floor you just wait one damned minute an excellent first step toward peace is stringing up all the slaves who rose up against their rightful masters thats what a first step toward peace is he got thunderous cheers from his southern friends this time though senator radcliffe and the other northern firebrands sat on their hands that told stafford as much as he needed to know about the kind of game newton and his cohorts were playing but there were games and then again there were games i am willing to support consul newtons resolution stafford said jaws dropped again eyes poppedamong them those of leland newton no newton wouldnt be able to call stafford names for rejecting the resolution out of hand even if it came with a poison pill stafford went on the usual command arrangements will of course apply of course newton said i am not trying to change the way the united states of atlantis work no indeed sarcasm dripped from staffords tongue freeing the mudfaces and niggers would do nothing of the sort as a matter of fact sir it wouldnt newton said it would only extend citizenship to men and women who are now but residents and it would ruin an entire class of white men who have contributed greatly to making atlantis strong consul stafford pointed out some form of compensation might be arranged newton said how generous stafford fleered tell me what compensates for murder killing in war is not murder newton replied killing in an uprising is stafford said and inflicting a fate worse than death upon helpless women is a foul crime in war or peace i would agree with you his colleague said so no doubt would countless black and copperskinned women compelled to be the vessels of their masters lusts its not the same thing stafford insisted uncomfortably recalling the mulatto woman whod initiated him into the rites of loving no eh newton said it all depends on who is doing what to whom i suppose you make that into a joke and a nasty one at that stafford said but you are quite right a chattel has no say over his person or over hers the other consul broke in or over hers stafford agreed but when a slave callously violates a free white woman he only imitates what white men have done to the women he is not permitted to call wives that is not what i was going to say really why am i not surprised once the bickering ended the resolution passed and well see who ends up outsmarting whom jeremiah stafford thought his guess was that once an army full of white men bumped up against the insurrectionists it would go after them full bore whether consul newton wanted it to or not and even if by some mischance it didnt he could still use his alternate days in command to steer it in the direction he wanted it to go he looked forward to it politicians in atlantis won votes by railing at bureaucrats leland newton had done it himself if you listened to politicians bureaucrats were miserable old slowcoaches the fistsized snails in the southern states could move faster than they did and cucumber slugs had more in the way of brains to say nothing of less in the way of slime if you made a speech like that you commonly believed it at least while you were giving it newton knew he sometimes exaggerated for effect but even so he expected the ministry of war would need weeks to gather together the soldiers and munitions and other supplies an army required if it proposed campaigning against the rebels west of the green ridge mountains the army was ready to move four days later the minister of war told newton that colonel balthasar sinapis the senior officer who would accompany the consuls into the field had already apologized for taking so long i hope you will not be hard on him because of the delay the functionary added well i may possibly forgive him this once newton said he does promise to do better in any future emergency the minister of war said good was the only answer newton could find colonel sinapis was a swarthy professional soldier who spoke with some sort of guttural accent hed come to atlantis in the wake of the upheavals following the recent failed revolutions in europe consul newton thought of him as a human rifle musket aim him at whatever you pleased and he would knock it over for you what the colonel thought of the consuls was something that hadnt occurred to newton till sinapis sat down in the leading railroad car of the leading train that would take the army into action against the rebels sinapis had an axeblade of a face a shaggy gray mustache under a scimitar nose and the fierce unblinking stare of a peregrine falcon you gentlemen will have a plan of campaign for the days ahead he asked when he spoke his accent and his ferocious manner gave him the aspect of a talking wolf the only wolves newton had ever seen paced an ironbarred cage back in croydon had one of those wolves worn a gray uniform instead of coarse gray fur it might have been balthasar sinapis brotherinlaw however lupine colonel sinapis manner his question was only too cogent newton glanced over at jeremiah stafford he was anything but surprised to find the other consul looking back at him well they both said slowly neither seemed to want to tell the colonel how much they disagreed about what ought to happen after the army encountered the insurrectionists a flash of scorn in sinapis dark eyes warned that he already knew they couldnt even agree to disagree some thought now would spare us much trouble later he said as if to squabbling children his accent might remain strong but his english was grammatically perfect newton had already noticed as much the colonel might have said some thought now will save us much trouble later he might have but he hadnt which meant what that he expected no such planning he just wistfully hoped for it consul staffords expression said he was making the same calculation and liking it no better than newton did well do what we can to obtain a satisfactory result he said at last certainly your excellency colonel sinapis said and how do you propose to define success when we find it well know it newton said yes i suppose we will stafford agreed colonel sinapis sighed like a wolf that had failed to outrun a deer so many images in our language of animals not native here newton thought the colonel said what you mean is you have not got the faintest idea of what you want the army to do or perhaps each of you has an idea but you have not got the same idea is this true am i right or am i wrong the two consuls looked at each other they both sighed too at the same time and on the same note you may be rightfor now newton said i think we both hope we will have the answer once the army goes into action sinapis brows came down over his eyes like battlements protecting a keep the lines on his cheeks deepened like entrenchments in a siege meaning no disrespect to you gentlemen he said a phrase that always meant disrespect to its targets but an army without a plan is like a drunkard on a stroll if you have no notion where you are going how will you know when you get there or if you get there lets get there first consul newton said once we do i expect well sort things out i hope well sort things out consul stafford said that wasnt exactly agreement but it wasnt exactly disagreement either newton decided he would take it by the way balthasar sinapis whuffled out air through his mustache he was less satisfied politics he said disdainfully gamemeno politics that sounded like a participle derived from gameo the classical greek verb meaning to marry leland newton was mildly surprised and pleased that he recognized the form and that he remembered what the verb meant or had meant marrying politics made no sense perhaps the word had changed meaning in the centuries since plato and xenophon used it before he could ask the emigre officer went on all you think of are your gamemeno political points there it was again just as incomprehensible as before what i think of gentlemenand you had better keep it in mindis the blood of my soldiers it is what you intend to spend to make your political points and i do not believe you care a cent for it newton started to deny that indignantly he stopped with the words unspoken it wasnt that he didnt care what happened to the atlantean soldiers rattling along behind him sinapis had that wrong but newton hadnt thought at all about what might befall the grayuniformed men if he admitted as much the colonel would be within his rights to call him on it i have been thinking more of what our army will do to the insurrectionists consul stafford said of course you haveyou are a politician too no sinapis didnt bother hiding his dislike for the men who outranked him you leave it to a soldier to worry about the other dont you stafford seemed to have no comeback for that newton knew too well he didnt except for the dull metallic rumble of iron wheels on iron rails silence filled the compartment wheeeoooo the locomotive whistle screamed as the train crossed the railroad bridge from the state of freetown to the state of cosquer the land on the south side of the stour looked no different from that on the northern side all the same jeremiah stafford let out a long sigh of relief at last he was back in gods countryor at least in a country with civilized laws before long the train stopped in a sleepy little town called pontivy a gang of black and copperskinned slaves lugged fresh lumber to the tender a swagbellied white man in overalls had a pistol on his belt but stafford would have bet he hadnt had to draw it for years thump thump the sawed lengths of wood replaced what the locomotive had devoured since the last stop another slave went down the train oiling the wheels the lazy black devil didnt bother lifting the spout of his oil can between one set of wheels and the next he just let the expensive oil spill out onto the dirt why should he worry he wasnt paying for it seeing that kind of thing made stafford grind his teeth the overseer either didnt notice or didnt carehe wasnt paying for the oil either somebody was though dammit the railroad companys supply department or the shareholders or on this journey the atlantean government stafford hated waste he knew slaves generated more of it than he would have liked because things werent their own they didnt care about them that was why for instance planters had to give their field hands those heavy clumsy tools they would have broken the better ones white farmers used and in short order too we have to do something about that he muttered atlantean slaveholders had been saying the same thing since the seventeenth century the only answer anyone had come up with was making the slaves afraid to be careless with their toolstheir owners tools and that worked only up to a point press a nigger or a mudface too hard and hed either try to murder you or hed run off both were more expensive than broken tools consul newton had also got off the train to watch the refuel ing and to stretch his legs he didnt seem to notice the negro wasting oil which relieved stafford but he did notice stafford mumbling to himself and asked what was that i wish we would make our workers more efficient and considerate stafford said why dont you try paying them newton asked his tone not in the least ironic nothing makes a man a careful worker like the fear of getting docked the whole point of our system is to keep from enslaving workers to money stafford said his fellow consul raised an eyebrow so you enslave them to their masters instead a dubious improvement i fear and i have never yet heard of a slaveowner who broke out in hives when some cash came his way no the owners only worry when their slaves see a coin once in a blue moon slaves dont need money stafford said remember their masters feed and clothe and shelter them none too well more often than not newton said they live better than factory hands in hanoveror in croydon come to that stafford retorted who said that the first freedom was the freedom to starve whoever he was he knew what he was talking about i dont see white factory hands swimming across the stour to work on your plantations newton said tartly we would not enslave them if they did and you know it perfectly well stafford said fine have it however you please i dont see free negroes and copperskins volunteering to go back under the lash either it has happened stafford said i recall one such case just a couple of years ago the copperskin couldnt make a go of it in freetown so he decided to come south he knew he wouldnt starve here and his children wouldnt either it must not happen very often by god or you would not be able to call particular instances to mind his colleague said since that was true stafford maintained a discreet silence the train whistle blared again it was even louder when heard out in the open than from inside a railroad car the windows commonly closed against soot and cinders muffled some of the ferocious squeal all aboard the locomotive driver bawled from the back of his iron chariot he might have been piloting a ferry boat not the most modern conveyance in the world all aboard the whistle shrilled once more colonel sinapis nodded coolly to the consuls when they joined him in the compartment they shared he hadnt got off the train reading glasses perched on that curved blade of a nose he pored over maps of the southwest regardless of whether the consuls were ready for whatever might happen when the army got where it was going he intended to be what he wasnt ready for any more than they were was their train derailing just outside of pontivy the only thing that saved them from worse misfortune was that they hadnt got going very fast yet there was a jolt and a crash the next thing stafford knew the locomotive and tender had flipped over onto their sidesand so had the car he was riding in he had time for one startled exclamation before he landed on what had been the side of the car and colonel sinapis landed on him oof stafford said which summed up exactly how he felt about the situation the colonel had a more detailed opinion which he expressed in english and what sounded like several other languages stafford didnt understand them all but admired the effects especially the one that sounded like ripping canvas leland newton had also fetched up against the side of the car he however was not festooned with a colonel so his remarks were less impassioned are you all right jeremiah he asked it was as far as stafford could remember the first time his colleague had used his christian name i seem to be leland he said returning the courtesy or i will be if the good colonel sinapis would remove his elbow from the vicinity of my navel the good colonel did move the pointed part in question and the consul did gain considerable relief as a result sinapis scrambled to his feet he stepped on stafford once more in the process but without malice we must help the injuredand there will be some he said stafford only grunted because sinapis was bound to be right derailments were lamentably common and produced more than their fair share of lost limbs and broken bones the colonel wrestled the door open it didnt want to open sideways but he made it obey he scrambled out stafford and newton followed sinapis prophecy was confirmed at once a couple of the stokers lay on the fernsplashed ground one was clutching his leg and groaning the leg had a bend in a place where it shouldnt consul staffords stomach did a slow lurch he looked away in a hurry if an injury like this threatened to sicken him how would he do on a battlefield with bullets and cannonballs ripping flesh he hadnt thought about that when he set out from new hastings maybe he should have the engine driver limped out of the capsized locomotive he was not only hurt but incandescently furious a rock he screamed some goddamned fucking son of a bitch put a fucking boulder on the fucking tracks he started to hop up and down in his rage but his ankle made him think better of it that shiteating bastard whoever the devil he was he went and derailed us on purpose i hope he rots in hell and old scratch uses his short ribs for toothpicks slow cold certainty formed inside jeremiah staffords mind that shiteating bastard whoever the devil he was was a mudface or a nigger he sounded as sure of himself as any biblical prophet yes very likely colonel sinapis nodded those people are the ones with the most reason to slow us down or stop us rounding on his colleague stafford said you dont say anything sir consul newton spread his hands what would you have me say i agree most likely a slave did place a rock there to derail us i have never claimed slaves loved us the most i have ever said is that they may well have good reason not to love us bah stafford turned away from him in disgust that let him look down the track half a dozen cars after the one in which hed been riding had also overturned some of the soldiers inside them were bound to be hurt too the cars farther back had managed to stay on the rails had the train been moving faster more of them would have gone off those slaves were fools the consul thought they would have done better to plant their boulder farther from town so we would have built up more speed or maybe they didnt know we would stop in pontivy a horrible shriek derailed his train of thought the phrase had quickly become a commonplace after railroad lines began crisscrossing atlantis now stafford was reminded of the reality that had given rise to it colonel sinapis crouched beside the stoker with the broken leg among other things the colonel knew how to set fractures even if the process was painful stafford hoped the army surgeons had laid in a good supply of nitrous oxide and ether the newfangled medicines seemed sovereign against even the worst agony hold still sinapis told the stoker his strong hands made sure the man obeyed the officer nodded to the other stoker who hovered nearby draw my sword cut a couple of saplings cut strips of cloth too so i can splint this leg dont just stand there man move move the other stoker did and smartly too when balthasar sinapis told you to do something you did it first and worried about why later he would have made a marvelous overseer consul stafford chuckled softly what was a colonel but an overseer who used a uniform and army regulations instead of a bullwhip to get his way stafford stared this way and that no slaves in sight now hed wondered if they would stick around to enjoy the chaos theyd caused but no such luck even stupid slaves knew better too bad and the army was going to be later than it had expected getting to the insurrection that was also too damned bad the train derailed once more before it got to nouveau redon this time peopleno doubt colored peoplehad set logs on the rails the train was going faster when it hit them leland newton ended up with a knot on the side of his head and a left wrist sprained so badly he had to wear it in a sling one of the army surgeons gave him a tiny bottle of laudanum for the pain the potent mixture of brandy and opium pushed it off to one side anyhow the opium also settled his bowels which had been flighty on a traveling diet of hardtack and salt pork army rations slaves dont love you either consul stafford pointed out to him no matter how splendid you think they are theyll kill you if they get the chance worst of it was newtons colleague wasnt wrong newton hadnt let that enter his calculations when he left with the army he wondered what else he hadnt thought about that he should have he hoped he didnt find out the hard way when he remarked on that colonel sinapis said plan ahead always plan ahead it will not be perfect but it will help the latest dose of laudanum had worn off leaving newton sore and irritable he wiggled his arm in the sling the surgeon had put on him that only hurt more how do you propose to plan against what happens in a derailment he snapped to his amazement the colonel had a sensible answer for him belts across the seats would hold the passengers in place and not let them fly about promiscuously in an accident that would save many casualties damned if it wouldnt newton said in surprise his pique evaporating i wonder why we dont do it now because the railroad companies say it would cost money to put all these belts into place because they say some people do not care to be closed in with a belt because they say feminine costume would be inconvenienced and so people break limbs and sometimes break their heads but a few cents are saved hallelujah sinapis did not so much as raise his voice which only made the irony more cutting gingerly feeling the side of his own head newton could sympathize with that irony he turned to jeremiah stafford whod come through the latest derailment unscathed here is something about which the government should have its say dont you think not quite so urgent as a servile insurrection stafford remarked but that wasnt necessarily a veto for he went on bound to be easier to gain consensus on account of that one would hope so yes consul newton was not about to let anyone display more sangfroid than he did a plan colonel sinapis said again have you gentlemen yet devised one he was relentless as a hurricane how can we newton did his best to sound reasonable we wont fully know the situation till we arrive many telegraph lines are down slaves doing stafford broke in newton shrugged as may be but what comes over the surviving wires is the most amazing twaddle if you tell me the slaves are responsible for that i shall be most surprised no no the other consul said impatiently do you expect calm and good judgment in the middle of an uprising though perhaps not occasional accuracy however would be welcome newton said do we fight the colored rebels do we fight the people fighting the colored rebels sinapis persisted do we try to keep them from fighting what do we do if they dont feel like stopping those were all good questions newton had answers to none of them well that wasnt strictly true he had his own answers unfortunately consul stafford also had his own answers which werent the same which were in fact as different as coal and kohlrabi at least stafford also didnt try to tell colonel sinapis exactly what would happen when the army got off the train in the state of new marseille he knew newton had different answers too sinapis looked from one consul to the other and back again he might have been examining two insects with revolting habits his voice suggested that he was or will the army try to do one thing one day and something else the next depending on who is in command i tell you gentlemen this army is not a toy to be pulled back and forth between you as if you were a couple of spoiled children who needed spanking you will cost me soldiers if you try to do things that way and i remind you that soldiers are not toys the innocent white men and women being despoiled by the insurrectionists are not toys either stafford said neither are the slaves who have been despoiled for centuries by these socalled innocents newton returned he stared steadily back at balthasar sinapis what is your personal view of slavery colonel it is my personal view sir and i prefer to keep it that way sinapis said whatever it is it is less important than my view that throwing away an army on account of lack of foresight and cooperation will do atlantis more harm than good we are all three of us men of strong opinions stafford soundedamused yes amused newton was sure of it the other consul went on now if only any two of us shared some of those opinions we are what the country has newton said if from among us we cant piece together a course that will do the country good then lord have mercy on the usa yes kyrie eleison sinapis said which meant the same thing but sounded much more elegant in the eastern foothills of the green ridge mountains the insurrection really caught up with the army like his colleague jeremiah stafford was discovering that a diet of salt pork and hardtack left a lot to be desired to start with and went downhill in a hurry from there when the train stopped in the evening some soldiers pounded their hardtack crackers into crumbs and fried them in pork fat stafford tried that himselfonce he found that different and better meant two widely separate things he also found he hardly needed pipeweed the inside of the car in which he and newton and colonel sinapis traveled was smoky enough without pipes or cigars the derailments had broken several windows he supposed they were lucky all of them hadnt broken even as things were he feared he looked like the end man in a minstrel show the soot on his white shirtfront told him how much he was likely to have on his face the rasping coughs he let out every so often certainly warned him how much he had in his lungs iron squealed on iron and sparks flew up from the wheels as the locomotive driver braked as hard as he could what the deuce stafford said i wonder if some of our notquitefriends put something new on the tracks leland newton sounded pleased with his own cleverness colonel sinapis by contrast sniffed scornfully if they had any tactical sense they would have put the boulder or log or whatever it was around a bend in the track he said then the driver would not have been able to see it until he had no chance to stop but the insurrectionists did have tactical sense even if not of the sort balthasar sinapis had looked for as the train slowed they started shooting at it from the pines and redwoods to either side of the roadbed for a moment those bangs meant nothing to stafford but when a bullet punched through the side wall of the car and cracked past his head before drilling out the far side he figured things out in a hurry theyre firing at us he exclaimed more angry than frightened what do we do newton added for the sake of the country and for the sake of your own skins i suggest you get low and flatnow colonel sinapis said he couldnt give the two consuls orders they outranked him but his suggestion had the snap of what would have been a command it also seemed a very good idea no sooner had stafford got down than another bullet smashed through the space where he had been sinapis did not get down he drew his eightshooter and started banging away through one of the broken windows the reports only a few feet from staffords head stunned his ears lying beside him on the nonetooclean planks leland newton grimaced every time the colonel fired this is most undignified newton said among other things stafford agreed he wondered what would happen if they both got killed here he knew what the atlantean charter prescribed if both consuls died or abandoned their office for other reason the senate had to choose an interrex to serve as the chief executive till the next consular elections were held it had to choose him by a twothirds majority too the way the senate was divided these days stafford doubted whether jesus christ himself could win a twothirds majority of the conscript fathers which meant that if they both perished chaos would descend on the united states of atlantis worse chaos stafford amended as another bullet snarled by not nearly far enough above his prostrate frame if only one of them died here the other consul would serve alone till the next election stafford eyed newton and found his colleague eyeing him right back isnt it nice that were friends newton said wonderful stafford said in distinctly hollow tones his colleague laughed that the usa did not suffer a charter crisis lay to the credit of the armys junior officers and sergeants the cars in which they rode farther back were getting peppered with bullets too they rushed their grayuniformed soldiers out with fixed bayonets to drive the insurrectionists away a few of the soldiers went down as soon as they jumped from their cars the rest stolidly professional advanced into the woods regardless shouting as they went the firing kept on but it wasnt aimed at the train any more the rebels were shooting at the soldiers and vice versa stafford and newton got up again to watch colonel sinapis grunted that ought to shift them he said and it did when the soldiers came back some of them dragged rebel corpses by the feet one rebel they caught wasnt a corpseand then quite suddenly he was they brought out their own casualties too the surgeons attended to them as best they could consul stafford watched with greatif slightly nauseatedinterest his colleague might admire the rebels but these men sent to put them down would probably feel differently x down the west side of the green ridge mountains the train chugged slowly coughing a little leland newton peered out through the swirling smoke that belched from the locomotives stack well he said i did think we would get to new marseille faster than a horse can walk so did i consul stafford said fretfully balthasar sinapis coughed too a cough of correction newton judged not one caused by smoke as a matter of fact he said we are going at the speed a horse can trot so they were atlantean dragoons in their tall black felt hats trotted along to either side of the railroad track they had eightshooters shotguns and carbines their job was to keep the negroes and copperskins whod risen in these parts from attacking the train the foot soldiers inside the cars carried loaded weapons sinapis had made it plain he didnt like doing that but he recognized the need the dragoons had done their job up till now no more bullet holes marred the battered railroad cars no more screams rose as surgeons probed for musket balls newton missed them not at all but if the copperskins and negroes thought of themselves as the armys enemies as they seemed to wouldnt the soldiers in the army think of those negroes and copperskins the same way if that wasnt what consul stafford expected consul newton would have been astonished setting out from new hastings newton would have called staffords expectations so much foolishness the consul from croydon wasnt so sure now if a man was willing to lay his life on the line to try to kill you you werent going to love him on account of it no you were going to want to keep him away or else to do unto him before he could do unto you and if the soldiers got off the train with the notion that they needed to kill any slave who looked at them sideways firmly fixed in their heads they wouldnt be interested in interposing themselves between the rebels and the whites they were rebelling against no theyd want to join the local whites in slaughtering every insurrectionist they could catch stafford had clearly seen that from the beginning why didnt i newton wondered like a lot of northern foes of slavery hed tended to romanticize the men and women who were the victims of the institution it was much harder to romanticize someone who was trying to blow your head off you were much more likely to make someone like that into a demon there in the fortress of your mind maybe that was why stafford had foreseen so clearly what was coming he didnt suddenly need to turn the uprisen slaves to demons inside his head as far as he was concerned slaves who rose against their masters demonized themselves muttering to himself newton looked out through the swirling smoke again he could imagine that it was the veil of time and that he was looking back into the past the tall trees some of them with moss hanging from their branches the understory of squat barrel trees the ferns growing in green profusion below them the only signs of modernity were the railroad lineand the dragoons we might see a honker pulling up leaves somewhere he remarked i wonder if any honkers are left alive stafford said a few years ago that artist fellow set out from avalon to find some remember and he did too in some hidden mountain valley newton scratched his head what was his name anyhow audubon that wasnt consul staffordit was colonel sinapis a very fine artist indeed you know him newton asked in surprise imagining the fierce and dour sinapis with any interests beyond those of his sanguinary trade wasnt easy but he sighed now as he shook his head alas i did not have that privilegehe died last year no one could match his paintings of viviparous quadrupeds and especially of birds for their accurate vivacity no one came close even if honkers are no more they will still live for us in his portrayal of them i had not thought you such a friend of nature stafford said so the colonel had surprised him too time often hangs heavy in the ministry of war sinapis answered having a hobbyhorse to ride helps make the hours pass one of my colleagues translates chronicles from the medieval latin another has become an expert on the history of mining iron several drink or play cards me i prefer nature a career soldiers life in atlantis one more thing newton hadnt thought through the country had no serious foreign threats lying where it did how could it and the navy not the army would deal first with any threats that did appear in his time in europe colonel sinapis would have been used to adventure and upheaval sitting around gathering dust in the ministry of war couldnt have been easy for him no wonder hed found something besides soldiering to interest him well atlantis had its own share of adventure and upheaval now the navy couldnt do much about it either not unless the rebels came close enough to the waters edge to be bombarded by sea if any part of the national government was going to restore order it would have to be the small sleepy muchmaligned army can our soldiers do the job required of them consul newton asked the colonel if you and consul stafford tell me what the job is and stick with it they will do it whatever it may be sinapis answered they do not have much experience fighting but they are welldisciplined men you can rely on themif i know and they know what they must do if the two of you cannot make up your minds or if you change them more often than you change your drawers we shall have trouble he looked melancholy but then he usually looked melancholy he sounded melancholy too as if he expected they would have troubles but it was a peculiar kind of melancholy because he also sounded as if he was looking forward to whatever troubles they found leland newton had been looking forward to whatever troubles they found when he set out from new hastings he wasnt so sure any more jeremiah stafford had always been a man of the atlantic coast in that he was like most of his countrymen atlantis had been settled from the east and remained most densely populated on the coast facing england and the european mainland only one real cityavalonlay on the hesperian gulf and looked toward terranova new marseille gave itself airs but wasnt in the same league during the fight for freedom victor radcliff had marched an atlantean army through western atlantis to face the redcoats in new marseille the country on this side of the mountains had been a howling wilderness then now a lifetime later the pursuit of profits from cotton had turned much of it into an imitation of the plantations farther east much of it but not all here and there the wilderness still howled in stretches between plantations only the railroad line proved that anyone had come this way before ferns and barrel trees and conifers got dull in a hurry like consul newtonand no doubt like colonel sinapisstafford wondered if he would see a honker but he didnt even market towns were fewer and farther between on this side of the mountains than in the longersettled east but people turned out to cheer the soldiers whenever the train stopped for fuel and water stafford couldnt resist pointing that out to his colleague in the consulship well some people do leland newton allowed but i dont see any blacks or copperskins dancing in the streets and singing hosannas because weve come good god in heaven who cares about them stafford said white people made atlantis they did indeed on the backs of the colored people they fetched here to do the hard dirty work they didnt care to do themselves newton answered youre spewing that rubbish again stafford said if you think white people dont work in this country youve been walking around with your eyes closed without white men and their work and their capital slaves would have nothing to do this part of atlantis would be better off if it had been settled by small freeholders the way the lands farther north were newton said better off how pray stafford retorted would you rather come to this climate in a wool shirt and sweat and itch nine months of the year if you would by god youre welcome to it but i see you are wearing cotton instead the same as i am try growing cotton on one of your precious small freeholds it takes too much labor to make that possible i could wear linen in a pinch newton said in musing tones linen is tolerably cool or better than tolerably and it wrinkles if you give it a hard look and it costs far more than cotton doesall of which i have no doubt you understand perfectly well stafford said you are being difficult for the sake of being difficult i have no idea what youre talking about newton said stafford only snorted hed come to politics from the practice of the law just as his colleague had he knew a denial that wasnt a denial when he heard one while he and newton bickered colonel sinapis looked out the window the atlantean officer suddenly pointed there he said this is part of the trouble of the countryside this was a rude encampment alongside the railroad tracks tents and leantos sheltered white people who were dirty and wore ragged clothes a few of them waved to the train more just sat or sprawled where they were too apathetic to salute the men who had come to rescue them you see stafford rounded on newton and made the words an accusation this is what the insurrection does these poor innocents got away with their necks nothing more all they worked for through their lives is gone now yes its very sad the other consul said but that was at best a barbed agreement for newton went on they seem to have it as hard as the slaves did before the uprising the monstrous unfairness of that almost choked jeremiah stafford with rage every time you open your mouth all you prove is that you dont know what youre talking about any master who housed his slaves like that would get a quick talkingto from his neighbors or maybe a horsewhipping putting mudfaces and niggers in such miserable quarters would be begging for an insurrection i see newton said nodding wisely you house your slaves better than this for the sake of your own safety not on account of their comfort he doubtless thought that would make stafford angrier if so he was doomed to disappointment stafford only laughed at him and i suppose the factory owners in croydon pay their workers even one cent more than the least they could give while still keeping the workers alive we were talking about freedom and the freedom to starve not long ago if i recall rightly by leland newtons sour expression the other consul did we are not perfect paragons either newton said but we hire our workers labor we dont buy it and sell it our workers are free to starve in a different job if they dont like the one they have stafford interrupted that probably wasnt what newton had been about to say which didnt mean it wasnt true to change jobs as they please newton went on as if the other consul hadnt spoken they can move about as they please they can marry as they please and raise their own legitimate children they can watch them starve too you mean or waste away from consumption stafford shot back and who gives a damn whether mudfaces and niggers have legitimate children they do newton said do you suppose they enjoy it when the father is sold to one plantation the mother to another and the children maybe to a third jeremiah staffords snort was full of exasperation you have been reading sensational novels again that rarely happens and is always condemned when it does but the law allows it which is the point newton said only if you make it the point stafford replied and how often do women in croydon have to sell themselves on the streets to survive how often are the children they bear legitimate he laced the word with scorn by the way his colleague grimaced that happened more often than newton would have wanted before the other consul could answer colonel sinapis said whether these slaves are legitimate or not we are going to have to try to deal with them the two of you are in command here that plainly disgusted him but he couldnt change it he continued you had better figure out a way to work together because you will get my men killed and pretty likely yourselves with them if you go on like this you know what we need to do colonel stafford said i know what we need to do i think even consul newton knows what we need to do the question is is he willing to do it newton didnt say anything he did look like a man who knew what needed doing but whether what he knew was the same as what stafford knew was liable to be a different question leland newton eyed crocodile flats with distaste it was bigger than a village smaller than a town it had got carved out of the primeval atlantean wilderness on the banks of the little muddy river a name that struck newton as perfectly accurate once upon a time crocodiles had laid their eggs therehence the name now the crocodiles were gone a more deadly species raised its broods in crocodile flats a militia captain in homespun a broadbrimmed floppy hat all but covering his eyes told colonel sinapis you cant go no further by railroad its all niggers and mudfaces from here on out they have spread this far sinapis muttered to himself this is not what we were told when we left new hastings yeah well its so anyways the captain said can we force our way through the rebel pickets to get to the heart of the insurrection sinapis asked not by train you cant the militia captain answered he paused to spit a stream of pipeweed juice into the dust shifted a chaw to the other cheek and went on bastards have torn up as much track as they could god damn them to hell that wasnt colonel sinapisit was jeremiah stafford the news made his temper burst like a mortar bomb have they got any notion how much money theyre costing the usa why without a railroad connection new marseille will wither on the vine newton wasnt sure whether he meant the state or the town that gave it its name the town still had all its sea commerce of course the colored rebels werent likely to turn pirate and harry that a couple of hundred years before avalon had been a famous pirates roost but times were different now newton looked to sinapis and asked what do you recommend colonel that we disembark and advance sinapis answered high time we discover what we are up against i couldnt agree more consul stafford declared whether he agreed didnt matter today because it was newtons turn to command but tomorrow the southern man would lead unless newton marched east away from the little muddy they would go into action then in any case newton saw little point to putting things off a day very well he said prepare the advance as you think best colonel balthasar sinapis saluted crisply just as you say your excellency he turned away to start giving orders to his subordinates before he could the militia captain tugged at his sleeve youll want our men to go along wont you we know the countryside like you know the shape of your wifes well hell you know what i mean they may come if the prospect pleased sinapis he hid it very well but if they do they will find themselves under the command and under the discipline of the army of the united states of atlantis the captain shifted the wad of pipeweed from cheek to cheek again what does that mean exactly he asked to give you a basic example if they kill prisoners or torture them for the sport of it i shall hang them from the closest strong tree branch sinapis answered calmly is that plain enough or do you need further illustration but the captain broke off he might have said several different things but he wasnt stupid enough to imagine that any of them would have done him any good all right colonel have it your way well play along well play along till we dont think youll catch us so newton judged his meaning anyhow did sinapis judge it the same way newton expected he did the colonel might be a good many things but he was neither foolish nor naive the bridge across the little muddy remained in the militias hands they had pickets on the west side of the river those men seemed mighty glad to see regular atlantean troops come join them now we get down to business stafford said ferocious anticipation in his voice as newton and he crossed the plank bridge together so we dowhatever the business turns out to be newton said his shoes and staffords thudded on the timbers so did those of the soldiers they led the men broke step as they crossed lest rhythmic vibrations from marching in unison shake the bridge down it wasnt likely but it could happen they took no chances colonel sinapis sent picketssome militiamen others regularsout ahead of his main force and into the woods west of the river newton waited a little queasily for the sound of gunfire consul stafford looked to be waiting for the same thing and to be looking forward to it the more the army fought the insurrectionists the less inclined it would be merely to keep the peace a corporal came back to colonel sinapis theres a copperskin up ahead carrying a flag of truce sir he said what do we do about him sinapis looked a question to newton honor it newton said at once lets find out what they have to say stafford made a disgusted noise but he couldnt do anything about itnot today he couldnt anyhow the colonel told the corporal what to do the twostriper saluted and went off to do it he came back fifteen or twenty minutes later with a strong stocky copperskin who still carried his white flag newton had expected the rebels emissary to be wearing stolen white mens finery but he still had on homespun wool trousers and an undyed unbleached cotton shirt slave clothes my name is lorenzo the fellow said i speak for frederick radcliff the tribune of the free republic of atlantis there is no such place consul stafford exploded there is no such title and slaves havent got the right to last names there is such a place because thats where i come from frederick radcliff is the tribune there lorenzo answered calmly and hes not a slavehes a free man and so am i wouldnt be much point to talking if we werent would there what do you want what do you expect from us leland newton asked leave us alone and well do the same for you the copperskin said the free republic of atlantis is a place where anyone can live in peace a lot of whites have run away from us but they didnt need to as long as they dont try to make anybody into a slave any more we wont give them any trouble likely tell stafford jeered youve already killed a lot of people and done a lot of damage newton said why shouldnt we treat you as so many rebels and criminals because this is a war and wars mean fighting and fighting means killing lorenzo repliedthe same answer newton had given to stafford back in new hastings and because frederick radcliff is fighting for the same thing his grandfather fought for a long time agothe chance to be free mudfaces and niggers have no business being free stafford shouted his face purpling with fury easy jeremiah easy newton said he turned back to the rebels emissary you are not going to be allowed to form a nation apart from the united states of atlantis if you think that can happen you are only fooling yourselves your commander is only fooling himself by god thats the first sensible thing ive heard you say all day stafford told him newton ignored him if lorenzo was fazed he didnt let on nodding to the consul he said give us our rights inside the united states of atlantis then and well be happy enough to stay you have no more rights than a cow stafford said you have no more rights than a chair damn you what rights do you have in mind newton asked the emissary ignoring his colleague seemed best the same rights white folks have lorenzo answered the right to be free the right to a last name the right to marry and raise a family the right to buy and sell things the right to learn reading and ciphering frederick he can do that but not many slaves can the right to vote even you want to become citizens consul newton summed it up in a handful of words lorenzo nodded gratefully yes sir that is just what we want will you let the whites who have run away return to their land as long as they dont try to buy us or sell us or order us around the copperskin said some of us want land of our own too so we can farm if the white folks take everything back nothings left for us stafford clapped a hand to his forehead theyre as red as the crazy radicals in paris they probably preach free love too you werent listening newton said he told you one of the things they wanted was the right to get married yes he said that stafford answered why do you believe him theyre full of savage animal lust lorenzo stretched out his arm and looked at his hand then his eyes went to staffords hand my skin is darker than yours he said but it is lighter than frederick radcliffs past that i do not see much difference between us no eh well you will stafford said tell your principal that if you put down your guns and petition peaceably for the redress of grievances something may come of it newton said it is hard for atlantis to talk with men in arms against us this time the copperskin looked stafford in the face he shook his head if we put down our guns you will slaughter us he said stafford didnt waste time denying it lorenzo went on better we should fight if you do we will slaughter you anyway newton warned well you can try lorenzo said the corporal took him back past the pickets then you tried it your way see what it got you stafford said to newton you didnt help newton said let me understand colonel sinapis said it is to be war now for the moment yes newton answered regretfully war against slaves whod risen against their masters jeremiah stafford could imagine no more noble cause he must have done something right or god wouldnt have been so generous to him but it wasnt the kind of war hed had in mind when he set out from new hastings with the army the grayclad soldiers owned the ground where they marched but not another square foot of soil in the socalled free republic of atlantis any man who left the linesay to go behind some ferns and answer natures callwas liable not to come back again a negro with a dagger or a copperskin with a bayonet might cut his throat and sneak off with his rifle musket and boots any time the soldiers came within a quartermile of trees or ferns or fences or buildings they were in danger enemies would pop out or pop up fire and then run off as fast as they could the atlanteans would shoot back but it took uncommon marksmanship and uncommon luck to hit a single man at that range even if he didnt disappear firing at large masses of soldiers the mudfaces and niggers had much better luck no it wasnt the way stafford had imagined it in his minds eye hed seen dramatic pitched battles like the ones victor radcliff had fought against the redcoats paintings of thoseor woodcuts sometimes colored copied from paintings of thosehung in every government building from the senate house down to the lowliest village post office he didnt suppose the actual battles were just like the paintings but the art gave him his most vivid notions of what war was like colonel sinapis didnt seem surprised at how things were going in charge of raw men like that i would fight the same way he said as the army encamped two evenings after crossing the little muddy why should they risk a big battle all the advantage would lie with us what better reason stafford said sinapis gave him a crooked smile and do you also look for your chicken to climb up onto your plate already fried your excellency well no the consul admitted then do not expect the enemy to do what is convenient for you sinapis said reluctantly stafford nodded all right i can see the sense in that how do we go about forcing the damned insurrectionists to fight on our terms then that is a better question balthasar sinapis plucked at his shaggy mustache in europe i would say the way to do this is to attack some place the enemy feels obliged to defend in europe why not here stafford said because i see no place in these parts that the enemy would feel he had to hold the colonel replied where is the capital of the socalled free republic of atlantis wherever frederick radcliff happens to be unless my guess is wrong where are the rebels manufactories as far as i know they have none this being so what position must they hold to the death he waited by all the signs he really wanted an answer stafford opened his mouth then closed it again when he realized he had no good one to give you see the difficulty sinapis said even more reluctantly stafford nodded again the atlantean officer continued do you intend that we should kill every negro and copperskin within the area the rebels claim if that is what it takes to put down the insurrection yes stafford said those who own these persons under current atlantean law would not thank you for destroying their property sinapis warned and what better reason to give the rebels still in the field to keep fighting instead of yielding he might be nothing but a damned foreigner but he was a shrewd damned foreigner slaveholders didnt want their human property destroyed they wanted it restored to them as far as stafford was concerned they hadnt thought things through how far will they be able to rely on slaves experienced in rebellion he asked would you trust such a man to shave your face colonel me not a bit of it sinapis answered but if a man can get no use from this form of property what point to having it it wasnt so simple house slaves had to be trusted they gave personal service and cooked if you couldnt be sure they wouldnt turn on you you couldnt keep them around field hands were different all you needed from them was work and even before the uprising overseers had had to watch their backs plantations could stay profitable after the insurrection but even if they did white planters lives on them would have to change colonel sinapis saw that clearly so did stafford we shall burn that bridge when we come to it the consul said after what he hoped wasnt too awkward a pause first we have to win this war one way or another if we lose it nothing else matters any more or do you disagree no your excellency sinapis answered as you say winning comes first maybe not even winning though will solve all our troubles here what do we do in that case worry about it after we win stafford said at once if we dont win well have a pile of other things to worry about will you tell me im wrong about that no sinapis said he does think im wrong about other things stafford realized angrily about what about slavery well the devil take him if he does by the map the gunston plantation lay only a couple of days march to the west leland newton had studied maps till he was sick of them what difference did they make if the enemy wouldnt stand and fight he didnt like thinking of the insurrectionists as enemies but he couldnt think of people whod shot at him as friends this stretch of countryside had belonged to the rebels till the atlantean army marched in to reclaim it signs of that were everywhere big houses stood empty doors gaping open and smashed windows said theyd been plundered every so often the army would march past one that had burnt to the ground fields went untended ripening maize and wheat stood forgotten so did acres and acres of cotton and pipeweed no livestock was in sight even if surviving white plantation owners reclaimed this land they would have lost a fortune consul stafford couldnt open his mouth without going on about that consul newton didnt need long to get sick of listening to his colleague you didnt care while whites were taking everything away from blacks and copperskins he pointed out why do you bellow so loud when the shoe is on the other foot because i am a white man damn it stafford snapped and so are you if you take the time to remember it the united states of atlantis are a white mans country in case you hadnt noticed i thought we were a free mans country newton said mildly same thing stafford insisted come to croydon and youll see how wrong you are newton said if i came to croydon i would see all kinds of things i dont care to see free niggers and mudfaces screeching bluestockings trade unionists free lovers and every other sort of crackpot under the sun stafford said since i already know as much i have the sense to stay away before newton could come up with the retort that would leave the other consul gasping for air a brisk racket of gunfire broke out ahead i wonder what thats in aid of he said its a demonstration of patriotism stafford said what else would it be im sure the people shooting at our men would agree with you newton said i own myself surprised though that you of all people would say such a thing sometimes the worst thing you could do to sarcasm was take it literally this skirmish seemed sharper than the atlantean army was used to fighting maybe the insurrectionists held no vital strongpoints maybe they could melt off into the woods whenever they chose but they could also fight whenever they chose and they seemed to have chosen to fight here newton rode forward to get a better look at what was going on that made him a target something he didnt realize till he came close to the fighting when he did belatedly figure it out he wasnt sorry to dismount and hand the horses reins to an ordinary soldier he continued on foot as they usually did the rebels fought from the edge of a stretch of forest if things went wrong they could melt away in a hurry not only that but theyd dug themselves holes and trenches from which to shoot they made much smaller targets than they would have had they stood up and volleyed the way the atlantean regulars did a grizzled sergeant near newton knew exactly what he thought of that yellow dogs he growled the stub of a stogie shifting in his mouth as he spoke well we can shift em even if they want to play silly games soldiers went forward in neat lines every so often one would fall sometimes he would get up and stagger toward the rear on his own sometimes medical orderlies would carry him to the rear sometimes ominously he would lie where he fell not to rise again till judgment day those neat lines did not wash over the dugin rebels they couldnt get close not in the face of that galling musketry some men fell back others lay down themselves and returned fire then a flanking column went in off to one side of the insurrectionists line that shifted them where the frontal attack couldnt the negroes and copperskins saw they were about to get enfiladed they didnt wait around to let it happen but slid away into the woods and they kept on sniping at the men who came up to look at their trenches and the handful of bodies in them well we licked em an atlantean soldier said it was true newton thoughtbut only if you didnt count the cost xi rain on a cobblestoned road was a nuisance if you rode a horse you wore a broadbrimmed hat and an oilskin slicker to stay as dry as you could many of the roads east of the green ridge mountains were cobblestoned some were even macadamized traffic moved on them the year around jeremiah stafford was discovering that cobblestones and macadam were sadly scarce on the far side of the mountains one day no doubt they would come but that day was not yet and rain on a dirt road was not a nuisance rain on a dirt roadespecially the hard driving semitropical rain that pelted down nowwas a catastrophe what had been a perfectly ordinary perfectly decent perfectly respectable road turned into a long strip of something with a consistency between soup and glue foot soldiers swore as mud sucked boots off their feet cannon and limbers and supply wagons bogged down the foot soldiers had to shove them through the muck by brute force not surprisingly that made the men swear more on horseback consul stafford had it easier than most of the men in the atlantean army his mount struggled to move forward but it was doing the struggling he wasnt colonel sinapis also on horseback said something to him whatever it was stafford couldnt make it out the rain was coming down too hard eh the consul cupped a hand behind his ear when i was a subaltern we could not fight in weather like this sinapis said louder this time why not what makes the difference stafford asked percussion caps the atlantean officer answered a wet flintlock is nothing but a fancy clubmaybe a spear if you have a bayonet on the end of it but a percussion cap will still go off in the rain interesting how a mechanical device can change the way we wage war said stafford who hadnt dwelt on the idea before this always happens for sinapis such things fell within his area of professional competence if you doubt it ask the terranovan natives how much they have enjoyed opposing muskets with bows and arrows mmno doubt the next question is how well supplied with percussion caps are the damned insurrectionists stafford said better than i would have thought colonel sinapis said which was not what stafford wanted to hear sinapis continued they showed every sign of having plenty at the skirmish yesterday they fought quite well in fact their steadiness impressed me that was something else stafford didnt want to hear theyre nothing but lousy mudfaces and niggers he growled no man with a rifle musket in his hand is nothing but anything your excellency the officer warned no man who holds his ground till he sees himself outflanked and then draws back in good order is nothing but either sir you will get us in trouble if you think of the rebels as nothing but i want to get them in trouble stafford said angrily we havent had much luck with that have we balthasar sinapis looked up into the heavens a raindrop splashed on the end of his long nose if you can persuade god to ease this downpour your excellency you will have shown me something i did not know before even when the weather was good we didnt have much luck shifting the black bastards yes consul stafford was in a fine fury if that impressed sinapis the colonels face didnt know it this campaign is just beginning sir he said we will do some splendid thingsi am sure of it and we will have some terrible things done to us and to the rebels those will seem splendid such is war it shouldnt be war not against thesethese damned ragamuffins stafford protested it should be like oh cleaning up broken crockery never judge a soldier by the kind of uniform he wears or by whether he wears a uniform at all colonel sinapis said some of the most dangerous men i saw in europe looked like farmers they were farmers till they picked up the guns theyd hidden in barns and sties and pigeon coops after that you would have thought they were devils straight out of hell what happened to them stafford asked intrigued in spite of himself my men hunted them down and killed them the foreigner replied dispassionately we did perhaps too good a job that was one of the reasons i left that service and pledged my sword to atlantis too good a job what kind of howling wilderness had sinapis men left behind stafford didnt much care as long as the insurrectionists got what was coming to them nothing else mattered the rain came down harder stafford hadnt been sure it could with a little luck it would wash frederick radcliff and the rest of the insurrectionists out to sea but that was bound to be too much to hope for the consul began to hope the downpour wouldnt wash him and the atlantean army out to sea every once in a while a great storm would slam into southern atlantis savage winds would tear off roofs and sometimes blow down buildings the cyclones would roar inland till they finally weakened and petered out this wasnt one of those it wasnt blowing very hard at all it was just raining and raining and raining forty days and forty nights went through staffords mind for hundreds of years theologically inclined writers had wondered how noah had put atlantis peculiar natural productions aboard the ark and how those productions had ended up here and nowhere else that sort of writing seemed to have tapered off in recent times the consensus was that nobody knew except possibly god a junior officer came back to colonel sinapis from the vanguard stafford admired him moving against the tide had to be even harder than going with it the officer spoke to sinapis whatever he saidagain the drumming rain muffled it for the consulmade sinapis gnaw at his mustache stafford thought that a disgusting habit after gnawing the colonel dipped his head he might have been zeus in the iliad which stafford remembered from his college days he said something to the junior officer who looked relieved and sloshed forward again at last sinapis condescended to explain we stop here we cant go forward any more we will start killing animals if we do soldiers will start drowning too stafford said well so they will colonel sinapis cared about losing his men when they faced the rebels when it came to a downpour he seemed to worry more about his horses and mules stafford almost called him on it but the rain also drowned his urge for a brand new row even making camp wasnt easy tent pegs didnt want to stick in the soggy ground once up the tents leaked like billybedamned all soldiers were supposed to have oilskin groundsheets so they could sleep dry some had never been issued them some had thrown theirs away and even the ones who had them werent happy because muck slopped over the edges cooking hot foodeven boiling coffeewas impossible soggy hardtack made an uninspiring supper salt pork was next to indestructible but in weather like this it was liable to start getting moldy too staffords tent was bigger than the ones the soldiers used but no drier he sat inside glumly wondering what would happen if the insurrectionists chose this moment to attack colonel sinapis had posted sentries all around but so what how much could they see and who would hear them if they yelled a warning then stafford thought if the rebels do attack now theyll go over their heads in goo and good riddance to them he felta littlebetter someone tugged at the tent flap leland newton may i come in the other consul asked why not everything else has gone wrong stafford said heh newton ducked inside and let the tent flap fall behind him with a wet dismal splat you should take your comic turn on the stage youd make more than atlantis pays us comic turn did you think i was joking i am not glad to see you stafford said nor am i enamored of you believe me but we are in harness together like it or not newton said and one day soon evidence to the contrary notwithstanding this army will start moving forward again evidence to the contrary notwithstanding indeed stafford muttered newton pulled out a flask here have a knock of this it may improve your outlook something ought to maybe im glad to see you after all stafford swigged barreltree rum kicked him in the teeth and flamed down his throat by god maybe i am are you glad enough to answer a question for me newton asked i dont know lets see stafford almost drank again but handed the flask back instead suppose the rebels decline pitched battles suppose they keep sniping and raiding and skirmishing as they have been doing are you ready to post thousands of soldiers in little garrisons all through these parts for the next twenty or thirty years to try to hold down the countryside if that is what it takes why not stafford said the terranovans do it on their frontiers to keep the copperskins from sneaking in and detaching peoples hair it will cost us dear newton warned what do you suppose not stopping the insurrectionists will cost us stafford asked icily something newton said which surprised staffordhe hadnt expected the other consul to admit even that much newton went on change always costs something but dont you see we have to change either way i fear trying to hold down slaves in southern atlantis for the next generation will cost us our souls i think wed be fighting for themand for our backbones stafford said maybe youre right your excellency maybe but i wouldnt care to bet on it newton ducked back out into the rain leaving stafford alone the taste of barreltree rum still on his lips balthasar sinapis pointed up into the sky do you see that small bright yellow ball there squinting consul newton nodded i do colonel what of it if i remember rightly in the old country we used to call that the sun the craggy colonel did have a sense of humor leland newton wouldnt have bet a cent on it smiling to show he appreciated the joke he said how long do you think the roads will take to dry out enough to let us travel on them they probably should be good enough for us to use just before it starts raining again sinapis answered newton started to smile again then he realized the colonel wasnt joking this timemerely expressing his faith in the innate perversity of nature since newton had seen plenty of that perversity himself he decided he couldnt very well disagree all around them the encampment steamed that hot sun drew vapor up from the drenched canvas of the tents the grass and weeds and ferns on which those tents were pitched steamed so did horses backs and so did soldiers clothes every time newton inhaled he felt as if he were breathing soup as if picking that thought from his mind colonel sinapis remarked no one would say the state of new marseille has a mediterranean climate avalon farther north is said to be quite pleasant the year around newton replied sinapis only sniffed it would not be the same are you familiar with the notion of dry heat your excellency only by reading of it leland newton spread his hands atlantis is surrounded by the sea after all and i believe it is a positive good that she is her position has gone far toward making her rich no doubt sinapis said it has also gone far toward giving every citizen of this country rheumatism and lumbago or do your bones not creak when you get up of a morning till i came here mine never did he was talking about new hastings where hed spent the bulk of his atlantean military career the capital had a good climateor consul newton had always found it so it was certainly a better climate than chilly croydons but sinapis had different standards of comparison the colonel stuck a stogie in the corner of his mouth then he tried to strike a lucifer on the sole of his boot the boot sole was wet and the match wouldnt catch muttering an unpleasantry that wasnt in english sinapis pulled a small piece of shagreen from a tunic pocket he scraped the lucifer against that the rough sharkskin gave enough friction to touch off the match sinapis lit his cigar and puffed out pungent smoke to flavor the prevailing steam you are ready for anything newton said as the colonel put the shagreen back in his pocket i try to be sinapis answered if i may speak frankly though your excellency i was not ready for a war intended to be waged along political lines i do not see how any army or any officer could be ready for such a thing all wars are political wouldnt you say newton parried in their goals yes colonel sinapis said a clever modern german called war the extension of politics by other means i agree with this anyone who thinks about it is bound to agree i believe but when political affairs interfere with the way the war is fought it becomes less likely to have a happy result i believe anyone who thinks about it is also bound to agree with this newton didnt need to think much about it to decide it seemed quite likely all the same he said when the war touches slavery in the usa political affairs are bound to interfere half the country takes the institution for granted while the other half hates it we should count ourselves lucky not to have flown at one anothers throats do you expect this fight to solve your problems for you sinapis didnt sound as if he thought any fight could solve any problem i hope so expect may be too strong a word newton remained an optimist oh well by the way sinapis sounded he didnt what had he seen what had he done in europe to leave his attitude so curdled consul newton realized he didnt know the details of the colonels career before sinapis got to atlantis he hadnt cared enough to find out that might have been a mistake but asking now would seem awkward so he didnt in his own way consul stafford was an optimist too most atlanteansmost white atlanteans anyhowwere what were the united states of atlantis if not a place where a man could build on his hopes but staffords hopes were different from newtons the suns return prompted only one thought in him now we can go after the insurrectionists and finish them off he declared maybe the suns return prompted some thoughts among frederick radcliffs negroes and copperskins too they werent an army or werent exactly an army they could and did move around by ones and twos and small bands where colonel sinapis men wouldnt have felt happy or safe doing any such thing and they popped up here and there and started sniping at the atlantean soldiers one bullet snarled through the air between newton and stafford both consuls automatically ducked they exchanged sheepish looks almost everybody ducked it didnt mean a thing we ought to hang every black bastard we catch sneaking around with a musket stafford said after he straightened up that will really make the rebels want to give up newton observed i dont care whether they want to give up or not stafford said i want them dead i want the ones who are left alive to be afraid to lift their hands against their masters for the rest of their days i want the united states of atlantis to be safe for decent godfearing white people again you want things to go back to the way they were before the uprising started newton said yes that is what i want the other consul agreed how do you propose to get it though newton asked weve been over this ground before can you unscramble an egg can you make all the rain weve just had fall up into the sky the sun can dry out the rain stafford said stubbornly that makes it as if it had never been the sun of justice can dry out the insurrection too enough to let us get by he meant it he meant every word of it realizing as much alarmed leland newton but he knew it was so when pilate asked what is truth he didnt wait for an answer newton said now i ask you sir what is justice i will wait as long as need be for your reply justice is giving people what they deserve for what they have done jeremiah stafford sounded as stern and certain as the old testament prophet whose name he bore newton nodded we can take that for a beginning place what do people who have held other people in bondage for centuries deserve what do people they deserve thanks and congratulations stafford still sounded certain he had the courage of his convictions compare the lot of those bondsmen here with that of their savage cousins in terranova and africa and you will see that i speak the truth i had not finished newton said what do people who buy and sell other human beings at a whim who take the fruits of others labor who violate their bondswomen whenever it strikes their fancywhat do those people deserve what do people who christianize the heathen who build a thriving country out of empty wilderness who make the united states of atlantis into the earthly paradisewhat do those people deserve stafford returned we are talking about the same people you know what justice is depends in some measure on the angle from which you view it well i would agree with you there newton said you have a perspective different from mine about the planter class i know them you dont stafford said let it be as you say newton told him stafford raised an eyebrow he hadnt expected even so much of a concession consul newton went on what you will not see is that we also have a differing perspective on the rebels you think of them as murderous bloodthirsty wild beasts which they are stafford broke in to you perhaps newton replied to me they look more like men and women who having been treated intolerably for generations seek liberty so these abuses cannot go on they seem very much like proper atlantean patriots in other words even if their skins be dusky that is a madmans perspective the other consul exclaimed oh piffle you know better do i caper do i gibber newton said you do not as you must know but you are more dangerous not less because you do not stafford answered an obvious lunatic ends up in jail or an asylum where he can do others no harm a lunatic who is not so obvious will deceive many others and persuade them to follow him what is the name of that maniac minister which one newton asked atlantis permitted all faiths which meant strange ones sometimes sprang up in the backwoods like weeds most flourished for a while and faded but some seemed likely to last longer the fellow who founded thewhat do they call itthe house of universal devotion stafford said i know there are others but hes the one i had in mind oh him well we have agreed twice in a few minuteshow strange i think hes a maniac too newton said the house of universal devotion was indeed a backwoods sect one with an unsavory reputation people who didnt belong to it claimed that far too much of the devotion went to the founder far too little to the lord members kept to themselves as much as they could there were rumors some of the rites were licentious even lewd newton didnt know if those rumors were true but he wouldnt have been surprised something else he didnt know i cant tell you what his name is he goes by the reverend or the preacher if i came out with nonsense like that i wouldnt want my real name associated with it either stafford said people listen to him newton said he doesnt seem to do much harm that was as far as he would go to praise the house of universal devotion it was too far to suit jeremiah stafford the devil the other consul snapped the only reason you say that is he rants against slavery along with his other ravings that he does should make you ashamed to hold the same views even a broken clock is right twice a day newton said that clock ought to be smashed not broken stafford said if the sect provably violates the laws or if we find good reason to set aside the charter no doubt it will be newton said until and unless that happens tolerance seems the better policy you will tolerate a tumor on the atlantean body politic which wants only growth before it can extinguish the charter but an institution long sanctioned by our laws that you oppose stafford sounded bitter as wormwood consul newton hadnt thought of things in such a light uncomfortably he said the reverend and his followers do not harm others not where they get caught stafford retorted slavery does newton went on as if his colleague had not spoken that is why i oppose it and why so many in the north do servile insurrection must be checked newton waved to the soldiers all around well here we are what are we doing if not trying to check it they were doing more along those lines than hed had in mind when they set out from new hastings whatever were doing its not enough stafford plucked at his whiskers i wonder if we have any weakminded house of universal devotion men in this army if we do i shouldnt be surprised to hear that they were discovering our plans to the niggers and mudfaces that hadnt occurred to newton he wanted to say the other consul would be hearing voices next he wanted to but discovered he couldnt what stafford had suggested might be unlikely but it was far from impossible what did come out of his mouth was we shall have to find out about that yes we shall even the soft answer failed to satisfy stafford we should have done it a long time ago maybe we would have had you suggested it then newton said if you bring it to colonel sinapis attention i am sure he will handle it he does not favor slavery stafford said darkly newton wondered why that surprised the other consulfew immigrants did stafford scowled but then he unbent enough to add he will not care for the house of universal devotion either it is destructive of good discipline something else on which we agree leland newton said we may have more in common than either of us would have believed so we may but so what stafford had no more give to him than the rocks of north cape we also know where we disagree and we know which carries the greater weight i am not your enemy newton said you mistake me if you judge me so you are the enemy of things i hold dear however stafford replied you oppose me there and i will oppose you to see those things strengthened and protected i do not see how we can make a friendship of that neither did consul newton however much he might have liked to jeremiah stafford scowled at lorenzo the copperskinned emissary from the free republic of atlantis stared back impassively whatever lorenzo was thinking he didnt tell his face about it a useful quality in an envoy only the flag of truce he carried kept stafford from ordering him seized and hanged from the closest tree the consul was tempted to do it despite the white flag here i am again now you start to see you cant hope to beat us lorenzo said even his voice grated on staffords nerves he talked like what he was a slave and likely a field hand at that a pig in an archbishops robes would have made a more unlikely diplomat than lorenzo but only a little we havent seen anything of the kind stafford growled if your precious frederick radcliff is such a wonderful general why doesnt he come out and fight instead of skulking around like a coward lorenzo still didnt change expression though something might have flickered in his eyes if you are such a wonderful general consul stafford why dont you make him come out and fight when he doesnt want to beside stafford leland newton snickered then tried to pretend he hadnt colonel sinapis coughed which might have been even more embarrassing staffords ears felt ready to burst into flame he couldnt even show his fury lest he hand lorenzo another point that he ground out can be arranged so you say your excellency by his tone lorenzo didnt believe a word of it i also say you deserve lashes for your insolence stafford told him lorenzo only shrugged if you want i will take off my shirt and show you my stripes i have tasted the lash before have you no and i have not deserved it either stafford said oh deserved lorenzos face might not show much but he had an expressive voice well i did not deserve my whippings either but that did not stop the overseer and many of the people in the free republics army will tell you the same story that is why we keep fighting that is why you will never make us give up no matter what in a pinch killing the lot of you will do stafford said the copperskin started to laugh then he took another look at staffords face and thought twice he hadnt realized stafford might mean it after a considerable pause he said well you can try giving us the freedom we want the freedom we deserve would come cheaper though you dont think you have earned punishment for your insurrection punishment for your treason stafford asked your excellency any man with stripes on his back who does not rise up against the folk who gave them to him deserves punishment for not having any balls lorenzo said that is how it seems to me and i have tasted the lash let us be free men and citizens and we will trouble you no more say we have no right to that and we will fight you forever go fight then because we will do just that stafford said you say so now will you say so in five years time or ten or fifteen without waiting for an answer lorenzo raised his flag of truce and strode away from the white men who led the army opposing him you should know you were speaking for yourself there consul newton told stafford certainly not for me and i would say not for the atlantean government either well so what stafford said today is my day in command you let that lorenzo get above himself when it was your turn high time the insurrectionists understand that we will not put up with their insolence and whether i speak for the government of atlantis or not you may rest assured that i do speak for the government of every state with a servile population this kind of thing cannot be allowed to spread or it will consume us all he turned to colonel sinapis we ought to shadow that rogue of a lorenzo see where he goes with any luck at all he will lead us straight to frederick radcliff if we take off the insurrections head the body ought to die interesting you should say so your excellency sinapis answered i tried it the last time he called i lost two men and gained nothing the rebels may be many different things but naive they are not oh stafford said on a deflated note too bad it would not have worked in europe sinapis said here i thought perhaps the enemy is not so clever so i might learn something worthwhile but no he spread his hands as if to say what can you do what stafford wanted to do was dispose of every slave who had risen he still wasnt convinced it was impossible the will was thereor it would be if it wouldnt cost the slaveowners so dear the means were the harder part he found out just how hard it might be a couple of days later to his surprise and even more to his dismay he found out not from consul newton or colonel sinapismen hed come to see as obstacles in his own pathbut from a messenger who galloped in out of the east the news the man brought was particularly unwelcome the slave uprising had broken out in earnest behind the army the railroad line over the green ridge mountains was cut no supplies would get through any time soon balthasar sinapis long face got even longer when he heard that he said several choice things in english then several more that sounded even juicier in what seemed like three or four other languages once the thunder and lightning stopped crashing down he said this presents us with a serious problem two serious problems in fact food and munitions if the goddamned insurrectionists can live off the countryside so can we consul stafford declared but they have already been living off this countryside for some little while sinapis said that makes it more difficult for us to do the same hard to get more meat off bones the vultures have already picked clean consul newton agreed vultures is right stafford snapped thats just what they are and high time you admitted it too having put the consul from croydon in his placeor so it seemed to himhe gave his attention back to the colonel we have enough ammunition to keep fighting dont we for a while sinapis answered dubiously if we should run dry without getting any more in that case our troubles get worse translated into english that means we get massacred shortly thereafter doesnt it newton asked put in his place he might be but he refused to stay there colonel sinapis didnt tell him he was wrong either of course that was because consul stafford beat him to the punch oh rubbish the insurrectionists are bound to run dry before we do and if we arent better men with bayonets in our hands then something is dreadfully wrong with the way the drillmasters train our soldiers he turned back to sinapis againno he rounded on him this time or will you tell me im wrong youd better not his voice warned and colonel sinapis didnt no both those points hold considerable truth he said then why were you panicking a moment ago stafford asked i was not the officer replied with dignity i would be remiss in my duty if i did not point out difficulties he was right which didnt make stafford love him any better growling deep in his throat the consul said well sir things being as they are what do you recommend we do march for the town of new marseille colonel sinapis answered at once we establish a secure base and we secure a supply route by seaall the more important now that the land route has failed we also prevent the insurrectionists from seizing the place which would be a disaster for us he was right again leland newton promptly nodded even stafford could find nothing to quarrel at not this time he nodded too very well he said and we should do that as quickly as we can before the niggers and mudfaces hereabouts find out whats happened farther east and try to steal a march on us assuming they dont already know newton said yes assuming stafford contrived to make the innocent word sound more than a little obscene all right your excellencies for once we find ourselves in complete accord if only we did not require misfortune to cause it sinapis said he waved to his junior officers who stood in a knot off to one side waiting to learn what had happened after their commander explained they seemed no happierwhich was putting it mildly sweet suffering jesus one of them exclaimed were supposed to push the savages around they arent supposed to push us war is not about what is supposed to happen captain colonel sinapis replied in tones so wintry they should have frozen the subtropical landscape all around war is about what does happen and about responding to it as best one can eryes sir the captain said that was one answer that was never out of place not even consul stafford could complain about the way sinapis and his officer corps got the men moving the soldiers grumbled and swore but soldiers always grumbled and swore they marched along the muddy roads which was what mattered and the insurrectionists did not seem inclined to do more than harry them maybe that meant frederick radcliff didnt aim to attack new marseille himself stafford hoped so anyhow xii more hard rain further slowed the armys march to new marseille even after the soldiers got there leland newton reminded himself new hastings would be a while learning of their misfortune a ship or a land traveler would have to carry the news the rebels had proved much too good at cutting telegraph lines all the southern ones seemed to be out maybe a working line still ran from new marseille up to avalon even if one did it wouldnt help much thered been talk of stringing wires from new hastings to avalon but it hadnt happened yet frederick radcliffs irregulars kept sniping at the atlantean soldiers rain or no rain the reports said the damned insurrectionists somehow got their hands on proper percussion pieces jeremiah stafford grumbled why couldnt they have been wrong for once it could be worse newton said of course it could the other consul said they could have got their hands on a couple of batteries of field guns too wouldnt that be delightful newton thought how hed like to be on the receiving end of a cannonade now that you mention it no he answered he might sympathize with the downtrodden negroes and copperskins but not enough to lay his life on the altar in expiation for generations of white mens sins and then just as hed said it could it proceeded to get worse first one soldier and then several more came down with yellow fever that did nothing to improve the morale of the men who managed to escape it a good number of them were down with a bloody flux of the bowels it was less dramatic than the yellow jack which didnt mean it was a sickness anyone would want a few men trickled away colonel sinapis responded by setting out even more sentries than he was already posting desertions slowed though they didnt quite stop newton suspected more soldiers would have tried skedaddling had they not feared what might happen if the rebels caught them god in heaven stafford said the way things are going i wonder whether we deserve to win ive wondered all along newton said drawing an irate glare from his colleague colonel sinapis looked at things from a different angle you must remember your excellencythese are green troops he told stafford many of them have been in the army for years and years but they are green anyhow because whom has atlantis fought in all that time instead of reacting to the obvious justice of the comment stafford only muttered whom as if he were a grammatical owl accusative case is it not sinapis said english is not my native tongue but i do not care to make mistakes using it you were accurate newton assured him you were more accurate than many people who grew up speaking english would have been oh one of those colonel sinapis said every language has them i suppose they are like ambushes set in place to trap the unwary a breeze from off the hesperian gulf blew the rain clouds to the east it brought with it the scent of the sea newton was familiar with that sharp salt tang of course he couldnt very well not be not when hed spent most of his life in croydon and new hastings but he thought the hesperian gulf smelled fresher than the ocean off the east coast of atlantis it probably was no coincidence that less sewage went into the gulf than into the ocean off the east coast a sentry rode back to the army and said looks like theres a bunch of spooks and coppers laying for us up ahead can we give them a surprise for a change consul stafford asked i command today newton said pointedly do you not wish to surprise the enemy colonel sinapis asked him part of him wanted to say yes if he did he could get away with itfor the day sooner or later though the news would get back to new hastings odds were it would get back in whatever distorted form stafford chose to use and newton had discovered he liked getting shot at no better than any other human being not without reluctance he replied proceed as you think best colonel maybe you are smarter than you look stafford said after a salute that might have come from a clockwork mechanism sinapis conferred with the scout then he sent a cavalry screen forward to keep the insurrectionists from getting a good view of anything else he was doing with luck the flanking party that hurried off to the right would do unto the enemy what he wanted to do unto the atlantean army with luck the thought brought newton up short the soldiers hadnt had much not so far in this campaign he didnt need to wait long for another lesson on the dubious joys of being the target of flying lead the rebels lurking among the ferns at the edge of a stand of hemlocks opened up on the atlanteans from cleverly concealed positions those positions didnt stay concealed for long of course when a rifle musket went off it spat a long tongue of fire and a cloud of blackpowder smoke rose above the man whod fired if anyone ever invented gunpowder that didnt smoke hed make a fortune nobodyd come close to doing it yet return fire colonel sinapis shouted quite a few of his men had already started shooting back without orders they marched with loaded weapons something they wouldnt do in anything but the most dangerous country two or three atlantean soldiers fell screams rang out one man though went down like a dropped rag doll shot through the head hed never get up again as they had more than once before the atlanteans in gray advanced on the ragged negroes and copperskins harrying them before long the rebels would slide back into the woods and disappear then the whole miserable process would start over a few miles farther down the road that was what the rebels thought anyway it was how things had worked out the last time they tried this stunt and the time before that it wasnt how things worked out today as the copperskins and blacks started their withdrawal the flanking column hit them a great thunder of musketry from their leftthe atlantean armys rightannounced the collision thatll shift them colonel stafford yelled the biter bitand lets see how the sons of bitches like being on the receiving end by all the signs the rebels liked it not a bit that didnt surprise leland newton in war more than perhaps in anything else it was better to give than to receive now that the rebels had to fight the flanking party they couldnt simply fade away the main body of the atlantean army got into the scrap at close quarters the soldiers had a lot of pentup rage to vent thinking about that newton turned to balthasar sinapis colonel dont you think you ought to order your men to take prisoners he said why stafford yelped as if hed proposed requiring the soldiers to start practicing some unnatural vice newton looked at him if you have learned the art of interrogating corpses your excellency i hope you will be good enough to acquaint the rest of us with it you mock me sir by the way stafford said it his seconds would confer with newtons at any moment to arrange the terms and time of the duel the code duello wasnt dead south of the stour so maybe that was exactly what he had in mind whether he did or not newton didnt dont be a bigger blockhead than you can help he said which made stafford gape he went on youve been mocking me since before we left new hastings have you seen me take offense some people are more sensitive to slights than others stafford said but his heart didnt seem to be in the quarrel any more newton looked back to colonel sinapis prisoners he prompted yes yes the point is well taken sinapis gave orders to a captain and sent the junior officer forward to convey them to the troops then he sighed i hope they will heed him that hadnt occurred to newton when he thought of an order he thought of its being obeyed without fail but men and all their works were imperfect what ever happened without fail some captured rebels might have got shot or bayoneted there in the woods with no one but angry atlantean soldiers to see the job done this was one of those places where asking too many questions didnt look like the best idea in the world all the same the soldiers did lead out more than a dozen disgruntled rebels most with their hands tied behind them a few with nooses already around their necks we ought to smoke them over a slow fire stafford said that would give us what we need to know and in a hurry too in my experience torturing prisoners is usually more trouble than it is worth colonel sinapis said not always and not in all circumstances but usually a better way is to question them separately telling each man his answers will be compared to those of the others anyone whose answers do not match his friends will know he is to be singled out for punishment this has proved a good way to get at the truth it struck consul newton as a good way to get at the truth too lets do that then he said eagerly too eagerly he wondered maybe so but he had no stomach for tormenting captives and even jeremiah stafford gave a grudging nod we can try it he said first sinapis carefully instructed the men he told off to question the captives chances were he didnt think theyd be gentle without careful instruction chances were he was right too do we keep moving toward new marseille newton asked him or do we wait to see what we find out if we can strike at the heart of the uprising had he just said that damned if he hadnt stafford neither sneered at him nor clapped him on the back that other consul left him to stew in his own juices that was liable to mean stafford was cleverer than newton had given him credit for one more worrisome thought among so many others i dont know your excellency you are the commander today colonel sinapis long face showed what he thought of atlantean practice it certainly had some flaws the framers of the charter hadnt thought of the colonel continued i am here as i understand my position to put your orders and those of consul stafford into effect as long as i am doing that i may legitimately give orders of my own otherwise those orders lie outside my region of responsibility his fleshy nostrils quivered no he didnt like atlantean arrangements even a cents worth i am not asking you for orders colonel newton said as diplomatically as he could i am asking for your opinion for your professional judgment ah my opinion that i am certain is worth its weight in gold sinapis could be formidably sardonic in a language not his own my opinion your excellency is that it is better to put out a fire while it is still small because dousing one after you let it get bigger will be much harder newton glanced over at jeremiah stafford again his colleague failed to rise to the bait newton wondered whether something was wrong with him he had the perfect chance to tax newton for not letting the army move soonerand didnt use it such restraint seemed out of character or maybe stafford was letting events bludgeon newton even if in the abstract you admired someones cause it was much harder to feel lovingkindness toward him after hed almost killed you newton had had that thought before it came home to roost again he deliberately turned his back on the other consul staffords soft chuckle said he had much too good an idea of what newton was thinking ignoring it newton addressed colonel sinapis you want to go after frederick radcliff then if we find the chance i do sinapis dipped his head which he seemed to do more often than not in place of nodding newton thought again of zeus in the iliad sinapis made a mournful bedraggled excuse for a greek god well what these days was so fine as it had been once upon a time the officers figure of speech wasnt greek at all maybe we can put the genie back into the bottle after all do they tell that story in atlantis newton had heard it or read it though he couldnt remember where or when stafford did ali baba and the forty thieves he said and colonel sinapis dipped his head again the other consul added ali baba may be stuck in the arabian nights but believe me the thieves made the crossing here ahead of you it would not surprise me sinapis said i have never found a place where thieves did not make the crossing perhaps heaven is such a place perhaps not too a long pause we shall pursue frederick radcliff then given that chance we shall newton and stafford said together they eyed each other suspiciously newton couldnt guess which of them that agreement bothered more colonel sinapis looked most dubious as he peered up from the ground at jeremiah stafford on horseback are you sure you must ride with them your excellency he asked in tones that couldnt have meant anything but are you out of your mind your excellency but stafford nodded youd best believe i am colonel if theyif wecatch the rebel i can make sure he gets whats coming to him on the spot a written order carried by the commander of the raiding party would accomplish the same thing sinapis said no doubt but i would not see it happen stafford said the colonel sighed have it your way then you will anyhow i cannot give you ordersonly suggestions still if you slow down the men with whom you ride you will make them less likely to do what you most want done flicked on his vanity stafford said i wont slow them down he hadnt been riding long before he wondered if hed told sinapis the truth the raiders were mostly young bandylegged and small they spoke in gleeful obscenities and they seemed to think the presence of an atlantean consul was the funniest thing theyd ever run into if i was back in the real world one of them said to him id think holding slaves was the wickedest thing a man could do the troopers accent proclaimed him a northern man from hanover or possibly croydon the real world stafford waved the ferns and grass and hemlocks and barrel trees all around seemed real enough to him and then some what do you call this this here the cavalryman thought the question was pretty funny too your excellency this here is fucking nowhere with a capital n his friends on horseback nodded they thought it was fucking nowhere too and they had a point the only work of man in sight besides the narrow road that might have started its career as a honker track was a ruined tumbledown shack stafford didnt think the insurrection was the reason it was empty by the look of it nobodyd lived in it for the past twenty years how do you feel about slaves rising up and killing their lawful masters stafford asked how do you like it when they try to kill you and your friends on account of somethings lawful that dont make it right the young soldier answered but the other part of that there youll have to wait a while before you find the next fella who tells you hes only happy when some goddamned son of a bitch is shooting at him again the other cavalrymen nodded consul stafford would have been hardpressed to tell the northern man he was mistaken the captain leading the detachment glanced down at something in his handa sketch map stafford supposed but for the gold braid on his hat and the three stars on each side of his collar he looked little different from his men not much older than they were either we swing in here he said pointing down an even narrower track toward the dark woods ahead lousy rebels are in there we pitch into em from the flank drive em off and snatch the shitheel who tells em what to do stafford couldnt place him by the way he talked maybe hed come from england or ireland when he was young he didnt seem hesitant about what they were doing anyhow that was good an officer who didnt believe in the cause for which he was fighting could easily contrive to botch his mission while making the failure look like an accident as soon as they got to the edge of the woods the captain told off horseholders to tend to the other mens mounts he didnt choose very many which pleased stafford he wanted to get as many soldiers as he could into the fight they plunged into the woods some of the cavalrymen carried carbines others had eightshooters at the ready stafford had a revolver himself a carbine or a rifle musket could easily outrange it in a forest where you couldnt see past pistol range though so what and with eight bullets in the cylinder he could put a lot of lead in the air in a hurry if he had to would the insurrectionists even bother posting sentries on their flanks copperskins and negroes were notoriously lazy and shiftless so stafford wouldnt have been surprised if they didnt but that thought had hardly crossed his mind before somebody let out a startled whos there the atlantean army and the lord jehovah the captain answered stealing a line one of victor radcliffs officers had used a lifetime earlier well shit the enemy lookout exclaimed if the redcoats had said anything like that in response to the atlanteans long ago it hadnt got into the history books it probably wouldnt get into the history books now the shooting started a couple of seconds later shooting would make the books shooting always did bullets cracked past people they slammed into tree trunks they whispered through the undergrowth cutting leaves and fronds as they went and a few of them smacked into soft flesh shrieks rose up along with the shots and the fireworks smell of gunpowder smoke something up ahead moved jeremiah stafford thought it did anyway he squeezed the trigger the revolver bucked and roared in his hand maybe he drilled a vicious negro right between the eyes and dropped him to the forest floor before he could even blink or maybe hed wasted a bullet on ferns stirred by a vagrant breeze unless he tripped over a corpse on his way forward hed never know on the terranovan mainland they called something like this a copperskin fight both sides hid behind trees and shot at each other as they tried to move the savages on the western mainland used bows and arrows too silent unnerving weapons the copperskins here banged away like their black brethren so did the atlantean cavalrymen they still had the advantage of surprise and tried to make the most of it frederick radcliff was in there somewhere the faster they could grab him the better when stafford ran forward his shoes sank into the ground his feet felt wetwater was leaking in almost without his noticing the hemlocks and pines were giving way to mossdraped cypresses a flapjack turtle stared at him out of cold yellow eyes from a puddleone of too many puddles that suddenly seemed to appear out of nowhere sweet suffering jesus he exclaimed were in a swamp the cavalrymen had made the same unwelcome discovery at about the same time their complaints were even more heartfelt and much more profane stafford started swearing too though he was an amateur alongside virtuosos it might have been funny if it werent so revolting this whole mission had been predicated on speed and surprise surprise was gone shot dead by an alert sentry as for speed how could you do anything in a hurry with mud trying to suck the shoes off your feet and maybe trying to suck you down into it another maybe crossed staffords mind maybe the insurrectionists leader wasnt so foolish to base himself in a place like this maybe he wasnt so foolish period that might have made the consul wonder whether negroes and copperskins generally were as foolish as hed always thought it might have but it didnt instead it made him decide that frederick radcliff had his grandfathers blood in him all right those lying poxed the captains furious voice broke off as if he couldnt find anything bad enough to say about the people he had in mind whoever they were that came a moment later when he tried again nobody said anything about this being a goddamned mudhole back in the atlantean camp the captured insurrectionists would no doubt claim their captors hadnt asked them the right questions technically stafford supposed theyd be telling the truth all the same he couldnt help wondering what would have happened had the soldiers hurt them a little or more than a little to make sure they werent withholding it couldnt very well have turned out worse snake a trooper wailed on a rising note of horror lousy snake just bit me that gave stafford one more thing to worry about not what he needed at such a crowded moment frederick radcliff the captain shouted come out and surrender frederick radcliff a chorus of voices told him what he could do with his surrender their curses showed more ingenuity than consul stafford would have expected from such a pack of colored riffraff go after them stafford called the more noise the more insurrectionists and the more likely we are to catch our man he wondered whether they would know their man even if they caught him what exactly did frederick radcliff look like who would bother painting a slaves portrait nobodyno money in it and the leader of the uprising wasnt likely to have sat stockstill for a newfangled photograph either stafford pictured frederick radcliff as looking like his famous grandfather only with dark skin and kinky hair that might be right or it might not he wasnt sure within twenty years how old the jumpedup slave was that might make things harder too but much harder stafford didnt think so some judas among the insurrectionists would give their leader away if he saw him maybe the copperskin or black wouldnt do it on purpose an involuntary gasp of surprise would serve well enough though and then frederick radcliff would dance on air or face a firing squad or suffer whatever other lethal fate his captors decided upon and then what would the insurrection quietly fold up and fail because the man who started it got what was coming to him stafford hoped so that was why the raiding party had come here after all but what would happen if someone elsethat damned arrogant lorenzo saykept things going even after frederick radcliff was dead and gone what would happen farther east where slaves were rising up even though chances were theyd barely heard of frederick radcliff stafford muttered under his breath it wasnt a happy kind of muttering the closer he looked at the insurrection the worse it seemed back in new hastings hed thought everything was simple sally forth slaughter the insurrectionists and march home in triumph he hadnt imagined the uprising was like the hydra sprouting two heads for each one you chopped off but just because he hadnt imagined it back in new hastings that didnt mean it wasnt so to make matters worse the enemy must have heard his well intentioned advice to the cavalrymen the negroes and copperskins started making a racket first here then there then somewhere else anyone who tried following the trail of noise would be chasing a willothewisp panting his heart pounding stafford thought sinapis was right damn him i am too old for this he pushed through the ferns anyhow maybe he would stumble over frederick radcliff maybea bigger unlikelihood however little he cared to admit it to himselfhe would recognize the rebel leader if he did stumble over him or maybe something else worthwhile would happen something else did happen worthwhile or not the green curtain in front of him parted a negro carrying a musket he must have stolen off a planters wall was also hurrying forward they stared at each other in mutual shock and horror for a split second the dapper middleaged white man and the young black in filthy ragged clothes then after simultaneous gasps they both raised their guns and fired and they both missed they couldnt have been ten feet apart but they missed anyhow the twin shots and the crack of the insurrectionists bullet darting much too close past staffords ear all but stunned the consul the negro looked as desperately unhappy as stafford felt but they were in different situations it would take the insurrectionist at least half a minute to reload and fire another round all jeremiah stafford had to do was pull the trigger the black man figured that out in an instant had he been the naturalborn coward stafford assumed him to be because he was a negro he would have thrown himself down in the thick undergrowth or tried to run away instead he clubbed his musket and rushed at the consul stafford did fire again he didnt miss this time the bullet caught the insurrectionist just to the left of the middle of his chest stafford couldnt have placed it any better aiming at a target with all the time in the world to shoot when you shot somebodyespecially when you hit him right where you wanted toyou expected him to fall over stafford had done enough hunting to know that deer didnt always fall over as soon as you shot them hed thought it would be different with people though for one thing no deer ever born had tried to smash in his skull with a reversed musket he ducked the stroke that would have scrambled his brains then he fired yet againand hit the negro yet again the man still didnt fall over though he did grunt in surprise and pain when the bullet bit into him he also dropped the musket but only to try to snatch the eightshooter out of staffords hand why dont you die damn you stafford groaned fuck your mother you white devil the negro said he opened his mouth to add another unpleasantry but blood poured out between his lips and from his nostrils for a heartbeat or so he looked astonished thenat lasthis eyes rolled up in his head and he slowly crumpled to the forest floor a sudden nasty stench amid the forests green odors said his bowels had let go he twitched a few times but now he was plainly dying fast stafford stared down at him he smelled the mans sweat and his blood as well as his shit hed never dreamt killing could be so dreadfully intimatethe negro was the first man hed ever known hed slain all at once he doubled over and was sick some of his vomit splashed the black man but it seemed more tribute than defilement you all right consul a rough voice asked a sergeant with grizzled side whiskers stood there he jerked a thumb at the corpse never done for anybody before have you no stafford choked out have you got anything i can rinse my mouth with here you go the sergeant handed him a tin canteen with a cloth cover thanks stafford undid the cover and gulped hed expected water he got barreltree rum he almost puked again as much from surprise as for any other reason then he spat out some of it the sergeant nodded thats the way friend gets rid of the taste bettern water would doesnt it it does stafford agreed a different kind of surprise in his voice he took another swig and swallowed this time then he handed back the canteen after putting it on his belt again the sergeant said i dont think were going to catch the son of a bitch neither do i im afraid stafford said but even if we dont were making him run away were making the insurrectionists dance to our tune for a change potent excitement and even more potent rum were hitting him the way the negros musket ball would have had it connected thats got to be worth something doesnt it well we can hope so anyways the veteran answered and with such doubtful assurance stafford had to be content leland newton nodded to himself when the cavalry column came back without the rebel leader then he noticed that his fellow consul was splashed with blood and distinctly green around the gills are you all right jeremiah he asked more real concern in his voice than hed expected he watched as stafford looked down at himself and noticed the blood for what seemed likely to be the first time oh stafford said and then as if explaining everything in three words it isnt mine well good newton said ah whose is it then this nigger and i saw each other in the woods at the same time stafford answered i ended up shooting him newton would have thought the consul from cosquer would sound proud of himself after doing something like that instead stafford seemed unwontedly subdued colonel sinapis understood that before newton did your first time your excellency the officer asked thats right stafford nodded jerkily you arent the first one to ask me either it must stick out on me like spines is that the mark cain wore he sounded altogether in earnest newton hadnt killed he had no idea what it would be like and wasnt anxious to find out whatever stafford had learned about himself it seemed to have come closer to shattering him than bucking him up sinapis gaze swung to the captain whod commanded the raiders you did not capture the rebel chief did you kill him no sir not that i know of the captain said my guess is that he was there or somewhere close by there were plenty of insurrectionists in those parts and i can see no reason why there would have been if they werent guarding something or someone important to them he paused for a moment i wish we would have had a better description of the scalawag and i wish someone would have told me wed be squelching through a bog after him were you sinapis said his eyebrows leaping the captain noddedunhappily if newton was any judge we did not learn that from the prisoners who told us where frederick radcliff would be hiding we sure didnt sir the captain said maybe they were holding out on us or maybe we just didnt find the right questions to ask any which way we got into something we werent prepared for the troops performed bravely not catching our man wasnt their fault they did everything they could they might have done better if theyd known what theyd be getting into it must be the fault of the questioning colonel sinapis said had we asked the question we needed we would have got the right answer a bog malakas he didnt bother to translate that he sounded splendidly disgusted with the bog with the questioner with the captives for not volunteering more with the whole campaign that last seemed most likely to newton he put the best face he could on things on to new marseille then sinapis dipped his head on to new marseille your excellency we shall make sure the rebels cannot steal the place that would behe paused to look for wordsunfortunate yes unfortunate to say nothing of embarrassing the ones he found seemed to fit altogether too well they roused stafford from his sorrowful lethargy too new marseille already has a garrison it has cannon he said it has cannon sinapis agreed most of them point out to sea to protect the harbor from enemy bombardment it has a garrison a small one so far as i know it has not been reinforced by sea these people we are fighting have already done several things i had not imagined they could do while i was still in new hastings if they should surprise us again it would not surprise me newton tried to parse that last sentence logically it made no sense logic or no he understood what sinapis was talking about so did his colleague well wed better get there ahead of them then stafford said or if we cant manage that wed better drive them out once we do get there indeed colonel sinapis said i should not care to be remembered as the man who lost the city his mouth tightened he must have been remembered for some failures back in europe hed made glancing allusion to at least one of them plenty of people came to atlantis to try to redeem failure elsewhere some succeeded they were the ones who wrote their names in lifes book in large letters others went right on failing most of those by the nature of things were soon forgotten but a soldier who failed might end up better remembered than one who triumphed the same newton realized uneasily held true for a consul who failed newton had understood from the start that either he or stafford wouldnt get what he wanted from this campaign now he realized neither of them might get what he wanted and what would come of that book iii xiii they were gone the last gunshots petered out at the edge of the wooded swamp adjoining the st clair plantation frederick radcliff allowed himself the luxury of a long heartfelt sigh of relief hed known the atlantean soldiers were dangerous fighting men he hadnt dreamt how dangerous they were till they almost snatched him from his redoubt here he wouldnt even be able to stay here any more the soldiers were liable to come back without warning if they did his own men might not be so lucky holding them off how had the white atlanteans learned where he made his headquarters only one answer occurred to him they must have squeezed it out of a captive what had they done to the men they took all sorts of unpleasant possibilities occurred to frederick with the scars of the lash on his own back he wouldnt have put anything past the enemy but he was still in the fight that was the most important thing the free republic of atlantis remained a going concern and it remained an inspiration for slaves all over the southern half of the usa not all the uprisings that had broken out from the hesperian gulf to the atlantic were under his control that had worried him at first it didnt any more they all had the same goal to give negroes and copperskins the freedom they deserved simply by virtue of being men and women some of those distant uprisings had ended in massacre either of whites by furious slaves or of slaves by victorious and vengeful whites that kind of slaughter would make it harder for the two sides to come back together when peace finally returned if it ever did frederick urged his followers and everyone who rose with him to limit killing whenever they could and he hoped his urging did some good he hoped yes but he wouldnt have staked more than ten cents on it his scouts still kept a close eye on the consular army the main body didnt seem to be coming after him as far as the watchers could tell it was heading for new marseille lorenzo clicked his tongue between his teeth when he got that news i told you we should have grabbed the town when we had the chance the copperskin said aint gonna get it again we might not even have taken it we couldnt have held it frederick said as he had a good many times before as lorenzo had before he responded but think of the newspapers yelling rebel army takes new marseille headlines like that theyre worth money to us getting run out and shot up isnt frederick said do you reckon we could keep those soldiers from running us out well no lorenzo admitted there you are then frederick would have boxed lorenzos ears if the copperskin had tried to tell him anything different here i am all right lorenzo said mournfully here i am trying to cipher out what we do next we hang on thats what frederick answered long as we hang on sooner or later were gonna win they have to squash us flat to lick us and even if they do well just pop up again somewhere else all right i hope its all right anyway lorenzo said we aint got killed yet and when we started out i sure thought we would have by now reckon that puts us ahead of the game frederick thought that put them ahead of the game too had their cause failed they wouldnt just have been killed they would have been put to death with as much pain and ingenuity as their white captors could come up with a brightly colored little bird fluttered from branch to branch above fredericks head every so often it would peck at a bug he pointed to it the motion was enough to send it flying away a lot of atlantean creatures had no fear of man as far as frederick could see the little warblers were afraid of everything he knew how they felt lorenzo saw the bird too his thoughts went down a different track not much meat on those but theyre tasty baked in a pie dunno why the rhyme talks about blackbirds they aint half as good off in the distance more gunshots erupted frederick frowned but that seemed to be the last flurry if youre sure you dont want to have anything to do with new marseille maybe wed better head north up towards avalon lorenzo said plenty of plantations up that way plenty of mudfaces and niggers whod be glad to see us and plenty of white folks who wouldnt he commonly put his own kind first frederick commonly thought of negroes first that wouldnt matter unless the two groups paused in their fight against oppression and went after each other instead of the whites who held them both down some of the whites had tried to provoke them into doing just that so far it hadnt worked frederick wanted to make sure it wouldnt weve got to remember the white folks are the ones weve all got to go after he said blacks dont fight copperskins copperskins dont fight black folks either well sure lorenzo agreed wed have to be pretty damned stupid to pull a harebrained stunt like that plenty of people are stupid doesnt matter what color they are fools all over the place frederick said what weve got to do is weve got to make sure the fools dont drag everybody else into the chamber pot with em that sounds good to me lorenzo said weve got enough trouble taking on the white folks looks like to me we fight our own little war while were trying to do that theyll lick all of us frederick radcliff nodded looks the same way to me he was glad he and lorenzo both saw it like that to negroes copperskins even enslaved copperskins had more touchy pride than they really needed they were always ready for trouble and would sometimes start it themselves if they couldnt find it any other way thats how come you can go on running things far as im concerned lorenzo added maybe i wouldnt mind being on top but i wont do anything thatd mess up the war against the whites so help me god fredi wont he held up his right hand as if taking an oath not that slaves were allowed to take legally binding oaths in the united states of atlantis thats big of you lorenzo matter of fact thats downright white of you frederick grinned crookedly the copperskin groaned frederick went on plenty of time to worry about all kinds of things once we win till we do we better keep going like weve been going we ought to go toward new marseille instead of north though we really should lorenzo kept gnawing like a termite if he chewed long enough he figured whatever he was chewing at would fall over maybe we dont attackall right but we should be in place to attack if we see the chance well all right we can do that frederick said lorenzos jaw dropped smiling frederick went on just because i dont think we ought to attack it right now that doesnt mean it wont be a good idea later on maybe we should be ready to grab the chance if we can the former field hands face lit up well hell frederick why didnt you tell me that sooner lorenzo said for a little while there i thought you were softer than you ought to be but i see it aint so not me frederick said weve come this far well go as much farther as we have to now youre talking lorenzos grin got wider yet jeremiah stafford had thought new marseille would be very much like cosquer why not they were both seaside slaveholding cities in the united states of atlantis werent they so they were but they were no more identical than barrel trees and barrels over on the east side of atlantis cosquer had real seasons oh they were milder than new hastingsand much milder than hanovers or croydonsbut they were there once in a while it even snowed in cosquer washed by the warm current of the bay stream new marseille seemed to bask in an eternal june it was always warm it was always humidnot muggy the way it got in cosquer in the summertime but moist and cosquer was an old place the second oldest city in atlantis four hundred years old now or as close as made no difference only a year or two younger than new hastings the bretons after all had found atlantis even before the english fisherfolk but the radcliffes had seen right away that the new land needed settling while the kersauzons were slower on the uptake well the kersauzons paid for it the way slowcoaches commonly did new marseille by contrast was new as new as a freshly minted gold eagle it hadnt been much more than a fort and a trading post back in victor radcliffs day the best harbor south of avalon on the west coast but so what when it was hundreds of miles from the settled regions of atlantis that hardly mattered once the railroad and then the telegraph connected new marseille to the rest of the world it mattered a lot over the past twenty years new marseille had seen a growth spurt the likes of which the world had never seen the likes of as one local boaster put it he wasnt so far wrong either there was one other big difference too right this minute all the white people in new marseille were scared out of their wits many of themmost of the more prosperous onesowned slaves and it was impossible to look at a slave without wondering if he wanted to wring your neck as if you were a chicken or to accept a cup of coffee from a house slave without fearing shed slipped rat poison into it even worse was the idea that new marseille might not be so different from cosquer had servile insurrection raised its ugly head back there too did whites look askance at negroes and copperskins there too the cut telegraph wires made it impossible to know for sure but they let staffords imagination run wild and he could imagine things far worse than reality was likely to be or maybe in the present disordered state of affairs he couldntand that was a genuinely terrifying thought every so often somebody in an upstairs window would fire at somebody down in the street the somebody in the streetthe targetwas invariably white the somebody in the window almost invariably got away jeremiah stafford would have been willing to bet the shooter was bound to be colored he would have been willing to bet yes but he couldnt find anyone who would put up money against him not even consul newton was that big a sucker towns in eastern atlantis had broad cleared belts around them new marseille didnt insurrectionists lurked in the woods right outside the city limits sometimes they sneaked in to stir up the slaves in town colonel sinapis soldiers tried to seal off the perimeter there was too much of it and there were not enough of them the garrison that had held new marseille was pathetically grateful for reinforcements dont know what we wouldve done if those devils got in here first was something consul stafford heard again and again stafford had a pretty good notion of what the garrison and the white populace would have done had new marseille been forcibly incorporated into the free republic of atlantis they would have died that was what big guns bore on the stretch of the hesperian gulf in front of new marseille they crouched in casemates of brick and iron and earth and cement no naval cannon could smash them except by luck but they pointed only out to sea their giant iron cannonballs and bursting shells wouldnt cover the landward side of the city when engineers laid out new marseilles works they never imagined anyone would attack from that direction well life was full of surprises aside from small arms the only pieces that would bear on the insurrectionists were three and sixand twelvepounders like the ones colonel sinapis had brought from new hastings field guns were better than nothingand they frightened the copperskins and negroes in a way that rifle muskets didntbut consul stafford couldnt help longing for all the massive firepower that pointed the wrong way can we get those big guns out of their works and turn them around so they give the niggers and mudfaces a dose of what for he asked sinapis it might be possible the colonel said slowly and staffords hopes leaped but then sinapis went on even if it is it would not be easy or quick or cheap if you seek my professional opinion your excellency the project would not be worth the trouble it causes them stafford did want sinapis professional opinion he wanted that opinion to match his own when it didnt his temper frayed what would some of the other soldiers here say if i asked them the same question he inquired his voice holding a certain edge balthasar sinapis looked him over stafford got the feeling he reminded the atlantean officer of something nasty squashed on the bottom of his boot after a moment sinapis answered well that is your prerogative your excellency if you find someone who asserts that this is a practicable step perhaps the army would be better served with a new commander if you dont care for my judgment i resign that was what he meant in plain english stafford might not have been sorry to see sinapis go had he had someone in mind to replace him but accepting his resignation would no doubt cause a flaming row with leland newton the senate would wonder whether either one of them had the faintest idea of what he was doing and the senate might have good reason to wonder too colonel sinapis stood there calmly waiting to hear what stafford chose sinapis had the courage of his convictions stafford was uncomfortably aware that on this issue he lacked the courage of his own well i expect you know what youre talking about he said gruffly one always wonders sinapis said at the beginning we thought this would be an easy campaign he was generous to say we not you stafford had thought it would be easy the insurrectionists were more in earnest than hed dreamt they could be they also showed more in the way of courage and discipline than hed dreamt they could he associated those traits with white men not with what he thought of as the dusky races but frederick radcliffs fighters had them stafford didnt want to admit that even to himself he especially didnt want to admit it any place where leland newton might hear he knew what would happen then newton would start yapping about full freedom for natives of africa and terranova well he could yap all he pleased he wasnt going to convince stafford that stafford might convince himself was one more possibility he hadnt imagined before he set out from new hastings while he was woolgathering sinapis said something he missed entirely im sorry colonel he said in faint embarrassment i said that we are lucky we made it here we would have had to live off the already bare countryside or else commenced to starve if we had not sinapis repeated if the insurrectionists were a little more energetic they would have done everything they could to block our progress could they really have managed that stafford asked i do not know your excellency the colonel replied but i tell you this i am not altogether disappointed that we did not find out now that we have a sea connection to keep us supplied how soon can we move against the enemy again stafford asked whenever you and your colleague agree that we should we can sinapis said sooner or later also the roads and railroad line from the east will become passable again they had better anyhow or this uprising is far more severe than we imagined and certainly far more severe than any that came before it it was already the worst insurrection in atlantean history stafford had no doubt of that and it was worse than it might have been because the other consul and the northern senators had kept the national government from doing anything about it till almost too late and now stafford had to persuade his colleague that the army needed to go over to the offensive again if the soldiers werent going to fight why had they come at all leland newton nodded yes i think we should move out too he said we didnt come west to defend new marseille i couldnt have put that better myself stafford sounded astonished we did not come to massacre negroes and copperskins either newton warned we came to establish peace by whatever means prove necessary if they are dead they are likely to be peaceable stafford said its the ones who havent gone to their eternal reward that youve got to watch out for sending them up before the celestial judge strikes me as a good way to make sure they trouble atlantis no more killing every negro and copperskin in atlantis might make tacitus peace but it would change the country forever newton said it would also leave our good name a stench in the nostrils of every other nation in the world oh nonsense the grand turk massacres armenians for the sport of it the czar murders jews instead stafford returned newton was about to ask him how he liked lumping the usa with the ottoman empire and russia but before he could the other consul continued over in terranova they arent fussy about disposing of their copperskins whenever they need to and england kills off as many people in india as it has to to keep the nabobs from causing trouble stafford paused then murmured in latin ubi solitudinem faciunt pacem appellant where they make a desert they call it peace newton agreed that was the roman historians line all right he and stafford mightdiddisagree on a great many important things but they came from the same educational tradition and argued from the same assumptions even disagreeing they talked to each other not past each other if we cant get rid of the mudfaces and niggers we might ship the lot of them back to terranova and africa stafford said that would solve our problem too in your dreams it would newton ticked off points on his fingers itemthe terranovans as you pointed out yourself have more copperskins than they want and they dont want ours itemshipping these people away would cost millions of eagles money we havent got itemeven if we had the money we havent got the shipping and itemthese people are here in such numbers they can breed faster than we can send them out of the country this kind of talk youre spouting has been going round for years nothings ever come of it and nothing is likely to he waited for stafford to get angry at him instead the other consul cocked an eyebrow and said well leland if youre going to complain about every little thing taken by surprise newton started to laugh he wagged a finger at his colleague you got me that time but ill pay you back oh i have no doubt of that stafford said in the meantime though what do you say we snuff out this insurrection if we can if we can newton agreed but if that should prove impracticable we had better try something else such as i dont know yet newton said somethinganythingdesigned to hold the united states of atlantis together i can imagine circumstances where it might be better if atlantis came apart before newton could respond to that his colleague held up a hand let it be as you say crush the insurrection first and worry about everything else afterwards newton didnt think hed said precisely that on the other hand he and stafford rarely came so close to sharing the same view of anything his glance slid toward the woods where the rebels lurked maybe the atlantean army could smash them once for all maybe then why did he have so much trouble believing it yet another messenger found frederick radcliff he was scratching a mosquito bite which was one of the things you did when you made your headquarters deep in a swamp he hadnt been deep enough when the atlanteans assailed him before which meant theyd almost caught him the obvious solution was to move where they would have a harder time getting at him the trouble with the obvious solution was that it meant getting eaten alive all of the messengers brought the same news theyre coming out it wasnt what frederick wanted to hear hed hoped the white atlanteans would hole up in new marseille and stop taking the war seriously no matter what hed hoped that wouldnt happen he sighed he might have known it wouldnt come to that he had known it wouldnt as soon as he touched off the uprising his greatest fear was that the whites would put everything they had into crushing it from their point of view ruthlessness made perfect sense anything less than a crushed insurrection and slavery was dead what hadnt occurred to him then was that slavery might be dead even if the whites crushed the insurrection the men and women who fought under himand the others all over southern atlantis whod flared into rebellion in his name even if not under his commandcould be beaten but so what from this day forth how could any master rely on his twolegged property to stay quiet and if you couldnt rely on your slaves to stay quiet how were you going to get any work out of them what are we gonna do the messenger asked bringing him back to the here and now which road are they using frederick asked looks like theyre marching by the northeast one the other negro said frederick swore under his breath if the atlantean soldiers had headed straight east againif theyd started back along the same road theyd used to get to new marseillehe still could have imagined they were giving up the fight and heading off to the green ridge mountains again but no they intended to keep on with their campaign all right in fact aint that where we got us most of our fighters the messenger said yes frederick said and left it right there hed wanted to spread the insurrection towards avalon the more of the southwest that fell under the influence of the free republic of atlantis the better as far as he was concerned none of the whites needed to be julius caesaror for that matter victor radcliffto see as much and they would have taken prisoners and squeezed them hard frederick had to assume they knew as much about his plans as any of his ordinary soldiers he thought of something else did they bring everybody out of new marseille or did they leave a garrison behind more soldiers in there now than there was before the white folks marched in the messenger answered that made frederick swear again he knew it would make lorenzo swear even more ferociously but now he could truthfully tell the copperskin that hed thought about trying to take the town and hed had good reason to decide it wouldnt work he got to tell lorenzo exactly that a couple of hours later lorenzo only nodded too damned many snowballs stayed behind he said if whites had rude names for their colored bondsmen it was only natural that the folk who sprang from terranova and africa would return the disfavor thats right frederick said wondering how lorenzo had got the news messengers were supposed to bring it straight to frederick himself not to anyone else well that was a worry for another day the worry for today was all those white soldiers on the move lorenzo had to be thinking the same thing we can bushwhack em he said we can and wed better frederick said if they go wherever they want and we dont try to stop them weve lost i wont try and tell you youre wrong lorenzo said frederick wasnt sorry to leave his swampy fastness the state of new marseille was warm and sticky and bugridden from one end to the other having lived there for so many years frederick knew that all too well but things werent quite so bad when he came out into drier country he carried a revolver taken from a dead atlantean cavalry trooper that gave him seven bullets to fire at the enemyand one for himself if everything went wrong after the raid hed decided the whites wouldnt take him alive one pull of the trigger got everything over with in a hurry they wouldnt be able to torment him and they wouldnt be able to use him to scare other slaves whod rebelled most of the whites had fled this part of the country a couple of big houses bristled with warning signs and had sentries parading outside of them they might as well have been forts frederick thought his men could overrun them at need but he didnt see the need the whites holed up in them wouldnt come out to attack his fighters which was all that really mattered if the army went away or lost the holdouts wouldnt count for beans and if the army won if the army won frederick would be dead he wouldnt care what happened later on the negroes and copperfaces were eating what they scavenged from the countryside and from granaries taken when plantations fell most whites lacked the presence of mind to set fire to barns or to pour water into storage pits before fleeing a good thing too or the rebels would have had aliterallythinner time of it soldiers from what hed heard often turned up their noses at frogs and turtles and the big flightless katydids that were more common than mice in the woods slaves couldnt afford to be so choosy nothing wrong with turtle stew not if youd been eating it since you were little and took it for granted of course the soldiers didnt have to worry about such things now they had a baggage train a luxury the rebels did without the soldiers could ship hardtack and salt pork and bully beef into new marseille and bring it along with them when they marched no they wouldnt go hungry along with the other slaves frederick had sampled captured hardtack and bully beef you could eat the stuff if you had to no doubt of that given a choice frederick preferred turtle stew and frogs legs and whatever flatbread his cooks could bake on griddles or hot stones scoutsboth blacks and copperskinsshadowed the atlantean column the grayclad soldiers were moving into the country where frederick wanted to spread the insurrection if he could keep them out uprisings against the local planters would stand a better chance but he knew he would have to win a standup fight against them to keep them from penetrating the country between new marseille and avalon shooting at them from behind fences and out of the woods wouldnt do it the soldiers shrugged off those losses and kept marching their scouts also hurt the rebels the whites were no stronger not man for man they were no better in the woods but they were better shots and they were better at supporting one another they were professional soldiers in other words not the amateurs he led can we stop em in a regular battle he asked lorenzo the copperskin shrugged broad shoulders damned if i know he said time to try though dont you think part of me does frederick said then i start wondering how many of us get shot if we try it and it doesnt work lorenzo only shrugged again its a war we hope we hurt the other bastards worse than they hurt us thats all fredericks other fear was that the insurrection would fall to pieces after a lost battle that worried him less than it had in the early days though the negroes and copperskins who fought alongside him had shown their resilience chances were a loss wouldnt scuttle everything and they might win he would have had trouble believing that when the rebellion started but they really might lets try it he said you know a place where we can hold em upand where we can fall back from if weve got to he didnt want his optimism running away with him not me lorenzo shook his head i aint from around these parts either weve got some folks who are though best thing we can do is find out from them bound to be somebody wholl know of one and a bald longfaced negro named custis said reckon i know a place got to slow the white soldiers down some or theyre liable to get to it fore we does skirmishing with the column of white atlanteans was easy making sure the skirmishes didnt get too costly proved less so the soldiers seemed much more eager to mix it up with the bushwhackers than they had on their march to new marseille they usually had the better of it at close quarters too like any other art bayonet fighting took practice the soldiers had more than the rebels did but the series of little fights did slow down the men in gray and custis promised spot proved as good as he claimed a stone fence near the top of a low rise gave cover against musketry a stream to one side and woods to the other made the fence hard to outflank the road ran just in front of the woods putting a barricade across it was easy the rebels behind the fence could rake the soldiers with gunfire if they tried to decline battle if we can beat em anywhere this here is the place frederick said i think so too lorenzo agreed its like the places where the white atlanteans fought the redcoats way back when it is frederick nodded eagerly he hadnt thought of that but he could tell it was true as soon as lorenzo said it the atlanteans under his grandfather had needed to fight in places like this less steady less disciplined than their english foes they needed all the help the ground could give them his own colored rebels needed that kind of help today he put men in the woods to keep the atlanteans from outflanking his position by surprise he posted men behind the barricade too why let the enemy have an easy time tearing it down he knew when the soldiers drew near they raised a column of reddish dust that hung in the dusty air the barfords had always complained about road dust when they visited friends and relations clotilde barford saidover and overthe problem would go away if the government sometimes it was the state government sometimes the national only macadamized or cobbled the highways she wanted the government whichever government it was on any given day to start with the one that ran next to the barford plantation frederick might have been a slave but he could see the trouble with that hed never set eyes on a macadamized road or even a cobbled one but he knew what they were and what making them entailed lots of rocks whether crushed or fistsized lots of labor and lots of money the government might not have to pay slaves in work gangs but it would have to feed them and water them and doctor them and it would have to pay their owners for their services and for their time away from the fields where would the government get money like that especially since white folks squealed like hurt hogs about every cent they grudgingly coughed up in taxes people who liked paved roads talked about other advantages besides their being dustfree the most important was that you could use them in any weather rain didnt turn them to muck but horses hooves did better on dirt than on cobblestones or macadam and dirt roads didnt have to be expensively rebuilt they didnt have the added cost of maintenance either they were just there and odds were they would go right on being there for many years to come frederick examined his preparations one more time he turned to lorenzo are we ready he asked did we forget anything the copperskin started to answer then he caught himself and took another long look at things himself frederick liked that the more you checked the less you took for granted the better off you were likely to be at last lorenzo said only thing i wish we had are some cannon of our own me too frederick said dont know what we can do about that though except maybe grab some from the white folks if wed taken new marseille lorenzo began frederick cut him off with a sharp chopping motion of his right hand too late to worry about that now specially since we might notve taken it still looks to me like we couldve lorenzo said stubbornly they might have gone on arguingit was nothing they hadnt done beforebut several atlantean cavalrymen rode out from under their armys dust cloud and trotted forward to look over the rebels dispositions hold fire frederick yelled to his men the clouds of powder smoke would tell the white horsemen just where their foes waited for a wonder the men under his command did as he asked the cavalrymen stared at the rise and the barricaded road and the woods off to the side then they rode back to report to their own superiors fredericks stomach knotted it wouldnt be long now xiv jeremiah stafford peered at the insurrectionists position through a spyglass he couldnt judge how many men they had behind that stone wall enough to let them think they could challenge the atlantean army anyhow they couldnt possibly be right could they by the way colonel sinapis lined up his men with fussy precision and by the way the corners of his mouth turned down he wasnt so sure instead of sending the foot soldiers forward to sweep aside the riffraff of negroes and copperskins sinapis advanced his field guns till they werent far out of musket range hit the wall with everything you have he told the artillerymen what good will that do stafford asked him patiently the atlantean officer answered a stone wall will protect the men behind it from musketry if they think they are safe from cannonballs inexperienced troops often make that mistake he turned back to the men with the red chevrons and piping on their uniforms now he commanded the field guns belched fire and smoke they scooted backward from the recoil a few artillerymen had to step smartly to keep the carriages from running over them as soon as the recoil stopped the gun crews wrestled their pieces back into position swabbed the guns iron and brass throats and started reloading them several roundshot smacked into the fence that protected the insurrectionists from the way colonel sinapis had talked stafford thought the guns would smash down the wall all at once they didnt but through the spyglass he saw turmoil among the men on the far side something was going on sure enough when he asked about it sinapis answered the balls break the stones they hit you stand behind a stone wall that gets can nonaded it is like standing up under shotgun fire those little bits of stone can kill you and will hurt you if they do not kill ah stafford said enlightened the cannon went on thundering the commotion on the far side of the stone wall got worse here and there roundshot bit chunks out of the wall even when they didnt the copperskins and negroes stirred like bees when their hive was kicked so we shall see how they like that for a while and then we shall see how steady they are after a cannonading colonel sinapis said artillery is what inexperienced troops commonly fear most if it unsettles thewhat do you call themthe insurrectionists yes they will be easy enough for our infantry to handle i expect they will be stafford said its not as if they were white men after all he wondered how he would like to face artillery fire from behind a stone wall that offered less protection than hed expected chances were he wouldnt like it much but he didnt dwell on that something gleamed in colonel sinapis dark eyes but the colonel didnt call him on it the fieldpieces thundered again and again hurling cannonballs up the slope the whacks the roundshot made when they hit the fence were shorter and sharper than the blasts that flung them forth sinapis waved the cannon fell silent the officer turned to the bugler beside him blow forward he said yes sir the man replied and raised his battered brass bugle to his lips under the subtropical sun it gleamed like gold the imperious notes rang out hurrah the soldiers shouted as they started toward the enemy they advanced with fixed bayonets the sunshine also glittered from the sharp steel bayonets were another thing that made raw soldiers knees knock somehow it was easier to put up with the notion of taking a bullet than to imagine yourself screaming your life away pierced by a foe whod come all that way to stick you and who had within himself not a drop of the milk of human kindness while the main force advanced on the fence a smaller group of soldiers moved against the barricade blocking the road copperskins and negroes popped up from behind the fallen trees and fired at the oncoming men in gray and plenty of insurrectionists in back of the fence blasted away at the atlanteans moving toward them they have nerve sinapis said they have their nerve jeremiah stafford exclaimed which meant something altogether different i had hoped we could get in among them without needing to fire sinapis said that does not seem likely now sure enough the atlantean infantrymen began shooting back at the foes behind the fence then they had to reload under fire from the enemy which nobody in his right mind could have been enthusiastic about some of them got shot ramrod in handas ignominious a way to go out of the fight as any stafford could think of artillerymen wrestled some of the cannon around half a turn so they bore on the logs across the road twelve pounds of highspeed iron smacking an obstacle like that did much more visible damage than the roundshot did to the stone fence logs tumbled like jackstraws consul stafford hoped they squashed some of the fighters behind them when they fell over this is good sinapis said in somber satisfactionthe only kind he seemed to show that is very good if the flanking party gets through there the frontal assault matters less stafford hadnt thought the flanking party would matter hed assumed the frontal assault would overwhelm the insurrectionists in back of the fence they proved steadier than hed ever imagined they could despite the bombardment from the field guns they kept pouring a galling fire into the atlantean soldiers assailing their position dead and wounded men in gray uniforms dotted the slope more of them every minute there was a limit to what flesh and blood could bear the negroes and copperskins firing as if their lives depended on itand they did they didforced the soldiers right to the edge of that limit and the attack on the barricade didnt go as well as either the colonel or the consul wanted some of the men behind the logs might have got squashed the rest kept on shooting and insurrectionists hiding in the woods banged away at the flanking party from the flankan irony stafford failed to appreciate make them stop that he shouted to sinapis the colonel looked at him without expression if you have any practical suggestion as to how i am to accomplish that end i should be delighted to hear it he didnt add if you dont shut up and quit joggling my elbownot out loud he didnt stafford heard the suggestion whether it was there or not he knew too well he didnt have any practical suggestions along those lines he could see what was wrong but not how to fix it leland newton pointed to the slope and the wall theyre getting up to it he said and then diminishing that some of them are anyhow yes a lot of bodies dotted the slope once they get over it and in amongst the damned insurrectionists the fight is as good as won stafford said you hope the other consul said yes i do stafford agreed and if you do not i should like to know why oh noi wont fall into that trap now that we are in the field you will not be able to accuse me of failing to support our soldiers in every way newton said i suppose you also wish to pretend you did not do everything in your power to keep them from taking the field stafford growled my dear fellow had i done everything in my power to prevent it the army never would have left new hastings newton replied easily my dear fellow here had to mean something like you silly son of a bitch he wasnt wrong either but he certainly had delayed the armys departure stafford might have pointed that out instead he peered toward the fight at the stone fence some of the atlantean soldiers were scrambling over it through the spyglass he could see soldiers and insurrectionists stabbing at one another with bayonets the copperskins and blacks werent giving much ground were they giving any ground at all he had trouble being sure over on the wing the flanking party had reached the barricade not many white men had got past it though the gunfire from the woods alongside the road was too intense to let the flankers ignore it they had to turn and respond which meant they had trouble going forward the insurrectionists planned this battle well colonel sinapis remarked i do not think i could have improved on their dispositions hearing that did nothing to improve staffords disposition we can beat them he asked anxiously yes we can beat them sinapis said but they can also beat us which i had not counted on before we set out if enough atlanteans got over the wall they would win but the enemy had more men and more determined men back there than stafford had dreamt possible colored fighters savages couldnt be that brave could they sinapis spyglass also surveyed the front under it his mustacheframed mouth twisted he lowered the telescope i am very sorry your excellency i do not think we shall succeed this day dear god in heaven stafford cried can thatthat rabble beat our finest soldiers it would seem so yes the colonel answered impassively they must not stafford said do you hear me they must not it is war sinapis said there are no musts in war there are only ares consul stafford almost hit him one thing alone made the consul hesitate the likelihood that he would lie dead on the ground a moment after he did such an unwise thing he groaned instead watching everything he held dear crumbling before his eyes eight shots in one weapon were wonderful reloading the pistol after firing eight shots at the atlantean infantry was a son of a bitch bastard as frederick radcliff discovered to his sorrow put a bullet in each chamber measure a charge of black powder and stuff each charge into a chamber without spilling it fix a percussion cap for each chamber do all that while your hands trembled because youd just come as near as dammit to getting killed doing it seemed to take about a year but frederick methodically went on he couldnt afford to stay unarmed seven more bullets for the white mensome of them would probably hit anyhow one more bullet for himself just in case theyd got over the wall he hadnt dreamt they could do that hed also assumed that if the white soldiers did get over the wall the battle was as good as lost but it turned out not to be the negroes and copperskins he led didnt flinch even from the soldiers most savage bayonet work they rushed toward the white men in gray not away from them they might be less skilled with the bayonet themselves but they were every bit as plucky and they turned the wall to an advantage they pinned the soldiers whod got over against it and started killing them there it was madness it was mayhem neither side asked for quarter and neither side offered it for longer than frederick thought possible neither side gave ground either a white mans voice furious and astonished rose above the din of shrieks and gunfire you nigger assholes cant do this hell we cant frederick shouted back he had no idea whether the soldier heard him hed finally got that damned eightshooter reloaded as he raised it he breathed a small prayer that it wouldnt explode in his hand if you didnt do a good enough job cleaning off excess powder more than one chamber would fire when you pulled the trigger only one bullet could get out of course the rest the rest would probably blow off the hand that held the revolver more whites scrambled up over the wall to try to help their comrades frederick fired at one of them the man clutched his ribs and tumbled back on the far side of the stone fence only after that did frederick realize the gun had hurt the enemy not him thenand the thought within him warred between all at once and at lastmore atlantean soldiers were climbing over the fence to get away than to come to their friends rescue we licked em lorenzo cried exultantly he asked shall we go after em if we do their cannon will murder us frederick unbent enough to follow that with a question of his own or do you think im wrong nooo the way lorenzo stretched the word showed his reluctance but he didnt try to talk frederick out of the decision he might not like it but he saw it was right a moment later he brightened when word of what we done here gets around every copper man and black man in these parts is going to come running to join our army expect youre right frederick hoped he sounded more enthusiastic than he felt that would bring his army more menmen he mostly didnt have weapons for and men he would have trouble feeding lorenzo went on planters around herell have to light out for the tall timber too unless they want to get their big houses burned down while theyre layin in bed asleep thats a fact now frederick could sound happy without reservation the free republic of atlantis just got bigger damned right it did lorenzo agreed those white sons of bitchesll run back to new marseille with their tails between their legs everything outside the city limits i reckon thats ours from now on half an hour later a negro whod been a butler before the uprising and served as the rebels quartermaster these days came up to him you know where we can get more percussion caps boss he asked were mighty low on em mighty low were short on powder and bullets too but we can come up with some of those anyways percussion caps though you know how to make em not me frederick shook his head they got mercury in emi know that mercury fulmisomethin know where we can get our hands on some this mercury whateverthedevilyoucalledit the quartermaster persisted can you dig it out of the ground dont think so i think youve got to make it some way like they make sugar out of sugar cane frederick answered but you dont know how it wasnt a question but by the way the other negro said it frederick should have known how the quartermaster set his hands on his hips how are we supposed to keep fighting if we cant get no more percussion caps i never said we couldnt do that frederick replied i just said we couldnt make em ourselves but we can steal em from the atlantean soldiers were getting more from the men we killed at the wall right some more the quartermaster said grudgingly not hardly enough to fight another battle with though well well get lots frederick soothed him as best he could some of the white folks in these partsll have percussion muskets too well grab us more caps once we kill them or run them off a few more the quartermaster said but if the white soldiers just keep on picking fights with us were licked on account of before long we wont have nothin to shoot back with what do you propose to do about that mr frederick radcliff frederick wondered whether his grandfather had ever had the family name flung in his face like that probablythe radcliffs and radcliffes had been prominent in atlantis for so long the surname made a handy curse and even if the quartermaster was a snotty nigger yes frederick knew that was how master barford would have thought of the fellow but it fit too well to let him pretend it didnt the question needed answering they just got whipped remember he said they wont be hot to jump on us again right away and i figure well get our hands on more percussion caps by the time they do how you gonna do that the other man challenged ill manage frederick actually had an idea he was damned if hed tell it to anybody who talked like that stafford wanted to try to hit the insurrectionists again to leland newtons surprise colonel sinapis was thinking about it too are you both out of your minds newton said well just bang our heads on the stone wall again he pointed to the fence where the negroes and copperskins had taken such a toll of atlantean soldiers two days earlier they cant do that twice the other consul declared you didnt think they could do it once newton reminded him this is the only reason i pause now colonel sinapis said i was surprised once if i must take these people more seriously then i must that is all if we were in touch with new hastings by telegraph i could ask for reinforcements without them i fear we could not defend a perimeter after another misfortune plenty of new marseille militiamen to draw on stafford said theyre a lot closer than any regulars except the garrison in new marseille city and theyd be up for fighting slaves whove risen uplord knows thats so how well they would do it is i fear a different question colonel sinapis told him they have no experience in the field they have little experience in drill they are unaccustomed to following ordersas what atlantean is notand they would be armed with flintlock muskets no better than the ones their great grandfathers used against the english but they want to fight stafford said that counts too no doubt the colonel replied one of the more devastating agreements newton had ever heard sinapis went on in any case we are lower on ammunition than i would like after the next supply column comes in we will be in a better position to try the enemy again that makes sense said newton who didnt want to fight again any time soon that does make sense stafford agreed when we fight againand wed better do it pretty quickwe ought to make damned sure we win differing motives led the two consuls to the same conclusion now but that conclusion turned out not to be worth a cent or even an atlantean the next supply column didnt bring more bullets and powder and percussion caps and hardtack and salt pork and coffee to the atlantean army the next supply column never arrived a handful of harried soldiers did the tale they told wasnt pretty bushwhacked one of them said his eyes wide and staring we were going through the woods and all of a sudden like there were these trees across the road and wild men shooting at us from both sides wagons couldnt turn around hell we couldnt do anything im a good christian man and its gods own miracle im here to give you the word youll see me in church apraying every sunday from here on out another survivor nodded sorrowfully they came on us screamin and yellin and leapin and carryin on he said some of em had bayonets and some of em had hatchets and dear lord i dont want to remember some of the things i seen when they jumped us how soon did these fellows quit fighting and run away newton wondered were they the ones whod fled first and fastest or had they played dead till the insurrectionists werent interested in them any more either way they hadnt covered themselves with glory balthasar sinapis had more immediate worries what became of the wagon train he demanded where are our munitions and victuals damned niggers grabbed all that shit answered the soldier whod promised to go to church every sunday from now on reckon theyll send us more from new marseille sooner or later if we get it later but the insurrectionists have it now by the way jeremiah stafford looked around he expected fighters in slave clothes to start popping out of the ground like skinks so newton thought anyway a man from europe or terranova would have been more likely to compare them to moles this is not good colonel sinapis said and newton would have had a hard time quarreling with him this is not even slightly good the loss of the munitions the bullets and powder are bad enough but the percussion caps are worse the rebels had not a prayer of making their own percussion caps can we recapture them newton asked the wagons perhaps sinapis said what they held i would doubt that can you not see the negroes and copperskins in your minds eye each with a crate in his arms or on his back unhappily newton nodded he could picture that only too well the men singing the same songs they would have used at harvest time as they carried away their precious booty consul stafford would know from experience what songs those were newton didnt but his imagination seemed to serve well enough maybe we should attack now stafford said before they bring the loot up to their position your colleague has the command today the colonel reminded him tomorrow is bound to be too late stafford said youll get the blame if we sit here he meant well we can try newton said he did not mind if papers south of the stour screamed at him if newspapers in his own section did the same that wouldnt be good he could be only so dilatory before they started if he wanted another term as consul which he did yes we can try it was almost noon by then the soldiers didnt expect to attack the rebels position that day getting orders to the junior officers and forming the men up for the assault took longer than leland newton thought it should the soldiers went forward willingly enough but with no great enthusiasm and it soon became plain that sinapis had waited too long to give the order newton didnt think about his own role in the troops late start either the insurrectionists had had enough percussion caps and ammunition all along or the copperskins and negroes lugging those stolen crates had got to their position before the atlantean attack went in a rippling wave of fire from behind the stone wall greeted the white men in gray who advanced on it the soldiers didnt press the assault the way they had before none of them reached the wall let alone got over it they returned the insurrectionists fire for a while then fell back toward their encampment once more bringing their dead and wounded with them newton had a hard time getting angry at them for their performance they could see they had no chance to break the position before them what sensible professional would let himself get killed with so little chance to realize a return on the investment of his life but their failure left another question hanging in the muggy air newton asked it well gentlemen what do we do now setting out from new hastings jeremiah stafford had thought everything was obvious they would close with the insurrectionists they would smash their gimcrack army and hang or shoot or burn frederick radcliff and as many other leaders as they could catch they would return the copperskins and negroes to the servitude for which they were fit by nature and then they would go back to the capital in triumph right now getting back to new hastings in one piece would have looked like triumph to stafford more things had gone wrong than he would have imagined possible before the army set out and the uprising had proved much worse than hed dreamt it could in his worst nightmares what are we going to do he demanded of colonel sinapis if we dont put down the insurrectionists he held his head in both hands as if the enormity of the idea made it want to explode and that wasnt so far from true either we need more munitions we need more soldiers sinapis said i do not believe any troops will be forthcoming from the national government for some timeif ever the state militiamen you have mentioned are less desirable but he shrugged a drowning man doesnt care a cent what kind of spar he grabs stafford said send out the call colonel by all means if we have twice as many men under arms here we can do more than we can now anyway will you tell me im mistaken youd better not his voice warned and sinapis didnt yes i think the time to do that is here if we are serious about quelling the insurrection what else would we be stafford yelped colonel sinapis shrugged again i am not a political man your excellency i am a soldier you and your colleague decide the policies here once you have done that i shall carry out to the best of my ability any part of them involving soldiers stafford muttered darkly agreeing on anything with consul newton seemed to require a special miracle every time it happened but newton didnt try to dissuade sinapis from summoning the new marseille militia though he did say i worry that they may prove oversavage when they encounter armed negroes and copperskins the enemy is not gentle himself stafford pointed out no doubt he has his reasons for harshness newton said no doubt the militiamen do too stafford snapped some of them were forced to flee their homes some had their wives ravished or their sisters or their daughters ravished perhaps by mulattos or halfbreed copperskins newton said what is that supposed to mean stafford asked coldly what it says the other consul answered you are not a naive man your excellency you know slaveholders have been going in unto their bondswomen for as long as negroes and copperskins have been in atlantis thats different stafford said i believe you believe it is newton said whether the slaves believe the same thing may be open to doubt be damned to the slaves are they not saying be damned to the masters in their place would you not say the same thing i am not in their place they want to place me there though stafford said if they win we shall have colored masters whipping white slaves and forcing white women to go on ministering to their filthy lusts is that what you have in mind of course not and if you listen to the insurrectionists it is not what they have in mind newton replied they claim the free republic of atlantis is to have equality for every man of every color likely tell jeremiah stafford rolled his eyes they will claim anything to keep on fighting you believe them do you and i suppose you will also believe that mothers find babies under cabbage leaves he had the satisfaction of watching newton turn red i know where babies come from the other consul said tightly i am merely trying to point out to you that the rebels have more reasons for rising than satanic wickedness in fact that is how they judge the system that brought their ancestors here and turned them into property as if i care how they judge it stafford fleered their cousins in squalid socalled freedom live worse more benighted lives than they do they have learned our language here they have learned of our god here the one true god they are part of a a great country newton was very quick he heard the small hesitation and knew it for what it was you started to say a free country didnt you what does it profit a slave to be part of a free country it profits only his master maybe one day the mudfaces and niggers may be advanced enough to deserve freedom stafford said but that day is not here and you are doing your best to make sure it never comes newton said if you do not give a boiler a safety valve it will explode when you keep the fire too hot for too long we are watching one of those explosions now he walked away before stafford could answer the consul from cosquer was much happier when militiamen started coming into camp he could have been happier yet for they seemed less like soldiers and more like braggarts and blowhards and ruffians little by little he realized the atlantean regulars had spoiled him they were hardbitten men too but they had discipline anyone among them who got out of line promptly suffered for it by contrast the militiamen did as they pleased till regular sergeants and corporals started knocking sense into them one underofficer died in the process so did six or eight militiamen most of them quite suddenly that did not count the fellow whod knifed the regular corporal his company commander didnt want to turn him over for punishment and his friends seemed ready to defend him they soon changed their minds staring into the muzzles of a dozen fieldpieces doubleshotted with canister would have changed jeremiah staffords mind too stafford judged it would have changed anybodys mind the militiaman got a drumhead courtmartial then he was hanged from a stout bough sticking out from a pine the drop wasnt enough to break his neck and kill him quickly he writhed his life away over the next several minutes after he finally stilled forever colonel sinapis looked out at the wideeyed amateur soldiers whod watched the execution follow orders from your officers and from our officers and un derofficers and nothing like this will happen to you he said we all face the same enemies after all if you work with us we can beat them together and if you work against us i promise you will discover we are more frightful than any negro or copperskin ever born he paused then added one word more dismissed the militiamen couldnt have disappeared any faster if hed called down thunder and lightning on their heads a couple of dozen of them disappeared for good during the night sinapis took that in stride we shall be better off without them than we would have been with them he said technically theyre deserters if you catch them you can hang them too consul newton said no the colonels right stafford saidwords that didnt come out of his mouth every day if they cant stand the heat they shouldnt go near the fire let them run not everyone is a hero even if he can fool himself into thinking he is for a little while well maybe newton was even less eager to agree with stafford than stafford was to agree with sinapis with the army reinforced the colonel was able to send a goodsized force down to new marseille to protect the next wagon train the wagons reached the army without much trouble the insurrectionists must have known they were well protected because they did no more than snipe at them from the woods hardtack and salt pork werent inspiringstafford had already discovered how inspiring army rations werent but having enough of them was better than not and having enough munitions was literally a matter of life and death unfortunately that also held true for the insurrectionists what theyd hijacked would keep them fighting for some time to come and what theyd hijacked would also let themdid also let themexpand the insurrection more white refugees began streaming out of the north most of them with nothing but the clothes on their backs and perhaps a musket or an eightshooter clenched in one fist the stories they told made staffords blood boil how can you stand to listen to these people without your hearts going out to them he demanded of leland newton im not saying it doesnt his colleague answered but my heart also goes out to the negroes and copperskins these same people have been mistreating for generations while yours is hard as a stone toward them stafford only stared how anyone could care about those savages how anyone could say they are mistreated when they gain the benefits of atlantean civilization the lash the shackles the ball and chain the auction block the unwelcome summons to the masters bedchamber newton said dryly you have entirely the wrong attitude stafford said if i do then so does most of atlantis north of the stour the other consul replied and so does almost all of europe the font of what you call atlantean civilization thinks little of what has sprung from it i care nothing for what europe thinks we needed to get free of europe by god or would you rather we still flew the union jack and bowed down to queen victoria stafford said you must know i would not newton said which was true enough but i would also rather that we did not bow down to injustice here nor do we stafford declared his colleague sighed more and more peopleof all colorsthink we do xv a couple of dozen white men had holed up on a plantation they held the big house and the nearby barn frederick radcliff decided they showed enough determination to make a rush more expensive than he cared for he approached the big house holding as large a flag of truce as he could carry hed barely got to hailing distance before a white man inside the house yelled hold it right there nigger flag or no flag ought to shoot you down like the mad dog you are go ahead frederick answered see what happens afterwards he feared that what would happen was that the uprising would fall apart but that wasnt what he wanted the white man to think about and he hadnt named himself so the desperate whites couldnt know they had the leading insurrectionist in their sights well say your say then the white man told him grudgingly well see how much manure you pack into it got no manure frederick said what we got is we got enough men to kill the lot of you you think we wont use em youre crazy he didnt want to use them how many eightshooters did the white defenders carry those were the guns that made a difference when things came to close quarters their spokesman jeered at him likely tell black boy youre tryin to scare us out on account of you aint got the balls to drive us out probably another dozen skulkers back there behind you and thats it think so do you youll see frederick had looked for some such response from the whites because hed looked for it hed got his own men ready for it ahead of time when he turned and waved they knew what to do black men and copperskins with shouldered bayoneted rifle muskets marched out of the woods to one side and into the trees on the other side fredericks force did greatly outnumber the fortified whites he made it seem even larger by having the men hurry through the trees where the whites couldnt see them and then march out into the open again he finally waved again this time for the parade to stop well he called have we got the men we need or what no one answered him for some little while he could guess what that meant the defenders were arguing among themselves some had to think they couldnt hold off the rebels while others would be more hopeful at last the leatherlunged spokesman bawled well if you dont want to fight what do you want come out you can keep your guns but come out frederick answered you dont want to stay in the free republic of atlantis you can march away long as you dont shoot at us we wont shoot at you you do start shootin youre all dead you stay in there youre all dead too thatd hurt us some but it sure wouldnt do you any good another pause then the white man asked how do we know we can trust you we come out you got us where you want us youre in deep water any which way and you know it frederick said have you ever heard of the free republic of atlantis makin a deal like this and then going back on it no but if you murder everybody who comes out we wouldntve heard about it would we the white man had his reasons for being suspicious frederick made himself remember that the fellow was dicing for his life with enemies he hated killing everybody aint that easy somebody plays pigsnake or something frederick said everyone in southern atlantis knew about pigsnakes they werent poisonous when they got into danger they puffed themselves up and hissed and snappedand then they rolled onto their backs and played dead frederick went on sides some of usd brag if we did that kind of thing people run their mouths no matter what color they are and thats a fact he waited again he didnt know what the white men would decide he didnt know what he would have done himself in a mess like that he was glad he wasnt the one who had to figure it out times awasting he called hoping to speed things up he didnt though or not very much he stood there in the hot sun till the front door to the big house finally opened all right the spokesman shouted were coming out you lied to us well kill as many of you bastards as we can some of the whites carried muskets others pistols they all looked wideeyed and jumpy as if they were dealing with so many ferocious wild animals like as not they thought they were and they seemed to get even jumpier as they moved away from the cover of the house and barn frederick waved encouragingly go on nothings gonna happen not unless you start it they came up to him you got nerve nigger the spokesman said maybe you got nerve too trustin me frederick answered he almost said trustin a nigger but he couldnt make himself call himself by that name to a white man even if he sometimes used it among his own people the white studied him with disconcertingly keen gray eyes youre a smart fellow aint you frederick shrugged anybody who brags on bein smart really aint ignoring that the white went on i wouldnt tell you this if you didnt already know but i reckon you do we get out of here well join up with the soldiers first chance we find i suppose so frederick said you reckon that just as soon as your bunch comes in theyll have enough people to whip us up one side and down the other i the white man paused and sent him another sharp stare you are a smart fellow no i dont figure well make the difference all by our lonesome in that case we may as well let you go long as you dont kick up trouble frederick said as the white man walked on with his comrades he got off one last verbal shot some smart fellows they come to grief on account of they aint as smart as they think they are that was bound to be true frederick hoped it wouldnt turn him upside down but how could you know you were outsmarting yourself till youd actually gone and done it those white men would have found theyd outsmarted themselves if they opened fire on the insurrectionists at least half of frederick thought they would whites had trouble taking blacks and copperskins seriously as fighting men maybe the sight of all those bayonets had made these whites more thoughtful than usual bayonets didnt have to kill to be useful weapons they only had to intimidate and they were splendid for that you sure you should have let them go lorenzo asked no frederick answered which made the copperskin blink he added but if we break a bargain once we make it we give the whites an excuse to do the same thing like they need one lorenzo said scornfully army hasnt fought dirty frederick said theyd be worse if we did why give ourselves more trouble dont you reckon we got enough well its pretty bad way things are now lorenzo allowed i dont like getting shot at and thats the lords truth but i know whats worse whats that frederick asked way things were before the copperskin answered i was gonna be a field hand the rest of my daystill i got too old and feeble to go out to the harvest anyhow then id sit in my damn cabin till i got sick and died or else master barfordd knock me over the head on account of i cost too much to feed if im gonna go out id sooner go out fightin frederick pondered that but not for long me too he said white militiamen coming up from the south were one thing white militiamen coming down from the north were something else again their leader a bushybearded ruffian named collins or conlin or something like that spread his battered hands and told leland newton im damned glad to be here your honor im damned glad to be anywhere right now and thats a fact they let you get away i heard newton said they did collins or conlin agreed they could have killed the lot of us but they made terms and they kept them he might have been a man announcing a minor miracle we would have done our best to avenge you newton said i expect so the militiaman nodded wouldntve done us a hell of a lot of good though would it newton didnt know what he could say to that so he didnt say anything instead he asked who made the arrangement with you were you sure he could get his friends to keep it we werent sure of nothin collins or conlin spat a stream of pipeweed juice to emphasize that we damn neardamn nearstarted shootin at each other before we decided we didnt have no choice we was trapped where we was at fellow who dickered with us was a nigger thats all i know about him for sure later on some people told us he was fred radcliff hisself but i cant say for sure he was and i cant say for sure he wasnt what would you have done if youd known he was good question the ruffian spat again expertly if wed plugged him then they wouldve massacreed us for sure he massacreed the pronunciation of the word but newton didnt correct him instead the consul asked so the rebels observed the usages of war then observed the what plainly the militiaman knew no more of the usages of war than a honker knew about history after a pause for thought the fellow said they told us they wouldnt kill us if we came out peaceablelike and they didnt so if you mean did they play square well i reckon they did that will do newton said nodding but what difference does it make the militiaman sounded honestly puzzled theyre still a bunch of mudfaces and niggers theyre still slaves in arms against their masters too he might not know anything about the usages of war but he was sure what such folk deserved at the time consul newton had no idea whether that would matter it turned out to and the very next day atlantean soldiers brought in four rebels theyd captured spying on the camp a negro and three copperskins it was the first success the grayuniformed men had had for a while their friends whooped and hollered string em up somebody shouted and in an instant everyone was baying out the same cry jeremiah stafford nodded like an old testament prophet just what the renegades deserve he said he had the command that day if he ordered the captives hanged hanged they would be all the same newton said i think we ought to treat them as prisoners of war the other consul stared at him as if hed taken leave of his senses youve come out with a lot of crazy things but that may take the cake stafford said why on earth should we act like a pack of fools i mean look at those villains newton did copperskins were said to be impassive one redbrown prisoner was trying to put up a strong front the other two and the negro seemed frankly terrified even so newton answered they didnt kill that pack of militiamen and they could have besides if we hang these fellows what will the insurrectionists do when they get their hands on some of our men after the last two fights chances are they already hold white prisoners he made stafford grunt which was more of a response than hed thought he would get why on earth do you imagine they would respect anything we do stafford returned because theyve kept terms after agreeing to them newton said war is bad enough when both sides stick by the common rules it only gets worse when they throw them over the side stafford grunted again the insurrectionists threw them over the side when they began their rising will you talk to colonel sinapis before you go looking for the closest tree with a thick branch newton asked why not see what a professional soldier thinks of the whole business hes soft on the insurrectionists too stafford muttered but he didnt say no with newton following in his wake he hunted up the colonel balthasar sinapis gnawed thoughtfully at his mustache there are times when you do hang prisoners he said when the other side has committed some atrocity you want them to know they have not put you in fear and that you can repay them in their own coin here though in battle the rebels have not acted like savages do we want to give them the excuse to start if they werent savages they wouldnt have risen against their masters stafford insisted no doubt the english papers said the same thing about the atlantean assemblys army a lifetime ago newton said its not the same thing damn it stafford said it never is when the shoe goes on the other foot colonel sinapis put in stafford scowled at him sinapis went on is it different enough to make us fierce for the sake of fierceness history argues that if you make a war against slaves a war to the knife a war to the knife it shall be true stafford said how many tens of thousands of them did the romans crucify after they beat spartacus how many romans did those slaves kill before the legions beat them newton said one more grunt from his colleague stafford threw his hands in the air all right let them keep breathing for now if their friends give us cause we can always hang the wretches later that seems fair newton allowedit was more than hed expected to win from his fellow consul so it does colonel sinapis said and that seemed to settle that jeremiah stafford felt like a man struggling in quicksand it wasnt just that hed let leland newton talk him into treating captured blacks and copperskins as prisoners of war that was bad enough but there was worse the servile insurrection sizzled everywhere but the places where atlantean soldiers actually stood a man who went off into the woods to ease himself might not come out again if he didnt his friends were all too likely to find him with his throat cut or his skull smashed in they werent likely to find the skulkers whod murdered him is this what you call fighting in accordance with the usages of war stafford asked newton after three ambushes in two days it may not be sporting but i wouldnt say it breaks international law the other consul answered if colonel sinapis feels otherwise im sure hell let us know bah stafford said the colonel didnt agree with him often enough to suit him as far as he was concerned sinapis had a soft spot in his heart for the insurrectionists stafford wondered why hadnt the colonel been a loyalmaybe even an overloyalservant of the status quo back in europe did he have a guilty conscience he was trying to salve years too late more and more whites fled the territory north and east of the city of new marseille some of them took service with the militiamen fighting alongside the atlantean regulars others seemed more inclined to moan about their sea of troubles than to take arms against them why havent you people killed all those raggedyass bastards by now an unhappy planter demanded of stafford i wish it were as easy as you make it sound the consul answered well why aint it the planter said nothin there but a pack of slaves you should take the lash to em theyd run miles dog my cats if they wouldnt something inside stafford jangled someone in ancient days was supposed to have put down a slave uprising like that he tried and failed to remember who it was he suspected the failure was a sign the ancient historian who told the story was talking through his hat he also suspected the planter was doing the same thing did you try scaring them off with a whip he asked well no the fellow admitted they woulda shot me if i had then why do you think things are any different for us stafford inquired on account of youre the government the planter said by the way he said it that gave the army everything but power from on high if only it were true stafford thought aloud he said dont you see that the insurrectionists have rejected government along with everything else but theyve got no business doing that the man exclaimed how often had he rejected government when it tried to do something he didnt fancy raise his taxes for instance no doubt hed done it without thinking twice now he needed what government could give him and so he was crying out for it listening to him made stafford very tired we shall do what we can for you sir the consul said if you will pick up a musket and do something for yourself that will also help your countrys cause maybe i will the planter said which meant he wanted nothing to do with a notion that might endanger his precious carcass seeing as much stafford went off to talk with another refugee hoping that fellow would show more sense just because a man hoped for such things didnt mean he got them i wish we knew more about whats going on in the rest of the country stafford said to consul newton the next day that we dont probably isnt the best sign his opposite number replied the rebels are doing too well at cutting the telegraph wires they control the countryside and i dont know what we can do about that we ought to do more than we have been stafford said fretfully we are not aggressive enoughnot nearly and that is not least your fault you want the insurrectionists to prevail i want justice to prevail and peace to return newton said what you call justice is a southern mans nightmare stafford said a southern white mans maybe newton answered to a southern colored man the way he lived up until the rebellion was the nightmare if we could find some way not to leave anyone of any blood too dissatisfied wish for the moon while youre at it stafford said and if anyone is to be satisfied i intend it shall be the white man believe me your excellency that is my first concern oh i believe you newton said that is a large part of the problem he walked away leaving stafford obscurely punctured here they come a copperskin called hurrying back toward the position the rebellious slaves held frederick radcliff grimaced he didnt want to fight the white men he wished they would leave the free republic of atlantis alone too much to hope for of course whites hated the idea that negroes and copperskins might be able to take care of themselves they hated the idea that negroes and copperskins ought to be free even more and so another battle was coming another chance for things to go wrong frederick thought the free republics fighters had done better than hed ever dreamt they could but if things went wrongno when they didhe had to hope his makeshift army wouldnt fall to pieces they werent professional soldiers could they deal with defeat militiamen had finally let the atlantean army flank its way past the strong position fredericks men held for so long this new one the free republic occupied wasnt nearly so good it was the best the colored fighters could do though if they let the white men in gray march wherever they pleased the free republic of atlantis was only a sham if land was really yours you had to fight to keep it frederick wasnt about to let his men stand there and trade volleys with the soldiers that was asking to get the fighters chewed to pieces the white professionals were trained to fight that way his men werent they would sweep the open area in front of the woods where they crouched with musketry if the whites wanted to try advancing through it they were welcome to but counting on the enemys foolishness turned out to be a bad idea atlantean soldiers in their gray and militiamen in blue or brown or green or colorless homespun did attack across the field in front of the forest there were enough of them to keep fredericks men busy enough to make him think there were more a man who knew how to do card tricks or seem to pull coins from someone elses ear or nose had learned the art of misdirection he made the audience look away from the important part of what he was up to so it wouldnt catch on till the trick was done the soldier commanding the atlantean army had picked up the same knack frederick was pleased with how well his men were fighting till somebody ran in from the left shouting we is fucked we is fucked all to hell an gone what do you mean frederick asked but the ice in his belly said it knew before his brain did sure as the devil the scout pointed back the way hed come towards a swell of ground that hid the view to the southeasthid it much too well as things turned out they movin up behind that the negro said they gonna cornhole us like nobodys business son of a bitch frederick said and then more sensibly weve got to get out of here before they can do it before who can do what lorenzo whod come over from the shooters at the edge of the woods plainly hadnt heard about this scouts news as if to prove as much he added were giving the white men hell theyre pretty damned stupid to keep coming at us like that i only wish to god they were frederick said as the scout had before him he pointed to the southeast they got themselves a column movin up on us over there we better pull back quick or else theyll he didnt go on or think he needed to lorenzo showed he was rightthe copperskin swore in english french and spanish lorenzo wasted no time arguing he just ran back into the woods shouting for the negroes and copperskins who had been holding off the atlantean regulars and militiamen to stop what they were doing and fall back to the north only a rear guard of sharpshooters would hold off the whites coming straight at them the rest of the fighting slaves had more important things to worry about lorenzo was soldier enough to see as much right away if only hed been soldier enough to see the possibilities of that flanking move if only hed been frederick asked himself if only id been whos the tribune of the free republic of atlantis anyway who started this damned uprising but it wasnt so simple frederick knew he was inventing his generalship as he went along so was lorenzo of course but lorenzo showed a talent for that side of things frederick knew he himself couldnt match now he had to hope his rapidly retreating army wouldnt fall apart because it was retreating rapidly he also had to hope the atlanteans wouldnt knock his army to pieces a bullet from some white mans rifle musket cracked past his head close enough to make him hunch his shoulders and duck before he could catch himself another bullet snarled past this one a little farther off they reminded him that like his army hed stayed here too long fall back then it wasnt what he wanted to do which had nothing to do with anything if he and his fighters didnt fall back the white atlanteans would have them at their mercy if the soldiers knew the meaning of the word which struck frederick as unlikely they got out barely in time a volley from the flanking column raked them as they retreated but only one and from fairly long range the soldiers in gray hadnt yet unlimbered their field artillery that could have cost fredericks men far more than musketry did and it was something to which the negroes and copperskins could not reply frederick hated and feared cannon and the men who served them his rear guard did what it was supposed to do it held off the white men in gray whose frontal attack had done such a good job of blinding the insurrectionists to the flanking columns movement the fighters in the rear guard fell back from tree to thicket to barrel tree quite a few of them didnt make it out of the woods theyd defended that was the price you paid for joining the rear guard the negroes and copperskins volleyed back at the whites in the flanking column frederick was delighted to watch several soldiers in the enemys firing line fall over thatll show em we havent quit he said to lorenzo damned right it will the copperskin agreed they beat us but they didnt lick usknow what i mean yes frederick had been thinking the same thing though not so precisely we can stand up to them no matter what we really can lorenzo said its taken us a while to figure that out and its taking them even longer but thats a fact they march smarter than we do and theyve got those blasted fieldpieces forget about those and there aint much difference between them and us if wed seen that a hundred years ago frederick shook his head in frustration almost like its our own fault we didnt get free wouldnt be so easy without the rifles and muskets we got from the soldiers who came down sick lorenzo said frederick nodded the copperskin had a point lorenzo went on and they always did their best to keep us from learning the secret thats a fact frederick said whites genuinely believed they were better than copperskins and blacks because they did they made the people they enslaved believe it too frederick knew his own life would have been entirely different had his grandmother been white i mightve been one of the consuls fighting the insurrection he thought in surprise of course he also might not have he might have been anything at all as a white man the one thing he surely would not have been was the frederick radcliff he was now changing the color of his skin would have changed everything else that had happened to him since he was born it wasnt the color itself so much that mattered it was how everybody else treated you because of the color right now all these white men in gray uniforms wanted to kill him because he was trying to change how much color counted and if that didnt go miles and miles toward proving his point he was damned if he knew what would lorenzo pointed north after we get over that rise theres a stream with thick woods on the north side if we cant stop those white bastards there we cant stop them anywhere wed better try then frederick said maybe they couldnt stop the white soldiers anywhere hed feared that after the insurrection started he didnt fear it so much any more but it was still possible all kinds of things were still possible one thing wasnt a black man wouldnt become a consul of the united states of atlantis any time soon and if that wasnt all of what the insurrection was about it sure was a big part of things well colonel sinapis said philosophically we almost had them there jeremiah stafford fumed to say he was not inclined toward philosophy was putting it mildly god damn it to hell we should have had them there the consul exclaimed one of the things you must understand your excellency is that war is not like a steam engine or a threshing machine sinapis said the manufacturer cannot promise it will perform in suchandsuch a way for suchandsuch a time war stafford loaded as much scorn into the word as he could putting down uprisen niggers and mudfaces shouldnt be dignified with the name what are we doing but whipping curs back to their kennels when you whip dogs back to the kennels the dogs do not pick up whips and try to whip you away the colonel replied making this a smaller business than it truly is will do us no good he was right stafford knew it which only made him angrier he said the point is it should not be a grand business these damned insurrectionists should not have the power to make it into a grand business well i cannot say anything about what they should be able to do and what they should not that is gods business not mine sinapis made the sign of the cross not quite as a roman catholic would have done it then he thrust a twig into a campfire and used the small flame he got to light a cigar after a couple of meditative puffs he went on all i can speak to all i can deal with is what is and what is here is a serious rebellion your excellency it seems only to be getting worse too the enemy soldiers have learned a great deal from facing our men several times this happens more often than governments trying to put down rebellions wish it would before long the enemy soldiers who live are troops as good as our own these are not enemy soldiers damn it stafford thundered they are nothing but a pack of stinking insurrectionists balthasar sinapis only shrugged you may call them whatever you please of course but it makes no difference in the end the only thing that makes a difference is whether they perform as soldiers unquestionably they do that retreat they brought off i quite admire them for it no raw rebels could have come close to doing anything like that bah stafford stomped away from the fire he did not care to hear what colonel sinapis was telling him even if it was the truthno especially if it was the truthhe didnt care to hear it if copperskins and blacks could fight well enough to make an experienced officer admire them everything white atlanteans had always believed about their social system was a pack of rubbish no more stafford couldnt believe that he wouldnt believe it frederick radcliff was nothing but a nigger he was a nigger in arms against the usa that meant he had to be put down like any other sheepkilling dog he was of course also a radcliff he was a grandson to one of the first consuls no doubt at all that his grandfather had been a very able man little doubt he was a very able man himselfhe wouldnt have caused so much trouble if he werent again that made things worse not better frederick radcliff was a slave by blood and a slave by nature if you started bending that principle where would you end up youd end up as leland newton that was where youd end up with nigger equality they had it up in croydon or something close to it they even let niggers and mudfaces vote up there stafford shook his head he did not care to let such a tragedy befall his own state out in the woods crickets and katydids chirped nighthawks and bats swooped low over the fires to seize the bugs the flames had lured soldiers shadows lurched here and there as the men walked in front of their tents other soldiers out farther from the campfires watched to make sure the insurrectionists didnt sneak in and kick up trouble those sentries these days were every one of them experienced woodsmen ordinary atlantean troopers on night sentry had shown a lamentable tendency to get their throats slit or otherwise to perish silently that made night attacks all the easier dead men seldom gave timely alarms there at least colonel sinapis did seem to have solved a problem a little one stafford muttered discontentedly a tiny one the real problem wasnt keeping insurrectionists from sneaking into camp and raising cain the real problem was that there still were insurrectionists he spat in disgust the wind sprang up it was heavy with rain as it often was in these parts it was also heavy with the stink of the encampments latrine trenches stafford wrinkled his nose though the stench was anything but unfamiliar anyone who lived in a city got to know it wellindeed often got to the point where he took it for granted right now it made stafford think of all the trouble the insurrectionists were causing did atlantis have to take that for granted too even if this uprising was crushed would another as bad or worse break out in a few years time how could the country hope to hold together if slave revolts tore into it the way cyclones did stafford spat again he saw only two ways to keep that from happening either you had to cede equality to the slaves or you had to make them too afraid even to think of rising maybe youd have to kill a lot of them to make sure the rest got the message he shrugged if that was what it took that was what it took who except for the whites whod lose money when their niggers and mudfaces died would waste grief on them and the owners could be compensated things might work out they just might xvi a supply column that came northeast from new marseille brought fairly recent papers from the west coast city and older ones from new hastings leland newton wasnt delighted at the headlines but he also wasnt much surprised no one anywhere seemed happy with the armys progressor rather lack of progressagainst the insurrectionists new marseille reporters and editors found a simple explanation for the failure as far as they were concerned the army was a bunch of bunglers led by idiots the new hastings chroniclethe one daily in the capital that took a proslavery linehad a similar opinion the other papers from the capital took a different tack one consul newton enjoyed more here listen to this he said to jeremiah stafford holding a monthold new hastings daily war whoop out at arms length so he could read it without his spectacles the way the blacks and copperskins in southern atlantis have succeeded in resisting government forces for so long proves the point atlanteans from the north have been making for many years men are men regardless of color courage is not the exclusive property of whites the sooner this is recognized by all of every hue the sooner peace will return to our republic im glad they sent it stafford said before newton could show his surprise at such a sentiment his colleague explained it will wipe my backside better than a handful of old leaves patiently newton said you can use the paper however you please that doesnt make whats printed on it any less true lies all lies every single word staffords voice was too loud and sounded like a cracked bell little drops of spittle flew from his lips as he spoke one of them landed on newtons sleeve newton eyed it with distaste distaste leavened by alarm jeremiah i mean no offense but you are talking like a fool or maybe like a madman you may not care for everything the papers say but much of it is true whether you care for it or not this rebellion is more difficult and intractable than you dreamt it would be when the campaign against it began and the rebels are different from what you thought they would be can you blame the papers for noticing what you must have seen too yes stafford said which was not what newton hoped to hear if things are the way they say they areif they are the way you say they arethen dickering with the insurrectionists becomes the only practicable course i tell you frankly sir i should rather die a thousand deaths leland newton believed that believed it beyond a fragment of a doubt his own voice gentled as he replied would you rather atlantis died a thousand deaths what else lies ahead on the track you have chosen for the country i want the insurrectionists to die a thousand deaths stafford said savagely that might begin to repay them for their atrocities it might it might also be beyond our power to arrange newton said if that is not the lesson of the past few weeks they have none we have not done what we wish we would have it does not follow that we cannot do it stafford said how newton asked for the first time since seeing the newspapers some of the other consuls dreadful certainty leached out of him he no longer looked as if he were going to give the preacher a run for his money his mouth sagged unhappily so did his shoulders his answer came in a much smaller voice i dont know well we are on the same trail there anyway because i dont know how to do that either newton said but we must pain filled staffords words what do we name someone who insists we must do something that cannot be done newton answered his own question if he is lucky enough to be young we name him a child otherwise we call him a fool if he keeps on insisting we have asy lums for such people stafford turned the color of a sunset but before he could come out with whatever hed been about to say musketry started up off to the north the encampment boiled like coffee in a tin pot soldiers ran this way and that before long quite a few of them purposefully trotted north we have another chance now to do what we came here for stafford did say at last what do you think the chances are that this next battle will settle the insurrection once for all newton asked i dont know the other consul said but i do know theyre better if we win than if we lose are they what a man might call betting odds newton persisted i dont know that either stafford sounded as if he wanted to change the subject or else drop the whole conversation which he did for he went on i am going up to the front to see what our brave soldiers and militiamen can do you are welcome to accompany me if you care to if you arent yellow he meant stung newton said there is not a place on this campaign where you have gone and i have not if the other consul tried to quarrel with that newton was ready to box his ears but stafford said only come on then and hurried off toward the sound of the firing he drew his eightshooter as he went sighing so did newton the idea of shooting insurrectionists did not delight him as it did his colleague all the same he could not believe the copperskins and negroes would spare him for the sake of his belief in individual liberty so many bullets flew almost at random no one could do anything about those if someone at close quarters aimed at him in particular he intended to fire first he might favor individual liberty yes but not at the price of his own survival that thought made him miss a step and almost stumble the insurrectionists were risking their lives for individual liberty no wonder they made such difficult foes by the time he and stafford got to the scene of the firing it was already dying away theyd passed a couple of parties of stretcherbearers taking wounded men back to the surgeons and one foulmouthed corporal going back under his own power cradling a bleeding wrist in the crook of his other arm only a skirmish your excellencies said the middleaged first lieutenant who seemed to be in command of the atlantean soldiers thereabouts they probed to see if we were ready to receive em they found out we were and then they faded off into the woods again didnt much care for the reception eh stafford said still holding his revolver at the ready no sir the lieutenant scratched at his graying side whiskers was this the kind of glorious action hed imagined when he joined the atlantean army in the flower of his youth leland newton had trouble believing it but then the difference between what you imagined and what you got was one of the yardsticks by which you measured your passage into adulthood out in the ferns and barrel trees from which the insurrectionists had opened up a wounded man screamed his guts out one thing newton had noticed all badly hurt men sounded the same maybe that said something in favor of the basic equality of the races hoping so newton proposed it to stafford his colleague snorted huzzah he said sourly if i shoot this horse here itll make pretty much the same noises too shall we pick it for consul next term the way caligula did with incitatus well no newton said stafford was just the kind of man who would remember the name of the mad roman emperors cherished charger and trot it out when it did him the most good all right then dont waste my time with foolishness he snapped and turned away had the injured negro or copperskin lain out in the open stafford probably would have tried to finish him off or to hit the fellows who came out to pick him up and do what they could for him newton didnt think that was a sporting way to make war he also didnt think stafford cared a cents worth for sport something in colonel sinapis long sad face told jeremiah stafford the armys senior officer didnt want to listen to him too damned bad colonel stafford thought a colonel who didnt listen to a consul wouldnt stay the armys senior officer for long we need a decisive victory over the insurrectionists stafford declared we need to break their fighting force and we need to break their spirit such a victory would be desirableyes your excellency was that resignation in sinapis voice it had better not be stafford thought we need to go after that kind of victory more aggressively he said i shall certainly be as aggressive as seems advisable colonel sinapis said be more aggressive than that stafford told him one of the colonels shaggy eyebrows rose do you want me to lead the army into a trap sir no damn it i want you to trap the insurrectioniststrap them and smash them stafford said if you smash a glob of quicksilver all you have are smaller globs here there and everywhere sinapis said fine stafford said the atlantean officer gave him a lookthat wasnt the answer sinapis had expected consul stafford went on after we smash the big glob we can destroy the smaller bits one by one at our leisure ah sinapis relaxed fractionally he hasnt gone round the bend after all the colonel didnt say that but stafford saw it in his eyes a beat slower than sinapis might have he resumed that may be possible i hope it is but i would be lying if i said i was sure if we dont make the effort colonel why the devil did we ever leave new hastings stafford asked and answered his own question we came to fight the insurrectionists we came to beat them lets do that then balthasar sinapis sketched a salute very well your excellency stafford had learned that very well your excellency could mean anythingor nothing when colonel sinapis got an order he didnt fancy he saluted promised to obey and then sat on his hands stafford didnt aim to let him do that this time sinapis fingers wouldnt be warm under his behindtheyd be flaming in the fire but stafford didnt have to hold sinapis hands to the fire this time the colonel sent his men against the insurrectionists with what struck the consul as almost a deviltakethehindmost enthusiasm sinapis might have been thumbing his nose at stafford in effect saying well this was your idea if it goes wrong blame yourself because its not my fault if it went wrong stafford supposed he would have to do that if he didnt blame himself leland newton damned well would blame him and would make sure all the papers back in the more civilized parts of atlantis blamed him too he could see headlines in his minds eye they would scream about his recklessnessand about his fecklessness too they would ask why he overrode a professional soldiers judgment that would make a painfully good question too no one was happier than he then when it didnt go wrong the atlantean soldiers fell upon and routed a goodsized force of copperskins and blacks the insurrectionists hardly formed a line of battle they fired a few shots and fled the soldiers killed over a hundred of them and captured close to a hundred more casualties among the whites were seven dead and seventeen wounded you see stafford said exultantly eyeing the unhappy prisoners we really can do this we just have to push hard it worked this time sinapis said and not another word the consul jerked a thumb toward the captives we ought to hang the lot of them is what we ought to do you agreed we would not your excellency colonel sinapis reminded him harming prisoners is a game both sides can play nor would your colleague approve of breaking the agreement stafford backtracked i didnt say we would i said we ought to and i still believe that after this war is won there will be a great reckoning slaves have to learn they cannot rise against their masters what comes afterwards is politics as sinapis was in the habit of doing he spoke the word as if it tasted bad that is your province i have nothing to say about it while the fight goes on there i am obliged to tell you what i think yes yes jeremiah stafford made himself nod sinapis could croak as much as he pleased if he wanted to think he was obliged to imitate a chorus of frogs he could do that too but if he thought stafford was obliged to listen to him he needed to think again stafford did some more talking of his own keep on pressing them i tell you it is our best hope of victory you are one of the men in a position to give me orders by the way sinapis said that he didnt care for it either even his salute though technically perfect felt somehow reproachful of course i shall obey them and then your excellency we will see what comes of that frederick radcliff didnt like falling back before the white soldiers during his life though hed had to do any number of things he didnt like he couldnt imagine a slave who hadnt and so he retreated and retreated again the atlantean regulars and the militiamen who reminded him of hyenas skulking along next to lions came after his men lorenzo fancied retreating no more than he did weve got to pin their ears back the copperskin said that would be good frederick agreed but how do we make sure they dont pin ours back instead ambush em lorenzo answered at once only way to teach em respect only way to make em keep their distance too bastards have been eating peppertheyre right on our heels if we can i want to give them a jolt frederick said my only worry is that theyll slide around our flank the way they did before we need to find a place where the ground wont let em lorenzo said plenty of people carrying guns on our side wholl know about places like that if there are any places like that frederick said bound to be some the copperskin insisted let me ask aroundill see what i can come up with frederick didnt tell him no he didnt want the atlantean army hounding his rebels either and before long lorenzo found a mulatto or maybe he was a quadroonhe was nearer yellow than brown who said he knew about a place where the main road ran through a valley wooded on both sides they go in there a bunch of em dont come out the other side the man said that sounds good frederick replied next question is can we get there without hanging out a sign telling the white folks why were heading that way lorenzo sent him an admiring glance thats the kind of thing you wouldntve worried about when we started neither would i chances are long as you live you better learn somethin from it frederick said only wasting your time if you dont got that right lorenzo said he put his head together with the lightskinned negro when the two men separated lorenzo was smiling the white men leading the atlantean army would not have rejoiced to see that smile to top it off lorenzo nodded i think we can do it without making the buckra suspicious that made frederick smile in turn every slave used the word buckra from time to time to refer to white men every negro slave frederick had known insisted it came from an african language no copperskin hed ever heard of claimed it sprang from terranova but that didnt stop copperskins from coming out with it and lorenzo and the highyellow local slave turned out to know what they were talking about the valleyhappy valley the local man called itwas the perfect place for an ambush fredericks fighters retreated toward the northeast and passed through the valley they seemed to at any rate a lot of them melted away to either side instead after the white atlanteans charged forward the insurrectionists would make them pay only one thing went wrong the atlantean soldiers didnt charge forward they paused at the southern end of happy valley and sent patrols forward to see what was going on in there at fredericks orders and lorenzos no one fired at the white scouts except what appeared to be the retreating rebel armys rear guard the idea was to make the white soldiers and militiamen believe the insurrectionists hadnt posted men in the woods to ravage them when they stormed after the withdrawing negroes and copperskins it was a good idea frederick remained convinced of that even afterwards so did lorenzobut then of course he would have because it was his the one trouble was it didnt work the white scouts seemed to know something smelled like rotting crayfish right away instead of pressing on after the tail of the withdrawing rebel army a tail now much stronger than the body of which it had been a part the white men studied the trees and ferns to either side of the dirt road they scratched their heads and rubbed their chins and generally acted like men who didnt like what they were seeing come on in the waters fine frederick thought at them as loudly as he could by the intent expression on lorenzos face the copperskin was also doing his best to will the white men forward which only went to show that willing someone forward was a hell of a lot easier to talk about than to do little by little the atlantean army advanced till it was close to the edge of the woods the field artillery unlimbered and sprayed as much of the forest as the guns could reach with cannon balls and canister frederick hoped his fighters had had the sense to scoot back when they saw the cannon taking aim at them if they hadnt it would be too late for some of them how many of those white bastards can you see lorenzo asked are they screening us so they can go around to our right or our left before we cipher out what theyre up to frederick wanted to say no he couldnt not when the atlantean army had repeatedly done that before he peered through a purloined spyglass then passed it to lorenzo doesnt seem like they are he said or does it look different to you after a long stare of his own lorenzo said i dont think they are harder to be sure though now that theyve got all those goddamned militiamen alongside the regulars i hate those sons of bitches well jesus christ who in his right mind doesnt frederick said the soldiers are just soldiers theyve got a job to do and they do it but most of the militiamen are the shitheels who bought and sold us they want to keep on doing it too and killing us and fucking us lorenzo added yes and those frederick said heavily are we going to let that keep on happening maybe they can still kill me weve already killed a lot of them but nowhere near enough the rest lorenzo shook his head a lock of his straight black hair flopped down over his eyes he brushed it back with the palm of his hand no ones gonna own me any more not ever again he was bound to be right about that if he and frederick were unlucky enough to be captured they wouldnt be returned to slavery as some of the men and women who followed them might no they would die whatever lingering instructive death the ingenuity of the whites whod taken them might devise frederick had always known such things were possible even likely that was why he always kept a last bullet for himself in his eightshooter what slave didnt have such knowledge fear of consequences fear of failing kept insurrections rarebut made them all the more desperate when they did break out right now frederick didnt care to dwell on all the things that might happen to him and his followers if they failed he aimed to keep from failing if he possibly could because he did he went back to dwelling on what the white atlantean soldiers and militiamen were up to weve taught em respect he said slowly theyve learned theyd better not just rush up like a herd of cows we carve em into steaks when they try too bad theyve figured that out lorenzo said they were easier to fight when they played the fool the white atlanteans had taught frederick a lesson too not to keep his own scouts too close to the main body of his army when the whites did try another flanking maneuver he found out about it in time to shift part of his own force and delay the enemy that let the rest of his men take new positions at their leisure seeing that the flanking move was doomed to fail the white men broke it off early both armies held their positions for a while frederick sent out raiders to try to wreck the enemys supply columns his own men foraged from the countryside he thought the whites would have more trouble doing that to his disappointment he turned out to be wrong when the whites got hungry they didnt stop at chickens and ducks and geese they ate turtles and frogs and snails the same as his men did maybe they drew the line at katydids but so what only proves what we already knew lorenzo said theyre nothing but a bunch of thieves what does that make us then frederick asked in wry amusement folks with sense the copperskin answered dont know about you but id sooner eat frog stew and fiddlehead ferns any day of the week not their rancid salt porkhe made a faceandwhat do they call themdesecrated vegetables desiccated frederick said whats the difference lorenzo asked frederick only shrugged he knew he had the word right though when you soaked the dried vegetables in water they regained a faint resemblance to what theyd been once upon a time you could eat them even if frederick like lorenzo had trouble seeing why anyone would want to lorenzo waved the question aside and came back to more important things what are we going to do to stop the white devils sure doesnt look like we can starve them back to new marseille no it doesnt frederick admitted glumly well then lorenzos voice seemed sharper than a serpents tooth the comparison came from the bible though frederick couldnt remember exactly where but he did have an answer for his copperskinned marshal even if lorenzo hadnt expected him to as long as we dont lose we win as long as we keep on fighting keep on making trouble we win sooner or later the united states of atlantisll decide we cost more than were worthtoo much money too much time too much blood thats when they decide they better start talkin instead of fightin you sound sure anyway by the way lorenzo said it he was far from sure himself he did unbend enough to ask how come you sound so sure on account of thats the way my grandfather licked the redcoats frederick answered he hung around and he hung around and he hung around till finally they got sick of the whole business thats why there are the united states of atlantis today and a fat lot of good they do us too lorenzo said oh things could be worse frederick said some of the islands south of herethe ones the spaniards still holdthe way they treat slaves makes atlantis seem like a kiss on the cheek and the empire of huybraseal in southern terranova thats supposed to be just as bad or maybe even worse but i aint in any one of those places im here lorenzo said pointedly if they catch me theyll kill me how does it get any worse than that frederick had had a similar thought not long before dont suppose it does he replied thing is then not to let em catch us right right lorenzos head bobbed up and down first sensible thing youve said in quite a whileyou know that well i try frederick said they both laughed why not they werefor the moment for as long as their followers could hold off the white soldiers or until the atlantean government got sick of what looked like an endless hopeless warfree men despite all the qualifications this tenuous freedom was as much as frederick had ever had while he had it he aimed to make the most of it jeremiah stafford fixed colonel sinapis with a glare that would have reduced any government functionary back in new hastings to a quivering pile of gelatin we arent pressing them anywhere near so hard as we might stafford said he could have made the statement sound no more ominous had he demanded have you stopped beating your wife whatever sinapis answered would be wrong or so stafford thought the officer however declined to turn gelatinous you wanted us to rush into that happy valley too your excellency sinapis said how many casualties do you suppose that would have cost us it would have been the worst disaster since austerlitz or maybe since arminius massacred the romans in the teutoberg forest in the year quinctilius varus give me back my legions stafford remembered the emperor augustus anguished cry from his own slog through suetonius in his university days consul stafford give me back my soldiers just didnt have the same ring but would it have come to that he didnt think so we could have whipped those savages he said im sure varus thought the same thing colonel sinapis replied sometimes your excellency you have to know when not to fight that was bound to be true in war as in a barroom argument all the same stafford said it sometimes seems to me that you abuse the privilege of not fighting colonel isnt that interesting colonel sinapis said then he turned on his heel and walked away stafford gaped hed been a senator before he was chosen consul and a prominent man before he was elected senator how could it be otherwise only prominent men reached the senate one measure of an atlanteans prominence was whether he reached the senate no one had had the nerve to be openly rude to him for many years come back here you he snapped as if sinapis were an uppity house slave the colonel stopped but did not return no he said calmly and made as if to walk off again before he could staffords voice went deadly cold have you a friend with whom my friends may discuss this matter further dueling might be illegal in every state of the usa but that did not make it extinct men from the south especially were still apt to defend their honor with pistols as calmly as before colonel sinapis said no again that made stafford gape once more the colonel continued your military regulations wisely forbid officers from dueling otherwise your excellency please believe me when i say that i should take no small pleasure from killing you good day sketching a salute he ambled off as if he had not a care in the world what had been in his eyes as he responded if it wasnt a pure wolfish pleasure at the idea of bloodshed stafford had never seen any such thing he reflected that he didnt know what kind of fighting man sinapis was army commanders seldom got to display their mettle in the front line maybe he was lucky not to find out the hard way maybe just maybe he was very lucky indeed i was not afraid he told himself he wondered how much that mattered or if it mattered at all a man might not fear an earthquake or a flood or a wildfirewhich wouldnt keep a natural disaster from killing him something told stafford that balthasar sinapis held about as much compassion as fire or flood or temblor how exactly had sinapis come to atlantis what were the circumstances under which hed lost his position in europe was it because some prominent mana government minister say or a princegot ventilated in a quarrel or a formal duel stafford hadnt thought so but his encounter with sinapis didnt stay quiet by the nature of things encounters like that never did everybody was talking about it the next day not much of what people said was true but when did that ever stop anyone i hear the good colonel wanted to load you into a cannon and fire you at the insurrectionists consul newton remarked no such thing stafford said which was truenot that truth had ever outrun a rumor with such dignity as he could muster the consul went on i keep trying to spur him to more activity against them from what folks are saying you keep trying to get yourself killed his colleague observed if you wade through everything folks are saying youll need to hold your nose and take a bath before you reach down to the truth stafford said the smell will tell you what youre wading in too you didnt challenge him to a duel then what yes of course i did i might have won too newtons raised eyebrows said everything that needed saying about how likely he thought that was and chances were he had a point too colonel sinapis was bound to get more pistol practice than stafford did and to have got more for many years if stafford was to win the duel he would need luck on his side sinapis would need only routine competence that he had the idea you know is to work with the colonel newton said if you make him hate you you wont have much luck with that hes a soldier soldiers do what you tell them to do stafford growled but he knew you caught more flies with honey than with vinegar there was a difference between obeying orders from a sense of duty and obeying them because you really wanted to the latter got good results the former again the other consul needed no words to let stafford know what he was thinking we are gaining ground against the insurrectionists you know newton said turning the subject were in deeper anyhow stafford answered im not so sure about gaining ground what they do to the wagon trains coming up from new marseille he angrily shook his head they have no business doing such things god damn them to the blackest pits of hell leland newton smiled thinly i never thought id learn how tasty frogandsnail stew could be he said i never thought i would have to find out stafford said we were guarding the wagon trains well for a while but things have slipped again if you put everything you have into going forward doing anything else with your soldiers is going to slip newton pointed out even with the militiamen along were stretched too thin for that not to happen stafford grunted and turned away almost as rudely as colonel sinapis had turned away from him doing anything else would have meant admitting some of the armys failures were his own fault and he was damned if he would newton didnt challenge him to a duel although no regulations except the laws of the united states of atlantis which a gentleman could ignore if he chose prevented one consul from meeting the other on the field of honor newtons voice pursued him dont you think wed be better off talking with the insurrectionists and seeing if there isnt some way we might all live together peacefully this is the only home any of us have you know that made stafford turn back we had been living together peacefully for many years under a system that assigned everyone his proper place from a white mans perspective newton broke in from a negros or a copperskins maybe not easier to be impressed i daresay if youre doing the buying and selling than if youre bought and sold you sound like youre selling nigger equality newton stafford said you may huckster as much as you please but im here to tell you im not buying oh i can see that the other consul answered better to let atlantis tear itself to pieces than to change one iota of the way we do things iota that goes all the way back to the theological controversies of the fourth century you know the difference between homoousios of the same nature and homoiousios of like nature one little letter and plenty of blood spilled over it a few hundred years from now will our quarrels seem as foolish no stafford said and then it would no doubt be pointless to remind you that our lord accepted the idea of slavery by newtons face it would indeed he credited the parts of the bible that pleased him and ignored the rest stafford didnt pause to wonder whether he did the same thing himself xvii none of the fifteen or so prisoners atlantean troops had taken in their latest skirmish with the insurrectionists seemed happy with his fate the blacks and copperskins were alive but hardly convinced they would stay that way for long maybe theyd heard the white soldiers werent hanging captured enemy fighters but they plainly had trouble believing it surveying them leland newton saw three who looked even more miserable than the rest two were copperskins the other a negro only one of them wore a skirt the other two had on baggy homespun trousers like their menfolk but no matter what they wore they were all of them women taken in arms with the men newton asked the sergeant in charge of the soldiers guarding the prisoners sure as hell were uh your excellency the underofficer pointed to the black woman that there bitch damn neardamn nearblew me a new asshole before paddy molloy jumped on her while she was reloading she fought him too till he clouted her a good one may i talk to her one of the sergeants gingery eyebrows jumped youre the consul sir seems to me you can do any old goddamned thing you please only proves youve never been consul newton thought but he didnt waste time explaining to the man with three stripes on the sleeve of his sweatstained gray tunic instead newton stepped past him and walked up to the captured insurrectionist whats your name he asked her by the way she looked at himlooked through him reallyhe might have been calling to her from a mile beyond the moon when she answered elizabeth her voice seemed to come from at least that far away newton pushed ahead anyhow is it true what the sergeant said did you fight against our soldiers the same way a man would have reckon i did she regained a little spirit as she added might still be doin it too cept the fuckin mick who grabbed me was too damn big to whup she couldnt have stood more than five feet two a knot on the side of her jaw said paddy molloy had clouted her a good one have they treated you the same as the men they took newton asked elizabeths first startled glance went to the two female copperskins whod been captured with her then her eyes swung back to consul newton he couldnt have said why but her gaze made him feel like an idiot that must have been what she thought too because she said you aint the brightest candle in the box is you what do you mean newton didnt think hed risen to the highest rank in atlantis by being stupid elizabeth did though as if to a halfwit she explained they dont throw the men down on the ground and hold their legs apart and screw em eight or ten or twenty times you may be white devils but i dont reckon yous cornholin devils they did that to you to all three of you molested you violated you the consul heard his own horror matteroffactly the captured female fighter nodded chance i took i knew that when i asked the menfolk to learn me to shoot didnt reckon id get caught though her grimace declared she wished she hadnt sides they liable to give me the clap or the pox newton hardly noticed that he stormed back to the white sergeant did you and your troops take unfair advantage of those women he thundered as full of righteous wrath as jehovah watching the children of israel bow down before the golden calf unfair dont look that way to me sir the sergeant seemed to think newton was an idiot too like elizabeth he wasnt shy about telling him why jesus christ they were doing their damnedest to murder the lot of us were we supposed to kiss em on the cheek and invite em to a waltz like no but you werent supposed to to rape them either newton had to fight to get the dreadful word out chance they take if they fire at us the underofficer and elizabeth used the same brutal logic seeing he would get no satisfactionunder the circumstances perhaps not the perfect wordthere newton stormed off to talk to a captain the young officer only shrugged what do you expect from men who find women in arms against them your excellency civilized behavior newton suggested sarcasm rolled off the captains back war is not a civilized business he said it has its rules and customs on the whole the insurrectionists have lived up to them well what do you want me to do about it put em up on charges the captain asked that was exactly what newton wanted but the younger mans laughter told him he wouldnt get itnot here anyhow fuming he stomped away to talk to colonel sinapis the colonel had given consul stafford a hard time so newton assumed he would find him reasonable he didnt sinapis said the soldiers took the women after the women fought against them thats right newton said its disgraceful its barbaric its it is to be expected sinapis interrupted officers may be gentlemen your regulations say they are so do the ones in most of the kingdoms of europe perhaps that makes it so but soldiers my dear fellow the duke of wellington a very fine commander even if he is an englishman calls them the scum of the earth believe me your excellency he knows what he is talking about too all the more reason to punish them harshly when they do something this outrageous newton exclaimed outrageous sinapis tossed his head as he often did where a native atlantean would have shaken it i think not this is revenge what would you do if a woman tried to shoot you not that i hope newton answered sinapis studied him the colonels eyes lingeredinsultingly longon his crotch at last sinapis said it could be that you would not but a great many men would and i see no point to punishing them for it that would cause the army more problems than it would solve what if the women they ravished were white the consul from croydon demanded violating women for the sport of it no good officer can allow that if white women had tried to kill our troops in combat though that would be the womens lookout and their misfortune sinapis said he was consistent anyhowif he was telling the truth if he wasnt his face didnt know about it which if he was any kind of card player meant nothing i had hoped for more cooperation from you colonel newton said reproachfully i had hoped for more sense from you your excellency sinapis replied we do not always get what we hope for though do we evidently not newton said please make sure however that your soldiers do not molest these women again now that the heat of battle has cooled i believe i can do that very well your excellency sinapis delivered a precise salute and please issue orders that other women taken prisoner in combat are not to be violated newton continued the colonels mouth twisted under the eaves of his drooping mustache i dislike giving orders sure to be ignored it weakens discipline which is the last thing any army needs if you issue them strongly enough the men will follow them newton said you have never been a soldier you have never tried to lead soldiers this is as plain as the nose on your faceas plain as the nose on my face even sinapis stroked his formidable proboscis i am very sorry but issuing those orders is a waste of time newtons voice went hard and flat do it anyway yes your excellency by contrast sinapis voice held no expression at all this time his salute seemed more reproachful than anything else leland newton didnt care some things he would not put up with and this was one of them whether the orders really would do any good he preferred not to think about a copperskin brought a hatchet down on a flapjack turtles neck pouring blood the turtle went into its death spasm the head flew some distance from the body its fearsome jaws opened and closed opened and closed no one got anywhere near it like a snakes it could bite for some time after being detached and those jaws could easily take off a finger to white folks flapjack turtle was something you ate when you couldnt get beef or pork or mutton or poultry as a house slave frederick radcliff had something of the same attitude field hands eked out the rations their masters gave them with anything they could get their hands on ill take this to the girls now the copperskin said with a grin picking up the turtles carcass the legs still flailed feebly they didnt want to believe the beast was dead dont let them hear you call them that joaquin frederick said you wont like what happens if they do i aint afraid of them joaquin swaggered off any man who aint afraid of womenhe aint as smart as he ought to be frederick remarked to lorenzo yeah there is that lorenzos chuckle sounded distinctly wry always knew they could fightany fella ever had anything to do with em knows that but i never reckoned they could fight like this with guns and everything well neither did i frederick said dont suppose the white soldiers reckoned they could either last surprise some of those bastards ever got lorenzo said good thing too oh sure frederick agreed kind of tough on the gals the whites catch though lorenzo nodded but not with much sympathy they knew what they was gettin into and they knew what was liable to get into them if somethin went wrong white folks dont cornhole the ordinary fighters they catch frederick said we dont cornhole their fighters when we catch em they shouldnt ought to fuck the gals its different lorenzo said and frederick found himself nodding he couldnt have said just how it was different but he also felt it was maybe because most men didnt enjoy cornholing other men where any man who was a man would jump on a woman any chance he got still and all he said slowly it doesnt seem right we been fightin straight up so have the white soldiers pretty much whole bunch of fellas jumpin on a woman on account of she was carryin a gunthat aint straight up lorenzos eyes slid toward the cooking fires the direction in which the younger copperskin with the flapjack turtle had gone slyly he said you ought to go sing your song over there youd have all those pretty young gals crawlin under the sheets with you fastern you could he snapped his fingers thats what i need all right frederick rolled his eyes as any middleaged man would have he thought about an embarrassment of riches even were the spirit willing the flesh was definitely weak and his spirit wasnt so willing reckon helend have herself a thing or three to say about em give her one in the chops thatll make her shut her big yap damned if it wont lorenzo found simple answers for all worries except military ones hed lived with a lot of different women while he was a field handwith none for more than a couple of years now that he was a general or as close to a general as any man in the free republic of atlantis was he cut as wide a swath through the women whod joined the insurrection as a man his age could hope to do but frederick didnt want to live like that helen and me we done got along good for a hell of a long time why should i want to change now cause fresh pussys more fun than the same old thing every goddamned time yes lorenzo had an answer for everything one trouble frederick thought it was the wrong answer if lying down with someone whose likes you knew and who knew what pleased you wasnt better than sleeping with a stranger then it wasnt that was all some menand some womenpreferred the one some the other frederick saw no point to arguing about it would you argue about liking duck better than pork he did amble over toward the fires himself behind him lorenzo laughed a filthy laugh in spite of himself fredericks back stiffened that only made lorenzo laugh harder its the tribune one of the cooking women said stew wont be ready for a while yet another one told him even as she spoke chunks of turtle meat went into a big iron pot its all right im just seein how things are going i guess youd say frederick answered how about that admiration filled the copperskinned womans voice by the way she eyed him frederick didnt think hed have to work very hard to get her into his bed but no matter what lorenzo thought that wasnt what he had in mind all the people doing the cooking were women both they and the men seemed to take that for granted frederick wondered why it wasnt as if men couldnt cook most boss cooks all through the slaveholding states were men frederick sadly remembered davey hed been someone to reckon with somebody whod had a lot of influence on the master and mistress the way to the heart didor couldgo through the stomach that had been fancy cooking though women handled the plain job men cooked for superiors women for equals maybe that was what was going on here you couldnt get much plainer cooking or cooking more intended for equals than what went into feeding an army frederick was ready to fight to the death to make negroes and copperskins equal to whites in atlantis that women might be equal to men had hardly crossed his mind up till now as it did he shook his head white men black men and copperskinned men were all the same under the skin anybody well anybody who wasnt a white slaveholder could see that but men and women men and women were different anybody could see that too hadnt people of all colors been telling stories and making jokes about the differences since the beginning of time in the early days of the uprising some of the men might have been hearing those old jokes inside their heads they loudly doubted that women had any business picking up rifle muskets and taking potshots at white soldiers and they plainly expected the women to break and run when soldiers fired at them well they knew better now some women had run when the shooting picked upbut so had some men women mostly werent as big or as strong as men so they had trouble fighting hand to hand but the two sides didnt fight hand to hand all that often which meant that mattered less than frederick had feared it would wounded women shrieked on higher notes than wounded men still and all though no one whod seen women in action would claim they couldnt fight since they could didnt that argue that a lot of other differences were smaller than they seemed at first glance frederick rubbed his chin thanks to his famous grandfather his beard was thicker than most negroes he could have done without that part of victor radcliffs legacy what would his fellow fighters say if he told them that after they won the war for freedom against the atlantean army they would have to give women the same freedom freedom to vote to hold property to divorce for all the same reasons they wouldnt like it not even a little which argued that he should keep his big mouth shut and if you keep it shut dont you slam the door on freedom same as the whites want to do that was an interesting questionno two ways about it the way it looked to him if he tried to win everything at once he only increased his chances of winning nothing at all once he established the principle that negroes and copperskins had the right to be something more than property throughout the usa before too long someone should get around to establishing the principle that women had the right to be more than property yes that would be easy wouldnt it of course it would frederick was sure of it and because he was he decided not to try to push his followers any further than they were likely to want to go on their own equal rights for women could wait a while nigger equality mudface equality as usual jeremiah stafford freighted the phrases with as much obscenity as they would carry and a little more besides no white man from south of the stour will put up with that nonsense for a minute and you know it perfectly well leland newton only raised an eyebrow and rustled the latest batch of newspapers that had come into camp but there is more to the united states of atlantis than white men from south of the stour and the rest of the people are getting damned sick of a war going nowhere the other consul said if they get sick of spending money on it the states south of the stour can fight it by themselvesand good luck to them after an outright triumph by the insurrectionists that was what stafford feared most if we dont get help from the rest of the country why should we bother staying attached to it he said dont let the door hit you in the backside when you leave newton said cheerfully which was also nothing stafford wanted to hear and that cheery tone rasped worse than the words could the southern half of atlantisthe smaller half the poorer half the less populous half the half racked by servile insurrectionmake a go of things on its own consul stafford had no idea if we leave and if we win our fight how many niggers and mudfaces do you suppose well leave alive afterwards he said i couldnt begin to guess consul newton asked but if you murder them all what happens to your precious social system then ive asked you that before who brings in your crops who cuts your hair who cooks your supper how soon before youre bankrupt because your wonderful whites from south of the stour wont do nigger work to save their lives those were all intriguing questions much more intriguing than stafford wished they were even so he said wed be taking care of things our own way nothing else matters then what am i doing here what are all the soldiers from north of the stour doing here newton asked if you dont want our help well leave believe meand well be glad to do it too we want your help we deserve it by god stafford said but if you dont care to give it well go on by ourselves they scowled at each other stafford had the feeling they were talking past each other as they had so often and for so long in new hastings he also had the feeling this was the worst possible time for them to be doing that the trouble was he didnt know how to fix it newton would not take him seriously he didnt think newton took himself seriously and doubting that stafford couldnt take newton seriously either since he could he saw only one thing to do win the fight against the insurrectionists while the atlantean army remained opposed to them but that meant getting colonel sinapis to do something with it and stafford was unhappily aware how much he hadnt endeared himself to the colonel he tried to take a light tone when he asked sinapis if you arent using the army may i borrow it for a little while by the way the colonels eyebrows came down and together by the way his mouth tightened to a bloodless line stafford knew the approach had failed i am using it your excellency in case you had not noticed sinapis answered in a voice like winter you arent using it enough stafford told him there sir we differ colonel sinapis said yes we do stafford agreed grimly levity hadnt reached the somber officer maybe bluntness would see here colonel do you want the united states of atlantis to fall to pieces before your eyes he was appalled when sinapis obviously gave the question serious consideration and he was even more appalled when the army commander shrugged his rather narrow shoulders meaning no disrespect your excellency sinapis said but you will please believe me when i tell you i have seen far worse things stafford almost asked him what could be worse than a republica republic often called the hope of both europe and terranovadissolving into chaos only one thing made him hesitate he feared balthasar sinapis would tell him instead then he tried a different road let me put that another way colonel do you want to take the blame when the united states of atlantis fall to pieces before your eyes and why should i sinapis rumbled when these things happen there is usually plenty of blame to go around he was a cool customer all right well stafford had already discovered that to his own discomfiture why ill tell you why colonel because if this army does not put down the insurrection in a hurry its liable to be recalled if it is the southern states will go on fighting the war on their own even if that means leaving the usa that is what it will mean too plenty of blame to go around yes but a lot of it will stick to you he waited hed told the truth as he saw it how much that meant to colonel sinapis or whether it meant anything at all to him hed just have to see hed got sinapis attention anyhow the officer stroked his mustache hed done something that made europe too warm for him stafford still didnt know what it was but it must have been something juicy if sinapis got another big blot on his escutcheon who would hire him after he left atlantis the chinese maybe maybe stafford didnt think even the most raggedy principality in southern terranova would take the chance after a long long pause sinapis said you have an unpleasant way of making your points i tried a pleasant way colonel you took no notice of it stafford answered sinapis muttered to himself stafford didnt think it was in english that might have beenprobably wasjust as well what stafford didnt understand he didnt have to respond to another pause followed then the colonel returned to a language the consul could follow what do you want me to do now were getting somewhere stafford didnt say it out loud if he had he would have lost his man sinapis pride was even touchier than that of a grandee from the state of gernika all the consul said was this is what ive got in mind rifle muskets cracked cannon thundered lorenzos mouth twisted into a frown damned white devils are getting pushy he said they are frederick radcliff agreed how do we make them sorry for it now the copperskin smiled and broadly you do know the questions to ask im counting on you to know the answers i need frederick said if you dont weve got trouble ill talk to people who know the ground see what we can do lorenzo said depends on what they tell me and it depends on how pushy the soldiers are getting if its only some chances are theyll give us more to worry about than they have been but if theyve decided they dont have to worry about us any more if thats what theyve decided its up to us to show em how big a mistake theyve made frederick said there you go lorenzo smiled again his lips were as thin as a white mans which made this expression seem uncommonly cruel to frederick lorenzo went on i reckon theyre jumpy all right they think theyve got to squash us today this minute the longer the war goes on the more they figure theyre losing he didnt say that the whites really were losing that wasnt obvious but if they thought they were losing they might as well have been persuading them that they couldnt put down the insurrection was a big part maybe the biggest part of what frederick wanted to do it had worked for his grandfather against the english how sweet if it worked for him now against the atlanteansagainst his grandfathers white relations victor radcliff hadnt had any white children who lived frederick was his only direct descendant a piece of property he thought thats all i am to the whites had his grandmother been white even if she werent victor radcliffs wife frederick sighed hed already been over that ground too many times in his mind a runner came back from the insurrectionists picket line a white soldier would have saluted before reporting this negro didnt bother white folks is bangin away like nobodys business he said cannons blowin holes in our line soldiers comin right on through em once theys blown either we needs more muskets down where the fightins at or we needs to git outa there frederick and lorenzo looked at each other slowly lorenzo said we keep pullin back we lure em on get em to a place where we can really hurt em or maybe thats what theyre after frederick responded worry in his voice theyre trying to get us to a place where they can really put the screws to us well sure they are lorenzo sounded amused which struck frederick as taking optimism to an extreme the copperskin went on we got to do it to them and not let them do it to us so what are we supposed to do down there the messenger asked you want we should fall back yes fall back frederick hoped that was the right answer if it wasnt hed just hurt his own side hed been thinking about the differences between men and women his male fighters followed the orders he and lorenzo gave without much backtalk the women whod taken up arms against the white soldiers almost mutinied we want to kill them fuckers a copperskinned woman cried after what they done to us we want to shoot their balls off or cut em off a black woman added the other women with rifle muskets and pistols shrilled furious agreement were gonna do that honest to god we are frederick realized he sounded as if he was pleading then he realized he was pleading he went right on doing it too weve got to find a better spot thats all weve got to find a spot where we can punch a hole in them not the other way around like theyre doin here we can whip em we will this here just isnt the right place you better be right the copperskinned woman warned yeah you better be else we gonna shoot your balls off again her comrades ululated to show they were with her i aint worried about that frederick said how come some of the women demanded while others asked why not on account of if we dont win the white soldiersll string me up and lorenzo here with me frederick answered whatever happens to me after that i aint gonna care about it one way or the other thats just it said the negro woman whod complained before they catch you they kill you and then its over they catch us our bad times just startin the other women nodded but after theyd had their say they fell back with the men hey that was fun wasnt it lorenzo said now i remember how come i never wanted to be tribune fun matter of fact no frederick said lorenzo laughed not that hed been joking he went on one more thing i got to do is all he did it so did lorenzo the copperskin extracted the free republic of atlantis fighters as neatly and almost as painlessly as a dentist could extract a tooth using newfangled ether or chloroform but the soldiers kept pushing after them showing determination frederick hadnt seen from them before they mean it this time he said unhappily lorenzo nodded they do damn them now we have to make them sorry for meaning itif we can frederick wished he hadnt added those last three words he made himself nod too yes he said if leland newton didnt know what his consular colleague had done to light a fire under colonel sinapis but jeremiah stafford must have done something the atlantean soldiersand especially the militiamen whod joined forces with sinapis regularsadvanced with more dash than theyd shown since crossing the little muddy part of thatno small part newton judgedcame from their commander sinapis heart hadnt been in the fight for some time it was now and the whites were making progress they were making more than newton had thought they could as a matter of fact the insurrectionists skirmished and fell back skirmished and fell back how long could they keep falling back before they started falling apart consul newton had wondered about that more than once and each time the rebels resilience surprised him could they surprise him again he would be surprised if they could sinapis drive pushed the negroes and copperskins back into some of the least known least settled parts of atlantis newton wouldnt have been surprised to see honkers grazing on some of these meadows audubon had not many years before no one sawor shotany of the big flightless birds but a redcrested eagle did tear up a soldiers back with its claws and fierce beak if the mans friend hadnt driven it off with a fallen branch it probably would have torn out his kidneys audubon and other older naturalists said honkers were the atlantean national birds favorite prey though people or sheep would do at a pinch one thing was sure as honkers had declined so had redcrested eagles as best they could surgeons patched up the soldier this one had attacked do you think hell pull through newton asked if the wounds dont fester he should one of them answered seeing a splash of the soldiers blood on the back of his hand that he hadnt washed away he spat on it and wiped it off with a rag not as deep as bullet wounds his colleague agreed tossing a scalpel into a tin basin of river water nasty all the same though im not sorry weve killed most of those damned eaglesill tell you that theyre vicious brutes nothing but vicious brutes in this part of the country the first surgeon said he was a tubby man with muttonchop whiskers that didnt suit the shape of his face the eagle the niggers by the way he talked he came from somewhere south of the stour i wouldnt be surprised if the insurrectionists say the same thing about us newton remarked well your excellency people can say any tomfool thing they please the surgeon answered but saying it doesnt make it so his chest puffed out like a pouter pigeons so that it almost projected beyond his belly he seemed to think hed just said something wonderful newton didnt as you demonstrate he replied and walked away he felt the rotund surgeons eyes boring into his back as if they were a redcrested eagles claws but the wounds they left behind tore only his imagination the army kept pushing ahead against resistance that seemed to fade more with each passing day jeremiah stafford was inclined to gloat it may have taken longer than i thought it would at first but weve finally got the insurrectionists where we want them he declared even if we do have we got the insurrection where we want it newton asked stafford sent him a look he would have been as glad not to have what are you going on about now the other consul demanded you know as well as i do newton said the slaves in frederick radcliffs army arent the only ones in arms theres fighting wherever men and women are enslaved hed hoped that harsh way of putting things would make stafford feel guilty but no such luck once we smash the head the body will die you wait and see stafford said confidently and i think we will smash it too newton was less sure they wouldnt than he had been a couple of weeks earlier how did you manage to um inspire colonel sinapis he asked trade secret his colleague said smugly oh come on you sound like a drummer for a patent medicine newton said when they say their ingredients are a trade secret they just mean they have more opium than the other fellows potion does if youd put that much poppy juice into the good colonel hed be too sleepy to move let alone fight he got a chuckle out of stafford anyhow opium isnt the drug i used i found something stronger i didnt know there was anything newton said opium really works and thats more than you can say for most of the medicines the quacks have well yes stafford allowed but threatening dear colonel sinapis reputation turned out to work even better had anyone ever used dear as less of an endearment consul newton didnt think so what did you do i told him that if the southern states left the usa because he didnt go after the insurrectionists hard enough hed get the blame stafford said he would too by god whod hire him after that good question newton said slowly and so it was well a man who was a bad politicianwhich is to say a man who didnt understand what made other men tickwasnt likely to become consul of the united states of atlantis jeremiah stafford might often be mistaken as far as newton was concerned stafford usually was but that didnt make him a fool i only wish i hadnt needed so long to see which lever to pull he said now the insurrection might be over and done with if id figured it out sooner or we might have blundered into worse trouble than we really did find newton said i dont think so stafford shook his head its all over but the shouting the insurrectionists will get whats coming to them and high time too xviii a head to the northeast jeremiah stafford could see the green ridge mountains swelling up against the sky they loomed taller than they had just a couple of days before the insurrectionists kept giving ground for a moment stafford almost forgot about the insurrectionists hed never dreamt he would see the mountains from this anglefrom the back side to any man who lived east of them as most atlanteans didbut here they were and here almost in their rolling foothills the negroes and copperskins whod caused the usa to say nothing of jeremiah stafford in his own person so much grief were making what had to be their last stand stafford had all kinds of reasons for thinking it had to be ifno whenthe atlantean army finished smashing them they surely please god would be able to fight no more and atlantis needed it to be their last stand too because if it wasnt the army would likely be recalled not long after that happened when it did if it did the country would probably start falling apart the insurrectionists seemed convinced this was their last chance too theyd run up earthworks at the far end of the low wide valley that led toward the mountains they might have been challenging the white atlantean regulars and militiamen if you want us youll have to dig us out their actions said and if you try digging us out youll have to pay the price stafford turned to balthasar sinapis who stood near him examining the trenches and ramparts through a spyglass how strong are they the consul asked hard to tell colonel sinapis answered the ground rises as you move that waynot much but some enough so i have trouble seeing whatever they may be hiding there it wont be much stafford said confidently now that weve started driving them they havent been able to slow us down let alone stop us have they he waited sinapis couldnt very well do anything but dip his head in assent the officer also couldnt help adding because they havent your excellency doesnt mean they cant devil it doesnt stafford retorted theyre whipped now they have to know it too or they wouldnt hide behind earthworks we go in we slaughter them and theres an end to it let there be an end to it o lord why are you so sure leland newton asked by the way the words came out he knew the answer as well as stafford did because this has to be the end because the country cant stand any more stafford didnt say that not when the other consul already knew it he spoke to sinapis as if newton hadnt said a word they arent waiting in the bushes to ambush us as we advance you know they arentyou ran enough scouts through the bushes i needed to do it too the colonel replied with dignity he waved toward the gently sloping sides of the valley first to one then to the other this is exactly the sort of terrain they are fond of using for an ambuscade but they didnt did they stafford said colonel sinapis couldnt very well claim the contrary stafford pressed his advantage and the reason they didnt is that theyre too beaten down too hard pressed the foxes may have given us a good chase but weve run them to earth now well bury them in it youve always thought we would have an easier time against them than we turned out to newton said yes and so stafford answered coolly as soon as we root them out of their holes here weve won you never thought we could do it at all it may have come later than i wanted but not too late dont let it be too late if newton wanted to argue stafford was ready it was his own day to hold final authority so the arguments didnt matter but newton didnt say anything more as it had been when caesar crossed the rubicon the die was cast form up the men colonel and send them forward stafford told sinapis weve come this far lets get it over with sinapis gave back a precise salute as you say your excellency he might have been a valet answering a rich englishman then he gave the regular officers and militia commanders their orders the regulars would follow them the militiamen might or might not sinapis kept them on the wings and in the rear where any failures ought to matter least bugles blared the regular soldiers moved to their places like marionettes on strings the militiamen had improved over the course of this campaign despite profane shepherding from their officers and sergeants they were still slower and sloppier than the men who made their living from war but so what stafford told himself theyll all roll over the insurrectionists and then well glue things back together we can still do it im sure we can how much work had the insurrectionists put into their earthworks while they shoveled one copperskin complained to frederick radcliff i dont reckon the overseers ever drove us this hard then he flung another spadeful of earth up onto the growing rampart in front of their trench and frederick just looked back at him and answered good when the other man stared frederick had condescended to explain goddamned overseers never needed you as much as i do now that seemed to satisfy the copperskin who went back to digging without another word now frederick and lorenzo looked out over the rampart at the white men mustering against them we can still do it frederick said im sure we can i hope we can lorenzo said i hope like anything we can fredericks head swung away from the atlantean soldiers and toward his own amateur marshal youre the one who set this up he reminded him i know i know now im the one whos worrying about it tooall right lorenzo said if it goes wrong theyll roll over us ever since the uprising started weve known that could happen frederick said as long as we can shoot ourselves or shoot each other before they get their hands on us well be fine fine lorenzo bared his teeth in something halfway between a smile and a snarl is that what you call it these days well be dead is what well be weve been dead ever since i took the hoe to matthew and the rest of you followed me back to the big house stead of whompin me to death with your spades frederick answered you know it as well as i do too well yeah lorenzo grudged a nod dont mean i got to like it if you liked it they wouldve shoveled dirt over you by now they wouldve shoveled dirt over us all by now frederick said lorenzo stared out at the white soldiers the discipline with which they formed their ranks was daunting it aint like theyve quit trying the copperskin said i know frederick raised his voice so all the fighters in the trench negroes and copperskins men and women could hear him weve got to hold them here no matter what weve got to if they break through this line were screwed so do whatever you can you want to be free you want to stay free you want your children to be free if youve got anyor even if you dont yetthis here may be the place where you can make it real you ready yeah the answering shout wasnt so loud as it might have been the fighters could watch the white men deploying out beyond riflemusket range too it was intimidating beyond any possible fragment of doubt it was meant to be a bugle rang out ordering the atlantean soldiers and militiamen forward the note was pure and sweet almost like birdsong frederick spied a flash of gold that had to be sunlight sparking off the horns polished bell here they come somebody said after a couple of heartbeats frederick realized that was his own voice the white mens cannon started roaring frederick hated artillery more than anything elsemostly because hed never figured out how to match it the white atlanteans had it the insurrectionists didntthey just had to endure it in screamed the cannonballs some of them flew long others thudded intoand sometimes smashed throughthe rampart in front of the trenches a couple of them smashed into fighters after smashing through dirt screams rose up the insurrectionists didnt have much in the way of surgeons herb women made poultices to keep wounds from going bad men whod been butchers could lop off shattered limbs ether they hadnt managed to steal any coming up from new marseille they relied on rum and thick leather straps to muffle pain if the atlantean artillerists had had guns that could loft shells over the rampart and down into the trench they would have hurt the insurrectionists worse they did all they could with what they did have frederick thought the cannonading would never end and of course one minute under fire seemed as long as a week of ordinary life or maybe a year but the insurrectionists couldnt cower they would die if they did up lorenzo yelled reminding them up and shoot the more of em you shoot before they get close the fewer youll have to stick the fewer who can get close and shoot you he meant frederick could see why he didnt care to put it that way men who worried about what happened to their own precious flesh wouldnt be inclined to let gunfire come anywhere close to it who in hisor herright mind would be so inclined rifle muskets bellowed smoke rose in thick fireworkssmelling clouds here and there white men fell overbut only here and there the rest kept coming the bright morning sun shone off their bayonets brighter than it had off the bugle but silver instead of gold shoot the bastards lorenzo howled cant let em come close not with the numbers theyve got kill em dead the insurrectionists did their best by now they could fire almost as fast as the white regulars practice hadnt made regulars of the negroes and copperskins but it hadnt missed by much and they were firing from behind the rampart so they exposed only their heads and sometimes their shoulders to the white atlanteans not many of the whites were shooting the regulars in the center trudged toward the ramparts as if theyd never heard of longarms here and there a militiaman raised his piece to his shoulder and blasted away as he advanced it wasnt exactly aimed fire but that didnt exactly matter with lots of bullets flying around the law of averages said some wouldnt be wasted one cracked past frederick close enough so he felt or thought he felt the wind of its passage his knees bent in the involuntary genuflection almost everyone accorded near misses fifty feet down the trench a negro half his age screeched jumped in the air and clapped a hand to his bleeding shoulder whump a cannon ball slammed into the rampart throwing up a shower of dirt the blacks and copperskins it had protected rubbed at their eyes and spat out gritthose who still had enough saliva to spit anyhow those damned fieldpieces kept on pounding away hurrah the regulars shouted as they came closer hurrah hurrah some of the militiamen joined the rhythmic chant others howled like dogs baying at the moon or yelled honk honk if real honkers had sounded like that theyd probably all laughed themselves to death for all the fierce and wouldbe fierce cheers more and more white men fell as they neared the rebels strongpoint the rest of the soldiers leaned forward and slowed down as if they were walking into a heavy wind they were bravehating them frederick knew that much too well but not all the bravery in the world could bring troops up to a rampart if the fire from behind it was hot enough the insurrectionists could deliver that kind of fire their enemies officers had seen charges fail before they must have realized this one was liable to do the same almost at the same moment several of them raised their voices to call out orders the men obediently halted you could really do things with soldiers like that yes a couple of them fell over one kicking another ominously still the rest of the first rank went to one knee the second rank crouched above them the third rank stood straight at another shouted command they delivered a volley then they stood up as the next three ranks passed through them and delivered another one after that cheering the regulars resumed their advance they hurt fredericks men volleying at another army out in the open odds were they would have ruined it and left it wide open for a charge they couldnt bring that off here no matter how much they must have wanted to the rampart did its job saving the insurrectionists untold dead and wounded which might turn out to make no difference if the regulars and militiamen got over the rampart and broke the defenders behind it nothing would matter much when frederick asked lorenzo should be any time now the copperskin said better be frederick said the negroes and copperskins kept firing at the atlantean regulars and militiamen despite the volleys the regulars couldnt reach the rampartnot at the first try anyhow if they tried again frederick wanted to ask when again but he and lorenzo had done what they could now they had to hope theyd done it right consul newton was getting sick of listening to consul stafford gloat about what would happen to the insurrectionists stafford cheered as the white atlanteans came close to storming the low earthen wall frederick radcliffs followers had thrown up next time theyll get over stafford exulted and then he made twohanded thrusting motions as if wielding a bayoneted rifle musket hed done that before too newton was also sick of it when he turned away from the other consul he might have been the first white man to spot the negroes and copperskins coming over the low rise that topped one side of the valley uhoh he said now what are you croaking about stafford demanded you sound like a frog in springtimeknow that instead of answering newton pointed then he looked toward the other valley rim insurrectionists were swarming down over that one too somehow hed thought they might be uhoh stafford said then as if impelled by a lodestone his head swung in the other direction as newtons had before it uhoh he croaked again who sounds like a frog now newton couldnt resist the gibe truth to tell he hardly tried even when things looked to be coming to pieces he could enjoy needling his opposite number only trouble was stafford didnt notice he was being needled they tricked us he cried fury and astonishment warring in his voice i didnt know that wasnt in the rules newton answered part of him realized he was much too likely to get killed in the next hour if you were going to die shouldnt you die with a bon mot on your lips then again why should you youd be just as dead one way as the other and all the people who heard your lastminute wit seemed much too likely to end up dead with you who would send your cleverness on to your loved ones and to the history books the soldiers needed a few seconds longer than the consuls to see that they were suddenly facing a flank attack their attention had been even more strongly focused on the fight in front of them the fight at the rampart the insurrectionists must have planned it that way jeremiah stafford was absolutely rightno dead right the slaves had tricked the professional soldiers now the professionals had to find some way to fix itif they could they didnt have long to think things over either the insurrectionists were already starting to pour enfilading fire into the militiamen on either wing of the atlantean army bullets aimed at the end of a row of men were much more likely to bite than those aimed from the front colonel sinapis wasnt usually a demonstrative sort he started hopping around and waving his arms and shouting like a man possessedor possibly like a man with his trousers on fire the artillerists frantically swung their guns toward the brushy patchily wooded sides of the valley they started banging away at the negroes and copperskins on the armys flank artillery was the one arm the atlantean force had that the rebels lacked how much good it would do here though struck leland newton as being open to doubt the fighters on the slopes were in loose order cannonballs couldnt knock them over six or eight at a time as they could against troops advancing close together over open ground maybe sinapis hoped he could scare the insurrectionists away or at least scare them into shooting badly or maybeeven more worrisome thoughthe simply had no better schemes that turned out not to be true he pulled the militiamen away from the assault on the rampart and sent them upslope against the flankers but that exposed them to enfilading fire from the rebels behind the earthwork the militiamen showed reckless courage manymaybe even mostof them were panting for vengeance against what they saw as their uprisen property none of that helped them much rifle muskets inflicted more punishment than flesh and blood could bear neither militiamen nor regulars had been able to get over the rampart and the militiamen also werent able to get in among the rebels on the slopes they came close the bodies they left there marks like those of high tide on a beach showed how very close they came close counted in horseshoes in war it sometimes proved worse than not trying at all watching the militiamen reel down the slope away from the concealed insurrectionists who murdered them one after another consul stafford groaned like a man under the lash my god he said we are ruinedruined i tell you newton this whole valley is a killing ground newton said which only put the same thing another way damn his fumblefingered soul sinapis blundered right into it too stafford groaned if he did you helped push him along newton said you were bragging that you lit a fire under him you told me how clever you were how you got him to move when he might not have wanted to when you threatened to blame him if atlantis fell apart because he didnt break the rebellion right this minute the rebellion is breaking us stafford didnt call him a liar he didnt call him a feebleminded twit either if that silence wasnt a telling measure of the other consuls despair newton had no idea what would be up a few hundred yards ahead of them the regulars rushed the rampart again if the white atlanteans could break any part of the trap they might be able to wreck the whole thing if but muzzle flashes on the rampart spat toward the white men like tongues of fire shot from dragons mouths and bullets flew farther than dragonfire ever could again the regulars had to sag back short of their goal an officer near colonel sinapis was trying to tell him something the mans knees suddenly gave way his hat fell off as he sagged to the ground he wriggled for a little while but not for long theyre murdering us murdering stafford said they are newton couldnt disagree he did think the officer was liable to be lucky as such things went the poor fellow had died fast and might not even have known he was hit not every man who stopped a bullet had such good fortune newton had seen too many ghastly wounds and too many men suffering from them for too long to hold any illusions on that score if we cant stop them good lord what will become of the country after this stafford choked out the words but he did bring them forth newton had to respect him for that now the other consul had found his bon mot in the face of death how much good it would do him and whether anyone hereabouts would survive to remember it tomorrow were a couple of questions whose answers it seemed better not to contemplate jeremiah stafford had a bullet a charge of gunpowder and a percussion cap ready in each cylinder of his eightshooter how much good theyd do him against enemies armed with rifle muskets that far outranged his revolver he didnt care to think about he and consul newton both went up to huddle close to the rear of the regular contingent maybe misery loved company maybe that was the safest place to be in these parts not that any place in these parts counted as particularly safe not if you were a white man newtons accusation burned like vitriol inside staffords soul stafford had pushed balthasar sinapis as hard as he could he had made the colonel go forward where sinapis would have hesitated or even halted on his own it had workedup till now up till now three of the most mournful and miserable words in the english language then stafford stopped thinking of mourning and misery in the abstract a lieutenant about twenty feet away from him cried out twisted an arm to try to clutch at the small of his back and slowly crumpled to his knees and then to the ground a moment later a private soldier went down also shot in the back again newton realized what was going on before stafford did newton didnt automatically assume the insurrectionists were stupid theyve got men behind us too he said glumly and they did the copperskins and blacks back there had done some quick rough entrenching before they opened up on the white atlanteans no one had tried to stop them no one had even noticed them till they started shooting they could shoot at the whites with almost as much protection as the insurrectionists behind the ramparts had and now theyd surrounded the whites a classical education came in handy all kinds of ways even in this moment of despair stafford knew just what he and his comrades were facing it wasnt as if such things hadnt happened before even if that disaster might have stayed unmatched for two thousand years and more cannae stafford groaned this is another cannae hannibal had surrounded and slaughtered several roman legions at cannae during the second punic war the battle was the carthaginians masterpiece it was about as good a job as any general could do and here on a smaller scale frederick radcliff had just recreated it of course carthage didnt win the second punic war but right at the moment jeremiah stafford had no idea how the united states of atlantis could hope to put down this great servile insurrection by the way things looked neither did colonel sinapis he turned to stare at the rebels firing on his men from behind he raised his hands in horror they seemed to fall limply back to his sides all by themselves he doesnt know whether to shit or go blind stafford thought he hadnt heard the vulgar phrase in years but hed never known a time when it fit so well pull yourself together he shouted to sinapis weve got to do something something yes your excellency but what the colonel answered they have us in a modern cannae so his classical training still worked too did it nice that something did even if his generalship had let himand everyone elsedown pull yourself together stafford repeated dont despair of the republic sinapis didnt answer maybe he wasnt despairing of the republic but of his career stafford didnt know how hed save that stafford didnt know how to save his own career either assuming he could get his own life spared even then the non sequitur made him laugh if you dont live through this what happens in your career afterwards wont matter one whole hell of a lot he thought bullets from all directions were flying around him now he didnt know which way to duck he did notice that consul newton and even colonel sinapis whose courage was irreproachable whatever one might say about other aspects of his military persona also ducked at near misses a few people maybe the ones born without nerves lacked that reflex but only a few as newton straightened he touched the brim of his cap to stafford well jeremiah i dont suppose you expected things to end up this way id be lying if i told you i expected them to i daresay youre happier about it than i am stafford answered heres nigger equality all right and it will be the death of both of us i dont want to die i have too many things i still want to do the other consul said trouble is what i want doesnt matter right this minute i blame it on victor radcliff stafford said even diluted his blood is better than the vinegar and horse piss in sinapis veins as far as i know the insurrectionists numberone soldier that lorenzo is pure copperskin newton said will you tell me his blood is better than sinapis too damned right i will stafford answered my parrot could have done a better job leading this campaign than that stupid foreigner didand i havent got a parrot heh newton saidabout as much laughter as the joke deserved in front of them the atlantean soldiers milled like ants stirred by a stick every time they turned any one way they got shot at from the flank and behind as well as from the front they werent dying like ants though they were dying like flies the negroes and copperskins didnt try to close with them why should they they were doing fine carving up the white atlanteans at a distance even as stafford watched the back of a militiamans head exploded the way a melon might after a sledgehammer came down on it the mans rifle musket fell from fingers that could hold it no more his knees buckled he went down and wouldnt rise again till judgment day most of the militiamen owned slaves how many of them would be left alive by the time this fight finished ironically stafford began to hope the insurrectionists made the massacre complete that might horrify atlantis into fighting the war seriously if it did the whites would win in the end as newton had pointed out winning might entail making sure not a nigger or mudface remained aboveground and on his feet that would play hob with the longcherished social system south of the stour jeremiah stafford found he didnt care one way or another the usa would sort things out the free republic of atlantis that was an abomination and had to be suppressed no matter what if im going to die i may as well die usefully he thought he couldnt believe anything short of a massacre would galvanize the senate and the people of atlantis into giving the insurrectionists what they deserved and for the life of himno for the death of himhe couldnt see how the atlantean regulars and militiamen had any chance of stopping a massacre usefully he thought again and hoped it wouldnt hurt too much in the sack lorenzo howled exultantly weve got the sons of bitches in the sack and we just tied off the top they cant even run away now theyre ours oursyou hear me i hear you frederick radcliff answered looks to me like youre right this went better than i ever dreamt it could hed wanted to surprise the white atlanteans hed wanted to hurt them too to succeed beyond your wildest dreams by the nature of things you couldnt possibly expect that all weve got to do is keep going now lorenzo mimed aiming shooting and reloading before too long wont be none of those white bastards left alive extra sweet blowing holes in the militiamen the soldiers theyre just here working you know i dont have anything special against em except that theyre trying to kill us fredericks voice was dry yeah except for that lorenzo agreed seriously then he came back to his favorite theme the militiamen theyre mostly out there on account of they wanted to get their property back turn us into slaves again that means well i got some news for themit aint gonna happen sure wont frederick said the militiamen seemed to be falling even faster than the atlantean regulars serves em right too lorenzo said i want to kill em all is what i want to do and i reckon maybe we can do it too so do i frederick said he never would have dreamt of that when the insurrection started either his dreams along those lines had been nightmares almost without exception nightmares of atlantean regulars smashing through the rebels shooting them bayoneting them hanging them tormenting them in as many ways as his sleepfilled imagination could find and it had proved ingenious in ways he never would have come up with awake he hoped he wouldnt have anyway you know whatll happen when word of what we done gets to new hastings lorenzo said white folksll shit thats what frederick nodded gravely they sure will then he found a question lorenzo hadnt yet and what happens once they get done shitting huh the copperskin didnt even see that it was a question who the devil cares what happens then wed better frederick answered what would the government of the united states of atlantis do after a ragtag force of rebellious slaves slaughtered its professional soldiers and the white mostly prosperous militiamen who fought beside those professionals maybe the government would throw its hands in the air and decide the free republic of atlantis was too strong to be put down maybe it would realize that blacks and copperskins were just as entitled to freedom as white men were maybe the government was looking for any reasonable excuse to liberate the men and women whod labored in bondage for generations maybe but the more frederick radcliff thought about it the less he believed it the insurrectionists clearly could wipe this trapped force of white men off the face of the earth suppose they did when word of the massacre got to new hastings wouldnt it infuriate the senate wouldnt the conscript fathers decide the rebellion truly was dangerous wouldnt all the whites in atlantis decide the same thing regardless of whether they lived in gernika or penzance and if all the whites decided the insurrection was dangerous what would happen next atlantis held many more whites than negroes and copperskins as much to the point or maybe even more those whites held far more wealth than their colored counterparts if they decided they had to kill everyone in atlantis who wasnt white so they could feel safe in their own beds would they be able to do it no sooner asked than answered of course they could it might not be easy or quick or cheap but they could do it frederick was sure of that they might even feel bad about it afterwards but afterwards would be too late to do anybody colored any good frederick was also sure of that which meant what that slaughtering this trapped army might be the worst thing the insurrectionists could do so it seemed to frederick one other thing also seemed all too plain not slaughtering this trapped army had to be the second worst thing the insurrectionists could do lorenzo he said what dyou want the copperskin answered weve got these assholes weve got em right where they belong frederick explained what he wanted he explained why he wanted it explaining made him more miserable not happier all the same he finished we cant kill em all we dont dare now that weve got em where we want em we need to use that to get what we want but weve got to call the ceasefire before theyre all down lorenzo spat in the dirt where the insurrectionists had dug their trench then you go down and take a white flag and talk to the white folks you done great stuff fred but i will see you in hell before i do that here all right i will frederick didnt sound thrilled but he nodded fair was fair and what happens when the white sons of bitches shoot you down like a hound even though you got that white flag no lorenzo didnt bother hiding his scorn get our men to stop shooting ill go down there if the buckra kill me go ahead and do what you want to them frederick answered you will anywayand i wont be around to stop you damned straight you wont lorenzo muttered he aimed a forefinger at fredericks chest like a rifle musket you nigger bastard you better be right you fuck this up nobodyll ever forgive you now tell me something i didnt know frederick said slowly the gunfire died away frederick scrambled up over the rampart and advanced on the whites armed with only a flag of truce he wondered if one of his own people would shoot him in the back that might almost be a relief xix when the firing from all around the white army slackened sudden crazy hope flowered in jeremiah stafford maybe the insurrectionists were running out of ammunition maybe the whites could snatch victory from what had looked like sure disaster maybe maybe stafford was building castles in the air that seemed much more likely when a stocky middleaged negro scrambled none too gracefully over the rampart with a big white flag the man held it up as he came toward the surviving whites boy if he wants to parley id talk till the cows come home a soldier not far from stafford said they can murder every fuckin one of us and they dont got to sweat real hard to do it neither that was an inelegant way of summing up the situation which didnt mean it wasnt true now that the shooting had paused the moans and howls and shrieks of the wounded took center stage stafford wished a man could close his ears to shut out dreadful noises the way he could close his eyes so he didnt have to see dreadful sights colonel sinapis limped back to the two consuls a bloodsoaked bandage was wrapped around his left calf he carried a stick in his right hand in place of his sword dipping his head to stafford and newton in turn he said if they wish to treat with us your excellencies i must recommend that we do so however much i regret to say so we are in no position to resist them that does seem to be the case doesnt it leland newton was doing his best to stay calm an admirable sentiment as far as it went he and sinapis both eyed consul stafford if satan wanted to talk to me right now i do believe i listen respectfully stafford said that nigger there isnt the devilnot quitebut ill hear him out thank you your excellency sinapis voice seldom showed much but if he wasnt relieved right this minute stafford had never heard anyone who was all the soldiers seemed glad the insurrectionists werent shooting any more the regulars and militiamen also ceased fire stafford saw a couple of them doff their hats to the negro as he approached even without orders some regulars formed an escort for him and led him back to the consuls and colonel sinapis stafford fought down the impulse to salute the rebels spokesman yes the consul was glad to be aliveand even gladder he might stay that way a while longer in lieu of the salute he asked who are you my name is frederick radcliff the negro didnt sound like a university man but neither did he sound as ignorant as many of his fellow slaves under dark heavy brows his eyes flashed and who are you friend i am no friend of yours stafford thought even as he gave his own name he studied the black mans face searching for traces of his illustrious grandfather he didnt need long to find them either the nose the line of the jaw the shape of this radcliffs ears yes he did have a white ancestor and stafford was willing to believe it was the man from whose line he claimed to spring consul newton also introduced himself then he asked well mr radcliff what do you want from us the negro eyed him with scant liking you ever call a black man mister before he asked yes there is legal equality in croydon newton hesitated then added i havent done it very often though stafford wondered whether that would do more harm than good had someone admitted something like that to him he wouldnt have liked it much but frederick radcliff only grunted thoughtfully well maybe youll talk straight to me he muttered before rounding on stafford again how about you i doubt it stafford answered had he thought radcliff would believe a lie he would have tried one but if the black man had the faintest notion of who he was and where he came from a lie would prove worse than useless better not to trot one out where that was so frederick radcliff grunted again you dont reckon im dumb enough to believe any old story anyways thats somethin he waved back to the rampart from which hed come then to the sloping sides of the valley and last of all to the insurrectionists whod been pouring bullets into the white atlanteans from behind you know weve got you you cant hardly not know weve got you both stafford and newton looked to balthasar sinapis they werent about to admit they could recognize military defeatno military catastrophe that was what a colonel was for sinapis made a steeple of his fingertips the present situation is difficult he allowed which had to be the understatement of the year difficult nothing this time victor radcliffs grandson didnt grunthe snorted in fine derision if i wave my hand youre all dead if you think you would live more than a heartbeat after you did that youre wrong stafford said oh i know the negro answered easily as long as i have some other choice i wont do it if i dont he shrugged if you think murdering all of us will help your cause you may be making a mistake stafford told him yeah i figured that out too said the tribune of the free republic of atlantis stafford had long been convinced negroes had less in the way of wits than white men did dealing with frederick radcliff made him wonder however little he wanted to the leader of the insurrection nodded back toward the rampart lorenzo he hasnt worked it through yet he trusts me but he doesnt see it for his own self he wants you folks dead so youd better deal with me the negro didnt say it but it hung in the air nonetheless yes he was a man of parts all right leland newton said you wouldnt have come out unless you had something in mind besides killing us all think so do you frederick radcliff had a very unpleasant grin better not give me a hard time or youre liable to find out youre wrong colonel sinapis stirred you have the air of a man who is about to demand a surrender and ready to put forth the terms on which he will accept it that is just what i am colonel the negro said if you say yes you get away with your lives if you say no we will wipe you out and then see what troubles jump up because we did up to you before we say yes or no we had better find out what you are asking consul stafford said frederick radcliff fixed him with a glare i am not asking one single goddamned thing i am telling you how it will be if you dont like it its your funeral yes sir thats exactly what it is if your terms are completely unacceptable we can go on with the fight stafford said colonel sinapis horrified expression warned him they could do no such thing stafford pretended not to see it as he continued you may kill us but were liable to ruin your army while youre doing it in your dreams stafford frederick radcliff said the consul didnt think hed ever had a colored man fail to give him his proper titles of respect before he knew what he could do about it here nothing it rankled regardless the terms consul newton said right the insurrectionists leader seemed to remind himself that was why hed come forth to talk with his enemies terms you can have your lives and thats it give up all your rifle muskets and pistols give up all your artillery give up all your ammunition give up all your horses too except the ones youll need for the wagons that haul your wounded then march away to new marseille and dont you ever come back again thats outrageous stafford exclaimed once you have all our weapons whats to stop you from starting the massacre again when we cant fight back nothing frederick radcliff answered if youd licked us we wouldve had to take whatever mercy you felt like giving usand there wouldntve been much would there well now the shoes on the other foot so see how you like it consul stafford liked it not at all he took newton and colonel sinapis aside to see how they felt about it what choice have we sinapis asked bleakly the wails from the wounded underscoring his words they can go back to killing us whenever they please i dont believe they would violate the terms once made newton added they dont want to make themselves infamous in the eyes of atlantis as a whole you hope they dont stafford said yes the other consul nodded i hope they stopped talking they didnt seem to have much else to say when they turned back to frederick radcliff he asked well whats it going to bewhich made things no easier consuls and colonel all looked at one another nobody wanted to say the fateful words but someone had to after a long painful moment colonel sinapis took the duty on himself we agree he said and then sensing that that by itself wasnt enough we surrender when cornwallis troops surrendered to victor radcliff their band played a tune called the world turned upside down no bands played here but the idea stayed with leland newton all the same insurrectionists had come out to make sure the white militiamen and regulars held to the terms of the surrender frederick radcliff had imposed on newton stafford and sinapis most of the negroes and copperskins though stayed under cover if the whites didnt go along the rebels could always open fire again once officers convinced the regulars that the insurrectionists would also abide by those terms the professional soldiers were willing enougheven happy enoughto stack their rifle muskets and pile up leather cartridge boxes below them the artillerists drove spikes into the touchholes on their fieldpieces but nothing in the surrender terms said they couldnt frederick and lorenzo hadnt thought of it so the rebels would do without cannon a while longer that wasnt the truces real danger point persuading the militiamen to hand over their guns was the militiamen hated and feared their opponents much more than the regulars did many regulars after all came from north of the stour they might well be personally opposed to slavery all the militiamen favored it they all hated the idea that the insurrectionists might win freedom on the battlefield and they all fearedno doubt with reasonthat their former chattels might seek vengeance as soon as they caught their white foes unarmed newton had to admit that jeremiah stafford did what he could to calm their fear even if he was also bound to feel it himself theyll let us go stafford said over and over again theyd be idiots if they did anything else damned right theyre idiots a militiaman burst out copperskins and mudfaces cant hardly be anything but since were stuck in their blamed trap what does that make us stafford inquired dryly the militiaman blinked that didnt seem to have occurred to him maybe he really was an idiot hiding a rifle musket was next to impossible when tipped with a twofoot bayonet the weapon was taller than a man even without a bayonet you couldnt very well stick one up your sleeve or down your trouser leg pistolseightshooters and oldstyle pepperboxes and even older flintlockswere a different story not the end of the world your excellency colonel sinapis said when newton remarked on it some of our men will be able to protect themselves from robbers or shoot game for the pot you cannot make war with pistols not against rifle muskets i see the sense in that newton replied but will the insurrectionists or will they use a few holdout pistols as an excuse to treat our men more harshly than they would have otherwise sinapis smile tugged up the corners of his mouth without reaching his eyes you think of such things your excellency so do i coming out of the cynical school of europe but that ploy never occurred to frederick radcliff or even to lorenzo who is less naive than the black man when i mentioned it they both promised they would not take it amiss as long as the militiamen do not try anything foolish thats good news newton tempered the remark by adding i hope so anyhow as do i sinapis agreed a few hotheads could greatly embarrass us by doing the wrong thing at the wrong time i would not be sorry if the rebels made an example of them i fear i would be sorry if those people made an example of all of us sorry yes consul newton left it right there the more rifle muskets went up in neat stacks of six the more vulnerable the white survivors became one thing was clear even if the fighting continued after this disastrous battle the insurrectionists would not lack guns cartridges or percussion caps for a long time to come here and there blacks or copperskins robbed disarmed white soldiers a handful of militiamenno regularsdied suddenly maybe they refused to take orders from men they still thought of as natural inferiors maybe slaves recognized owners they hadnt loved leland newton found himself in a poor position to ask too many questions the whites started back toward new marseille the next morning they hadnt been able to bury all their dead they had to rely on promises that the insurrectionists would see to it and what were those promises worth anything newton had no idea he also had other more immediate worries he kept looking back over his shoulder if the negroes and copperskins came swarming after the defeated atlantean soldiers what could the white men do die newton thought stafford also kept looking over his shoulder nervous are you newton couldnt twit him about it not when he was nervous himself some of the rebels still carrying weapons walked along beside the soldiers whod surrendered newton didnt see anyone prominent frederick radcliff wasnt coming along neither was lorenzo they had more important things to do with their time probably taking charge of gathering up the loot newton thought both the tribune and his marshal were bound to think that was the most important thing they could do right now well stafford said well be marching like a couple of privates from the regulars by the time we get back to new marseille so we will i know im in better shape than i was when i got on the train in new hastings newton answered so am ihere consul stafford brushed his leg with the palm of his hand but here he brought his hand up to his heart for a moment then sadly shook his head everything i ever believed in is coming to pieces everything outside of church you mean newton said no everything stafford shook his head again i always truly thought it was gods will that whites should rule over niggers and mudfaces hells bells man i still want to think so the evidence would appear to be against you newton said carefully yes it would and i dont like that for beans staffords voice was cold as an iceberg drifting past north cape in dead of winter maybe god has changed his mind about the way things workthe way they ought to work i should say and if he has then were all worse sinners than i ever thought we could be thats pretty bad too believe me i dont know anything about that i leave god to the preachers taking care of myself seems hard enough most of the time newton said he won a thin chuckle from the other consul it does doesnt it so you say you want to leave god to the preacher i didnt know youd taken up with the house of universal devotion thats not what i said and you know it damned well a touch of irritation came into leland newtons voice no educated atlantean could take the preachereven when he got called the reverendor the house of universal devotion seriously atlantis had spawned its share of sects and then some that no educated man could take the house of universal devotion seriously hadnt kept it from becoming one of the more successful and prosperous of those sects no one had ever gone broke betting against the ordinary fellows good sense all right for once stafford didnt seem to feel like arguingor not about that anyhow he did have other worries what do you suppose theyll do to us once we get back to new marseille and word of what happened here gets to new hastings i dont know newton answered maybe theyll decide we were a pack of fools and send out a new army to take a shot at the insurrection or maybe theyll try to turn this ceasefire into a real peace if they do that were the people on the spot on the spot is right the prospect failed to delight stafford make peace i wanted to kill them all sweet suffering jesus but i still do i want all kinds of things im not likely to get no matter how well im marching now a carriage would be nice wouldnt it consul newton tramped on for a while he wondered what would happen if he wore through the soles of his shoes before he got back to new marseille youll start wearing through the soles of your feet thats what after a furlong or so he said that frederick radcliff is a piece of work isnt he jeremiah stafford made a horrible face oh just a little he answered yes sir just a little hes a chip off victors block i dont suppose anyone who ever met him would tell you anything different i expect his owner might have newton remarked yes i expect the poor bastard mightand much good it would have done him stafford said long odds that hes dead now i wonder what he did to deserve it i wonder if he did anything some would say you deserve whatever happens to you if you buy and sell other people newton said some would say all kinds of damnfool things so they can fan themselves with their flapping jaws stafford used a flintandsteel lighter to get a cheroot going he tried to blow a smoke ring but didnt have much luck frederick radcliff newton tried to bring things back to what he wanted to talk about if he were his grandfathers legitimate descendant chances are hed be consul today instead of one of us he knows his onions no two ways about it onions stafford echoed disdainfully i half wish he would have killed us all that would have set the country going in the right direction anyhow this way its humiliating to know the damned insurrectionists could have killed you but decided not to on account of politics in theory i can see that newton said in theory reminds me of the caudine forks stafford continued as if he hadnt spoken back even before the battle of cannae the sam nites had beaten a roman army there and made the defeated soldiers pass under a slaves yoke before letting them go sharing a classical education with the other consul newton understood the allusion humiliating stafford repeated it could be so newton agreed could be my dear fellow it could be newton repeated more forcefully this time but whether it is or not im still damned glad to be alive this way at least i have a chance to sort things out later if i were dead i dont know how id manage that do you stafford opened his mouth then he closed it again newton had tried any number of things without obtaining that desirable result he cherished it now that he finally had it lorenzo admired the rifle muskets and the cartridge pouches and all the other impedimenta of war the white atlanteans had to leave behind for their long march back to new marseilleand their even longer march into disgrace will you look at this shit the copperskin crooned will you just fucking look at it i am looking at it frederick radcliff answered believe me i like it as much as you do youve got to go some to do that lorenzo said frederick believed him lorenzo might not have paid such careful loving attention to a beautiful woman dancing naked before him weve even got cannon he added cant do anything with em frederick said now i know why people talk about spiking somebodys guns lorenzo waved that aside well fix em wont take too long neither i bet and even if we dont so what damned white folks wont be able to shoot em at us yeah frederick had no trouble sounding enthusiastic about that hed never found anything he liked less than trying to stay nonchalant while roundshot screamed by but like most slaves he had no trouble seeing the clouds that darkened silver linings trouble is these are the onliest cannons weve got the damned buckra can go and pull more out of their assholes any time they please its the same deal as percussion capsthey can make em and we cant wont have to worry about percussion caps for a hell of a long time not after all the ones we took lorenzo said frederick wondered whether hed missed the point a moment later lorenzo proved he hadnt i bet some of our blacksmiths could make cannon if they set their minds to it maybe if frederick didnt sound convinced it was only because he wasnt sure wouldnt want to stand behind one the first time some poor damned fool fired it use a long fuse the first time lorenzo said after that though hell these guns the white folks make blow up every once in a while chance you take when you join the artillery reckon so frederick said with luck though wont be anybody shooting for a while now maybe the shootings over i hope so jesus do i ever oh i hope so too doesnt mean i wont stay ready to fight the copperskin answered white folks are likely too muleheaded to quit just on account of we licked em once thats why i was so surprised you let em go when we couldve hurt em a lot worsen we did if they want to beat us bad enough they can they got to decide to spend the money and spend the men but were whipped if they do frederick said what weve got to do is weve got to make em decide not to do that stuff if we scare em too much were dead it will take a while but were dead weve got to make em think these niggers and mudfaces aint so bad fighting them is more trouble than its worth we let em go free after a while theyll be just like anybody else fuck em lorenzo said i dont want to act like master barford did puttin on airs like the fat fool he was not what i meant frederick said we got to make em figure well be peaceable once were free if they reckon well keep on stealin and burnin and killin they wont give in no matter what quite a few insurrectionists had found they liked the outlaw life that would cause trouble when peace cameif it ever did one more thing to worry about later frederick thought first weve got to get peace negroes and copperskins and captured white soldiers who werent badly wounded dug long trenches in which to bury the atlantean regulars whod died trying to get over the rampart and up the gently sloping sides of the valley the stench of blood and shit and fear that hung over any new battlefield was beginning to go off to change to the spoiledmeat stink that announced what the flesh was heir to the fight was only one day past in the humid heat of atlantis southwest nothing stayed fresh for long good to get them underground frederick said sure is lorenzo answered and youd best believe our boys and girlsll go through their pockets one more time make damned sure nobody goes into a hole in the ground while hes still got anything anyone can use thats the way it ought to be frederick said his fighters had already plundered the battlefield plenty of them wore boots and socks that had graced white soldiers who didnt need them any more some of the white prisoners walked around barefoot too if a man with a rifle musket wanted what you wore on your feet would you tell him no some of the copperskins and negroes sported trousers or belts or tunics they hadnt owned a couple of days earlier some of the clothes were still bloodstained soaking them in cold water would get rid of most of those sinister marks two copperskins led a skinny white man up to frederick one of them said this fella says hes a preacherman he wants to say a prayer over the dead white men once they go in the graves oh he does frederick eyed the volunteer minister you aint gonna do nothin stupid are you i hope not the skinny man answered what do you mean stupid goin on about how white folksre better than niggers and mudfaces for instance frederick said or about how theyre sure to go to heaven cause they were fighting on gods side you come out with shit like that youre gonna end up in one of those trenches not preachin over it thatd be just what you got coming too for bein a fool lorenzo put in i was going to recite the twentythird psalm and the lords prayer the white man said i dont see how that can offend anybody frederick thought about it then nodded all right fair enough long as you stick to those you can talk i dont know that itll do the white folks any good but i dont see how itll hurt either his lack of zeal seemed to offend the wouldbe preacher but the man had the sense not to open his mouth about ita good thing too lorenzo said as long as you stick to that kind of stuff you wont get our fighters mad at you neither you do its the last dumb mistake youll ever make i understand the prisoner said you better frederick warned most of the white captives turned out to hear the memorial service for their fallen friends so did some of fredericks negroes and copperskinsmore than hed expected really one of the most successful tools whites had used to hold their slaves in line was a religion where god came down to earth as a white man frederick had taken years to realize that was what was going on in spite of realizing it he still thought of himself as a christian more often than not a lot of his fighters evidently felt the same way still in a dirty gray uniform the preacher stood in front of one of the filledin trenches that scarred the meadow looking out over his audience he said let us pray whites blacks and copperskins bowed their heads some of them clasped their hands or pressed palms together as hed promised the preacher recited the lords prayer and the twentythird psalm everybody knew those if you were going to draw comfort from a prayer youd find it in one or both of them frederick thought the man would stop there had he stopped he would have done well enough in an ordinary way instead the fellow looked out over his audience and went on these soldiers gave their last full measure of devotion fighting for their country and they will be repaid for the house of god is a house of universal devotion one where those who believe truly shall be made glad throughout all eternitynot just some eternity mind you but all of it what kind of shit is he going on about now lorenzo asked all frederick said was uhoh he knew what the preacher was going on about the house of universal devotion hadnt attracted many slaves but hed heard of it he thought the preacher and his followers were a flock of loons he wasnt the only one who did either a white prisoner threw a clod of dirt at the man preaching over the graves shut your lying mouth the prisoner yelled thats right another white man shouted the house of universal devotion is the doorway to hell liar yet another captive said god talks to the preacher and the preacher tells his people the truth the preacherwithout a capital letter ornamenting his callingstanding by the mass grave tried to go on but his audience didnt want to listen to him any more the white prisoners shook their fists at one another and bawled out curses and catcalls they might have started brawling if not for the bemused insurrectionists standing guard over them white folks are crazy crazy i tell you lorenzo spoke with great sincerity only one who cares which church you go to ought to be god hes the only one with the answers anyways of course white folks are crazy frederick answered they reckon they can keep slaves and keep em like beasts and they reckon god loves em you believe both those things at the same time you got to be nuts yeah hadnt looked at it like that but yeah lorenzo pointed at the angry prisoners what are we gonna do about those sorry bastards long as theyre just yelling it doesnt hurt anybody its like a waddayacallita safety valveon a steam engine frederick said they blow off steam against each other they wont give us so much trouble one of the white men chose that moment to decide he didnt care whether the negroes and copperskins were carrying guns full of crusading zeal he decked another white who presumed to hold an opinion different from his about the house of universal devotion a few seconds later another enthusiast flattened the first fellow whod used fists to make his point frederick drew his eightshooter and fired a round into the air nothing got peoples instant undivided attention like a gunshot christians whod been about to swing on their fellow christians suddenly had second thoughts that will be enough of that frederick said into the pool of silence that spread as the echoes of the shot died away what you think about god is your business when you punch somebody in the nose on account of what he thinks about god thats my business you leave other folks alone and hope like hell they leave you alone too you start acting like mad dogs you get what mad dogs deserve whites called slaves who dared rebel mad dogs frederick enjoyed throwing the phrase back in their faces he pulled the trigger again another tongue of flame spat from the revolvers muzzle to his amazement some of the prisoners wanted to argue with him im trying to save that ignorant fools soul from hell one white protested earnestly he reckons youre headed that way yourself frederick answered what makes you so sure youre right and hes wrong why the bible says so the white man replied as if to a fool suppose he reads it some different way or suppose he doesnt care about it at all then hes surely bound for hell and youd better look to your own soul too the captive edged away from frederick as if afraid god would strike the negro dead for presuming to ask such questionsand might singe him too if he stayed too near i will i do i look to mine you look to yours let that other fella look to his frederick said i promise you one thing you start that kind of stupid trouble well be the ones who end it some of the prisoners thought the preacher and the house of universal devotion were the fount of true doctrine many more were of the opinion that everything about them came straight from satan frederick had heard that the preacher opposed slaveholding that inclined him toward giving the house of universal devotion the benefit of the doubt otherwise he had a hard time caring one way or the other his main goal was to keep the captives from quarreling among themselves sooner or later he hoped to exchange them for fighters captured by the white atlanteans under the laws of war both sides got treated the same way what color a combatant was didnt matter the europeans who put those laws together hadnt imagined fighting people of a different color but that was all rightthe laws had more stretch to them than their framers figured just by treating with frederick and his fighters under the laws of war the white atlanteans granted them more equality than theyd ever enjoyed here before if the whites won that equality would vanish both sides recognized as much and up till lately neither side had seriously wondered what would happen if the negroes and copperskins won the whites hadnt dreamt it was possible neither had frederick not really but dreaming time was over reality was here now both sides had to try to make the best of it book iv xx back in new marseille the telegraphers were proud of themselves and their colleagues farther east in spite of the insurrection theyd managed to open a connection with new hastings on the other coast most of the time jeremiah stafford would have been proud right along with them most of the time when the news he had to give the capital was of a disaster his heart wouldnt have broken had the line stayed down a little longer as things were he had no choice neither did consul newton or colonel sinapis each man composed his own report and gave it to the telegraphers stafford collaborated with neither of the other leaders as far as he knew the other two didnt collaborate with each other he wondered how much the reports differed he wondered if anyone reading all three would be sure they talked about the same event he couldnt do anything about that he thought he was telling the unvarnished truth if sinapis or newton felt like lying that wasnt his affair if they thought he would stoop to lying they didnt know him very well besides while you could write around the awful news as much as you pleased you couldnt make it go away the insurrectionists beat the atlantean army they made it surrender in lieu of slaughtering it to the last man they made it march away without its weapons no one responsible could deny any of that if anybody tried it wouldnt do him any good no the remaining interesting questions were two first who was to blame for the catastrophe and second what the devil was the atlantean government supposed to do about it now newspapers in new marseille had no doubt on that score they printed highly colored interviews with soldiers they didnt name and a good thing for the soldiers that they remained anonymous or all the dreadful things theyd escaped in the battle would have landed on them in the aftermath they also printed headlines like string up the consuls and exile the colonel nice to know were loved leland newton said holding up one of the more inflammatory papers dont worry about it your excellency stafford answered as he corrected his breakfast coffee with a healthy splash of barreltree rum they loved you before we lost the battle im sure they did if the prospect dismayed newton he hid it very well after all i disagreed with them and what crime is more heinous than that stafford knew the answer to that particular question losing the battle that was liable to mean liberty for all the copperskins and negroes in the usa instead of saying so he sipped his rumlaced coffee the other consul could see the answer as well as he could himself the only difference was newton wouldnt think liberating slaves was a heinous offense he was a northern man after all so what did he know a raised eyebrow said newton guessed most of what was going on in staffords mind the other consul made a small production out of lighting a cigar he said we both must be getting old seems too early in the day to quarrel doesnt it now that you mention it yes stafford answered i will if you really want to though i dont want to disappoint you ill pass thanks newton said the papers are quarrelsome enough and whatever new hastings has to say is bound to be worse when do you suppose well hear from the conscript fathers after someone flings water in their faces because theyre bound to faint when they get the news stafford thought morosely are you really so eager he asked aloud eager well as a matter of fact no the other consul replied say rather curious in a clinical way as if im wondering whether the dentist will tell me whether he has to pull one tooth or two stafford winced hed had some agonizing encounters with toothpullers before they found out about ether no one went to one of those quacks unless he was already in pain and what they did to you only made you hurt worsefor a while anyhow afterwards you won relief but that was afterwards during was another story altogether and what sort of relief could the united states of atlantis win from the abscess of insurrection theyd tried to lance it tried and failed now the poison was spreading through the countrys system stafford had no idea how to stop it he would have been amazed if the senators on the far coast did he hadnt finished his ham and eggs and fried yams when a messenger who hadnt started shaving yet handed him one telegram and consul newton another oh joy stafford said as he unfolded his looking forward to it are you newton said well no stafford answered the other consul managed a chuckle of sorts but one with a distinct graveyard quality to it senate expresses its disappointment at failure to suppress slave insurrection the wire read it wasnt quite you clumsy idiot but it might as well have been the telegram continued use anyrepeat anymeasures necessary to end uprising manumission not mandatory but notrepeat notruled out that was all that was quite enough that was as far as jeremiah stafford was concerned much too much what does yours say he asked newton they want us to patch up a peace thats what it amounts to anyhow his colleague answered how about yours the same more or less stafford said heavily by god it frosts my pumpkin if we fight a proper war we can win it maybe we can but how much more money will it cost newton said how many more lives will we lose how much longer will the senate put up with that how long will the atlantean people put up with it even colonel sinapis thinks we can win it stafford was clutching at straws and he knew as much in case he hadnt consul newton rubbed his nose in it right now how far will anyone follow colonel sinapis stafford didnt answer no answer seemed necessaryor possible anyone who didnt blame the two consuls for surrendering to frederick radcliff and the insurrectionists blamed colonel sinapis instead quite a few atlanteans were sure there was plenty of blame to go around that seemed to be the sense of the senates telegram gently leland newton said it wont be so bad truly it wont weve had free negroes and copperskins in croydon for more than a hundred years now our republic hasnt fallen apart your states wont either easy for you to say stafford replied you may have freed them but you never had very many for you to free things are different down here they certainly are newton said the copperskins and blacks in croydon are peaceful citizens just like anyone else theyre up in arms here dont you see the connection its time to admit that what youve been doing here isnt working even if it has made white people money that made stafford scratch his head as far as he was concerned making money and working meant the same thing at last he saw or thought he saw some of what newton had in mind you mean a few of the slaves dont fancy it more than a few dont you think and dont fancy it is like saying the ocean isnt small newton answered they dont fancy it enough to pick up guns and risk their lives to try to do something about it shouldnt that tell you something you want me to say slavery is wicked and horrid and everyone who has anything to do with it ought to be ashamed of himself dont you stafford said im very sorry your excellency but i honestly dont believe that i know but whether you believe it isnt the point any more newton said that puzzled stafford again how do you mean the point is the slavesthe people who were slaves i should saydo believe it they would rather die than go on being slaves newton said a lot of them have died theyve made a lot of us die too shouldnt that tell you something youre playing the schoolmaster here suppose you give me the lesson consul stafford admired his own patience whether anyone else would admire itor call it patience and not mulish intransigencenever crossed his mind and newton seemed willingmaybe even eagerto do just what hed asked the lesson is simple if negroes and copperskins go on being them and whites go on being us atlantis is ruined we have to find a way for all of us to be atlanteans together or else well spend the next hundred years fighting we had a way to live together stafford insisted yes but too many people couldnt stand it thats why weve got the insurrection now whites in the south wont like the way you have in mind if blacks and negroes can grab guns and fight what makes you think white men cant stafford said thats simple enough newton aimed a forefinger at him as if it were a rifle musket you have to persuade them not to we ought to try and grab new marseille now lorenzo said weve got the white soldiers guns besides their hearts have to be down in their shoes we should hit hard and fast before they get reinforcements and fresh supplies frederick radcliff drummed his fingers on the outside of his thigh a few weeks ago he might have agreed with his marshal now everything had changed or if things hadnt changed the insurrection still had no hope ask you a couple of questions he said one of lorenzos eyebrows rose how am i supposed to tell you no youre the tribune what you say goes that wasnt how frederick thought of his powerwhich didnt mean it wasnt useful here what happens if the white folks get riled enough to throw everything theyve got into the fight against us well the copperskin pursed his lips as with the raised eyebrow it wasnt a showy gesture it was in fact hardly noticeable that hed made it at all counted for a good deal so did his hesitation before he said wouldnt be easy they send everything wed have to be mighty careful fighting pitched battles raids ambusheswe could keep on with that kind of stuff for a long time would we win in the end if we did frederick persisted damned if i know lorenzos answering grin was crooked tell you the truth when this whole thing started i figured wed both be dead by nowdead or wishing we were you aint the only one frederick replied with feeling and lorenzo laughed out loud but the way it looks to me is theres a time to push and a time to go easy we showed em we could beat em and we showed em we didnt aim to kill all the white men we could seems to me we got to let em chew on that for a while see what they do next if we push em now we only tick em offknow what i mean sure do what i dont know is whether youre right lorenzo took a deep breath and let the air whuffle out between his lips what the hell though like i say youre the tribune youve got us this far seems like you know what youre doing im glad somebody thinks so but frederick didnt say that out loud one of the tricks to leading hed learned was never to let your followers know you had doubts sometimes you could get away with being wrong with being unsure no that made you look weak and how could a weak man lead not even helen knew about some of the fears that knotted fredericks insides what you didnt show you didnt have to explain you didnt have to wonder about it so much yourself either for once he and his army didnt need to do anything right this minute the white atlanteans werent pressing themcouldnt press them for a while as lorenzo had pointed out food wasnt a worry hardtack and salt pork and bully beef captured from the soldiers supply werent exciting but kept body and soul together and the hunting in this sparsely settled countryside was better than it would have been with more people aroundthough there wasnt much livestock to take here just waiting around felt good it took him back to his days as a slave you werent always busy working for the masters but you always had to be ready to get busy and to get busy at someone elses whim that was how things worked here too if hed made a mistake about how the white men would respond after being defeated and spared they would be the ones who let him know it slaves always kept their eyes on masters and mistresses they needed to know what the white folks were up to sometimes before the whites were sure themselves and the negroes and copperskins still slaving it in new marseille were the insurrectionists eyes and ears there frederick radcliff didnt think the consuls army could move without his knowing about it beforehand the slaves in new marseille saw no signs that it was getting ready to move frederick took that for a good omen so did lorenzo who heard about it as soon as he did or maybe even sooner looks like you know what you were talking about the copperskin said im as happy about it as you areyoud best believe i am frederick said how long you aim to give em lorenzo asked till it feels right dont know what else to tell you frederick answered to his surprise that got a smile from the marshal were all makin this up as we go along lorenzo said aint it the truth frederick never would have admitted it if the other man hadnt come out with it first but he wasnt about to deny it once lorenzo pointed it out after a while fighters started slipping out of camp they thought theyd already got what they wanted and they didnt think the free republic of atlantis had any business telling them what to do any more they were free werent they lorenzo and frederick took a different view of things with fredericks approval lorenzo posted guards around the encampment to catch deserters and bring them back the united states of atlantis didnt let their soldiers walk away whenever the men happened to feel like it as far as frederick was concerned the free republic of atlantis shouldnt either that highly offended some of the men who wanted to go home who you think you are playing the white man over me a black fighter demanded when he was hauled before frederick you aint nothin but a nigger same as me you got no business tellin me what to do if i had me ten cents for every time i heard that id be the richest nigger in atlantis frederick said its the truth damn it the other negro said if im a free man aint nobody can make me do nothin i dont want to it doesnt work that way frederick answered nobody can buy you or sell you thats what bein free means but youre in the army now nobody made you join up you did it your own self thats right and that means i can leave whenever i please too the prisoner said means no such thing if people left whenever they wanted to pretty soon we wouldnt have an army any more you go in you got to stay in till the job is done unless you made a deal beforehand to get out sooner frederick said nobody told me i could make a deal like that the other negro exclaimed frederick smiled sweetly then it looks like youre in till the job is done doesnt it thats how my granddad did things and thats how im gonna do em too your granddad was nothin but a white man and he didnt set no niggers free the other man retorted look where you was at fore we rose up house nigger thats all you was an i bet you felt all jumpedup about it too how right he was frederick was embarrassed to remember the way hed looked down on field hands before he got stripes on his back and became one himself he was also damned if hed admit any such thing instead he answered youve got to start somewhere everybodys got to start somewhere before victor radcliff done what he done nobody in atlantis was free white folks had to do what the king of england and his people said an black folks an copperskins had to do what the white folks said the other negro broke in thats right frederick nodded my granddad made it so white folks were free anyways my grandma used to say he wished he could do more he done plenty with her didnt he shut up frederick said fiercely if i was a white man an you talked to me like that id make you regret itbet your sorry ass i would but he figured out you cant have an army less you got people who have to stay in he was right all the white folks countries do it that way were gonna win we got to do it that way too ill run off again you wait an see if i dont the prisoner declared i know who you are humphrey frederick said he hadnt till one of the guards whispered the mans name in his ear but he sure did now this time you dont get anything but a talkingto on account of you didnt know no better we catch you again youll be sorry for sure the prisonerhumphreystripped off his shirt and turned his back his scars made fredericks look like a beginners what you gonna do to me that the white folks aint already done he asked as he faced frederick once more and what do i say to that frederick wondered to his surprise he found something white folks whipped you cause you did stuff they didnt like you run off from us theyd thank you for it chances are theyd pay you for it same as the romans paid judas you want their thirty pieces of silver go ahead an run you bastard that shut humphrey up anyhow maybe hed stick around maybe hed try to desert again if he succeeded frederick couldnt do anything about that if humphrey failed he couldnt say he hadnt been warned freedom had limits it had to have limits or it turned into chaos frederick hadnt understood that before tasting freedom himself but there was nothing like running a revolution to drive the lesson home his grandfather could have told him the same thingif victor radcliff wasnt fighting on the other side colonel sinapis emptied new marseilles arsenal to equip most of his regulars with rifle musketsand with some ancient flintlock smoothbores that had gathered cobwebs there for god only knew how long there werent enough weapons for all the regulars there werent enough for any militiamen they were loudly unhappy about that sinapis stuck by his guns and by the way he handed them out leland newton backed him its not a state arsenalits an arsenal of the united states of atlantis newton told a selfappointed militia colonel its only right that the guns go to troops from the national government first if we had more youd get your share or maybe we wouldnt the colonelwho decked himself out in a uniform far fancier than sinapishad a pointy nose a whiny voice and a suspicious mind reckon youre afraid wed do us some real fightin against them damned niggers newton was afraid theyd try and would shatter the fragile tacit truce that still held since he didnt care to admit that he answered i havent seen your men win any more laurels than the regulars we never got the chance the militiaman complained that damnfool foreigner youve got in charge of your soldiers wouldnt turn us loose and let us fight the way we wanted to what did that mean newton feared he knew the colonel wanted to rape and loot and burn and slaughter he would have made a fine freebooter from western atlantis piratical past a soldier that looked to be a different story your private war against the men and women who were your slaves is not the only thing at stake here the consul said coldly the fate of the united states of atlantis rides on this too you reckon they dont go together the militia colonel made as if to spit thenbarelythought better of it if you do youre even dumbern i give you credit for and thats saying something he clumped away disgust plain in every line of his body staring after him newton sighed then he swore under his breath the militiamen didnt have to stay under colonel sinapis command if they grew desperate enough and if they got their hands on some muskets which they could probably manage if they grew desperate enough they could storm off against the insurrectionists on their own newton didnt think they would cover themselves in glory he knew he might be wrong though and even if he was right that might not stop them he started to go warn sinapis but what would that accomplish the most the regular officer could do would be to put the militiamen under guard that would only complete the breach newton wanted to prevent the militiamen wouldnt listen to reason from sinapis any more than that damned colonel had wanted to listen to newton what then reluctantly newton hunted up jeremiah stafford instead of the regular colonel he feared the other consul wouldnt listen to him either still if stafford didnt how were they worse off stafford did hear him out then he asked a reasonable enough question what do you want me to do about it your excellency we arent fighting frederick radcliffs men right now newton answered id like to keep it that way if we can right this minute the militiamen have damnall to fight with stafford said thats the biggest part of whats eating them not the biggest part newton said the other consul looked a question at him he went on whats bothering them is the same thing thats bothering you they dont want the negroes and copperskins to get their freedom yes thats about the size of it stafford said why do you think id want to slow them down then because theyll only spill sand in the gears and you know it as well as i do god knows the two of us dont agree but youre not a stupid man that militia colonel newton shook his head he couldnt cut his way out of a gunnysack if you gave him a pair of scissors your excellency we have a chance to end this peacefully we stafford interrupted peacefully maybe but not the way id want it to end this the way you want it wed have to soak atlantis in blood even that might not do it because killing all the negroes and copperskins leaves the country without slaves which isnt what you have in mind either or it might not end at allthere might be murders and burnings and bushwhackings a hundred years from now you can have peace or you can have slavery i dont think you can have both any more its not just cooking and sewing and barbering these days will an overseer ever be able to turn his back on a slave with a shovel in his hands again you god damned son of a bitch the words dragged from stafford one by one as if dredged up from somewhere deep inside him your servant sir newton made as if to bow the other consul started to say something else then broke off with an expression of almost physical painor maybe of true hatred now stafford was the one who shook his head like a horse bedeviled with flies he tried again you are a son of a bitch you know how to rub my nose in it dont you im sorry newton lied without hesitation the thing is there you know its there even if you dont like it thats the difference between you and the colonel of militia if i make you see it or smell it or whatever you please you wont go on telling me its not i wish i could stafford said bitterly im sure you do but its too late for that isnt it the senate wants to get this over with by the way the wires sound it doesnt care how we do it people south of the stourwhite people i meanwill get used to the idea of freeing slaves faster if someone they respect tells them they dont have much choice any more some of them may the rest will stand in line to shoot me itll be a long line too stafford didnt sound like a man who was joking what will things be like if they go on the way they have better or worse newton asked if anything would keep stafford thinking about what needed doingwhether he liked it or notthat was it by the way he screwed up his face he might have been passing a kidney stone this is not the way i wanted things to turn out when we left new hastings he said but youre happy now arent you happy probably goes too far newton replied ive always thought the slaves deserve to be free i hoped we wouldnt need bloodshed to free them it may not be over yet or even close to over stafford said do you remember what i told you before no matter how happyhe used the word again with malice aforethoughtyou are that niggers and mudfaces get to ape white men plenty of people south of the stour wont be a lot of them will be like the militia colonel you dont care fortheyll want to keep fighting no matter what i do remember weve been over this ground before whats the most they can hope for i can think of two things newton held up two fingers he touched one with the index finger of his other hand maybe theyll kill off all the blacks and copperskins down here then they wont have any slaves left whatever they were fighting for will be pointless and their grandchildren will ask them how could you do such a horrible thing he touched the other finger or maybe theyll win i dont think its likely but you never can tell but even if they do will they trust slaves around anything sharp from then on out i asked you that a couple of minutes ago and you swore at me you deserved it too stafford said which still doesnt answer my question your excellency what stafford called him then made everything the other consul had said before sound like an endearment it would have made a hardbitten regular sergeant a twentyyear veteran blush like a maiden aunt even on the receiving end newton admired it when his colleague finally ran down he inclined his head your mother would be proud of you he said if she knew what you had in mind shed call you worse than that stafford said the worst of it is i believe youwhich also doesnt answer my question newton said for gods sake jeremiah if you think that hero from the militia will get you what you want turn him loose but if you think hes the biggest jackass this side of a stud farm you ought to slow him down before he makes a bad spot worse he wondered whether stafford would ream him out yet again the other consul didnt he just gestured wearily as if to say he wanted nothing more to do with leland newton and his impertinent questions knowing when not to push any more could be even more important than knowing when to keep pushing no matter what newton touched a finger to the brim of his tall beaver hat and left stafford alone with his conscienceassuming he had one and the militiamen did not march off against frederick radcliffs fighters on their own newton didnt know whether stafford had anything to do with that nor did he try to find out what difference did it make anyhow in politics as in sausagestuffing the result often proved more appetizing than what went into producing it frederick radcliff had never dreamt his word would be as good as law in much of the state of new marseille as well as being heard in states east of the green ridge mountains people all over atlantis had paid attention to his grandfather but what did that have to do with anything victor radcliff had enjoyed the enormous advantage of a white skin for a man who had to do without one frederick had come further than hed ever imagined he could i hope to jesus you have helen exclaimed when he remarked on that he could always count on his wife to keep him from getting a big head with a sly smile she went on beats the daylights out of being master barfords house nigger dont it oh you might say so frederick answeredshe didnt know humphrey had mocked him for his former post yeah you just might and i was all puffed up about that when it was what i had i sure was seems like a thousand years ago his cheeks heated for once he was glad his skin was too dark to show much of a flush humphrey had known the difference between house slaves and field hands all right so far humphrey hadnt tried to run off again or if he had the word hadnt got to frederick those werent the samenot even close one of the things frederick had learned was that being a leader didnt mean knowing everything that was going on you could be pretty sure of what you saw with your own eyes past that you had to rely on what other people told you that sounded better than it really was as any slave knew people lied whenever they thought it would do them some goodor sometimes whenever they felt like it they kept quiet about things that made them look bad if nobody found out about things like that they won the game or they thought so anyhow trouble was the things people lied about or swept under the rug were often the things a leader most needed to learn frederick didnt like using side channels to find out about things his lieutenants should have told him that didnt mean he didnt do it back on the plantation henry barford had done the same kind of thing in the end it didnt save himthe uprising was too sudden too swift to be sidetracked but it had helped him run things for years and it helped frederick now a thousand years ago his wife echoed it does but it seems like day before yesterday too i reckoned id die a slavei really did so did i frederick said considering who his grandfather was he thought that fate seemed even more bitter to him than it did to helen hed never had the nerve to tell her that though his best guess was that shed call him a stupid uppity nigger if he dared do such a thing sometimes you didnt want to find out how good your best guess was aint gonna happen now helen said in wondering tones no it wont well die free frederick agreed adding and its startin to look like that wont happen in the next ten minutes neither wouldnt have believed that when you clouted matthew helen said i reckoned you was dead i reckoned i was too and not just the two of usthe whole work gang things turn out right fifty years from now old niggersll go on about how tough things were in the work gangs and young niggers listenin to em wont have any notion of what theyre talkin about thats what im aimin for frederick said while he was a house slave he hadnt understood what a hard life field hands led hed known but he hadnt understood not till he lived it himself for a little while it was even harder for him because they got used to it from childhood while he was dropped into it as a middleaged man with soft hands and with welts from the lash on his back be somethin if we got it helen said his disaster had turned her out into the fields too shed never blamed him for it not out loud which surely made her a princess among women she asked any news about what the white folks in new marseillere up to not altogether comfortably frederick shook his head only thing i know for sure is they havent come out against us and some of the militiamen done gone home on account of they cant get their hands on any guns aw toooo bad helen didnt sound brokenhearted frederick laughed aint it just they aint comin out to fight but they aint comin out to talk with us neither his wife said thats about the size of it youd know if they were frederick said well i hope so helen said which reminded frederick of his own thoughts about how hard it was to be sure of what was going on then she asked what if they dont do either one if they dont fight or talk frederick said helen nodded he scratched his head the white folks had to do one or the other didnt they maybe they try an wait us out see if our army falls apart helen said they know how to hold things together bettern we do once more that reminded frederick of his unpleasant encounter with humphrey youre right he said in somber tones they do theyve had more practice doin it think we ought to like push em then helen asked be harder for them to make like they dont want to talk with us if we try an talk with them right in front of all the newspapers an everybody it would frederick murmured damned if it wouldnt he thought saying no or saying nothing was easy in private doing it where people who wanted you to say yes could listen in that was another story dunno if you ought to go yourself talkin with em facetoface when we had guns all around that was fine stickin your head in the lions mouth in new marseille maybe they listen to you but maybe they shoot you instead even if the consuls dont tell em to maybe they do it irregardless helen said uhhuh same goes for lorenzo frederick could easily imagine a militiaman pulling out an eightshooter and blazing away the white men from south of the stour loved rebellious slaves no more than the negroes and copperskins loved them the militiamen were having trouble getting firearms in new marseille that might count for very little a length of rope might suit them better in fact yes watching a leader of the insurrection kick away his life might make them laugh like hyenas frederick had never heard a hyena or seen one atlanteans often said things or thought them for no better reason than that they were embedded in the english language he supposed his african ancestors and cousins knew all about hyenas lorenzo helens nostrils flared dont know if you oughta trust that copperskin hes liable to want to be the top fella not the second one it wasnt as if that thought hadnt also occurred to frederick but he said if he aimed to kill me he couldve done it a hundred times by now white folks are the ones we got to worry about not our own kind you hope helen said so frederick did if he remembered that lorenzo was a copperskin wasnt exactly his own kind if he remembered that the insurrection would eat itself up quite deliberately he made himself forget it xxi jeremiah stafford might have been happier to see the arrival of the antichrist at new marseille than he was when frederick radcliffs emissary rode into town on the other hand he might not have on the other other handassuming people came with threehe wasnt sure there was much difference between the antichrist and a spokesman for the free republic of atlantis had he had any choice he would have ignored the negro named samuel but samuel made sure stafford and newton and colonel sinapis had no choice carrying a flag of truce he rode into town with a guard of half a dozen insurrectionists two of them had captured atlantean cavalry carbines three had eightshooters while the last bore the free republics flag up till then consul stafford hadnt known the free republic had a flag it hadnt shown one in any of its fights with sinapis soldiers but it did nowone in stark contrast to the usas crimson redcrested eagles head on blue the free republics flag showed three vertical stripes red black and white samuel was only too happy to explain its meaning to new marseilles newspapermen and parading through town with it made sure the newspapermen noticed him it shows the three folks of the free republic the negro told anyone who would listen copperskins negroes and whites can all live together there in equality not a single reporter asked him what had happened to the whites in the free republic or why so many militiamen hailed from land it held that the reporters didnt ask such questions infuriated stafford the black bastard might as well have cast a spell on them he complained hes clever leland newton said which only irked stafford more the other consul went on and that flag is a master stroke it makes the free republic look to be the same kind of thing the united states are one more lie stafford said hes trying to force us to treat with him hes doing a good job too wouldnt you say newton answered if we dont treat with himor treat with his principals which is what hes come to arrangewe have to start fighting again although stafford was ready for that he and the militiamen seemed to be the only people in new marseillemaybe the only people in the usawho were hes arranged things so we have no choice he said sourly that didnt get the response he wanted either well your excellency if you think so too lets meet him and get it over with newton said stafford didnt want to which was putting it mildly but hed done all kinds of things he didnt want to do since leaving new hastings the more of them he did the easier the next one seemed to become meet with a nigger fronting for a slave insurrection before leaving the capital he would have laughed at the ideaif he didnt punch whoever was mad enough to suggest it now now he let out a wintry sigh and said all right maybe it will make those jackasses with pens shut up anyhow that would be worth a little something it didnt samuel made sure it wouldnt he wanted to meet while new marseilles reporters listened in why not he said the free republics got nothing to hide that only made the scribes like him better and so they sat down together in the eatery attached to new marseilles secondbest hotel the silver oil thrush foreigners no doubt would have found the name peculiar consul stafford cared little for what foreigners thought oil thrushes had grown scarce even here in the southwest but hed eaten them often enough to know how tasty they were samuel on the other hand was a stringy old buzzard his woolly hair frosted with gray he must have been somebodys butler or something of the sort before the insurrection he spoke almost like an educated white man with only a vanishing trace of a slave accent letting niggers and copperskins learn to read and write was a big mistakestafford had always thought so it gave them ideas above their station too late to worry about that now tribune radcliff and marshal lorenzo want to meet with you folks to end the war samuel said off to one side of the table where he talked with the consuls and colonel sinapis a sketch artist took down their likenesses soon a woodcut of the scene would grace some new marseille newspaper if they think well recognize their crackbrained titles theyd better think again stafford snapped samuel only shrugged talk to them about that your excellency talk to me about talking to them his use of staffords title of respect annoyed the consul instead of mollifying him if i had my way stafford began youd whip me within an inch of my life i know that your excellency samuel broke in with perfect accuracy but you dont have your way here not any more you dont shall we talk instead yes lets that was newton not stafford i would still sooner fight it out stafford said knowing he would get no support from the other consul he looked to balthasar sinapis instead he got no support from the colonel either he feared he knew what that meant sinapis didnt want the insurrectionists to humiliate him again in a way stafford sympathized in another way what good is having an army if you dont dare use it to his surprise sinapis answered him to keep someone else from using his army against you so thats why the niggers arent in new marseille is it stafford snarled yes that is exactly why sinapis said and on account of we dont want to come into new marseille any old way samuel said we dont want to fight any more we want peace you gonna tell all the people in atlantis you dont want peace you sneaky son of a bitch stafford thought watching the reporters scribble samuel knew how to play to the galleryfrederick radcliff must have understood what he was doing when he sent out the other negro damn it the people of atlantis or too many of them didnt want anybody telling them their leaders didnt want peace if you think the people of atlantisof the united states of atlantiswill let the socalled free republic of atlantis stand youd better think again newton said stafford blinked the way he did whenever he and the other consul agreed about something samuel only spread his palepalmed hands im not the one to talk about that either he said youve got to see what the tribune and the marshal have to say consul newton nodded he was willing to do that colonel sinapis was also willing to do it or at least resigned to the prospect if stafford said no all the blame would land on him there was probably enough to crush him if only if only a lot of things he thought they started with wondering why victor radcliff had to get a slave with child and went on from there too late to do anything about any of them now stafford was stuck with the world as it was he didnt say yes he couldnt make himself do that but he didnt say no no matter how much he wanted to approaching the hamlet of slug hollow leland newton wondered how it had got its name the answer proved altogether mundane it sat in a depression and the trees thereabouts were full of cucumber slugs some of them half as long as a mans arm the settlers had had the imagination of so many cherrystone clams but theyd told the truth as they saw it no whites were left in the hamlet maybe theyd fled maybe they hadnt had the chance newton didnt askhe didnt want to know jeremiah stafford did ask pointedly he made sure he did it where the reporters could hear him too newton thought about teasing him for taking lessons from samuel but decided not to he didnt think his colleague would appreciate it when stafford asked samuel only shrugged and spread his hands again i dont know what happened he said they were long gone by the time i came through herethats all i can tell you a likely story stafford said how do you suppose so many buildings burned down lightning i dont know samuel repeated if i dont know i cant tell you would we find bones if we dug in the ruins stafford asked maybe you would your excellency the negro said you got to remember thougha war went through here newton was ready to make allowances for that stafford didnt seem to be which surprised the other consul very little its war when you do it eh but its nasty and villainous when we fight back you said it your excellency i didnt samuel answered stafford sent him a murderous glare the consuls and the soldiers theyd brought along camped west of the ruined slug hollow samuel and his smaller retinue camped east of the place when frederick and lorenzo came down to join them they would bring enough fighters to equalize the numbers colonel sinapis had a goodsized force within easy reach of slug hollow he wasnt supposed to but he did leland newton would have been amazed if the same werent true for the insurrectionists if the talks failedor maybe even if they succeededthe war could start again any time frederick radcliff and lorenzo walked into slug hollow two days after the men from new marseille got there the negro and copperskin would have cut a fancier figure had they ridden maybe they didnt care or maybe they didnt ride why would they have learned while they were slaves stafford greeted them with if you keep up this nonsense about the free republic of atlantis we have nothing to say to one another if you call everything thats ours nonsense before we even start talking about it maybe you ought to send in your soldiers again lorenzo answered you want to settle things by fighting i reckon we can do that if newton hadnt got it for free he would have paid a hundred eagles for a glimpse of staffords face the other consul plainly did want to settle things by fighting just as plainly he knew he couldnt the united states of atlantis had ended up with egg on their face when they tried no matter how much he despised the idea he had to sit down and talk with the insurrectionists now and he did despise the idea and made only the barest effort to hide it frederick radcliff said if we can get what we need inside the united states of atlantis we dont need to worry so much about the free republic if we cant well thats a different story he made handwashing motions to show how different it was liable to be what do you need newton asked can you put it into words for us if radcliff couldnt the consul feared the talks would end up going nowhere but the negro leader didnt hesitate you bet i can he said we want to be free we dont want anybody no matter what color he is to buy us and sell us any more we want the law in atlantis to forget about color matter of fact whatever a white man can do a negro or a copperskin ought to be able to do whatever a white man gets in trouble for one of us ought to get in trouble for tooas much trouble but no more consul stafford seemed bound and determined to make himself as difficult as he could you want the right to miscegenate with white women he exclaimed to do what lorenzo asked to screw em frederick radcliff explained which wasnt the whole answer but which came close enough oh that to newtons surprise lorenzo laughed out loud what makes you think we think white women are pretty enough to be worth screwing he asked stafford again newton would have paid money to look at an expression he got to see for nothing white folks always get hot and bothered about that frederick said gravely they spent all this time screwin our women so naturally they figure we got to pay em back the same way consul stafford finally quit spluttering and gasping like a newly landed trout will you have the infernal gall to claim youve all been chaste throughout this uprising i hope not by god because i know better no i dont say that you dont like it so much when it happens to your womenfolk do you your excellency frederick radcliff answered but i say thisput us under fair laws and well live up to them my womans about the same shade i am we been together lots of years i dont want a white womani want her to be my legal wife whats so bad about that a lot of men from south of the stour will tell you its the wickedest thing they ever heard newton said a lot of men from south of the stour are damned fools lorenzo said and then hell it aint like we didnt already know that if you provoke us we will keep fighting consul stafford warned colonel sinapis stirred but he didnt come right out and call the consul from cosquer a liar can we go on fighting newton wondered he supposed it was possible he didnt think it would be easy or cheap or quick what would the united states of atlantis be like after a generation of nasty campaigning and ambushes would they be any kind of place he wanted to live he didnt think so would they be any kind of place where a negro or copperskin could live he also had his doubts about that you dont love us and we dont love you frederick said might be better if we went our own way in a chunk of this country a minute ago you claimed you would follow our laws stafford said if you make your own country out of ours do you aim to pay for what you take away from us frederick rubbed his chin that might cause some trouble he admitted oh maybe a little stafford said for that matter how do you propose to compensate all the slaveowners in the usa for having their property forcibly stolen from them you know what your excellency that aint my worry frederick radcliff said why not stafford pressed on account of any man whos been a slave will tell you slaverys wrong to begin with the negro answered why should you get paid cause you cant do now what you never should have started doing isnt that an interesting question newton murmured shut up stafford told him he turned back to frederick radcliff will you tell me slavery is illegal not yet frederick answered but it sure ought to be youll find plenty of people who disagree with you stafford said damned few whove ever been slaves lorenzo told him this is what were here to talk about newton said what we have now plainly isnt working he waited for the other consul to quarrel with him but stafford didnt thus encouraged if that was the word he went on we want to see what we can work out that will leave almost everyone not too unhappy this time jeremiah stafford looked like nothing so much as a stray dog vomiting in the middle of the street but frederick radcliff slowly nodded if that wasnt a politicians nod consul newton had never seen one and if that was a politicians nod in that case the negro leader wasor at least might bea man with whom it would be possible to deal newton dared hope so almost everybody not too unhappy lorenzo not only mocked the sentiment he did a rotten job of imitating leland newtons accent to fredericks ear the copperskin sounded like a man trying to talk around a mouthful of rocks have you got a better idea frederick asked what are we supposed to do if we cant find a bargain the white folks will live with what we ought to do is kill the consuls and that damned foreign colonel lorenzo said after that theyd all thrash like a pullet that just met the chopper with the flat of his hand he mimed a hatchet coming down on a skinny neck then he did an alarmingly accurate impression of a chicken that had just lost its head but frederick held up both hands in horror they would act like thatfor a little while then theyd decide they could never trust us again even a tiny bit and theyd hunt us down no matter how long it took or what it cost let em try and good luck to em lorenzo said do you want to live like a hunted animal the rest of your days frederick asked if you do you found the fastest way to get what you want me i want to live like the fancy masters wish they could lorenzo said i want to have servants fan me with those big old feathers ostrich plumes frederick put in sure enough such fans were in great demand among the richer plantation owners or they had been till the people who would have done the fanning decided they didnt care for the work yeah them lorenzo agreed and i want pretty girls to drop grapes in my mouth whenever i get hungry or maybe thirsty frederick didnt know whether to laugh or to be appalled how do you propose to get that without turning into a master yourself maybe we could make the consuls slaves instead of killing em lorenzo was full of ideas today not necessarily good ideas but ideas all the same and where would you get the pretty girls frederick asked with the air of a man humoring a lunatic oh what pretty girl wouldnt want to come to slug hollow lorenzo said and if that wasnt the most lunatic thing frederick radcliff had ever heard he didnt know what would be no one in hisor herright mind would want to come to slug hollow no one would have wanted to come here if the place were named silver nugget slug hollow by any other name would have been a place people tried to get away from not one they flocked to they could drop cucumber slugs into your mouth when you got hungry frederick said aint like i never ate em before lorenzo answered dont know many field hands who havent maybe its different with house slaves i know what they taste like frederick said which was true enough if the copperskin wanted to claim field hands ate such delicacies more often than house slaves did frederick couldnt argue with him but lorenzo chose to change the subject instead reckon well get what were after here dont know frederick answered uneasily we dont want to keep fighting forever though we gotta try fighting foreverd be bettern going back to where we were damned if ill ever pick any more cotton for a white man lorenzo said that i know frederick said he felt the same way and hed done it for days not for years all the negroes and copperskins who followed him felt the same way if the whites camped on the far side of slug hollow didnt understand that these talks would fail and if they failed fighting forever was what would come next he tried to picture what atlantis would look like after ten years of skirmishing or twenty or thirty like a restive horse his mind shied away from what that called up would anyone white or colored care to live here after something like that frederick flinched at all the unpleasant possibilities he could see and they werent just possibilitiesthey struck him as being likelihoods lorenzo said aint many women here gonna let white men do what they want with em no more neither uhhuh frederick said that shot hit much too close to the center of the targetmuch too close to the heart of who he was what had things been like between his grandmother and victor radcliff her owner lent her to the other white atlantean for his pleasure frederick knew that had she taken any of her own had they even liked each other as far as frederick knew his grandmother had never said anything to his father about his fathers father beyond letting him know who that famous father was had the insurrection come two generations earlier would fredericks grandmother have picked up a musket and tried to blow out victor radcliffs brains for using her the way he did again frederick had no idea lorenzo pressed ahead so weve got to get free or else weve got to keep fighting no other way we can go he looked at frederick frederick understood exactly what that look meant too no matter what he said about it if the talks failed the fight would go on with him or without him but he didnt disagree with lorenzo not here nope no other way he said the copperskin seemed satisfied the white men camped on the far side of slug hollow wouldnt be so easy to placate well if we go back to shooting at each other how are we worse off frederick wondered he saw no way and if that wasnt a judgment on the united states of atlantis what would be jeremiah stafford scowled across the table at frederick radcliff and lorenzo pretending even for a moment that a negro and a copperskin had any business treating with him as equals was galling enough remembering that they could have killed him but hadnt didnt make him feel any more kindly toward themnot now when he no longer lay in their grasp the table also reminded him what a travesty this was back in new hastings hed dickered with senators across tables ornamented with marquetry so fine and intricate it must have left the woodworkers shortsighted for life this one was of roughly planed boards hacked from the local pine it stood in the taproom of a tavern abandoned when the insurrection flooded over slug hollow since that day spider webs had grown thick up near the ceiling and in the corners of the roomor maybe theyd been there all along in a miserable place like this who could tell you seem to think turning all the slaves south of the stour loose will be easy stafford said to the leaders of the insurrection wave our handsabracadabraand its done i have to tell you it wont be like that oh we know frederick radcliff answered you better believe we know if it was gonna be easy we wouldntve had to start killing people lorenzo added bloodthirsty savage stafford thought you had no business doing that any which way he said oh yes we did frederick radcliff said it was the only way we could make you notice we were there white folks dont notice slaves except to make money off of em or to lay the women bitterness edged his voice considering who his grandfather was that was understandable enough as far as stafford knew hed sired no colored babies himself not for lack of effort though admitting as much probably wasnt the smartest thing he could do instead he said if we turn you loose it will break a lot of white families you said it yourselfpeople do make money from slaves thats one of the big reasons they wont want to give them up good luck making money off of slaves now frederick radcliff said the devils come out you cant put him down again so easy that is an unfortunate fact but a fact we must face leland newton said stafford sent his fellow consul a sour look much as he wished he could though he didnt contradict him this rebellion had succeeded all too well it warned that others could succeed too slaves might be ignorant but they werent too stupid to see that if only they were one reason you dont want to turn slaves loose is money lorenzo said what are the others mr consul sir he turned the titles of respect into sneers before either stafford or newton could answer frederick radcliff said cmon friendyou know why white folks reckon theyre bettern niggers and mudfaces gives em somebody to look down their noses at i knew they had those long pointy ones for some kind of reason lorenzo said even if his was almost as long and sharp as the average white mans frederick radcliffs was lower and flatter he didnt take after his grandfather there anyway but the negro hit a nerve with jeremiah stafford all right we think so because its true stafford growled everything says so from the bible to the most modern scholars it must be so to his amazementand furythe negro and copperskin both burst out laughing its your bible frederick radcliff said theyre your scholars what are they gonna say no were just a bunch of stupid cows next to these other folks i dont think so that had never occurred to stafford it disconcerted him but only for a moment the bible is the word of god he said sternly god would not lie and you face hellfire if you say he would lorenzo went right on laughing devild have you on the fire right now if we didnt turn you loose no jeremiah stafford didnt care to be reminded of that not even slightly this time frederick radcliff spoke before stafford could say anything thats about the size of it bible doesnt matter not for this i dont care if white folks reckon theyre bettern we are that doesnt matter either what matters is you arent strong enough to hold us down any more and now we know it realpolitik colonel sinapis murmured it sounded almost as if it ought to be an english word but not quite consul newtons thoughtful grunt said he understood it stafford believed he did too which didnt mean he liked it but then newton spoke to the insurrectionists you cant leave what white men think out of the way you think if your horses rose up against you that was precisely how stafford saw things it was also precisely calculated to enrage the negro and the copperskin you call me an animal you can kiss my ass frederick radcliff said i didnt i dont newton held up a hand as if to deny everything but most white men south of the stour are liable to more than a few from north of the river too i have to tell you but maybe not so many if you forget that or if you try to pretend it isnt there youre missing something important stafford stared at his colleague in amazement he said iti didnt stafford said i agree with every word of it though well ive got two words for those damnfool white folks lorenzo said tough shit realpolitik colonel sinapis repeated louder this time he looked across the table at the rebels the consuls are right white men in atlantis do feel this way you cannot ignore it because you do not care for it maybe us winning this fight here has gone a ways toward changing their minds frederick radcliff said balthasar sinapis politely dipped his head maybe he said i would not bet on this anything i was not ready to lose most white men will go to their graves sure they are better than any copperskin or negro ever born stafford added if thats what it takes well send em there lorenzo said he started to get up from the table wait frederick radcliff and consul newton said the same thing at the same time they both blinked then smiled almost identical sheepish smiles lorenzo blinked too and did sit down again newton went on we need to bring back something like peace we cant go on the way we have been the country will fall to pieces if we do and that wont help anyone i was thinking the same thing frederick radcliff said we keep fighting the rest of our lives weve got nothin worth havin slaves dont get set free weve got nothin worth havin either lorenzo said what have you got if you make the white men south of the stour want to fight you to the death stafford asked the way youre going thats just what youre doing we have to be free have to be frederick radcliff said lorenzo nodded freeing you will break hundreds of thousands of white men maybe millions stafford said they wont put up with it neither would you not in their shoes this time both lorenzo and frederick radcliff got up newton started to say something then he stoppedhe seemed to have no idea what would call them back they walked out of the tavern together newton and colonel sinapis both turned on stafford a bad peace is worse than none at all stafford insisted neither of the other two men said a word he didnt think that was because hed convinced them leland newton held on to his temper with both hands its either free them or fight forever he said suppose i asked you to bankrupt yourself suppose i asked every fifth man in the state of croydon to do the same stafford returned how eager would you be it wont be so bad as that newton said like hell it wont the other consul replied we wont do it i know my people why wont you listen to me negroes and copperskins were your people too newton said why wouldnt you listen to them he took a certain malicious pleasure in watching the other consuls mouth fall open they dont vote stafford sputtered he needed a moment to gather himself then his voice strengthening he added and theyve got no business voting either it doesnt seem to do any harm in croydon newton said no great pestilenceswe dont even have the yellow jack up there the way you do in cosquer god hasnt chosen to drop the city into the sea i dont know why not stafford said in the south people thought croydon and hanover were dens of iniquity full of sin and degradation what stafford didnt understandone of the many things he didnt understandwas that people in hanover and croydon felt the same way about the states south of the stour and all because of slavery you need to ask god about that newton said but you cant really believe youll be able to put all the insurrectionists back in bondage can you the question said he didnt want to believe stafford could believe any such thing his colleagues mutinous countenance declared that stafford wanted to believe itwanted to with all his heart and all his soul and all his might it also said stafford wanted to kill as many men and women as he needed to in order to bring the rest back to submission but then slowly the other consuls features crumpled no he said i cant no bombastic tragedian playing hamlet could have packed more anguish into three words hearing them made newton want to jump for joy he didntnor did he show that he wanted to showing stafford any such thing would only have further stiffened his colleagues already stiff back so newton spoke as if it were nothing but a matter of practical politics well then how do we do what wants doing good question the other consul said i warned you beforethe whites south of the stour wont put up with nigger freedom let alone nigger equality the way it looks to me their only other choice is going on with this war and that hasnt worked so well either newton said a lot of them wont care stafford said bleakly well the militiamen we had with us can help spread the word newton said and they can help spread the word that the copperskins and negroes could have killed every last one of us but didnt good god the consul from cosquer looked at him as if hed taken leave of his senses do you think those people will do anything on account of gratitude you know what thats worth so newton did much too well anyone who counted on gratitude in politics wouldnt stay in politics long no newton insisted but people all over the south need to know the insurrectionists arent devils with horns and barbed tails are you so sure what about the ones who slaughtered their masters and violated their mistresses when the uprising started stafford said shouldnt they hang for murder it was a war bad things happen in warsthats what makes them what they are newton replied i think we will have to declare an amnesty otherwise the fighting starts again doesnt it amnesty stafford spat the word back at him so they get away with all their crimes makes me wish i were a nigger myself dont be silly jeremiah nothing could make you wish you were a nigger newton said with great assurance his colleague couldnt deny it either newton went on and can you see any way around it as far as the slaves are concerned everything their masters ever did to them was a crime oh piffle stafford said he owns slaves too newton reminded himself what about masters who keep slaves on when theyre old and useless that did happen newton knew as much he also knew something else what about the ones who dont there are plenty of them too stafford waved that aside from now on i can see brokendown copperskins begging in the streets and dying in the gutter too many slaves cant make a living unless somebody tells them what to do how do you know how does anyone know newton said they deserve a chance just like everybody else youll find out and when they do start starving do you know what will happen theyll blame us for turning them loose stafford said that didnt sound as improbable as leland newton would have wished all the same he said freedom isnt easy for every white man either but how many whites do you know who want to be slaves you make everything sound so simple stafford said it wont be you wait and seeit wont so what newton said weve got to start somewhere unless we go back to the war can we do that to his vast relief stafford shook his head xxii jeremiah stafford was drunk even though slug hollow had that miserable wreck of a tavern the place no longer held spirits or wine or beer the insurrectionistsor maybe the locals as they decampedhad made off with its stock in trade such impediments did not stop a determined man stafford had paid a cavalry sergeant half an eagle for a jug of barreltree rum and proceeded to get outside of as much of it as he could it was harsh stuff it burned all the way down he would feel like death come morning or maybe a little worse than that right this minute he didnt care he did care that the cheap fierce rum wasnt doing what he wanted it to do like so many men he drank to forget but he still remembered the more he poured down the more sharply he seemed to remember too hed told leland newton the slaves would have to be free worse hed been cold sober when he did it i can take it back he thought newton would never be able to prove the words had come out of his mouth prove it or not though they would both know and it was true it might be loathsomeit was loathsome sweet jesus was it loathsomebut it was true theyll kill me he mumbled as he staggered through slug hollows narrow fernchoked streets theyll murder me no one had ever murdered a consul of the united states of atlantis no one had even tried to assassinate one thered been brawls on the senator floor but that wasnt the same thing no not even close of course no consul of the usa had ever tried to tell half his country that it couldnt go on the way it had for the past two hundred years and more ifno whenstafford tried to do that how many people would start loading their muskets how many people lived south of the stour how many of them werent negroes or copperskins stafford laughed raucously an easy calculation even for a drunk man enough to make pretty sure one of them would get him you couldnt stop a determined man stafford laughed some more frederick radcliff damn his black hide and blacker heart sure had proved that radcliffs stafford muttered radcliffes he pronounced the e the second time he laughed some more he was part radcliff himself so was newton few prominent people in atlantis werent few indeedno matter what color they were why couldnt victor radcliff have kept it in his trousers stafford took it out of his trousers and watered some of the ferns that had sprung up since slug hollow was abandoned or maybe the ferns had been here all alongin a pisspot hole in the ground like this one who could say for sure come to that who cared a big green katydid long as one of his fingers hopped away and disappeared under a rotting board this was the back of beyond all right in most towns mice and rats had supplanted the native atlantean bugs not here not yet maybe not for a long time either by all the signs slug hollow was going back to the wilderness from which it had sprung stafford veered around a corner he stopped shortso short that he almost fell over someone else was promenading through the streets of slug hollow the nerve of the fellow a second look told the consul promenading wasnt the right word the other man listed like a ship on a windswept sea he was as drunk as stafford was he might have been drunker if such a thing was possible evidently it was because he needed longer to notice stafford than stafford had to notice him when he did a sozzled grin slowly spread across his copperskinned face what are you doing here you shunsonof a bitch he asked i could ashkaskyou the same question lorenzo stafford said i can come here the insurrectionists war leader replied slug hollow isnt yours it isnt yours either stafford said it doesnt belong to anybody any more lorenzos grin got wider whod want it he pulled a small flat bottle from the waistband of his trousers have a snort take one of mine stafford held out the larger jug he was carrying each man drank from the others liquor lorenzos bottle held whisky every bit as raw and snarling as staffords rum whoosh lorenzo wiped his mouth on his sleeve thats fine stuff he had to be drunk as a lord to say such a thing stafford at least knew he was drinking slop it didnt stop him or even slow him down but he knew it i could kill him stafford thought lorenzo wouldnt expect a sudden attack but what good would it do the rebels would only find someone else and the new man might prove smarter and stafford realized the copperskin was eyeing him in a peculiar and unpleasant way i could cut your heart out like i was butchering a shoat lorenzo said you could try stafford said trying to steady his feet under him ahh whats the use lorenzo said you bastards might find somebody who really knows what hes doing that set stafford laughing i was thinking the same thing about you he said well fuck you then the copperskin exclaimed a couple of seconds later he started laughing again too you son of a bitch god damn me to hell and gone if we aint pretty much alike after all fuck you stafford saidwhat could be more offensive than hearing you were like a rebel slave but what if it was true they were both drunker than a leader had any business getting their thoughts had been running down the same track as if in lockstep maybe copperskin chiefs in terranova and black kinglets in africa had to worry about the same kinds of things as white consuls and emperors in atlantis and europe and when they worried about them maybe they came up with the same kinds of answers if they did sweet suffering jesus stafford whispered if that was true maybejust maybeliberating the slaves in atlantis wouldnt be the catastrophe hed always dreaded which didnt mean it wouldnt turn into some other catastrophe and which also didnt mean he could convince the rest of the whites south of the stour that it wouldnt be exactly the catastrophe theyd always feared but it did mean he would have to try white men always said copperskins drank like fish frederick radcliff knew he had good reason to distrust anything white men said about the people theyd enslaved that didnt mean he hadnt seen the same thing not from every copperskin hed known and not all the time but from a good many and more often than from negroes or whites he couldnt remember when hed seen anyone of any color worse for wear than lorenzo was now the copperskins hands trembled the whites of his eyes were almost as yellow as egg yolks like fertile egg yolks they were tracked with red even inside fredericks tent lorenzo squinted as if the dim light were much too bright he spoke in something close to a whisperthe sound of his own voice seemed enough to hurt his ears he moved very carefully as though pieces might break off if he bumped into anything hell of a spree frederick remarked his tone as neutral as he could make it and so lorenzo replied frederick had never heard a whispered snarl before you be able to talk to the white folks when we start dickering again frederick asked that was the only question that counted lorenzo gave back the ghost of a grin yes mother ahhh frederick made a disgusted noise down deep in his throat no matter what lorenzo thought he did need to know such things but the copperskin went on matter of fact ive been talkin with em while i was drunk what with one of their soldiers in slug hollow frederick was glad his marshal felt like talking with a white man instead of trying to murder him even drunk lorenzo was much too likely to succeed and if he did that was much too likely to touch the fighting off again lorenzo shook his head then winced sure as the devil moving anything must have hurt nah he said with one of the big fellasthat stafford asswipe you talked with jeremiah stafford disbelief clogged the way fredericks words came out the negro couldnt imagine why the war leader hadnt hurled himself at the southern consuls throat no matter what frederick couldnt imagine lorenzo nodded gingerly sure did he said he was as toasted as i was pretty near had some rum thatd strip the paint off a wall in nothin flat he smacked his lips remembering how about that frederick said along with isnt that interesting it was one of the handful of phrases that wouldnt land anybody in trouble a plantation owners black butler often found a use for phrases like that yeah how about that in lorenzos mouth by contrast the phrase became one of wonder you know something else he aint such a bad fellow how about that frederick repeated now wonder filled his voice too lorenzo couldnt have surprised him more if hed said that jeremiah stafford was really a woman under his clothes its a fact damned if it aint the copperskin declared it was no such thing it was what lorenzo thought right this minute frederick understood the difference whether lorenzo did or not what frederick didnt come within miles of understanding was why lorenzo thought so right this minute since he didnt he asked him why ill tell you whyon account of him and me we think the same way lorenzo answered if that wasnt a judgment on the copperskin what would be frederick had no idea how do you mean he inquired well ill tell youit was like this lorenzo said when i seen him first thing i thought was i ought to murder this stinking shithead i believe that frederick said it was almost the first thing lorenzod said that he did believe and you know what the war leader continued first thing he thought was i should murder this goddamned copperskin i believe that too frederick said as far as he could see the only reason consul stafford didnt want to murder every negro and copperskin in the usa was that if he did nobody would be left to do the hard sweaty work white folks didnt care to do for themselves stafford scared him more than any of his other opponents he asked why didnt you try why didnt he try if they were both fallingdown drunk what could possibly have held them back lorenzo proceeded to tell him i didnt on account of i was worried that if i just left him there dead the white bastards were liable to come up with somebody whos smarter and meaner mm frederick saideven how about that wouldnt do stretching his mind he could imagine the whites coming up with somebody smarter than stafford though the consul from cosquer was nobodys fool but meaner frederick didnt think such a thing was possible he hoped it wasnt and do you know what lorenzo said do you know no what frederick said he told me the only reason he didnt go for me was because he was afraid wed find somebody better is that funny or is that funny thats funny all right frederick agreed though he didnt feel like laughing could he replace lorenzo at need if something happened to the copperskin hed have to try would any other insurrectionist make as good a general frederick radcliff feared the answer was no he gave me some of his rum to drink and i gave him some of the tanglefoot i had lorenzo shook his head again small motions this time ones that might not hurt so much i was a fool to mix em my damned head wouldnt want to fall off so bad if i stuck to whiskey you drink enough of it and itll get to you any which way frederick said well yeah but lorenzo sighed you know what i want now i want the scale of the snake that bit me thats what got any not in here frederick said im gonna go get me some then lorenzo turned back toward the tent flap take it easy this time frederick warned yes mother the copperskin said once more he added i pour down that much shit two days in a row im liable to wake up dead tomorrow morning doesnt stop some people frederick said more than a few of the people it didnt stop were copperskins but lorenzo said i bet staffords lookin for the scale of the snake right now too like i say hes quite a fella away he went muttering a lowvoiced curse at the bright sunshine outside quite a fella frederick echoed he wished he did have something strong inside the tent now he didnt feel like getting drunk but he sure could have used a knock things were going better than leland newton had dreamt they could his colleague from cosquer had stuck to his agreement that the slaves in the usa would have to be freed newton hadnt really expected that he knew stafford had got headoverheels drunk after agreeing but he hadnt thought even getting drunk would make him go on go on stafford did though something might have happened while he was drunk if it had the consul from cosquer didnt want to talk about it newton had probed a couple of times as discreetly as he knew how he wasnt discreet enough stafford rebuffed every query newton did notice stafford and lorenzo the copperskin eyeing each other whenever the two sides met in the tumbledown tavern they still differed often loudly but they didnt seem readyno eagerto go at each other with knives any more newton asked stafford about that too oh hes a rotten copperskin but hes not such a bad fellow the other consul answered you never said anything like that before newton observed stafford only shrugged if were going to make this work we need to make it work he replied and newton couldnt very well quarrel with that agreeing that negroes and copperskins needed to be free turned out to be the easy part of the bargain agreeing on what that freedom meant and how far it should stretch proved much harder frederick radcliff knew what he wanted if were gonna be equal we gotta be equal he said over and over again anything a white man can do a black man or a copperskin has to be able to do if you can vote we can vote if you can make contracts we can make contracts if you go to school we go to school with you we especially need to go to school on account of you people wouldnt let us do that for so long that especially made consul stafford stir if you want to be equal you shouldnt get to claim you especially deserve to do something radcliff looked back at him havent you been saying we especially cant marry white folks stafford turned red miscegenation is contrary to nature who told you the leader of the insurrection retorted sure never bothers white men when they feel like laying colored women if you dont believe me you oughta ask my grandfather that made stafford turn redder theres a difference he mumbled how come lorenzo asked him miscegenation either way aint it dont matter whether a white man sticks it in or a white woman gets it stuck into her you are crude sir newton told him his own ears felt as if they were on firehe wasnt used to such blunt talk fucking is crude lorenzo answered dont need fancy clothes to do it in hell clothes just get in the way newton did his best to turn the subject maybe we can make a bargain if you give up the right to intermarry we can consider granting you preferential access to schooling yes that might be possible stafford almost fell over himself agreeing he didnt like the idea of educated negroes and copperskins in the usa but he liked the idea of their walking down the aisle with white women even less that was what politics was all about yielding something you didnt care for so you wouldnt have to accept something you really couldnt stand the proposition made frederick radcliff and lorenzo hesitate anyhow they put their heads together and argued in low voices at last radcliff said lets talk some more in the mornin if thats all right by you we got to take this back to our people see how they feel about it fair enough newton said before stafford could respond the other consul didnt object newton hadnt thought he would stafford might recognize the need for these bargaining sessions but that didnt mean he cared for them after radcliff and lorenzo had left stafford turned to newton and asked how would you like your sister or your daughter marrying a nigger i wouldnt like it much newton answered honestly i dont think any of the women would like the notion very much either i doubt whether many white women would thats why i hope the insurrectionists will give up their claim to intermarriage in exchange for schooling hmp youve got some sense anyhow who would have thought so stafford managed a crooked grin may i speak to this point colonel sinapis asked newton and stafford both eyed him in surprise neither intermarriage nor education had much to do with soldiering which was his province but newton said by all means colonel and stafford nodded thank you your excellencies sinapis said in europe we have only a handful of copperskins and negroesnot enough for people to get excited about what we have instead is a great plenty of jews we have some here too newton said we treat them more or less like any other white men consul stafford nodded again newton finished my secretary mr ricardo is a jew and a very able man i have seen what you do here even in your army you have some officers who are jewsnot many but some in europe this would never happen by the way the colonel sounded he approved of the european practice but he went on i understand why this is so too you have not so many jews here and you have so much dislike for colored people not much for jews is left over thats an interesting way of looking at things consul newton said uncomfortably it made more sense than he wished it did but whats your point colonel stafford asked ah my point yes before coming to it balthasar sinapis made a small production of lighting a cigar once it was drawing well he went on in my lifetime european laws against intermarriage with jews have mostly fallen into disuse some people said the sky would fall or the antichrist would come after this happened but the world still goes on as it always did maybe things would turn out the same way here maybe they would newton said thoughtfully we can hope so anyhow i wouldnt bet anything i wasnt ready to lose stafford said marrying jews at least youre marrying money marrying a nigger his disgusted look told what he thought of that no one would make anybody marry someone of a different color newton said the question is whether it ought to be legally possible i know what the question is stafford replied i know what the answer ought to be too when you make a treaty to settle a war you do not always get everything you want colonel sinapis said i understand that but id like to get some of what i want consul stafford said so would the negroes and copperskins newton reminded him staffords expression said he didnt needor more likely didnt wantreminding every time frederick radcliff walked into the tumbledown tavern to talk with the white consuls and colonel he felt like a trainer sticking his head into a tigers mouth hed come away safe every time up till now but things only had to go wrong once and he felt doubly nervous walking in there this particular morning it must have shown because lorenzo said dont worry this is what we decided if the white folks dont like it thats their hard luck frederick shook his head liable to be everybodys hard luck thats what im worried about we whipped them lorenzo said let them sweat with an effort frederick made himself nod the white men sat there waiting for him and lorenzo to join them frederick didnt trust any of them consul stafford was an open enemy consul newton was less of one at least openly but frederick wondered what he thought down deep of negroes and copperskins as for colonel sinapis maybe it was fredericks imagination but he thought the foreign officer looked down on the two consuls almost as much as they looked down on the uprisen slaves they faced that puzzled frederick did coming from europe count for so much he thought colonel sinapis thought it did good morning newton said as frederick and lorenzo sat down across the table from him what have you decided about my proposal after a deep breath frederick answered sorry but we arent going to take it newton looked as if hed bitten into something sour are you sure manyeven mostof your people would benefit from education only a handful would take advantage of intermarrying and chances are some of them would end up sorry theyd ever tried it you may be right you likely are but that isnt the point frederick said oh suppose you tell me what is then newtons voice was light and clear as usual but the consul was provoked enough to show the iron underneath which he seldom did frederick took another deep breath he needed one he tried to hold his own voice steady as he answered point is if were gonna be equal with white folks we got to be equal every way there is we deserve to get schooled same as white folks if were equal and we deserve the right to marry no matter what color somebody is if we say you can take that away from us what are we sayin were sayin youre bettern we are an all the talk about bein equal is just thattalk the white men glowered at him and lorenzo lorenzo glowered right back frederick only sat there waiting slowly consul newton said its hard to negotiate with you if you give us nothing to negotiate about thats what im trying to tell you thats why we rose up frederick said how can you negotiate about freedom either a mans free or he aint if we got to be free we got to be all the way free a matter of principle consul stafford sounded less scornful than he often did thats right a matter of principle frederick nodded the white man had come out with what he was trying to say we have our own principles you know stafford said sure you do that was lorenzo answering before frederick could speak you can buy us and sell us and lay our women whenever youve got a stiff dick you dont know what to do with only you cant not any more thats how come we rose up too stafford didnt explode the way frederick thought he might all he said was getting this past the senate will be harder than you seem to think tell em youre doing whats right frederick said its the truth as if that matters leland newton muttered more to himself than to anyone else it better matter frederick said if it dont we got to start over an startin over means the free republic of atlantis an lots more shootin i told you beforewe can start shooting again if you push us hard enough you wont like what happens if we do stafford said you wont like it either lorenzo promised and exchanged more glares with the consul from cosquer but they werent the same kind of glares as they had been before the two leaders drank together on the overgrown streets of slug hollow then stafford might have been scowling at a dangerous dog lorenzo eyeing a fierce redcrested eagle now each recognized the other as a man that much was plain whether such recognition improved things was unfortunately a different question we rose up on account of freedom frederick said if we couldve got it without fighting we wouldve done that but it wasnt about to happenyou folks know it wasnt and you know why too do you see the day then when one of the consuls of the united states of atlantis will be a negro and the other a copperskin jeremiah stafford didnt sound as if he saw that day but he didntquitesound as if he were mocking frederick either since he didnt frederick judged he deserved a serious answer not any time soon more white folks than there are colored and people just naturally vote for their own but maybe the day will come when nobody cares what color a man is as long as hes a good man and he knows what hes doin a noble sentiment consul newton said softly well so it is stafford agreed he looked across the table at frederick youd better not hold your breath waiting for that day though frederick looked back at him no need to worry about that your excellency i dont aim to i dont care if a copperskin gets to be consul lorenzo said what i care about is whether its against the law for him to try long as he can trylong as nobody ties him to the whipping post and stripes his back for even thinking about iti wont fuss same with marryin out of your color i dont reckon itll happen real often but there shouldnt be a law against it thats right frederick said thats just right thats how it ought to be easy enough for you to say so out here in the middle of nowhere consul stafford said as i told you a little while ago it wont be so easy to convince the senate in new hastings do we have to bring the war across the mountains then we can do that frederick wasnt really sure the insurrectionists could do any such thing but he wanted to keep the white men worried by the looks on their faces he did even if we give you everything you say you want you may not end up happy with it newton said if the law says were free well be happy with it frederick answered if the law says were equal well be happy lorenzo added colonel sinapis suddenly spoke up not matter what the law says white men will keep running atlantis for a long time to come you are rightthere are more of them than there are of you and they have more money they have more experience running things too you may not be slaves in law any more but you will not at once become equals no matter what the law says frederick radcliff glanced over at lorenzo the foreign colonels words seemed much too likely for comfort lorenzo spread his hands as if to say he felt the same way but what came out of his mouth was chance weve got to take i think so too frederick said we have to start somewhere leland newton had drafted the accord that would with luck put an end to what almost everyone these days was calling the great servile insurrection he wrote it in language more simple than he would have used most of the time he was a barrister keeping things simple wasnt something he normally did but while frederick radcliff could read and write he wasnt trained in the law newton didnt want him to be able to claim hed signed something he didnt fully understand why not stafford said when newton remarked on that itd served the damned nigger right we came to slug hollow to stop trouble not to stir up more of it newton said we came west to stamp out the insurrection stafford replied and look what a good job of it we did if we bring home a peace the whole country can live with we will have done well enough here newton said if the other consul bore down heavily on the word and if the whites south of the stour rebel because of the peace weve brought home how well will we have done here that may yet happen you know i do intend to propose that they be compensated for the loss of what has been their property newton said that may do some good then again it may not stafford replied if living in houses were to be made illegal tomorrow how happy would you be to get money for a house you had to leave happier than if i didnt get any i suppose newton answered you would still be angry though wouldnt you you might be angry enough to go to war about it stafford said i hope not newton heard less conviction in his own voice than he would have liked he gathered strength as he went on white men south of the stour cant go back to living in the house they had before their neighbors will burn it down around their ears if they try you know thats so unwillingly his colleague nodded but a good many of them dont understand that its so stafford said weve got to convince them youve got to convince them newton said they admire you they respect you they believe you they believe in you and much good any of that will do me as soon as i tell them they really do have to give up their slaves theyll start plotting to assassinate me and if you think im exaggerating youd better think again stafford said newton didnt think the other consul was he knew how high passions ran among slaveholders maybe whats happened to our armyand whats happened to some of themwill give them the idea that times have changed newton said hopefully maybe stafford didnt sound as if he believed it for a minute if you feel the way you do why are you signing the agreement newton asked this will be bad not signing would be worse stafford said i can see that much im not a blind man no matter how often youve called me one on the consuls dais but you and the insurrectionists seem sure angels will sing hosannas as soon as everyones name goes on that paper i am here to tell you things wont be so simple do i think everything will be wonderful once we have an agreement newton wondered maybe he did and maybe stafford was right to have his doubts but he was also right about something else not signing would be worse i said so jeremiah stafford gestured impatiently but that doesnt mean signing will be good it just means signing wont be so bad you can say right away that a man is free how long does it take before he truly believes hes free though and how long before his neighbors believe it he was full of hard questions this morning newton wished he himself were as full of answers he said all we can do is find out he handed the other consul the paper hed been working on does this say everything we need to say is it clear have i forgotten anything stafford perused it he suggested two or three small changes the points he raised were cogent newton made the changes without a murmur his colleague sighed now i suppose it is as good as it can be whether it should be stafford sighed again i think not but events have overtaken me general cornwallis must have said the same thing when victor radcliff trapped him in croydon newton remarked he ended up doing well for himselfand for englandin india stafford said atlantis cant send me so far away when the country learns what were about to do here today it may wish it could the treaty of slug hollow or perhaps the slug hollow agreement schoolchildren from now till the end of time will have to learn about it and about the people who signed it newton said but what will they learn stafford asked will teachers say we were heroes or will they call us a pack of fools and thrash all the little brats who cant remember how we made a hash of things more hard questions newton could only shrug well have to do it and then find out thats all he said are you ready no but were going to do it anyhow the other consul answered then we have to persuade the senate not to crucify us because we did it and good luck on that score your excellency well both need all the luck we can find newton said so will the united states of atlantis he carefully folded the slug hollow agreement and put it in a jacket pocket it meant nothing till it was signed but that moment was only a few steps away now xxiii frederick radcliff studied the paper in front of him with more care than hed ever given any other piece of writing no other piece of writing hed ever seen would affect his life so much or affect the lives of so many other people is it all right lorenzo asked anxiously the copperskin couldnt read and had to trust his judgment with much effort and with his tongue wagging from a corner of his mouth like a hardworking schoolboys lorenzo could write his name even that little put him ahead of most slaves i think so frederick answered he glanced across the table at consul newton whod given him the document newton was a white man a barrister and a politico and so triply not to be trusted he smiled back blandly now frederick discounted that his gaze swung to the other consul the southern consul the less happy jeremiah stafford looked the more relieved frederick felt stafford was bound to have seen the agreement beforehand if he didnt like it it was less likely to hold hidden traps that would limit the future liberty of blacks and copperskins as you will see we have already signed the document newton said it needs only your signature and that of your marshal for us to submit it to the senate and end this insurrection that has discommoded everyone not everyone your excellency oh no not everyone frederick said you see freedom in front of you you dont reckon yourewhat did you call it discommoded thats right he filed the word away so he could use it again if he ever found the need consul stafford sniffed you see a chicken coop in front of you you dont care who owns it i expect thats so your excellency frederick said youre hungry enough i expect its so no matter what color you are you want to get free bad enough i expect you rise up no matter what color you are too back in the old old days werent white men slaves and didnt they rise up whenever they saw the chance spartacus newton said thats the fella frederick nodded he knew little more about the ancient slave insurrectionist than his name he hadnt even been able to come up with it a moment before all the same lots of negroes and copperskins knew thered been plenty of slave revolts before their day whites didnt want them learning such things which was all the greater incentive for doing so plainly consul stafford also knew about spartacus just as plainly he didnt like what he knew and didnt want colored men knowing it but that was his hard luck nobody elses frederick went through the agreement one more time he might miss something because consul newton was too clever for him you took that chance in any dicker he was damned if he would miss anything because he hadnt been diligent enough though is it all right lorenzo asked again he respected and feared the written word all the more because he had no control over it reluctantly frederick nodded he had his own fears that damaging clauses still hid under the surface the way crocodiles waited underwater for whatever might be rash enough to step into their river but on the surface everything seemed as it should it is all right he replied more firmly than he had the last time may i offer you a pen consul newton took one from his pocket and held it out across the table got my own thanks frederick said not without pride he pulled it out it was at least as fine as the white mans likely finer where did you steal it stafford asked i dont have to tell you that and i dont aim to frederick said take a look at article four here his finger stabbed down onto it theres an amnesty for things that happened during the war if it covers killin folks i reckon it covers gettin my hands on an ink pen he waited to see if stafford would call him a liar by all the signs the consul from cosquer wanted to since article four said exactly what frederick maintained stafford couldnt he fumed instead leland newton kept his face studiously blank colonel sinapis looked amused but only for a couple of heartbeats then his features also went impassive again newton slid a bottle of ink across the table that frederick did accept opening it with a nod of thanks he dipped his pen then signed his name on the line waiting for it his signature wasnt so fancy and florid as any of the white menssinapis in particular was a productionbut so what you could tell it was his name and nothing else mattered he pushed the paper over to lorenzo and handed him the pen you sign it here he pointed to the only remaining blank line by god ill do it lorenzo said and he did we have an agreement the great servile insurrection has ended at last newton said the free republic of atlantis is no more consul stafford took what comfort he could from that we have an agreement frederick said but the senate back in new hastings still has to say everythings all right doesnt it till then its just what weve done its not official like thats true consul stafford and i will do all we can to make sure the senate does approve what weve done here consul newton said we dont want the fighting to flare up again and our own prestige is on the line here you know if the senate rejects this agreement its the same as rejecting our leadership stafford made a wordless noise down deep in his throat maybe his heart wouldnt break if the senate did reject the agreement it might be the same as rejecting his leadership but it might also keep slavery alivefor a little longer anyhow that was part of the reason frederick said reckon ill come back to new hastings with you me and my wife nobodys got more reason to try and make the senate see things the right way than the two of us are you sure that would be wise newton said slowly your presence there might do more harm than good consul staffords face saidshoutedthat he thought the same thing but frederick answered ill take the chance your excellency honest to god sir i will let the senate see that a negro can be a civilized fella or pretty close let the senate see that a negro and his woman can love each other just like a white man and his wife aint no proper reason our folks cant get married same as yours copperskins too lorenzo added copperskins too frederick agreed an let the senate see one more thing let the senate see a negro can be named radcliff thats what happens when white men get to go tomcatting around with the slave women and im here to tell you it aint right god bless my soul leland newton murmured for a moment consul stafford looked as if someone had hit him in the face with a wet fish for an even briefer moment colonel sinapis looked amused again then as before he donned the mask of impassivity you gonna tell me i cant come whats this piece of paper worth if you say somethin like that frederick tapped the agreement lorenzo had just signed come ahead by all means come ahead stafford said it will be something out of the ordinary at any rate but you must understand there is no guarantee the conscript fathers even the ones from the north will love you like i said chance i take frederick hoped he sounded calmer than he felt and why shouldnt they love me or at least like me some i bet im kin to half of em maybe more for some reason neither stafford nor newton seemed to want to answer that colonel sinapis by contrast laughed out loud if looks could have killed the ones both consuls sent him would have left the usa looking for a new army commander but nobody tried any more to tell frederick he shouldnt accompany the consuls back to new hastings jeremiah stafford had shared railway cars with negroes before porters fetched food and drink and pipeweed to passengers who needed them hed always taken those porters as much for granted as seats or windows they were part of the railroads accouterments it wasnt as if he had to treat them like human beings sharing a railway car with negro passengers was something else again during the course of the fighting and the talks hed come to respect frederick radcliff maybe that respect grew not least because of fredericks famous white grandfather regardless of the reason it was real but fredericks womanstafford didnt care to think of her as his wifewas nothing but a dumpy rather frumpy middleaged nigger frederick might have reasons for loving her whatever they were stafford couldnt see them she didnt put on airs anyhow that was the one good thing he could find to say about her but as the train rattled and jounced east toward the green ridge mountains he became more and more certain he could smell herand frederick what white man didnt know that niggers stank he wanted to say something had more southerners sat in the car with him he would have if either leland newton or balthasar sinapis had two working nostrils though neither man gave any sign of it sinapis smoked cigar after cigar and the pipeweed he favored smelled worse than any negro ever born stafford wanted to open a window but didnt want wood smoke and soot flying in and so he stayed where he was and stayed quiet sizzling inside neither frederick radcliff nor helenstafford supposed he ought to think of her as helen radcliff but the idea of real slave marriages was as repugnant to him as the idea of slaves with surnamesgave him any open cause to complain all they did was look out the window and exclaim at the scenery every so often a white couple on their first journey by train might have acted the same way what kind of reception do you think well get when we come into settled country newton asked as the train started into a pass that would take it through the mountains the terms we made will have gone before us eh stafford said well of course we wired them to new hastings after all the other consul replied wherever the wires reach people will have heard about them stafford nodded he knew as muchwho didnt but he was trying to pretend ignorance and he had his reasons in that case your excellency we should count ourselves lucky if they dont drag us off the train and lynch us by newtons gulp he hadnt expected stafford to be so blunt you are joking i hope he said i only wish i were stafford said he hadnt intended that frederick radcliff should hear him but the negro did welcome to the club your excellency radcliff said huh what club stafford asked any time a black goes out amongst whites he knows hes a dead man if he gets out of line said the leader of the insurrection same goes for copperskins too now you know how it feels hes got you there newton said with a sly chuckle huzzah stafford answered sourly he feared hed feel like a hunted animal till the train got north of the stourif he lived that long he didnt care whether slaves felt that way all the timeor had felt that way all the timetill his own signature on that damned sheet of paper acknowledged that they were slaves no more you needed to keep such people in line keeping them afraid went a long way toward doing just that but white men had always been the lords of creation in atlantis stafford hated feeling any other way he tensed when the train stopped in a hamlet called west duxbury for wood and water no ravening mob appeared west duxbury didnt have enough people to make a ravening mob but someone flung a rock through a window as the train pulled out of the station frederick radcliff and helen sat there with the air of people whod been through worse in their time consul stafford counted himself lucky to have got off so lightly leland newton was the one who let out a startled yip he almost jumped out of his seat all in all he reminded stafford of a cat that had just made the sudden and unwelcome acquaintance of a rocking chair sure enough smoke did pour into the car it masked whatever odor the negroes in there might have had it also made staffords eyes water and made him cough he felt as if hed been puffing on a pipe without letup for a week the only difference being that he didnt get the little lift pipeweed brought with it all things considered he would rather have kept the window intact he supposed more towns bigger towns and more stops lay ahead how long would it be before somebody decided a rock wasnt good enough how long before somebody pulled out an eightshooter or maybe a rifle musket no stafford hadnt been joking about any of that he knew how white people down here would feel about setting slaves free life was a miserable bastard all right but what other choice did you have at the moment stafford knew exactly what other choice he had outraged southern men could pull him from the train and hang him or burn him or simply tear him to pieces living seemed better if he could get away with it a conductor whose wool jacket was resplendent with polished brass buttons strode into the car and bawled new hastings coming into new hastings thank god leland newton said no one in the battered railway carriage seemed angry that he came close to taking the name of the lord in vain he knew why not too the others were just as glad to make it to the capital in one piece as he was stafford had warned that it would be bad newton had thought his colleague was exaggerating to make liberating negroes and copperskins seem a worse idea than it really was but the consul from cosquer turned out to know what he was talking about white men south of the stour really were up in arms at the idea of turning their bondsmen loose white women too newton shuddered at the memory of all those screaming furious faces some of the things they called him would have made a deepsea sailor blanch some of the things they called frederick radcliff made what they called him seem endearments by comparison senators were chosen because they had a longer view and were better able to deliberate than ordinary people so atlantean charter theory said anyhow in practice as newton knew too well senators often became senators because they were better able to say what most people in their state already thought if southern senators were better able to say what those women had been screaming they would meet this train with bayonets and with cannon loaded with canister it pulled into the station grayuniformed atlantean soldiers did stand on the platform with fixed bayonets but they faced away from the train not towards it they were there to protect the consuls and frederick radcliff and his wife not to mete out summary justice on them the captain commanding the soldiers called dont you worry folks nothings gonna harm you not while im around he spoke like a man from hanover from the north which meantnewton hoped it meanthe had no use for slavery the consul presumed that was colonel sinapis doing he hoped so at any rate sinapis had got off the train early maybe he had a good idea of what theyd go through on the way to new hastings or maybe he just wanted to buy himself a little more time before he had to explain to his superiors at the ministry of war why he hadnt crushed the insurrection consul newton breathed a sigh of relief once he got off the train as soon as he was traveling by himself he would be pretty safe consuls were the highest magistrates in the usa yes but how many people knew what they looked like they didnt put their faces on coins like european sovereigns or terranovan strongmen they were citizens of the republic over which they presided as far as newton was concerned things were supposed to work like that he worried about the way photographsand woodcuts and lithographs based on themwould change politics wouldnt they make it impossible for anyone who wasnt handsome to serve his country and wouldnt they make it easy for a goodlooking scoundrel to subvert freedom all that would be trouble for another day though the day they already had brought plenty of trouble of its own consul newton got a better notion of how much trouble it brought when he spent a few big copper cents on the days newspapers the papers in new hastings were always unrestrainedwhich was putting it mildly today they outdid themselves some of them called him and consul stafford heroes to others they were the worst traitors since habakkuk biddiscombe whod gone over to king george in the middle of the struggle for freedom and fought harder against the atlantean assemblys army than most of the redcoats the new hastings chronicle showed a frontpage cartoon of a negro who looked something like frederick radcliff and something like a gorilla the caption was next consul of the usa presumably to no ones surprise the chronicle didnt care for the notion even if everything went well how long would it be until more than a handful of white men were willing to vote for a negro frederick radcliff himself didnt think the day would come any time soon newton agreed with him that might be too bad which made it no less true he found more guards around the senate building which also housed the two consuls they or at least some of them knew who he was you really gonna turn them people loose one of them demanded in accents identical to consul staffords yes we are and you just told me why newton answered the corporal sent back a blank stare newton spelled it out for him because they are people and for one man to own another is wrong huh the man in gray saida noise full of nothing but skep ticism aint like theyre white people for cryin out loud how would you feel about that if they owned whites and not the other way around newton inquired huh the twostriper said again after some deliberation he went on reckon thered be some niggers and mudfaces who needed killing and pretty goddamned quick too your excellency newton had never heard a less respectful title of respect even so he said they decided the same thingabout white people and now if you will excuse me he didnt want to spend all day arguing with an underofficer about what hed done sure as the devil hed be spending day after day arguing with one senator after another after another behind him the corporal and his men started arguing among themselves some of them thought newton had a point anyhow that made him feel a little better about what he and stafford had done in slug hollow down south of the stour everyone seemed to want the consuls scalps men from croydon and other northern states greeted newton like a conquering hero as he walked the winding corridors of the senate house yes he did have some support at least a senator from hanover asked him how did you manage to get the great stone face to do what was right that description of his consular colleague made newton chuckle in spite of himself the great stone face wasnt there any more it had been a rocky profilea cliffside reallyon the eastern slopes of the green ridge mountains not far west of croydon had been was the operative term when newton was a young man an avalanche turned the great stone face into the great stone rubble heap but the memory of it like memories of moles and wolves and lions lingered on modern atlanteans tongues and if old paintings and woodcuts told the truth that rocky profile did bear a certain resemblance to consul staffords newton feared telling the other consul as much wouldnt be the smartest thing he could do well how did you the politico from hanover persisted newton chuckled again this time on a rueful note the distilled residue of terror the insurrectionists beat us he answered they didnt just beat us eitherthey could have massacred us but they held off nothing like that for concentrating the mind believe me it must be true so the newspapers werent turning out their usual rubbish when they said the slaves won the senator said no they werent with three words newton tried to conceal the fear he remembered much too well listening to himself he found he was mournfully certain hed admitted it instead well well the hanover man said is the black radcliff a man his grandfather would have approved of do you know i rather think he is consul newton said slowly youll see frederick radcliff for yourself before long and one of the things youll see about him is that he knows what he wants and he doesnt aim to turn aside till he gets it no matter whats in his way to me that sounds a lot like victor radcliff in the old days how about you i suppose so the senator answered one of the things victor mustve wanted was a nigger wench eh mightve been better for everybody if he hadnt got her we would have bought more time to work out how to deal with this mess without tearing the country apart it could be newton said but he didnt believe it for a minute the united states of atlantis had been busy quarreling about slavery for longer than hed been in public life with no sign they were getting anywhere the insurrection was only one more proof that they hadnt been and if frederick radcliff were never born my guess is that some other negro or copperskin would have kicked up an uprising anyway before very long the senator blinked now theres an interesting notion did the slaves rise up because this fellow radcliff led them into insurrection or would they have gone off anyway if he werent around it was an interesting question as long as you didnt start chasing it round and round like a puppy in hot pursuit of its own tail i hope you dont expect me to prove anything as if we were back in plane geometry at college newton said god forbid the other man replied my cousins friend taught geometry himself if he hadnt tutored me i never would have got through it well all right i know how you feel believe me newton said remembering his own struggles with euclids axioms and theorems my guess is we got the insurrection we got because of frederick radcliff if hed never been born we would have got a different one before too long how different a little a lot he spread his hands i couldnt begin to tell you seems reasonable the senator from hanover said after some thought of his own it does doesnt it newton said all of which again proves exactly nothing new hastings held more people than frederick radcliff would have dreamt could live together it dwarfed new marseille the biggest town hed seen up till then and croydon was supposed to be bigger and hanover was supposed to be bigger still frederick had trouble believing any such thing was possible but then hed also had trouble believing a city like this was possible he didnt know everything there was to knowa fact hed got his nose rubbed in time after time he suspected everybody ever born had that happen the consuls put helen and him up in a hotel that had to cost a lot of money but they didnt seem to worry about it people waited on the two negroes as if they were important whites not all the hotel staff consisted of negroes and copperskins either some of the waiters and sweepers and whathaveyou were white men and women most of whom spoke english with one odd accent or another they were as professionally deferential as the colored people beside whom they worked i could get to like this frederick remarked as a white man in a boiled shirt bowed him and helen to their table at the hotel restaurant dont let it go to your head she said even as the servitor pulled out a chair so she could sit in it talks dont work out the way folks hope were nothin but a couple of noaccount niggers again her pungent good sense made frederick smile oh i know he said as he sat down himself but look how they fuss over us now they can treat us like real people if they want to bad enough sure you treat a coral snake or a lancehead polite too long as its got a chance to bite you his wife answered soon as it cant though you try and figure out how youre gonna smash in its head that also seemed more sensible than frederick wished it did the other thing that seemed sensible was enjoying himself while other people were paying for it he ordered roast duck with loaf sugar and a wine the waiter recommended the wine came all the way from france and was almost as tasty as its price proclaimed it ought to be master barford he didnt know about stuff like this helen said after she tried it even if he did he didnt have the eagles to buy stuff like this frederick answered hed known some other planters had more money than his master just the same all slaveholders had seemed rich to him from a slaves perspective all slaveholders were rich what frederick hadnt realized was that there were plenty of people richer than any of the backwoods planters out near new marseille he suspected that among their number were both the consuls and most atlantean senators he was also beginning to suspect that if he played his cards right he could end up rich himself he was after all the man who represented negroes and copperskins to the rest of the usa if the man who did that didnt end up dead he would end up prominent and didnt a prominent man always have influence to sell do i want to get rich frederick wondered but that was the wrong question anybody who wasnt an idiot knew having money was better than not having it no one wanted to go hungry or barefoot or to wear rags or live in a leaky tumbledown shack the real question was did frederick want to get rich badly enough to sell himself to sell out the people who counted on him so he could pile up stacks of golden eagles the sweetened roast duck suddenly tasted like carrion in his mouth if he did something like that wouldnt he still be a slave and wouldnt he be a slave whod willinglyno eagerlysold himself to his new masters when he might have stayed free how could you look at yourself in the mirror after you did something like that every time you lathered up to shave wouldnt you want to cut your throat instead well then i wont do nothin like that he muttered wont do nothin like what helen asked even if it often seemed as if she could she couldnt read his mind after all never mind frederick said theyd been together all these years shed earned the right to push him she used it too it didnt do her any good not this time you traitorous son of a bitch that was what most of jeremiah staffords friends called him these days the rest called him you treasonous son of a bitch the only difference lay in his erstwhile friends attitude toward the language not in their attitude toward him they all seemed to hate him and the more they pushed him and mocked him and called him a jackass the more they provoked him to push back when his train pulled in at new hastings hed still despised liberation and everything that went with it they kept telling him it was impossible and hed had no business agreeing to it in the first place naturally he defended what hed done you would have signed that paper too if you were there he told anyone who would listen but nobody wanted to listen to him that was a big part of the problem supporters of slavery organized marches through the streets of new hastings the marchers made the city almost unlivable with drums and horns during the day at night they used their noisemakers and carried torches as well stafford feared they would burn down the capital over his head he didnt think his fears were misplaced whenever the marchers came upon a copperskin or a negro they beat him with an inch of his life colored men in new hastings were free not slaves that worried the marchers not a cents worth if anything it only inflamed them more new hastings had no real police force as far as consul stafford knew london was the only city that did the few watchmen on the city payroll here were no match for the marchersor for the marchers white foes who waded into them whenever the odds seemed decent they werent content with clouting one another over the head with placards knives came out so did pistols and so did soldiers stafford never found out who gave the order afterwards no one seemed to want to admit it but hardlooking men in gray uniforms who carried bayoneted rifle muskets appeared on street corners at sunup one morning when the antiliberation marchers disobeyed their orders in any particular they opened fire without warning that probably wouldnt have worked in a southern city like cosquer or nouveau redon or gernika it would have stirred up more trouble than it put down but it served its purpose in new hastings the marchers rapidly discovered they didnt have enough popular backing to take on the soldiers making the discovery cost them more casualties order returned to the capital order failed to return to the senate floor stafford and newton had presided over tempestuous sessions before those were as nothing compared to what the consuls met now shaking his fist at stafford a senator from gernika cried youve changed indeed stafford replied no matter what the honorable gentleman may believe it is not against the rules of this house he might as well have saved his breath youve changed the senator repeated as if it were forbidden in the sterner books of the bible we havent and we arent about to fools never do stafford said that of course only poured oil on the fire several senators screamed abuse at him in english french and spanish bang bang consul newton plied the gavel with might and main the honorable gentlemen are out of order he saidyou could sound all the more insulting when you were exquisitely polite they would do well to remember to look toward the future not the past take your heads out of the sand stafford translated to himself did ostriches really stick their heads in the sand he had no idea hed never seen an ostrich they were supposed to be pretty stupid just like honkers hed never seen a honker either even though they were atlantean birds as far as he knew nobodyd seen any honkers since audubon found some to paint which probably meant backwoodsmen had shot and eaten the last few survivors back around the time when the united states of atlantis freed themselves from england thered been proposals to set land aside as a preserve for atlantis native creatures nothing ever came of those proposalsno state cared to give up land from which it might one day draw taxes it was probably too late for honkers now anyhow it might not be for some other creatures but even if it wasnt consul stafford had more urgent things to worry about at the moment my colleague is right he saida sentence that hadnt crossed his lips very often before the failed campaign to put down the slave insurrection we may not like going forward but we have no other choicenot unless you would rather spend the rest of your lives fighting a war we are unlikely to win and one that will not bring us the benefits we seek even if we should win if you hadnt buggered up the fight against the niggers youd sing a different tune now a senator from nouveau redon said you wouldnt go along with everything the croydon man says another southern senator added we did the best we could stafford answered we faced danger together and we made the agreement with frederick radcliff together too and you get the blame together shouted the senator from nouveau redon the credit you mean leland newton said history will justify us it always justifies people who believe in progress did it stafford had his doubts but the way his former friends howled made him have doubts about his doubts too xxiv the clerk of the senate eyed frederick radcliff with as much warmth as he would have given a cucumber slug in his salad do you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give will be the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you god he droned i do frederick said are you aware that perjury is a felony punishable by fine or imprisonment or both i wasnt but i am now frederick answered a couple of senators chuckled a few more smiled all of them were northern men the dignitaries from south of the stour seemed affronted that a negro should testify before them at all well too damned bad frederick thought as for the clerk he was impervious all he said was state your name for the record i am frederick radcliff frederick said that probably affronted the southern senators all over again a negro with any surname would have been bad enough a negro with the most prominent surname in atlantis was more than twice as bad a negro grandson of the famous first consul was much more than twice as bad even the clerks eyes said as much if he wasnt from a slaveholding state himself frederick would have been mightily surprised but all that came out of his mouth was you may be seated frederick sat in the witness chair the angle at which it was turned let him see the two consuls on their dais as well as the senators on the floor of the chamber consul newton said for the record you are the man who was styled tribune of the free republic of atlantis are you not thats right frederick replied treason three senators shouted at the same time no such thing frederick said though that wasnt a question was it treason when my grandfather rose up against england my grandfather if they didnt care for that too damned bad again it would have been treason if victor radcliff and the atlantean army had lost newton said and it would have been treason if you and your army had lost too by the way consul stafford sounded he was still sorry it hadnt been but we didnt and so it aintisnt frederick corrected himself quite a few senators would think of him as a dumb nigger no matter what he did but he didnt want to give them extra ammunition treason doth never prosper whats the reason for if it prosper none dare call it treason newton seemed to be quoting something by the ring of it it was oldfashioned shakespeare frederick had read some but didnt remember seeing it there if you say that about my grandfather you can say it about me if you dont saying it about me isnt fair he said im not saying it about anyone because by the terms of the agreement we signed there is no such thing as the free republic of atlantis any more the slave insurrection is over and done withisnt that right newton said yes sir long as the rest of the agreement gets carried out frederick answered long as the slaves get freed and we get the same rights in law as any other atlanteans several southern senators started yelling abuse at him several northern senators applauded him trying to drown out the southerners newton and stafford both used their gavels no one seemed to want to pay any attention to them the sergeant at arms will restore order by any means necessary stafford warned that worthy looked at him as if hed taken leave of his senses frederick sympathized with the functionary quite a few senators carried stout sticks more often as weapons than as aids to keeping them on their pins and how many more hid a dirk or a pistol under their waistcoats frederick didnt know he wouldnt have wanted to find out the hard way either finally something like order did return why do you suppose consul stafford and i agreed to terms like those newton asked was it out of the goodness of our hearts say not likely sir frederick said which startled laughter out of senators from both sides of the stour he went on probably because we had you in a place where we couldve slaughtered you but we didnt do it yes you did have us in a place like that the consul agreed why did you let us go then so we could get terms instead of fighting forever frederick said and now you have those terms newton said frederick nodded we sure do what do you think of them theyre fair we can live with them theyre an outrage they dont punish you for what you did in the insurrection a southern senator shouted newton and stafford used their gavels again frederick talked through the sharp thuds they dont punish the slaveholders for everything they did before the insurrection either that set the senator to spluttering without words both sides agreed that recriminations were pointless consul newton said frederick nodded once more though hed learned the word recriminations after the talks with the white men started we did consul stafford agreed i dont believe that made anyone happy i know it didnt make me happy but i also know doing anything else would have made everyone even more unhappy i want all the conscript fathers to think about that newton said i understand that you may not wish to ratify the agreement we made in slug hollow believe me thoughthe consequences of rejecting it are far worse than the consequences of accepting it easy for you to sayyou arent losing half your property that stubborn southerner cried we intend to arrange compensation for slaveholdersafter the agreement is accepted newton said the southerner only jeered you say now you intend to but when will we see cash for our niggers and mudfaces when pigs fly is my guess youll get what you want and you wont give us what we need he sounded like a girl trying not to give in to a man who wanted to go to bed with her noting how much the senator sounded like that kind of girl frederick had all he could do not to laugh out loud we will meet all our obligations consul newton insisted of course ill marry you afterwards he might have been saying and maybe a man who told a girl something like that meant it and maybe he didnt may i say somethin your excellency frederick asked go ahead newton said stafford nodded thanks what i want to say is nobodys giving us anything for all the stuff slaves have to go through if slaves didnt have to go through things like that i wouldnt have me victor radcliff for a granddad i dont reckon theres enough money in atlantis to pay us for all that just let us be free and well call it square if white folks get somethin cause they cant own people and buy people and sell people any more they better reckon theyre the lucky ones not the other way around that got him another handfrom senators from north of the stour he presumed it also got him more fury from senators from states where owning slaves remained legal his guess was that most of those senators would be wealthy men which meant most were likely to own slaves themselves no wonder they didnt love him some of them brandished their sticks at him but if any of them were armed with more than sticks they didnt show it that was something frederick supposed he turned to the consuls ask you something were supposed to be questioning you stafford said with a thin smile but then he nodded go ahead black man or a copperskin ever talk in front of the senate before frederick asked its possible consul newton answered after a pause for thought not certain but possible in the states north of the stour colored men have been free for a long time theyve been able to get an education some of them have done very well for themselves and become experts on this and that so they may have testified im not sure going back through the records would say one way or the other all right frederick hadnt thought of that reckon folks wont have any doubts from here on out i reckon youre right by the way newton paused before coming out with the word he didnt use it very often and your testimony has been intelligent and to the point let the record show that also you have testified like a man i am a man frederick said the senators from south of the stour might not like that but it was true and hed just proved it on the most important stage atlantis had senators from south of the stour hadnt cared for leland newton before he went off to face the insurrectionists they liked him even less now that hed come back with an agreement they saw as a surrender whyd you sell the country down the river you son of a bitch one of them growled as he came up to newton in a hall would you ask consul stafford the same question the same way newton inquired ive already done it the politico repliedhe might be a fool but he was a consistent fool right at the moment newton didnt see consistency as a virtue he snapped well what did he tell you you dumb shitheel the senators jaw dropped he was more used to dishing out insults than to taking them i ought to cut your liver out for that god damn you to hell when i have to deal with oafs like you i think he has already sent me there newton replied why you the senator drew back a meaty fist as if by magic an eightshooter appeared in newtons hand hed practiced drawing it in front of a mirror practice might not make perfect but it definitely improved things i will tolerate the rough side of your tongue sir but i suffer no man to lay a hand on me pull the trigger you wouldnt dare you have already made a great many mistakes i promise you you will have made your last one if you swing on me newton aimed the pistol at the middle of the senators chest the politico was a beefy man if newton did fire he couldnt very well miss a lead ball almost half an inch acrossor more than onewould make almost any man thoughtful even the senator even him he took one careful backwards step then another as if he hadnt he snarled i still say youre screwing the country say whatever you please newton didnt lower the revolver for now why dont you go say it somewhere else swearing under his breath the senator edged past him newton held on to the pistol till he was sure the other man was going away then he tucked it back into his belt under his jacket only as he was putting it away did he let his hand shakeor rather lose the ability to keep it from shaking he came much too close to shooting himself in the leg that must have been fun frederick radcliff came out of another senators office now that you mention it newton said no is this what running atlantis is like all the time is this what my grandfather had to do the negro asked if victor radcliff ever drew a pistol on a senator in a hallway history does not record it leland newton answered plenty of people called him everything they could think of though and a little more besides by everything ive read and by everything old men told me when i was young he gave as good as he got or maybe a bit better huh victor radcliffs grandson said thoughtfully and then well i worried some of my people might shoot me too did you consul newton said frederick hadnt admitted that before so things werent all sweetness and light in the free republic of atlantis are you kiddin me only place its all like that is heaven cept i bet they argue there too frederick said somebody brags his halos shiniern the other fellows or this lady doesnt like it on account of that other lady over there shes playin her harp too loud if some of the conscript fathers heard you they would call you a blasphemous skink newton had to suck hard on the insides of his cheeks to keep from cackling like a laying hen he had no trouble at all picturing fredericks querulous angels and hearing them inside his head chances were that made him a blasphemous skink too he didnt intend to lose any sleep over it and frederick radcliff passed from the ridiculously sublime to the serious in a single sentence if all the southern senators are like that bigmouthed bastard how will you ever pass the agreement not all of them are thank god newton said i doubt they will love you any time soon but some of them can see reason if you hit them over the head with a rock consul stafford did after all happy day that makes one frederick said there will be more there must be more was newton saying that because he really believed it or to try to convince himself he didnt care to inquire into the question too closely to his relief frederick radcliff didnt seem to care to either no one banged on the door to the hotel room frederick radcliff and helen shared they had guards out in the hall to make sure no unwelcome and possibly armed visitors barged in on them given the emotional and political climate in the senate and in new hastings generally frederick was glad those guards were there when someone tapped on his door then he didnt hesitate to open it one of the guards handed him a newspaper saying a senator gave me this he asked if youd seen this story here a callused forefinger showed which story frederick would have found the headline even without the helpful digit what else would a senator want him to read but a story headlined slave revolt in gernika spreads he quickly read the piece the revolt had broken out near st augustine a sleepy subtropical town on the east coast south of the city of gernika the state capital local planters had had no luck crushing it neither had the state militia the state of gernika had been spanish atlantis till the usa bought it from spain thirty years earlier both before and after coming into the usa spaniards had an evil reputation among slaves better to be owned by an english atlantean than a frenchman but better a frenchman than a spaniard any dayor so negroes and copperskins said maybe that was true maybe not if the slaves down in gernika believed it they would fight harder against the men whod claimed the right to own them frederick gave the paper back to the guard all right now ive seen it what does the senator want me to do about it he didnt tell me the guard answered but if i was him id want you to stop it thats what youre here for right thats what youre here for right nigger the guard didnt say it out loud he and his friends were doing their job well enough so maybe he didnt even think it maybe but frederick had trouble believing that he could hear slights in a white mans tone of voice if he sometimes heard them even when they werent there well who could blame him regardless of whether nigger was in the guards thought what he did say made obvious sense it had equally obvious problems how am i supposed to stop something down in gernika if im here in new hastings beats me the guard tapped the two stripes on the left upper arm of his tunic i aint nothin but a dumb corporal you should ought to talk to the senator it would help if i knew which one frederick pointed out oh sure that makes a difference dont it laughing at himself the underofficer thumped his forehead with the heel of his hand perhaps all men really were brothers under the skin frederick had used that same gesture when he was feeling more stupid than usual the corporal went on this here was senator marquard from cosquer from consul staffords home state just north of gernika a frenchman by his name a sly fellow whatever his name and backgroundhe didnt want trouble spilling up over the border slaves everywhere south of the stour seemed suspended in a state of limbo if the senate approved the slug hollow agreement they would be free if the senate didnt they would explode and frederick didnt think he or anyone else would be able to stop them or even slow them down the negroes and copperskins down by st augustine must not have been able to wait or else some master had done something intolerable even by the loose standards of masters in a state where spanish rules still held sway the newspaper story hadnt said what touched off the uprising maybe the reporter didnt know maybe when he was writing about slaves he didnt care frederick didnt remember any particularly hostile questions from senator marquard the little the negro knew of him suggested he could see sense he supported slaverywhat senator from south of the stour didntbut he was less fanatical than most of his colleagues which meant im going to have to see him frederick told helen after summarizing the newspaper story and his conversation with the guard how come all he wants to do is get you killed his wife said that hadnt occurred to frederick he hadnt thought of himself as naive but maybe he should have if he went down to gernika to try to settle things and either the whites or the rebellious slaves didnt want to listen to him he could easily end up dead but if he didnt what was he worth as a leader what was the slug hollow accord worth sighing he said i got to see the senator where i go from there well well find out senator abel marquard was ready to see frederick frederick would have been astonished if he werent marquard looked both debauched and clever his eyes were redtracked and pouchy he combed a few strands of coalblack hair across a vast expanse of scalp but he had the air of a man who calculated and who rememberedfavors yes but also slights he shook hands with frederick with no visible qualms a courtesy not all southern senators seemed willing to extend to a black man when he said i am pleased to make the acquaintance of the man of the hour frederick could hear no sarcasmwhich with a customer as smooth as marquard didnt mean it wasnt there please to meet you too sir frederick said wondering if he meant it what can i do for you not what you can do for mewhat you can do for atlantis senator marquard answered frederick decided to stop beating around the bush why should i do anything for atlantis what the devil has atlantis ever done for me plenty to me i will say that but not much for me not yet maybe marquard agreed blandly but how would you expect the senate to approve the slug hollow agreementhe named it with obvious amusementwhen slaves are still in arms against the country in spite of the truce you promised oh come on sir frederick said with a snort ive never been to gernika ive never been anywhere near it if you think im in charge of slaves down there the way a colonel in new hastings is in charge of soldiers in new marseille you better think again i see well let me ask you another question then if you are not in charge of these people if they pay you no heed why should anyone here take the slug hollow agreement seriously marquard said does it not promise more than you can deliver mmp frederick made an unhappy noise he parried the question as best he could if you go along with it the slaves wont have any reason to rise up on account of they wont be slaves any more it could be marquard didnt call him a liar to his face but he might as well have on the other hand we are entitled to proof that you are a leader who can get your people to follow you wherever they happen to be by your people he couldnt mean anything but negroes and copperskins frederick wanted to argue with him about that he thought the slug hollow accord was good for everyone in atlantis regardless of color but that would sidetrack the argument instead he stayed direct suppose i do that for you then what will you do for me in exchange senator marquard looked pained such straightforwardness held little appeal for him you would not find me ungrateful he murmured pasting a delicate smile onto his thin lips fredericks lips were far from thin his smile far from delicate if i do this and i come back aliveor even if i dontwill you back the slug hollow agreement will you do everything you can to get your friends to back it too the senator looked pained you ask me to put my political future in your hands well youre askin me to risk my neck frederick retorted you think im gonna do that for nothin you better think twice i could tell you yes and then do exactly as i please marquard said you are no senator yourself you have no power to enforce a bargain no huh frederick smiled again as unpleasantly as he could how many slaves have you got sir if you renege on me how long do you reckon you can go before you have an accident or you can turn your slaves loose i guessbut if you do that you may as well go along with slug hollow right senator marquard opened his mouth then he closed it again after a long silence he said it is not to be doubted that you favor your grandfather the radcliffs have always been famous for their stubbornness i dont know anything about that i never got to meet him he never came to see my grandma again or my pa frederick didnt try to hide his bitterness all i know is you want me to do this and i want something from you if i play your game will you play mine another silence followed the question abel marquard made a steeple of his fingertips over his hands he stared across his desk at frederick had you been born white you would assuredly have been chosen consul by nowmore than once unless i miss my guess who can say that thought had also occurred to frederick but i never had the chance on account of im black instead maybe some other negro or copperskin will get it one of these daysif you go along with what i worked out with the consuls atlantis has got now by marquards expression he wasnt convinced that would be good for the country his chuckle wasnt enthusiastic either but he said all right if you go and pour oil on the troubled waters of gernika i will do what i can to have the senate ratify the slug hollow agreement does that suit you frederick thought about asking him to put it in writing before he did he realized marquard would refuse frederick tried a different question your word as a gentleman sir he knew the southern planters code other than a southern planter who knew it better than a house slave if marquard gave his word as a gentleman even to a negro he would keep it a man who broke his word showed he was no gentleman and a southern planter who showed he was no gentleman had no reason to go on living those same thoughts had to be passing through abel marquards mind if they were his muchlivedin face gave no sign of it his answering nod held no trace of hesitation my word as a gentleman he said and held out his right hand frederick took it again one man risked his life the other his influence each probably would have said he chanced too much jeremiah stafford had been on the point of demanding an army to put down the new spark of insurrection in gernika when frederick radcliff said he would go down there and try to do the job himself that took the consul by surprise he wondered if the rebellious slaves in gernika had even heard of frederick radcliff theyd heard there was trouble and theyd decided to start some more that was how things looked to him anyhow part of him wanted the negro to go down there fail miserably and prove to the world that the slug hollow agreement wasnt worth the paper it was written on what surprised him was that part of him didnt the world had changed and stafford had changed with it frederick radcliffs slave army could have carried out a massacre worse than any in atlantean history it could have but it hadnt stafford remained among the living because of the negro leaders restraint and so a life for a life stafford thought when he summoned frederick to his office things werent so simple of course atlantis owed the black man far more than one life but stafford was doing what he could dressed in white shirt black trousers and jacket and black cravatdressed like a prominent white man in other wordsfrederick radcliff cut an imposing figure amazing what wearing a jacket with black buttons rather than a butlers brass ones could do the negro no longer seemed the least bit servile the figure he cut made it easier for stafford to treat with him as an equal if you go down to gernika you lay your life on the line the consul warned he hadnt expected frederick to look amused you arent the first one to say so the negro answered dryly even if i couldnt cipher it out for myself my wife made it real clear he paused chuckled and repeated himself real clear why are you going then stafford asked on account of it needs doing frederick said if you send in soldiers youre liable to stir up everything south of the stour but if i can calm things down like that goes a long way toward showing things can work out the way we hoped when we talked in slug hollow stafford hadnt hoped things would work out when they talked in slug hollowjust the opposite in fact but having signed the agreement he had to support it all the abuse heaped on him because of it only put his back up he was a stubborn man himself and he had radcliff blood of his own on his mothers side if you dont calm things down he began chance i take frederick radcliff broke in if i deliver the senates liable to look at the slug hollow agreement a whole different way if i deliver im the man of the hour stafford understood what the black man meant but didnt say if frederick delivered he would be more powerful than any senator arguably more powerful than either consul and who would have chosen him to hold such power not the people only himself yes the kind of power the negro would have lay altogether outside the charter somehow that worried consul stafford less than it might have were frederick a different man back around the turn of the century the slaves on one of the islands south of atlantis had risen up and overthrown their french overlords they hadnt just overthrown them eithertheyd slaughtered them since then theyd had a dizzying series of generals and kings and untitled strongmen all grabbing for power for its own sake stafford didnt think that was what frederick radcliff had in mind of course if he was wrong itll work out your excellency frederick said or i hope it will my biggest worry isnt the negroes and copperskins my biggest worry is some angry white man with a rifle musket but hes the kind of fella ive got to worry about here in new hastings too youre well protected here stafford said staying safe in gernika will be harder im afraid chance i take the negro repeated it should be all right unless some senator is hiring those fellas with the rifle muskets what am i supposed to say to that consul stafford wondered do you want me to tell you theyd never do anything like that he asked aloud do you want me to tell you theyre too honorable to get those ideas nah frederick shook his head youd be lying and wed both know it hell and breakfast your excellency some of emd shoot a white man who said anything about slavery most of emd shoot an uppity nigger or fix it up so somebody else did the shooting for em stafford didnt argue the point how could he he did say dont you think thats a good argument for staying right where you are i wont lieid like to frederick radcliff answered but if i do what do you think the chances are the slug hollow agreementll go through it would still have some chance i think stafford said judiciously uhhuh thats about what i think itd have somenot too much frederick said if i do go if i can calm things down odds get a lot better you white folks have already had plenty of chances to kill me whats one more his laughter was not filled with mirth neither was the chuckle stafford returned its not as if copperskins and negroes never took a shot at me no huh this time frederick radcliff did sound amused if you didnt sign that paper thered be plenty of em whod still want to let the air out of you you mean there arent any now stafford asked oh maybe some frederick allowed but there would be more he cocked his head to one side nobody here but us chickens right now your excellency how come you didnt back away from slug hollow soon as you had the chance i wouldve bet my shirt you wouldan i wouldve lost it too i thought about it stafford saidthat wouldnt surprise the black man the consul went on but what good would it have done me if i had the fighting would just have started up again maybe we would have won it i think we would once you provoked us enough to make us push back hard what would winning mean though it wouldnt turn the clock back to where it was before the insurrection started i think we would have had to kill most of the blacks and copperskins in the country to make the rest quit the new rising in gernika says the same thing yes i think so too frederick radcliff agreed quietly all right then consul stafford spread his hands if we killed most of our slaves we couldnt go on living the way we could when we had them all and going on the old way would be the only point to repudiating slug hollow you cant put humpty dumpty together again frederick said no you sure cant stafford nodded all the kings horses and all the kings men and since the old way wont work any more wed better try to make the new ones work as well as they can thats how it looks to me all right i didnt reckon itd look that way to you frederick said no eh this time staffords chuckle was distinctly wry the other thing that happened was as soon as the terms we agreed to in slug hollow got out every idiot in new hastings started telling me what kind of idiot i was when a damned fool starts screaming at you you know hes got to be wrong and if hes wrong what does that mean it means youre right you follow me oh yes ohhh yes frederick answered the canniest senator could have sounded no more convincing one of the sweetest things in the world is rubbing some dumb son of a bitchs nose in just what a dumb son of a bitch he really is now that you mention ityes the consul said drunk hed seen that lorenzo was a man not so very different from him now sober he realized the same thing about frederick radcliff which meant he and his ancestors back to the earliest days of slaveholding in atlantis had been wrongheaded through and through which meant the slug hollow accord was probably the least the usa should be doing not the most but that was a worry for another day today had plenty of worries of its own among them i do wish you the best of luck coming back safe from st augustine i believe you frederick replied i wouldnt have a few months ago but i do now thats all right i wouldnt have meant it a few months ago stafford said things change either you change with themor you dont and they roll over you i dont like that lord knows but its the only game in town no he didnt like it one bit which as hed said mattered not even a cents worth xxv frederick radcliff thought he knew everything there was to know about living in a warm muggy climate as soon as he got off his steamshipanother firstand rode inland from st augustine he realized he was an amateur sweat sprang out on his skin but it didnt cool him because it didntit couldntevaporate it just clung leaving him hot and wet one of the men in the cavalry escort the national government had given him wore spectacles the trooper took them off and polished them with a rag then set them back on his nose ten minutes later he did it again goddamned things keep steaming up he grumbled the ground was flat and swampy frederick saw shades of green hed never imagined before ferns grew everywhere they even sprouted from the sides of brick walls heronsblue and gray and white some of them almost as tall as a manstood in shallow pools every so often one of those bayonet beaks would plunge into the water a wriggling fish or frog or salamander would vanish at a gulp vultures spiraling down out of the sky drew fredericks notice to carrion before his nose caught the sicklysweet reek the men from his escort smelled it about the same time he did somethings dead one of them said something big added the trooper with the eyeglasses he tried to wipe the condensation off them one more time by the way he swore under his breath as he stuffed the rag back into his tunic pocket he wasnt having much luck they rode around a corner and then all reined in at once a corpse hung from the branches of a cypress tree frederick thought it was a negros but it might have been a copperskins not easy to be sure it was bloated and blackened and the carrion birds had already been at it a turkey vulture perched on the branch not far from where the noose was tied it sent the travelers a beady jet stare so battered was the body that it might even have been a white mans hanged by the insurrectionists it might have been but it wasnt a placard tied to it warned slaves stay quiet they were still in country white men controlled then how much longer till we get to where the slaves have kicked off the traces frederick asked should be pretty soon a cavalryman answered when they start shooting at us from ambush thats a pretty good sign was it frederick wasnt so sure rebellious slaves might want to fire at government soldiers yes but disgruntled white men could also want to shoot at a negro whod already led a muchtoosuccessful uprising you knew that before you came down here frederick reminded himself and so he had but the knowledge hadnt seemed so immediate in new hastings what would keep a white man from hiding in the ferns near that tree and potting the fellow whod helped turn his world inside out the stink would you fool frederick wouldnt have wanted to wait in ambush here maybe one of the vultures would have but he couldnt think of anyone else who was likely to then they rode past the hanged man with the way the breeze was blowing that took the stench away frederick started looking apprehensively at every clump of ferns or bushes every stand of squat barrel trees every fence and slave cabin if somebody wanted to take a shot at him it would be easy guards or no guards before long the death reek returned theyd passed from land the whites controlled into country the rebels held here and there animals lay bloating in the fields there were only a few of those though frederick understood why most of the beasts would have been butchered and eaten but he wouldnt have seen any in a peaceful countryside human bodies lay in the fields too his nose told him many more people had died somewhere out of sight slave cabins stood empty some with doors yawning open so did big houses the ones that hadnt burned many of the planters houses had had their windows smashed so that they stared out at the muddy road like so many skulls with big black blind eye sockets in rebel country several cavalrymen held up white flags of truce frederick wondered how much good they would doand whether they would do any then he decided they had to do some without them he was sure his party already would have been attacked how do we get them to come out and to us talk asked the lieutenant who commanded his guards maximilian brauns side whiskers had gray in them he spoke with a heavy german accentlike a dutchman most atlanteans would have said like colonel sinapis and a good many others hed washed up on these shores because of some european political upheaval he would be grayer yet before he got a captains third small star on either side of his collar one thing frederick was sure oflike most europeans braun had no use for slavery maybe we should stop and stay in one place a while the negro said why not braun said that will them a better chance give to surround us and wipe us out no matter what he thought about slavery he had an acute sense of selfpreservation well who didnt but the officer gave the necessary orders his men set about making camp they ran up a large atlantean flag the scarlet redcrested eagles head on dark blue had never meant much to frederickhe was in atlantis but not of it now that might change he hoped it would along with the national flag the soldiers also went on flying a large flag of truce frederick hoped it would do some good if it didnt if it didnt he was liable to discover in short order that lieutenant braun hadnt been joking the immigrant didnt sound as if he had been braun set out sentries at the cardinal points of the compass the rest of the troopers tended to their horses having watched cavalrymen before frederick knew they worried about the mounts ahead of themselves as soon as the animals were brushed and fed and watered the troopers sat or squatted on the ground and started shooting dice one of them glanced up at frederick want to get into the game he asked sounding friendlier than white men commonly did frederick needed only a heartbeat to figure out why the trooper saw him as a victim to be fleecedor more likely skinned it wasnt as if frederick had never made the little ivory cubes spin himself but sorry he said ive got me a rule against gambling with the other fellas dice you aint so dumb the trooper said not without regret too bad i was kinda hopin you were he eyed the negro in a different way you really think you can get these rebels to behave im here to try frederick answered sure sure the cavalryman nodded as he rattled the dice in his right hand but what are the odds he threw the dice seven he said happily and scooped up the money on the ground what were the odds frederick shrugged well just have to find out thats all wonderful the trooper said were liable to find out theyd sooner kill us than talk to us what do we do then try and fight them try and stay alive frederick replied he could have given the answer in one word but he preferred not to say that word out loud die yes they could easily do that leland newton wished he were down in gernika he couldnt remember the last time such a longing had overtaken him he didnt think such a longing had ever overtaken him before come to that ever since atlantis acquired it from spain the new state had drowsed under the subtropical son if its senators were more impassioned about slavery than men from other states south of the stour it didnt send many of them to new hastings its free population was small newton understood that he wouldnt have cared to make his home in the midst of such humid heat either ten or twelve years earlier a great cyclone had chewed across gernikas southern peninsula not all the damage from it was repaired even yet nothing happened fast down in gernika up till now that might as well have been a law of nature but times changed if that wasnt a motto for the bustling driving nineteenth century newton didnt know what would be when he was a boy steam engines had been rare expensive novelties now steamships plied the seven seas railroads with steamdriven locomotives tied the land down under an evertightening web of iron and another web this one of copper wires almost as thin and insubstantial as gossamer brought news from one place to another as soon as it happened who at the turn of the century would have dreamt of any of that who at any time in all the prior history of the world would have dreamt of change fast enough to be visible in one mans lifetime no one now the nineteenth century and the men of the nineteenth century had to try to cope with it some tried to cope by denying that that change was real slaverys diehard defenders seemed to newton to be such men but the change was there whether they liked it or not even a sensible conservative like jeremiah stafford could see as much that he could finally see as much went a long way toward making him sensible in newtons eyes and some tried to push change along even faster than newton thought it ought to go he was pretty sure stafford and he could eventually get the slug hollow agreement through the senate the slaves in gernika didnt want to wait theyd had enough of waiting at white mens orders for white mens profit newton didnt know what they aimed to do on their own he suspected they didnt either but it would be of their choosing which was what they wanted if frederick radcliff could calm them down and persuade them to wait the prestige he gained in so doing would surely help the slug hollow accord according to stafford that was fredericks calculation but if things didnt go the way the negro hoped the cost was unlikely to remain only political chances were frederick wouldnt come back to new hastings again he had to know it tooknow it better than anyone but hed gone all the same some whites still insisted on calling the insurrectionist slaves a pack of cowards newton hadnt believed that before he saw his first battlefield in all the fights against the negroes and copperskins he hadnt seen them perform any less bravely than their white foes and going forward into the face of what was much too likely to be death in gernika took a courage of its own so leland newton thought at any rate several senators from south of the stour saw things differently and werent shy about saying so on the senate floor the sooner that radcliff niggers disposed of the better off everyone will be declared a diehard slaveholder from nouveau redon by everyone no doubt the honorable gentleman means the entire population of gernika except for whites copperskins and negroes newton observed dryly yes i mean no too late the conscript father realized hed stuck his foot in it not only did consul newton mock him from the dais but jeers rose on the floor both from northern senators and also from men who would normally have supported him with a baleful stare the senator from nouveau redon shook his fist at newton you tricked me it wasnt hard newton answered that may perhapsonly perhaps noteindicate that the honorable gentleman was talking through his hat the honorable gentleman didnt believe he was doing any such thing somehow newton hadnt thought he would the honorable gentleman tried to demonstrate he was doing no such thing by talking through his hat some moreat interminable length interminable at any rate till consul stafford terminated the torrent of verbiage with several sharp raps of his gavel that will be quite enough of that quite a bit too much of that in fact the gentleman is out of order by god sir i am not the senator shouted furiously im afraid you are stafford said more in sorrow than in angerfor the time being at any rate you are so far out of order that it would take a most superior watchmaker to pop off your back tighten your mainspring oil you up and generally get you running again as you should watchmaker the senator spluttered what nonsense are you spouting now goddamned watchmaker and you said i was talking through my hat no he didnt i did newton said and you were and you are and it looks like youll keep right on doing it unless you sit down and shut up so why dont you do that instead sir hear hear as the laughter had before the cry rose from northern and southern senators together outraged but even more downcast the senator from nouveau redon sank into his chair and resentfully fell silent newton turned to stafford thank you your excellency the other consul nodded back thank you your excellency they smiled at each other newton couldnt remember that happening up on the dais before the slug hollow agreement however little stafford might want them to they found themselves on the same side now and on the same side as frederick radcliff that would all fall apart if the negro came to grief in gernika i should be down there helping him newton thought again but for the life of him he didnt see what he could do to help frederick radcliffs position and power might lie outside the charter but they were no less real for that theyd been camped west of st augustine for three days before a rebel slave showed himself lieutenant braun had a bad case of the fidgets by then frederick radcliff didnt far better than the white officer he understood how leery of authority the insurrectionists were hed wondered whether any of them would appear at all or whether they would melt off into the swamps and the barreltree thickets till he and the atlantean soldiers went away but a copperskin did come out of the greenery the flag of truce he carried had been hacked from a bedsheet a planters bedsheet frederick thoughtthe cloth was too white and too fine ever to have belonged to a slave you really frederick radcliff the copperskin called to him plainly not wanting to come any closer than he had to i really am frederick radcliff frederick shouted back who are you my friends call me quince the other man answered pronouncing it in two syllableskeensaynot like the name of the fruit it means fifteen in spanish why do they call you that frederick asked as he was obviously meant to do oh maybe its because thats how many white men ive done for quince said eyeing the cavalrymen with frederick or maybe its because he glanced down at himself with unmistakable male complacency he wore baggy slave trousers so it was impossible to be sure what he had in mind but a trooper got the same idea frederick did and at the same time too frederick was constrained by what he saw as diplomacy the trooper wasnt and hooted in derision now tell me another one he bawled in quinces direction my goddamned horse aint that big poor creature quince said if he was joking he joked with a straight faceor something frederick shook his own head like a man harassed by mosquitoes at the moment he wasnt that kind of man but in gernika he was liable to turn into that kind of man any second now he had some gauzy netting to sleep inand he had some bites i dont care how youre hung he told quince come on in and talk with us if you dont want to get hanged the trooper whod doubted quinces attributes groaned several other cavalrymen sent frederick reproachful stares maybe they hadnt thought negroes could make such bad puns if they hadnt it only proved they hadnt been around negroes much as for quince himself he gaped at frederick then he threw back his head and yipped he sounded more like a fox barking at the moon than a man laughing but the grin on his face declared that that was what he had to be nobody told me you were a funny fellow he said walking toward frederick and the troopers dont worry about it frederick answered nobody told me i was either that drew more yips from quince frederick went on can you speak for all the slaves whove risen up in these parts if i cant nobody can quince declared the trouble was maybe nobody could as frederick radcliff had reason to know insurrectionists lacked the atlantean armys neat chain of command the army relied on hundreds of yearsthousands of years some officers saidof military tradition every band of rebels made things up as it went along lieutenant brauns thoughts must have run along a similar track can you for these slave rebels speak he demanded as if he were contemplating seizing quince for impersonating a spokesman rather than for any of the real crimes the copperskin must have committed for all frederick knew the dutchman was contemplating exactly that he seemed a very orderly officer but quince nodded back at him i can i do i will the copperskin said an enumeration thorough enough to satisfy even maximilian braun casually as if the matter were of no great importance but did need mentioning quince added anything bad happens to me itll happen to you people tooonly slower he walked into the encampment ja ja lieutenant braun sounded impatient not afraid frederick admired his coolness unsure he could imitate it himself the negros eyes surveyed the ferns from which quince had emerged he saw no other fighters which proved nothing they would be out there a sergeant muttered something to one of the troopers the man looked surprised but nodded he brought quince a square of hardtack some chewy army sausage that was about half salt and a tin mug of coffee for now were friends the soldier said he sounded none too friendly but sometimes actions spoke louder than words quince eyed the food as if wondering if it was laced with rat poison in his place frederick would have wonderedhad wonderedthe same thing trusting the men whod bought and sold you didnt come easy for a slave in atlantis but the gernikan rebel leader ate he showed no great enthusiasm but who could get enthusiastic about rations after washing down the bite of hardtack with some coffee he nodded back at the trooper whod fed him for now he agreed maybe for longer i hope so frederick said you know about the slug hollow arrangements the ones theyre talking over now in new hastings heard little bitsthats about all quince said masters dont like that kind of news getting to slaves so they sit on it as hard as they can frederick radcliff nodded back in his days on the barford plantationonly last year though they seemed as far away as china or japanhed seen the same thing slaveholders werent fools and like the army they had lots of experience on their side if slaves didnt hear news that had to do with them they couldnt get all hot and bothered about it and so slaveholders did their level best to keep their twolegged property in the dark what it comes down to is the senates working up toward saying these arrangements are the way things ought to be in atlantis from here on out frederick told him slavesll be freefree as white men theyll have the same rightsall of em theyll get to own property theyll get to vote if somebody elects em theyll get to go to statehouses or to the senate their kidsll go to school same as white boys and you say the senates gonna do this quince didnt call him a liar not in so many words but he might as well have howd that happen on account of the slaves i led whipped the snot out of the atlantean army the senate sent out against us thats how frederick said proudly quinces eyes lit up and you killed all the fuckers nigger youre my kind of man frederick radcliff was far from sure he wanted to be quinces kind of man but he did want quince to be his kind of man here no we didnt he replied the government never wouldve let us alone if we had we took their guns and let them go and made terms with them there wont be any slaves left in atlantis after the slug hollow agreement goes throughif it does but those goddamned asswipes in new hastings wont let it happen huh quince said sounds like them by jesus no thats not what was going on frederick answered i think they would have passed it sooner or later but then they got word of this uprising they got to wondering if i could bring slaves along in the deal or if folksd just keep on fighting can you blame us for rising up against these fucking dons quince said and the shitheads who came down after atlantis bought gernika are just as bad he paused then shook his head nah theyre even worse on account of they dont know when to quit and the spaniards do well sometimes how can i blame you for rising up when i rose up too frederick said but theres a good time to do that stuff and theres a time that aint so good you couldve picked a better one huh if quince was impressed he didnt show it and what happens when we put down our guns white devils jump on us with both feet thats what he answered his own question before frederick could but frederick said no thats not how itll work you put down your guns now itll be like it was a war and nobodyll come after you later on give me a new story why dont youone ill believe scorn filled quinces voice if the government in new hastings has to itll send in soldiers to keep white folks off your back frederick insisted go on youre tryin to fool me quince said no such thing honest to god quince i mean it frederick raised his right hand as if taking an oath but you got to do it pretty quick if you dont if the important white folks back in new hastings decide i cant deliver the goods i got you the copperskin stabbed a forefinger in his direction you want to be a big fella himself and you want to get big on account of us im already a big fella frederick said what i want is for slaves to get free thats the size of it you keep doing what youre doing you could mess that up for niggers and mudfaces all over atlantis says you yeah says me frederick answered and the reason i say so is its true you go on killing people and burning stuff theyll send lots of soldiers after you and i wont be able to do anything about it so well lick em you say you did quince seemed stubborn enough to make a proper leader for a rebel band he might have got on well with lorenzo we did and maybe you will but even if you do youll still be hurting all the other slaves in atlantis frederick said why should we care when did them other fuckers ever care about us before frederick could answer lieutenant braun unexpectedly broke in one of your poets in english wrote no man an island is he was wise in spite of an englishman being whatever you do to other folk it makes a difference whatever they do to you it matters believe me i would not be in this strange land a stranger if this were not so huh quince said i cant decide here on my own i got to go back and talk with some other people know what i mean sure frederick said do that then strange even insurrectionists find it needful to invent again the committee braun said this may gods judgment upon us be huh quince repeated not knowing what to make of that frederick radcliff didnt know either still scratching his head the copperskin eased away from the people whod entered his territory and slipped off into the woods it could be that you him convinced lieutenant braun said could be yeah frederick said could be you helped too hope so he shrugged now we wait and see what happens next thats all for jeremiah stafford waiting and seeing what happened next was the hardest part of having frederick radcliff go off to gernika if the negro persuaded his fellow slaves to abandon their revolt he would be a hero if the slaves kept fighting whites in the senate would decide frederick couldnt keep his own side in linewhich would doom the slug hollow agreement and if some angry white man down by st augustine shot frederick negroes and copperskins in the rest of the country would explodewhich would also doom the slug hollow agreement dooming the slug hollow agreement would also doom consul staffordpolitically anyhow frederick radcliff was liable to be doomed in the far more literal sense of the word hed understood that when he set out for gernika but hed gone anyhow that was admirable or stupid depending on ones point of view stafford wanted to think the black man was nothing but the usual dumb nigger he wanted to but he couldnt whatever frederick was usual he wasnt and the two of them were bound together now like those occasional sets of twins that seldom lived long if frederick failed he pulled stafford down with him that was part of what went with signing the accord at slug hollow for the life of him though stafford still didnt see what else he could have done some of his senatorial colleagues from states south of the stour understood why hed done what hed done not all of them were willing to admit it where a reporteror even a waitermight overhear them and quote them but they would when they talked with him in private others understood nothing and didnt care to be enlightened a senator from gernika with the euphonious name of storm whitson thundered against that interfering nigger with every breath he took and storm whitson had taken a lot of breaths he was up past ninety as a youth hed carried a musket against king georges redcoats later hed moved south to gernika and made his fortune in indigo and riceand in clever slavedealing stafford wished he could blame whitsons intemperance on senile decay but while the old man wore thick glasses and cupped a hand behind his ear to get the drift of what other senators were saying his mind was clear hed been thundering about negroes and copperskins for as long as anyone could remember he stood up on the senate floor nowleaning on a stick yes but despite that straighter than many younger menand shouted these inferior breeds must remain under our thumb god has ordained it and we would go against his will if we were to change the way we have done things for so long heads bobbed up and down not so long before staffords would have been one of those nodding heads he too had believed the slaveholders course was ordained by god but if it was why had god let the insurrectionists beat the stuffing out of the atlantean army in the backwoods of new marseille before he could ask the question his comrade on the dais found a different one i realize the honorable conscript father is a man of remarkable experience consul newton saidloudly to make sure senator whitson heard him but will he tell this house he was present at the creation and heard from jehovahs lips this onus laid upon the darker races senators from north of the stour laughed so did some from south of the river storm whitson simply stood there a living illustration of the third part of the riddle of the sphinx beware your excellency lest god punish you for your iniquity he said if you are so sure he will then he must speak to you eh newton said god will speak to any man who opens his heart and listens senator whitson replied any man who opens his mouth and talks can say god speaks to him newton observed but saying something doesnt make it so as you have proved time and again whitson snapped he might be getting frail but his wits had indeed stayed sharpsharp enough to make newton wince stafford used his gavel discussions of god and his purposes do not belong in the senate he said as the atlantean assembly ordained even before we won our freedom from england our people may follow any faith they choose or if they choose they may follow none the lord will punish them if they choose to follow none whitson declared maybe as a matter of fact i think so too butstafford shruggedneither of us can prove it its between them and god not between them and us i always thought the atlantean assembly made a mistake whitson said a proper christian country has no business putting up with jews and freethinkers and other unrighteous folk by law the united states of atlantis are not a proper christian country stafford said follow the bible in your own life if you want to no one will tell you you may not but in the senate we will follow the law follow it even when it takes us straight to ruination whitson jeered change isnt ruin we need to get used to that we need to remember it consul newton said ive had reason to think about that quite a bit lately change is only change it can be good or bad it doesnt have to be either one when youve seen as much change as i have young fellow youll know its mostly bad senator whitson said and this change you want to ram down our throats is the worst one yet nigger equality pah he made as if to spit the way it looks to me we have one choice besides liberating our slaves we can kill them all or try jeremiah stafford said we cant trust them to go on serving us the way they did before the slug hollow agreement may not be a wonderful bargain for atlantis it is the best bargain we could get things being as they are nonsense the senator from gernika said it isnt stafford answered even now part of me wishes it were but it isnt frederick radcliff couldnt have been any more bored waiting for quince to step out of the undergrowth again he knew the copperskin might tell him the rebels didnt intend to lay down their arms he knew quince might not come back alone but at the head of a swarm of slaves if quince did frederick wouldnt see new hastings or helen again but he couldnt do anything about any of that he also couldnt worry about it all the time and so he was bored he was so bored he did get into the cavalry troopers seemingly unending dice game he lost five and a half eagles in less time than it takes to tell after that he got out of the game again sure we cant talk you into sticking one of the horsemen asked rattling the bones as temptingly as he could nah ive already been as much of a sucker as i can afford to be and some more besides frederick answered you might win this time the trooper rattled the dice again slim odds frederick left it right there he didnt know the game was crooked he didnt want to waste any more money on a voyage of discovery either a lifetime of slavery had convinced him each and every gold eagleeach and every silver tencent piecewas precious losing so many so fast what helen would say if she ever found out no he didnt want to play any more then the troopers quit coaxing him they all grabbed for their eightshooters one of them pointed heres that mudfaced son of a bitch again sure enough there stood quince at the edge of the open ground lots of dirt in the southern states though not that of gernika was reddish which was how copperskins got their nasty nickname quince waved his big white flag come on in frederick called the truce holds no matter what you tell us maybe so maybe not if the cavalrymen decided plugging quince would help them theyd do it how could frederick stop them he couldnt he knew it and quince had to know it too but the rebel leader did come in along with the flag of truce he had a pepperbox pistol on his right hip chances were it had been some planters prized possession and chances were that planter needed it no more and would never need it again ceremoniously quince laid the fancy pistol at frederick radcliffs feet were gonna try peace quince said as if it were a dangerous possibly poisonous medicine like mercury for the pox if we can put down our guns and still get free thats worth doing but if it dont work out nigger youll answer to me one black could call another nigger without a jolt the word packed some in a copperskins mouth as mudface did in a negros quince had used it before mostly in admiration frederick didnt think he intended malice this time fair enough he answered but if it dont work out you got to stand in line plenty of other folksll want to nail my hide to the wall i believe that quince said nobodys gonna come down on us cause we rose up or cause of stuff we did while we were fighting thats the deal frederick said nobodyll go to law with you on account of any of that white survivors might try to take private revenge if they came to trial white juries mightlikely wouldacquit them frederick didnt know what he could do about that so far he hadnt come up with anything but it was outside the law and negroes and copperskins could also play those games once they were free they for true gonna pass that arrangement up in new hastings quince asked if they dont we all start fighting again frederick answered they got to know that too chances that they will pass it just got better too if your people honest to god do quit fighting still a couple of snowball cocksuckers i wouldnt mind finishing but i guess i can let em live quince said frederick nodded those whites were just as sure to want quince dead well they and he would have to forgo the pleasure if the slug hollow accord passed it has to now frederick thought doesnt it xxvi jeremiah stafford hated waiting when you had to sit there twiddling your thumbs what you were waiting for usually wasnt anything you wanted it might be something you needed but that was a different story if you had a toothache you waited for the dentist to get to work on you then you waited for whatever horrible things he was doing to be over ether was supposed to help with that torment as it did with so many others stafford hadnt had to visit a toothdrawer since the stuff came into use he wasnt so eager to test its virtues that he wanted to visit one either nobody with a full set of marbles wanted to visit the dentist what the consul waited for now wasnt the cessation of pain if the news here proved bad though it could end up causing more pain than all the toothaches hed ever had put together bad news here could split atlantis like a jeweler splitting a sapphireor less neatly like a drunk falling out of a secondstory window and breaking his leg the second comparison seemed to stafford to fit better he wished it didnt ever since the redcoats sailed away new hastings had been the place where important things happened in the usa now all of a sudden it wasnt as history had been made in slug hollow stafford did his best to forget all the fighting preceding that bit of history so now it would be made somewhere outside of st augustine in the heat and humidity and insignificance of gernika but what kind of history would be made there that was what stafford waited to discover along with the rest of official new hastings he didnt have a flannel rag tied around his head to keep a swollen jaw from tormenting him quite so much but he might as well have he was pretending to go through paperwork in his office when his secretary stuck his head in and said your excellency a soldier wants to see you a soldier stafford echoed and the secretary nodded with a shrug the consul said all right ned send him in whatever the soldier wanted talking to him was bound to be more interesting than a report on the previous fiscal years revenues and expenses pertaining to canals the soldier strode in and delivered a salute as stiff as a marionettes he was a young second lieutenant so new in his uniform that he all but squeaked your excellency he said and saluted again i am lieutenant morris radcliffe and i have the honor to bring you a report colonel sinapis has just received from lieutenant braun who commands the security detail assigned to frederick radcliff in gernika stafford wondered which twig morris radcliffe represented on the familys huge manybranched tree he wondered how the lieutenant was related to him and how the youngster was related to frederick radcliff he also wondered what morris radcliffe thought of being related to a negro but he wondered none of those things for more than a split second news from colonel sinapis from this lieutenant braun he barked well out with it man sir uh yes sir startled by staffords outburst lieutenant radcliffe had to compose himself before he could remember what he was supposed to say colonel sinapis told me to tell you that lieutenant braun told him that frederick radcliff has arranged an end to the hostilities between whites and slaves in and around st augustine he has arranged that stafford wanted to make sure hed got it straight sometimes you heard with your heart not your ears yes your excellency he has young radcliffe confirmed it at the present momentor at the moment lieutenant braun sent the telegramthere is uh was no fighting in gernika the negroes and copperskins who had rebelled against established authority are coming in from the woods and swamps what else would they be coming in from as far as stafford knew gernika had precious little territory that wasnt woods or swamps he forced his wandering wits back to the matter at hand well he said and then well again on the third try he managed something better its a great day for atlantis yes sir i think so too lieutenant radcliffe looked confused colonel sinapis told me he thought you would say something like that what with where you come from and all i wasnt so sure he was right by the way the lieutenant talked hed been born north of the stour some northerners thought anybody who favored slavery had been issued horns and pitchforks by satan himself some men from staffords part of the country felt the same about people who opposed slavery stafford had himself not so long before he declined to dwell on that now wearily the consul answered even when you wish they would things dont always last when they wear out youve got to patch em up or get rid of em and try something new doesnt look like we can patch slavery since we cant wed better figure out how to get along without it dont you think me uh yes sir lieutenant radcliffe gulped and blushed like a girl thats my personal opinion you understand your excellency my opinion as a soldier well soldiers arent supposed to have opinions about stuff that has to do with politics of course stafford said dryly and the juniorvery juniorofficer turned pinker yet but it was a sound rule soldiers were supposed to do what the people who did concern themselves with politics told them to do they werent supposed to give their superiors any back talk about it either if opinions got hot enough the system would break down if commanded to put down slaveholders some soldiers from south of the stour would refuse as stafford had seen for himself fewer from north of the river would refuse to fight slaves that had been true before the slug hollow agreement anyhow maybe it wasnt any more northerners were liable to figure the south had had its chance for a tolerable peace and to refuse to help it any further if it turned its back on that chance he hoped that wouldnt come up if there was any justice in the world it wouldnt whether you have opinions about politics or not lieutenant i do and i will give you one of mine stafford said if i cant get the slug hollow agreement through the senate after this i will go home while leland newton was campaigning against the slave insurrectionists the newspapers called him and consul stafford and colonel sinapis every kind of idiot under the sun they called frederick radcliff worse than that now conveniently forgetting what theyd said then they sported headlines with words like peace and justice and dignity and statesmanship prominently displayed they applied those words not only to frederick but also to the two consuls who got credit for sending him south to st augustine even sinapis came in for praise the papers said generous things about his common sense and restraint those same qualities had been conspicuously absent in his conduct of the campaign against the rebels west of the green ridge mountainsagain if you believed the newspapers newton didnt which didnt stop him from reading them if you added them all togetherthe ones that loved you and the ones that loathed youyou might come within spitting distance of the truth even if you didnt you would find out what editorsand the men who paid themthought to be the truth and in politics what people thought to be true was at least as important as what was true the consul from croydon also found his colleague from cosquer as eager as he was to get the slug hollow accord through the senate the only problem was southern senators kept using every delaying tactic they could find newton had known fools like storm whitson would go right on being foolish he had expected canny politicos like abel marquard to see which way the wind was blowing didnt you make some kind of arrangement with frederick radcliff before he left for gernika newton asked arent you reneging on it now marquards expressive nostrils flared i would never make an arrangement with a negroexcept the kind his grandfather made with his grandmother how could i renege on an arrangement i did not make what if he claims you did asked newton who knew better than to take everything the slippery senator said at face value what if he does senator marquard answered easily people claim all kinds of things they cant prove he may not need to prove it hell be a very popular man when he comes back from st augustine newton said if he tells the papers you said this that or the other thing dont you think most people who read that will believe it people not of our profession may but who worries about what people not of our profession believe only other people not of our profession marquard snapped his fingers to show what he thought of such people they elect the burgesses wholl vote on whether to reelect you newton said senator marquard snapped his fingers again he seemed bound and determined to stay unimpressed and on the senate floor he seemed bound and determined to keep the slug hollow agreement from ever reaching a vote he had friends too friends newton hadnt expected him to have cant you do anything about those people newton asked jeremiah stafford most of them come from your state im trying stafford said so are they newton answered exceedingly trying heh the other consul said let me put that another way i am doing everything i know how to do well then youd better come up with something new because what you know how to do isnt working newton said stafford glared i dont see that im getting much help from you from me any senator from south of the stour would just as soon cut me as look at me newton exaggerated but not by much maybe we really do need to wait and see if the negro can bring them to their senses maybe we do but stafford didnt seem convinced for he went on have you any ideaany idea at allhow strange relying on a negro for anything at all seems to me perhaps not in croydon though negroesand copperskinshave been citizens for longer than ive been alive theyve been citizens longer than atlantis has been free of england wewhites i meandont always love them but were used to treating them like men not like children or farm animals newton said and how often do they leave you sorry youve treated them that way the other consul asked well i dont have statistics at my fingertips the way the minister of the fisc does with his accounts my impression is that theyre about as reliable as white mennot much worse not much better newton replied fair enough stafford said is it any wonder im worried then when you put it that way no consul newton wished he could give a different answer but any politico learned early in the game not to count on other people too much regardless of their color if he didnt learn that he didnt stay in the game long enough to learn much else when frederick radcliff came back to new hastings he got a parade through the towns old old streets people cheered himwhites blacks and copperskins he waved to the crowd as a brass band thumped behind him he took off his tall hat and waved it too sitting beside him in the open carriage helen seemed ready to burst with pride the next day frederick called on senator marquard at marquards offices in the senate house marquards white secretary gravely told him the politico was indisposed and could not see him frederick said oh too bad and went away but when abel marquard was also indisposed the following day and the day after that the negro began to suspect a trend he went to the house marquard rented in new hastings only a couple of blocks from the senate house the senators negro butler received him there pleasure to meet you mr radcliff said the other black man whose name was clarence everybodys proud of youyoud best believe that thank you kindly frederick said by everybody clarence doubtless meant everybody our color he had to be a highly trusted man or the senator wouldnt have brought him to a state where he could run off if he chose frederick went on can i see himself he hadnt had such a prominent master but hed done clarences job for henry barford hes here im sure hed be glad to see you wait just a minute the butler answered obliged frederick wasnt so sure of that but he didnt say so clarence came back almost as fast as hed promised his smile had disappeared though well he will see you he said and took it no further than that senator marquards study would have made master barford jealous the senator did shake hands with frederick but didnt look happy doing it i kept my half of the bargain sir frederick said without preamble now its time for you to keep yours bargain what bargain by the way marquard said the word it might have come from russian or chinese we made no bargain that i recollect frederick stared at him hed known some pretty fancy liars in his time but for straightfaced gall the senator from cosquer took the prize you know damned well what bargain sir frederick said and proceeded to spell it out in words of one syllable by abel marquards manner he might have been hearing of it for the very first time my dear fellow he exclaimed when frederick finished when you were down in gernika you must have eaten some of the mystic mushrooms that grow thereyou know the ones that can make men think they see god or the devil sitting in front of them till they get better you are imagining things oh i am am i frederick said grimly if i think i see the devil sitting in front of me now its on account of im looking right at you he stormed out of the senators study something wrong clarence asked him oh you might say so yeah you just might the story poured out of frederick is that what happened clarence said when he finished thats just what happened so help me god it is frederick raised his right hand as if to swear it i believe you hes an old serpent the master isa sly old serpent but a serpent even so senator marquards butler spoke with a certain somber pride after shaking his head clarence went on he aint gonna get away with it though not this time slug hollows too important to let him well i think so too frederick radcliff said but what can you do about it he paused grinning that kind of stuff clarence laid a finger by the side of his broad flat nose and winked yeah that kind of stuff you leave it to me friend frederick nodded and left senator marquards residence hed warned the senator that marquards own slaves wouldnt let him get away with such doubledealing now he had to hope he was right he intended to give clarence a week before going to the newspapers himself he feared that would put the senators back up instead of bringing him around but it was the only weapon he had he turned out not to need it four days after abel marquard had denied making any agreement to back the slug hollow accord if frederick quelled the uprising in gernika the senator publicly announced his support for the accord it may not be a perfect bargain marquard declared in ringing tones on the senate floor but it is the best one we are likely to get marquard was an influential man when he lined up behind slug hollow he brought a good many other senators with him frederick had hoped he would do exactly that the negro almost sought out the senator to ask him why hed changed his mind but frederick didnt need long to decide not to do that he sought out clarence instead they didnt meet at marquards house that might have proved embarrassing to all concerned a tavern and eatery that catered to negroes copperskins and poor whites served better than well enough over fried fish and mugs of beer frederick asked what did you do who me clarence might have borrowed that blank look from his master i didnt do anything i didnt do anything at all even the things i was supposed to do you ever listen to a white man who has to find his own cravat and black his own shoes a slow grin spread across frederick radcliffs face i like that oh it gets better too clarence said it sure does he had to give his own washing to the laundry gal too an she made a mess of itjust by accident of course of course frederick agreed they both chuckled socks and drawers got starched shirts an trousers didnt a jacket got washed in hot water so it shrank like you wouldnt believe such a shame clarence rolled his eyes and i aint even started on what the cooks been up to no frederick asked eagerly no sir clarence shook his head the bread was scorched one day the next day it didnt rise the shrimp in the stew were a little offjust a little but enough he held his nose the masters were anyhow what we got was firstrate something in the salad gave the senator the runs after that he got word things werent goin real well down on his plantation neither soon as he heard that he started wondering if something funny was goin on now why would he think anything like that butter wouldnt have melted in fredericks mouth beats me i havent got the slightest idea anybody listening to clarence would have been convinced he too was one of gods naturalborn innocents but then he had a little talk with me you hear him talk he figures niggers and mudfaces they never heard of slug hollow or what led up to it likely tell frederick burst out uhhuh clarence nodded you cant believe how surprised he acted when i turned out to know as much about it as he did clarence he says clarence you really want to be free and have all that trouble taking care of your own self and he looks surprised all over again when i go i sure do master marquard an i dont know me one single slave who dont there may be some but i dont know none what did he say then frederick asked eagerly he says if i want to live long enough to go home again once im done in the senate reckon i better go along with slug hollow huh an i say senator marquard sir i hope you live a real long time but if you want black folks an copper folks to stay happy with you you got to know we is all for slug hollow we had to get his attention like but we finally went an done it good for you frederick said when he made out like i was a liar looked to me like the only way to to wake him up like was to hope his own people could getting him thinkin bout things we did that all right dont reckon a white man wouldve thought of it but you aint no white man even if your granddaddy was clarence said takes a fella who was a slave hisself to know how things really work with a planter and his niggers he votes for slug hollow he gets his friends to do the same we gonna be free for true for true frederick said firmly dont know what happens after that dont know if theres any happy endings you know what me i dont care clarence said long as theres a happy beginning long as i got a chance ill make it some kind of way you aint the first fella who told me that kind of thing frederick said lots of usre figurin we can make it some kind of way some of us wont clarence predicted expect youre right but some white folks dont make it either even with everything goin for them frederick answered you said itlong as weve got the chance thats what really counts yeah abel marquards butler nodded his eyes went dreamy and far away a chance just a goddamned chance honest to god clarence i think itll happen now frederick said and youve helped make it happen you know that an i know that an the senator he sure knows that too but i bet you anything it never shows up in the history books i aint gonna touch that bet i may be dumb but not so dumb clarence said when did anything a nigger did ever show up in the history books one of these day that may happen too frederick radcliff said one of these daysbut not quite yet leland newton glanced over at jeremiah stafford who nodded newton brought his gavel down smartly on the desk in front of him once twice three times the clerk of the senate will call the roll he said yes your excellency the clerk of the senate replied how often had the functionary called the roll hundredsmore likely thousandsof times hed held his post longer than newton had been in new hastings newton couldnt remember his ever acknowledging that command from a consul before but now poorly suppressed excitement filled his voice as it filled newtons new hastings hadnt known a moment like this since when since the atlantean assembly reconvened here after the redcoats went home reconvened and hammered out the system of government the usa had used ever since no doubt that was an important time but newton thought this one topped it wouldnt you have to reach all the way back to the fifteenth century when the battle of the strand ensured that no local kings no local nobility would lord it over the populace newton thought so the clerk of the senate did his best to return to his usual emotionless tone the question before the conscript fathers is shall the senate ratify the agreement made by the two consuls with one frederick radcliff and his supporters in the village of slug hollow state of new marseille no matter how hard he tried to sound dull he didnt quite succeed avalon voted first the state north of new marseille headed the alphabetical list within each states contingent the senators also voted in alphabetical order one of avalons six senators voted no slavery wasnt legal in avalon but it had been up until twentyfive years earlier some sympathy for slaveholding lingered yet cosquer came next it had more senators than avalon did since it held more people as far as newton knew every one of its conscript fathers owned slaves some of them defiantly voted against the slug hollow accord consul newton waited tensely till abel marquards name came up senator marquard the clerk of the senate intoned at last aye marquard said newton and the clerk might have failed to keep their voices emotionless but the senator from cosquer succeeded could machines have been made to speak his voice might have come from one of them he had opposed the agreement frederick radcliff had claimed the two of them had an arrangement whereby if the negro brought peace to gernika marquard would support slug hollow the senator denied everything but no matter what hed denied hed changed his mind hed announced he would support the accord and now hed gone and done it newton wondered how and why it came to pass that abel marquard had changed his mind nobody seemed to know or if anyonefrederick radcliff for instancedid know he wasnt talking something out of the ordinary must have happened but who could say what and in the end what difference did it make as long as marquard voted the right way which he did and as long as he brought some senatorial colleagues with him which he also did everything else was a matter of details the state of croydons delegation will now vote the clerk of the senate declared after the last man from cosquer spoke a defiant nay one by one the clerk polled croydons senators all of them voted to accept the accord and make slavery a thing of the past leland newton would have been horrified and astonished had they done anything else on the consular dais stafford turned and whispered to him next up is the compensation bill the way we agreed oh yes of course for a moment newton was tempted to imitate senator marquard and say something like we did the look on staffords face would almost be worth it but the operative word was almost compensation would make freeing the slaves if not delightful to the whites who owned them at least possible for those whites freeing slaves without compensation would touch off a revolt that would make the one just past newton hoped it was just past seem a childrens spat by comparison that seemed as obvious to newton as it did to stafford the other consuls warnings about the country breaking to pieces in the absence of such measures werent idle now newton would have to persuade northern senators that their states their constituents needed to see their taxes rise to placate a group of people who they were convinced were morally wrong southern senators went out on a limb for you and for atlantis he could already see in his minds eye the shape his argument would take now its your turn to do the same for them newton hoped the northern senators would keep their country in mind not just the next election at their local statehouse the one that might send them back to new hastings or hurl them into private life again rejected by their own people yes the kind of revenge the states south of the stour could take would be far worse than even the great servile insurrection like avalon freetown lay on the border with the slaveholding states two freetown senators voted against the slug hollow agreement newton winced hed expected to lose one vote there but not two even though abel marquard had come through in the end this would be closer than he wanted storm whitson looked ready to burst in anger and astonishment when the majority of the delegation from gernika voted for slug hollow brutus judas habakkuk biddiscombe and you sons of bitches he cried traitors all that remark will be stricken from the record consul newton declared and you are out of order senator well sir if i am i dont much care to be in order whitson shot back while you are on the senate floor you will abide by the senates rules newton said whatever whitson said after that the gavel overrode then it was on to hanover the most heavily populated of the united states of atlantis and also one of the states staunchest against slavery as croydons had hanovers delegation voted unanimously for the slug hollow accord after thatbefore that really but the unanimous vote made it clear to even the dullest and the most partisanthe result was plain when the last senator had voted the floor erupted in cheers and boos and applause and catcalls a northern senator punched a southerner in the nose ive wanted to do that for fifteen years he yelled then before the sergeant at arms could get to them the southerner picked himself up and decked his uncollegial colleague with a chair eventually the sergeant at arms and nearby senators untangled them on any other day such behavior would have been a great scandal it would have made headlines in papers on both sides of the stour when tomorrow came though it might not make the papers at all the slaves were free this side of the second coming what news in atlantis could be bigger than that the line that led to the justice of the peaces chambers stretched around the block when frederick radcliff and helen took their places in it most of the couples in the line were negroes and copperskins the reliable slaves of people whod come up from south of the stour to do business of one kind or another in the capital it hadnt been legal for citizens of new hastings to own slaves for many years southerners could bring them up here though the risk being that if the slaves escaped nobody would do much to help the owners recover the property that had absconded with itself a few white couplespeople whod decided to get married today before so many newly free slaves rushed to make their unions officialstood in line with the copperskins and negroes some seemed nervous about becoming the minority element in that long ribbon of colored people others made the best of it that the negroes and copperskins were all in high spirits lent everything a quality of easiness a white man pulled a flask out of a jacket pocket and took a nip he passed it to his sweetheart a redhead with skin so pale it was almost phosphorescent she also drank then handed it to the copperskinned woman standing behind her the copperskin smiled and sipped and gave the flask to her man it went down the line till it ran dry which didnt take long but that wasnt the only flask or bottle going around frederick and helen had a swig of distilled lightning somebody in lines gonna get too pickled to be able to say his i dos frederick predicted smacking his lips well if he is his womanll set him straight helen spoke as if that were a law of nature to her it probably was when the line didnt move as fast as frederick thought it should have he said how come they didnt hire more judges who could hitch people dont be silly theyre white folks helen answered theyre too dumb to see wed all want to do this yeah frederick said with a sigh a lot of whites honestly believed negroes and copperskins were no more than animals that happened to be especially useful because they walked erect and had hands and the whites had done their best to ensure that slaves stayed animallike by making it hardsometimes impossiblefor them to learn to read and write and cipher then seeing how ignorant their colored workers were they had no trouble deciding slaves truly were stupid when he and helen finally got into the justice of the peaces parlor they had forms to fill out before they could go through the ceremony a secretary did stand by to help illiterate couples that wasnt because of the influx of newly freed slaves quite a few whites who intended to marry also lacked their letters though far fewer proportionally than was true among copperskins and negroes frederick and helen also had to pay the oneeagle fee required to make things official frederick proudly dropped a fat silver coin onto the tabletop its sweet ring told the worldand the secretaryit was genuine the functionary filled in the blank lines on a form in a receipt book tore it out and handed it to frederick here you are mr radcliff he said for all the world as if he were dealing with a white man and an important white man at that thank you kindly frederick answered as if he were an important white man hearing and understanding that tone helen set a hand on his arm they beamed at each other the newly married couple in line in front of themhe a mulatto she a copperskin with strong cheekbones and long lustrous blueblack haircame out of the justice of the peaces chamber hand in hand both of them were beaming too congratulations frederick said thanks friend same to you the man replied from within the justice of the peace called whos next got to keep things moving today here we come your honor frederick said he and helen walked in together books filled the shelves behind the justices desk the halfempty glass of amber liquid on the desk said hed already needed fortifying but his motions were steady and his voice had no slur as he said raise your right hands and set your left hands on the bibles there yes sir frederick said he didnt mind giving respect to a white man whose position deserved it helen nodded to the justice of the peace as she obeyed i perform this marriage ceremony by virtue of the authority vested in me by the sovereign state of new hastings the justice of the peace intoned as he already had so many times before on this special day he looked at frederick repeat after me istate your name frederick radcliff the white mans eyebrows rose but he didnt miss a beat he led frederick through his part of the brief proceeding then took helen through hers when theyd both said everything required of them the justice of the peace went on by virtue of the said authority vested in me by the sovereign state of new hastings i now pronounce you man and wife to frederick he added you may kiss your bride it wasnt as if frederick hadnt been kissing helen and going to bed with her for all of their adult lives but kissing his bride that was a different story white mens lawsslaveholders lawshadnt let them be man and wife till the slug hollow agreement passed the atlantean senate he made the most of the kiss with a cough the justice of the peace said dont like to hurry you along folks but ive got to do it big
