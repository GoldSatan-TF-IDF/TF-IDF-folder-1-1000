the tumor in my fathers pancreas was removed last week in an operation that lasted five hours and was more difficult than his surgeons had expected afterward they delivered the grim news that most people in his condition could not expect to live for more than ninety days since i knew nothing of the surgery or the tumor i was not there when he was given his death sentence communication is not a priority with my father ten years ago he divorced one wife and had found another before word filtered down to me his current wifeshes either number five or number sixeventually called and after reintroducing herself passed along the barest of details about the tumor and its related issues agnes explained that my father was not feeling well and didnt want to talk i replied that he had never wanted to talk regardless of how he felt she asked me to spread the news to the rest of the family i almost asked why but didnt want to bicker with this poor woman the rest of the family consists of my younger sister jill and my mother jill lives in seattle and as far as i know has not spoken to our father in at least ten years she has two small children who have never met him and never will my mother after surviving twelve years of marriage got lucky and got out taking jill and me with her and i have a hunch that the news of his impending death will have zero impact on her needless to say we do not get together at christmas and exchange gifts by the fire after the phone call from agnes i sit at my desk and ponder life without warren my father i started calling him warren when i was in college because he was more of a person a stranger than a father he did not object he has never cared what i call him and i have always assumed he prefers that i dont call him at all at least i make the occasional effort he never has after a few minutes i admit the truthlife without warren will be the same as life with him i call jill and break the news her first question is whether i plan to attend the funeral which is somewhat premature she wants to know if she should try to visit him to say hello and goodbye and go through the phony motions of acting as though she cares when in fact she does not nor do i and we both admit this we have no love for warren because he never cared for us he abandoned the family when we were kids and has spent the past thirty years acting as though we do not exist jill and i are both parents now and we find it inconceivable that a father can have no use for his own children im not going she finally declares now or later how about you i dont know i reply ill have to think about it the truth is that i know i will go see him he has burned most of the bridges in his life but there is one rather substantial piece of unfinished business that he has to deal with before he dies my mother lives in tulsa with her second husband in high school warren was the superjock and she was the homecoming queen the most popular girl their wedding thrilled their small town but after a couple of years with warren all thrills were gone i know they have not spoken to each other in decades and why should they mom i have some bad news i say into the phone trying to seem sufficiently somber what is it she asks quickly probably afraid it is one of her grandchildren warrens sick pancreatic cancer he has less than three months to live a pause relief then i was assuming he was already dead and there you have it his memorial service will not be packed with grieving family members im sorry she says but she is not i guess youll have to deal with it i suppose i dont want to be bothered with it paul just call me when its over or dont i dont care what happens to warren i understand mom i know he hit her a few times probably a lot more than i realized and he drank and chased women and lived the hard life of a professional baseball player he was arrogant and cocky and from the age of fifteen he was accustomed to getting whatever he wanted because he warren tracey could throw a baseball through a brick wall we manage to move the conversation to the kids and when she might see them again because of her beauty and brains she landed on her feet after warren she married a slightly older man an executive for a drilling company and he provided a fine home for jill and me he loves my mom and thats all that matters i doubt if warren ever did in the summer of the country was slowly emerging from the trauma of vietnam spiro agnew was in trouble and would eventually go down watergate was getting hot with much more to come i was eleven years old and slightly aware of what was happening out there in the real world but i was wonderfully unburdened by it baseball was my world and little else mattered my father pitched for the new york mets and i lived and died with each game i pitched too for the scrappers in the white plains little league and because my father was who he was great things were expected of me i rarely met those expectations but there were moments of promise by early july the pennant race in the national league east had settled into a bland contest all six teamsmets pirates cardinals phillies cubs and exposwere hovering around and showing little enthusiasm for making a run in the west the reds and the dodgers were pulling away in the american league the oakland as with their swagger and colorful uniforms and long hair were looking to repeat their championship of my buddies and i followed the game religiously we knew each player and every statistic we checked every box score then replayed the games on the sandlots of white plains life at home was not always pleasant and my escape was on the field baseball was my best friend and in midjuly the game was about to be electrified like never before it began quietly enough with a pulled hamstring the first baseman for the cubs aaa affiliate in wichita went down as he rounded third and headed for home the next day jim hickman the first baseman for the cubs injured his back the team suddenly needed someone to play first so they reached down to their aa club in midland texas and called up a twentyoneyearold named joe castle at the time castle was hitting with twenty home runs fifty rbis forty stolen bases and only one error at first base he was the hottest player in aa and was creating a buzz as the story goes castle was asleep in the cheap apartment he shared with four other minor leaguers when the call came from chicago an assistant coach drove him to the airport in midland and he caught a flight to houston where he waited two hours for a flight to philadelphia while he waited he called his family in arkansas with the thrilling news when he arrived in philadelphia a cab delivered him to veterans stadium where he was quickly fitted for a uniform given number and hustled onto the field the cubs were already taking batting practice understandably he was nervous thrilled almost bewildered and when the manager whitey lockman said get loose youre starting at first and hitting seventh castle had trouble gripping his brandnew bat in his first round of majorleague batting practice he swung at the first two pitches and missed he would not miss again for a long time in the dugout before the game he huddled with don kessinger the cubs veteran shortstop and another arkansas boy kessinger had been an allamerican in baseball and basketball at ole miss and was outgoing and laid back he managed to keep the kid loose his only advice was go up there swinging the cubs center fielder was rick monday another veteran who had been born in batesville arkansas just down the white river from joes hometown between kessinger and monday joe managed to survive the worst case of pregame jitters a player could imagine it was thursday july a day baseball would remember for a long time the phillies pitcher was a lefty benny humphries a wild fastballer who walked as many as he struck out as joe strolled to the plate in the second inning he gritted his teeth and again told himself to swing at the first pitch wherever it happened to be humphries thought the rookie should get introduced to majorleague heat and unloaded everything he had joe from the right side guessed fastball made perfect contact and hit a shot that landed twenty rows back in left center field he sprinted around the bases much too excited for any kind of victory trot and was in the dugout being congratulated before he caught his breath he was not the first major leaguer to homer on the first pitch he saw in fact he was the eleventh fortysix homered in their first at bat eleven on the first pitch nonetheless his name was in the record book it was now open and joe castle wasnt finished with it in the fifth inning humphries started off with a fastball high and tight a brushback meant as a warning but joe didnt get the message he worked the count to and then yanked a fastball down the left field line where it barely scraped the inside of the foul pole the third base umpire was quick to twirl his right index finger signaling a home run joe who was rounding first and following the ball kicked into a sprint and slowed slightly as he neared home plate now a record belonged only to him and one other in bob nieman of the st louis browns homered in his first two majorleague at bats the mets were playing the braves in atlanta that night and the game was not on television i was in tom sabbatinis basement listening to lindsey nelson the mets wonderful playbyplay announcer who informed us of what had just happened in philadelphia it didnt take much to get lindsey excited he tied a record folks he said think of the thousands of young men whove played this game and only two have homered in their first two at bats i wonder if he can do it three times added ralph kiner the hall of fame slugger and lindseys sidekick the cubs chased humphries in the sixth and the phillies brought in a middle reliever a righthander named tip gallagher when joe left the ondeck circle in the top of the seventh the score was tied and the phillies fans always vocal were silent there was no applause just curiosity to their surprise joe dug in from the left side since there was no scouting report the phillies did not know he was a switchhitter no one had bothered to notice him during batting practice he looked at a curveball low then fouled off the next two fastballs with two strikes he shortened his stance and choked up three inches on the bat the previous season he led the texas league with the lowest strikeout percentage of any hitter joe castle was at his most dangerous with two strikes a slider missed low then gallagher came with a fastball away joe went with the pitch and slapped it hard to left center a line drive that kept rising until it cleared the wall by five feet as he circled the bases for the third consecutive time he did so with a record that seemed untouchable no rookie had ever homered in his first three at bats joe castle was from calico rock arkansas a tiny picturesque village on a bluff above the white river on the eastern edge of the ozark mountains it was cardinals country and had been since the days of dizzy dean an arkansas farm boy and leader of the infamous gashouse gang in the s his brother paul nicknamed daffy was also a pitcher on the same team in at the height of the gangs fame dizzy predicted in spring training that he and daffy would combine for fifty wins they won fortyninethirty for dizzy and nineteen for daffy twenty years later stan musial the greatest cardinal of all was revered to the point of being worshipped with a radio on every front porch the town like countless others in the midwest and the deep south followed the beloved cardinals with a passion during the long hot summer nights kmox out of st louis carried the games and the familiar voices of harry caray and jack buck could be heard on every street and in every car on july though the dials in calico rock had been switched to wgn out of chicago and joes friends and family were hanging on every pitch the cardinalscubs rivalry was the greatest in the national league and though many in calico rock found it difficult to believe they were rooting for the hated cubs they were suddenly doing so and with a fervor in a matter of hours they had been converted to cubs fans after the first home run a crowd quickly gathered outside evans drug store on main street the second home run sent them into a giddy celebration and the crowd continued to grow when joes parents two brothers their wives and their small children showed up to join the party they were greeted with bear hugs and cheers the third home run sent the entire town into orbit they were also celebrating in the streets and pubs of chicago as stunning as his first three at bats had been joes fourth would endear him to baseball purists forever top of the ninth score tied two outs don kessinger standing on third a tough righthander named ed ramon on the mound as joe stepped to the plate a few of the eighteen thousand fans clapped politely then an odd silence settled across veterans stadium ramons first pitch was a fastball on the outside part of the plate joe waited then whipped his bat like a broomstick crushing the ball and lining it a few inches outside the bag at first base a foul ball but an impressive one nonetheless ernie banks the cubs first base coach did not have time to react and if the ball had hit him he would have been seriously maimed willie montanez the phillies first baseman moved to his left but only after the ball had caromed off the stands and was rolling into right field instinctively montanez took two steps back joe noticed this and changed his plans the second pitch was a changeup high with the count and ramon tried another fastball as soon as he released it joe hesitated a split second then broke for first base with his bat trailing it tapped the ball slightly and sent it dribbling toward the second baseman denny doyle who was as startled as ramon montanez and everyone else in the stadium by the time doyle got to the ball or the ball got to doyle joe was ten feet past first base and slowing down along the right field foul line kessinger walked home with the eventual winning run the crowd sat in stunned silence players from both teams looked on in disbelief with a chance to hit four home runs in a gamea feat baseball had seen only nine times in a hundred yearsthe kid chose instead to lay down a perfect drag bunt to score the goahead run most of those listening to the game along main street in calico rock had seen the identical drag bunt though joe castle had seldom needed it they had seen far more tapemeasure shots and insidethepark home runs his oldest brother charlie who was sitting on a bench outside the drugstore had taught him the drag bunt when he was ten years old hed also taught him to switchhit steal bases and foul off pitches that were close but not what he wanted the middle brother red had hit him a million ground balls and perfected his footwork at first base both brothers had taught him how to fight whyd he bunt someone in the crowd asked charlie to score the run and take the lead charlie replied plain and simple the cubs announcers vince lloyd and lou boudreau had been plowing through the record book during the game and were certain that they had their facts straight three home runs in the first game of a career was a first four consecutive hits in a first game tied a modernday record though some rookie had five hits back in chicago won and by the time the game ended virtually every cubs fan was tuned in history had been made and they didnt want to miss it lou boudreau promised his listeners that he would soon have joe wired up for a postgame interview the crowd in calico rock continued to grow and the mood was rowdy the pride palpable a half hour after the game was over lou boudreaus voice came across the radio with im in the visitors locker room with joe castle who as you might guess is surrounded by reporters here he is sudden silence on main street in calico rock no one moved or spoke joe not a bad first game what are you thinking right now well i would like to say hello to my family and friends back home in calico rock i wish you could be here i still cant believe it joe what were you thinking when you stepped to the plate in the second inning i was thinking fastball and i was swinging at the first pitch got lucky i guess no player has ever homered in his first three at bats youre in the record book i guess im just happy to be here this time last night i was playing in midland texas still hard to believe indeed it is i gotta ask youand i know youve already been hit with thisbut what were you thinking in the ninth inning you had a chance to hit four home runs in a game yet you bunted i was thinking about one thinggetting don home from third for the goahead run i love playing baseball but its no fun if youre not winning well you got a nice little streak going here think you can keep it up tomorrow night i havent thought about tomorrow night don and some of the guys are taking me out for a steak and im sure well discuss it then good luck yes sir thank you few in calico rock went to bed before midnight as promised my mother awakened me at am so i could watch the early morning new york news programs i was hoping for a glimpse of joe castle channel did a quick rundown on the national league games the mets had won in atlanta to put them two games over then there was joe castle sprinting around the bases in philadelphia once twice three times the drag bunt though got as much airtime as the three home runs the guy could fly my mother brought in the new york times from the driveway on the front page of the sports section was a blackandwhite photo of joe castle and a long story about his historic debut i found the scissors cut it out and started a new scrapbook one of many i meticulously maintained when the mets were in town and my father was home i was forced to save the newspapers for a few days before clipping the baseball stories i loved it when the mets were on the road my father was gone and our house was peaceful and pleasant when he was around though the mood was far different he was a selfabsorbed brooding man with seldom a kind word for any of us he had never met his potential and this was always the fault of someone elsethe manager his teammates the owners even the umpires on the nights after he pitched he often came home late and drunk and thats when the trouble started i suspected even at the age of eleven that my parents would not stay together he rarely called home when the mets were away i often thought how wonderful it would be for my father to check in after a game and talk baseball with me i watched or listened to every mets game and had a dozen questions but i guess he was too busy going out with the boys for me baseball was a joy to play when my father wasnt watching because of his schedule he rarely had the chance to see my games and that was an indescribable relief when he was there though i had no desire to play he would lecture me on the way to the park snarl at me during the game and worst of all berate me all the way home he even slapped me once as soon as we were driving away from the field from the age of seven i cried after every game my father saw me play sara and i met during our sophomore years at the university of oklahoma we married a month after we graduated warren was invited to both the commencement exercises and the wedding but failed to show this surprised no one we have three beautiful daughters and live in santa fe where i write software for an aerospace firm sara was an interior designer until the girls came along and she decided to become a fulltime mother not surprisingly i was thrilled with each birth each healthy baby and not the least disappointed in the gender god selected for us i did not want a boy because i did not want to see him pick up a baseball and start tossing it around most of my friends have a boy or two and they have all coached the game at some level i am sure i would have felt the temptation to do likewise with a boy so i am relieved to have all girls i quit the game when i was eleven years old and havent watched an inning in thirty years my employer is one of those progressive companies with all manner of benefits and flexible work rules i could practically work from home but i enjoy the office my colleagues even my bosses its exciting to watch the technology spring to life evolve and eventually hit the market i explain to my boss that i need a few days off for a quick trip unrelated to my job he says fine i tell sara my plans and she understands completely she knows the history and i guess we both have known this trip would one day become inevitable i drive to the airport in santa fe and buy a oneway ticket to memphis when warren was thirtyfive years old he managed to persuade an old friend in the orioles organization to give him one final tryout in spring training he could still throw hard but he had no control plus his name was toxic and no other team would touch him he bombed in his first appearance and was cut the next day he called home and informed my mother he planned to stay in florida where supposedly some minorleague team wanted him as a pitching coach this was not true and i knew it i was twelve by then and well aware that my father was a habitual liar a few months later she filed for divorce and when the school year ended we moved to hagerstown maryland to live with her parents warren tracey retired from the game with a record of sixtyfour wins and eightyfour losses a career earned run average of in sixteen seasons he played for the pirates giants indians royals astros and mets and spent more time in the minors than in the majors his threeyear stint with the mets was his longest stay anywhere and they sent him down to aaa at least four times he struck out batters and walked his name is in the record book only because he led the league in hit batsmen in he was never happy anywhere and when he wasnt being traded he was demanding to be traded not a particularly stellar career but baseball fans know that only one player out of ten who signs a minorleague contract makes it to the bigs for a single game when i was very young and still impressionable i was proud of the fact that my father was a major leaguer no other kid on my street could make that claim as i grew older though i often wished i had a normal dad one who enjoyed having a catch in the backyard and coaching his son when he was with the mets he left for spring training each year in early january long before he was supposed to report he used various excuses for this but the reality was that he wanted to get away from home to play golf every day to work on his tan and to drink and catch up with old girlfriends jill and i didnt care which excuse he used we were relieved to have him back on the road after the year in hagerstown my mother informed us that he had remarried down in florida jill and i thought this was terrible news because he and his new wife might decide to start a family on the leg from dallas to memphis i open my old scrapbook on joe castle it is filled with newspaper clippings magazine articles the august edition of sports illustrated with joe on the cover and the item i had treasured most during that remarkable summer of an eightbyten blackandwhite photo of his youthful smiling face across the bottom he had printed neatly to paul tracey with best wishes then scribbled his autograph i had a whole collection of these when i was a boy my buddies and i wrote letters to hundreds of professional players asking for autographed photos occasionally one responded and to get a photo in the mail was a reason to strut my father got a few of these letters but was too important to grant a favor he constantly griped about the fans who wanted autographs i hid my scrapbooks from my father in his twisted opinion he was the only player worthy of my adulation after i quit the game my mother secretly stored my memorabilia in the attic she gave it backtwo cardboard boxes fullafter i got married at first i wanted to burn it but sara intervened and it survives until this day i have never been in memphis in august and when i step out of the airport terminal i have trouble breathing the air is hot and sticky and my shirt is wet within minutes i ride a shuttle to avis get my rental car crank up the ac and head west across the mississippi river into the flat farmlands of the arkansas delta calico rock is four hours away on friday july the front page of the sports section of the chicago tribune ran the bold headline four for four there was a large blackandwhite photo of joe castle and three different stories about his historic first game the entire city was buzzing about the kid for a tribe hardened by years of frustration cubs fans had a rare moment to gloat joe slept late in his hotel room called his parents collect and talked for an hour with them and his brothers then had a long late breakfast with don kessinger and rick monday he killed some more time by calling his teammates in midland reporters were looking for him but he was already tired of their attention at pm he stepped onto the team bus for the quick ride back to veterans stadium in the locker room whitey lockman walked over and said youre batting third tonight kid dont screw it up two hours before game time joe walked onto the field stretched and warmed up then took one hundred ground balls at first base it seemed as though time had stopped he couldnt wait for game time when he stepped to the plate with two outs in the top of the first there were fortyfive thousand phillies fans in the stadium there were also millions of cubs fans glued to tvs and radios with the count at two balls he ripped a double into the right field corner five for five in the top of the third with the bases loaded he singled to right and drove in two six for six in the fifth with the bases empty two outs and the infield back and from the right side he pushed a bunt toward third when mike schmidt picked it up barehanded joe was flying past first base and there was no throw seven for seven in the seventh inning he bounced a fastball off the top of the scoreboard in left center field and as he rounded the bases at a somewhat slower pace the phillies fans offered subdued but prolonged applause eight for eight with two outs in the top of the ninth and the cubs leading in a blowout joe dug in from the left side he had two singles a double and a home run and many in the crowd and legions of those watching and listening were praying for a triple vince lloyd and lou boudreau were openly begging for one on the radio hitting for the cyclesingle double triple home runwas a rare event in baseball it happened on average three times each season and since joe seemed intent on crushing all records why not hit for the cycle instead he fouled off ten straight pitches worked the count full then hit one of the longest home runs in the history of veterans stadium as he rounded third mike schmidt said not a bad game kid nine for nine with five home runs unbridled mania swept the streets of the north side of chicago after the scrappers game our last of the regular season the team met for a party in tom sabbatinis backyard mr sabbatini had the grill goinghot dogs and cheeseburgersand most of the parents were there including my mother my father was pitching that night in atlanta but we were not interested in that game instead mr sabbatini rigged up an impressive radio and we listened to wcau out of philadelphia it was not unusual in those days to scan the dial with a small transistor radio and pick up games from new york philadelphia boston even montreal and baltimore i often spent hours in my room at night keeping track of several games each time joe castle stepped to the plate the party came to a halt as we crowded closer to the radio harry kalas was the phillies announcer and his voice grew more excited as the game went on even though his team was getting drubbed with each of joes hits and especially with the two home runs we yelled and jumped around as if we were lifelong cubs fans at one point harry said i suspect there are a lot of cubs fans out there tonight especially in the little town of calico rock arkansas when joe came up in the ninth we were so nervous we were bouncing on our tiptoes after each foul ball we took a deep breath then leaned in closer to the radio harry said two strikes on castle we heard the crack of the bat and harry in his patented homerun call described what was happening the pitch theres a drive this ball is outta here in the upper deck mike schmidt territory greg luzinski territory five for five nine for nine unbelievable baseball fans simply unbelievable history was happening and though we were only eleven years old and far away from the game we felt as if we were a part of it we had already checked the schedule and knew that it would be late august before the cubs arrived at shea stadium my buddies were already dropping hints about needing tickets after three games in philadelphia and ten for the road trip the cubs were going home as harry kalas signed off he said i cannot imagine the reception joe castle will get tomorrow afternoon at wrigley field i wouldnt mind being there myself the cubs left philadelphia at midnight and arrived two hours later at ohare as the team boarded a bus to leave the airport joe castle got his first taste of fame several dozen cubs fans were waiting behind a chainlink fence for a glimpse of their new star he walked over shook a few hands thanked them for coming out at such an hour then hustled back to the bus where his teammates were waiting eager to leave but also enjoying the moment the front office arranged a hotel room under an alias and joe finally fell asleep at am not long afterward his parents and two brothers left calico rock for the long drive to chicago the cubs played the giants at pm saturday and only a sudden death would keep them away from wrigley cable television was still a few years in the future and the only games televised nationally were the world series the allstar game and the nbc game of the week on saturday afternoon with curt gowdy and tony kubek the july game was scheduled to be televised from tiger stadium in detroit where the as were in town at dawn nbc along with the rest of the baseball world awakened to the irresistible story of joe castle and his stunning debut in philadelphia suddenly the biggest game of the day was the cubs versus the giants indeed no other game was even close every baseball fan in america would be itching for news out of wrigley it was raining in detroit not a heavy rain but moisture nonetheless and at dawn nbc made the controversial and longremembered decision to move the game of the week to chicago the tigers and the as squawked for a few weeks afterward but no one listened joe castle owned majorleague baseball in july and nbc never regretted its decision the gamble paid off it was to be another historic game curt gowdy and tony kubek were roused from their sleep in detroit and put on a plane to chicago where nbc was scrambling to piece together a production crew and get enough cameras wired up at wrigley the network was also praying for clear skies by midmorning the weather was better in detroit than in chicago indeed when the tigers game started at pm there was not a cloud to be seen anywhere gowdy and kubek would later admit that they were thrilled at the change of venue because of the excitement at wrigley field in kubek the yankees longtime shortstop played against one walt dropo better known as moose because he was six feet five and weighed pounds in dropo was the american league rookie of the year but injuries soon derailed a promising career over the next eleven seasons moose dropo played for several american league teams and hit with home runs respectable numbers but not the kind to be remembered however in july while playing for detroit against the yankees he hit safely in twelve consecutive at bats without a walk it was an astonishing feat a record regarded by many experts as unbreakable suddenly moose dropos forgotten career was attracting attention the saturday edition of the chicago suntimes ran an old photo of dropo alongside a new one of joe castle and beneath them was the question in bold print twelve in a row the tribune sports page blared nine for nine wrigley field was built in and various expansions over the decades brought its capacity to the previous season the cubs averaged fans for each home game until the arrival of joe castle the cubs were averaging by am saturday crowds were gathering around the ticket booths at wrigley long lines were forming along addison street parties were under way on the rooftops beyond left field wrigleyville was alive and as the morning dragged on it began to rock everyone was desperately looking for a ticket a cubs equipment manager fetched joe from his hotel and sneaked him into an unnoticed maintenance door under the right field bleachers when joe took his first step onto the turf at wrigley it was just after am he had slept less than three hours because sleep was all but impossible the gates had been opened and the stands were filling quickly no one recognized him in his street clothes near the home dugout he introduced himself to several of the groundskeepers and politely said no to a reporter in the cubs dressing room he admired his new locker as he changed into his uniform a light lunch was served and joe was eating a sandwich with don kessinger when a trainer said hey joe your parents are here in a narrow hallway outside the locker room joe hugged his mother and embraced his father and brothers red and charlie all five were in various stages of disbelief with joe perhaps being the most composed its just baseball he said theyll get me out eventually not surprisingly red had some advice keep swinging if its close dont take a chance charlie added youre gonna see breakin stuff no more fastballs stay back right right joe said laughing then took his family inside the locker room for a quick tour they were overwhelmed sleepwalking through an adventure they had dreamed about for years the giants came into wrigley five games behind the dodgers in the west willie mays was gone in fact he was idling away his waning days with the mets but the giants still had willie mccovey and bobby bonds and their record was slightly better than the cubs on july their starter was ray hiller a lefthander with six wins and seven losses there were at least fortyone thousand rowdy cubs fans packed into wrigley at pm countless others watched from the rooftops beyond the left field wall when joe castles name was called in the bottom of the first a deafening ovation shook the old place and buried the voices of curt gowdy and tony kubek hiller was a junk dealer whose fastball rarely topped eighty he lobbed up a couple of harmless curveballs and joe resisted the urge to flail away his third pitch was some knucklecurve combo that fluttered high and outside and with the count and joe got the signal to hit away hiller came in with a slider that didnt move much and joe swung with a vengeance the ball lifted high and lazy at first then it seemed to gain speed soon there was no doubt it was gone the question was where would it land gary matthews the left fielder took two steps back then stopped turned around put his hands on his hips and watched to see where it was going the ball eventually bounced off the fifthfloor facade of a building some feet from home plate perhaps he was fatigued from all the homerun trots or maybe he was learning to savor the moment but whatever the reason joe rounded the bases at a slower pace but not slow enough to aggravate the pitcher never show up the pitcher red and charlie had drilled into him since the age of ten wrigley field had never been louder the standing ovation roared until joe took a step out of the dugout tipped his cap and acknowledged the adoring crowd then he blew a kiss at his mother who was in the owners seats in the second row ten for ten with six home runs joe led off in the bottom of the third with the score tied on the first pitch he faked a bunt and the entire giant infield reacted in spasms ed goodson at third and chris speier at short were on their heels before the pitch expecting a line shot from an astonishingly quick bat they eventually shot forward tito fuentes did the same while mccovey stutterstepped around first base after hiller recovered from the pitch he bolted upright as if terrified of a bunt evidently the giants scouts had been alerted to joes bunting skills ball one hiller kept his fastball off the center of the plate opting instead to pick at the corners and hope for the best his second pitch was a fastball five inches outside joe waited and waited then went with the pitch and slapped it to right field for a single eleven for eleven it may have been the thrill of watching history in the making or it could have been the clearing skies and sunshine and cold beer or perhaps even the excitement that a full house always provided or probably all of the above but the atmosphere at wrigley was electric by now joe was receiving a standing ovation when he stepped into the ondeck circle another when he stepped to the plate and of course an even rowdier one with each hit he tipped his cap and helmet to the crowd then took a lead off first his twelfth at bat came in the bottom of the sixth with the cubs up when the fortyone thousand faithful stood to applaud they remained standing on television curt gowdy admitted to having a knot in his stomach on the radio vince lloyd described it as the most dramatic moment he could remember lou boudreau went silent hiller had abandoned his fastball altogether and was surviving on long looping curves changeups and a nasty combo of a slider and curve known as a slurve joe fouled off the first two pitches both balls and cursed himself for swinging at bad pitches he shortened his stance choked up and took a ball high the fourth pitch was a slow dropping curve a pitch that might cross the plate at the knees or six inches lower and joe took no chances he chopped down on the pitch and it slammed hard into home platea fair ball it ricocheted high into the air toward third where goodson charged and waited and waited when he finally caught the ball joe was past first base for his twelfth consecutive hit move over moose dropo again he tipped his hat to the screaming crowd willie mccovey a fierce competitor tapped him on the rear with his glove and said congratulations kid joe could only smile and nod he was dreaming and in another world not too many years earlier his baseball card collection included a double allstar selection featuring both willie mccovey and willie mays in the top of the eighth mccovey hit a tworun bomb that sailed over the right field bleachers and was probably never found the giants led when the cubs came to bat in the bottom of the inning the score was one thing but the majority of the fans were not there just to watch a ball game it was a rare moment to celebrate their beloved cubs had not won a world series since there had been some memorable momentsthe team lost the series in seven games to detroitthough this had been during the war years when the good players were serving in the armed forces there had been a few hall of famershack wilson in the s and ernie banks in the s and s generally speaking though cubs fans were accustomed to disappointment they were fiercely loyal but also desperate for a team or a player that was better than the rest joes thirteenth at bat had enough pressure because of the first twelve hits but add a runner at each base two outs and two runs down and the tension on the field was suffocating the crowd was standing yelling some were even praying hiller was gone replaced by a righthander named bobby lund a veteran reliever who threw exceptionally hard joe would later admit that he preferred to hit from the left side because he could pick up the fastballs a bit quicker he was always content to foul off pitches and work the count full but in this his thirteenth and possibly most important at bat in whatever career he might eventually have he decided to be impatient he took the first pitch a high fastball and after one look at lunds delivery he was ready the second pitch was another fastball maybe an inch outside but close enough to rip joe hit a scorcher to right center a bullet that tito fuentes at second actually leaped for and missed badly the ball stayed ten feet off the ground until it crashed into the ivy where bobby bonds played it on one hop and fired home with two outs the runners were off with contact and joes double cleared the bases when he slid unchallenged into second base he owned the record the one that had been labeled unbreakable standing on second he put his hands on his knees and stared at the dirt and for a few seconds tried to believe and savor the moment the stadium was manic the noise was earsplitting the giants catcher dave rader had the ball and when the dust settled called time slowly he walked past the mound to second base where he ceremoniously handed it to joe castle the crowd roared even louder with this memorable act of sportsmanship joe removed his helmet and acknowledged the adulation the umpires were in no hurry to resume play they were witnessing history and the game is played without a clock finally joe walked to the seats beside the cubs dugout and tossed the ball to his father then he went back to second base and put on his helmet he looked deep into center field and quickly wiped a tear from his cheek a camera caught it and curt gowdy and tony kubek made sure the world saw that joe castle standing alone on second base and alone in the record book now a legend was human enough to show emotion after an hour on the flat twolane highways of northeastern arkansas i realize i am quite hungry outside the town of parkin i pull in to the gravel lot of a barbecue shack and hope for the best to avoid potential conversation i take a portion of my scrapbook to read during lunch over a pulled pork sandwich and a root beer i flip through pages of press clippings i have not seen in decades as soon as joe arrived in the majors i began visiting the library in white plains to collect stories from the chicago newspapers using a massive xerox machine near the periodicals section i made copies at five cents each the july sunday editions of both the suntimes and the tribune were packed with stories and photos of saturdays historic game joe was interviewed at length about the game and it was obvious he was thoroughly enjoying the moment among many memorable quotes he said such things as well if they keep me in the lineup ill probably hit for the season and oh sure we have seventyfour games left one home run per game is not out of the question and theyll get me out eventually and the pennant thats already in the bag man were thinking about the world series i want to play the as in spite of these comments it was clear he liked bantering with the press and much of what he said was tongueincheek the chicago baseball reporters a notoriously tough bunch were in awe and described him as cocky but not the least bit arrogant and at times obviously overwhelmed by what he had done his teammates were stunned but also realistic one said hell cool off but lets hope it takes a few weeks right now weve won four in a row and thats all that matters whitey lockman when asked if joe would remain in the lineup retorted what are you crazy the postgame photos revealed a freshfaced kid who looked all of twentyone and was on top of the world he was handsome with deepset blue eyes and curly sandy hair the kinds of looks that would soon attract women everywhere he went he was single and had no significant female in his life according to one story everyone was falling in love with joe castle i had watched the game of the week with my mother in our den and afterward met tom sabbatini and jamie brooks at a sandlot where we tossed the ball around and talked nonstop about joe we took turns reenacting each of his at bats on that glorious summer afternoon there was no doubt that each of us would one day do something as dramatic as joe castle we would play professional baseball no question about that the only unknown was for which team not surprisingly the three of us decided that we would play for the cubs together and for a long time i was having dinner with my mother and jill when the phone rang it was my coach and he began by explaining that the allstar voting had taken place that morning i had been selected for the twelveplayer roster the only elevenyearold to make the team i was dreaming of this of course but i figured it was a long shot i was stunned and elated and after squealing this news to mom and jill i wanted desperately to tell my father but he was in atlanta with the mets at the ballpark for a pm game and i knew he would not call afterward mom suggested i wait until late sunday morning and call his hotel the sandwich is gone i gather my scrapbook pay the check and continue my journey before long i leave the rice and bean fields and enter hill country then the ozark mountains which are not really mountains but more like slightly larger hills at batesville birthplace of rick monday i cross the white river and follow it north through mountain view and into the ozark national forest it is a beautiful drive along highway a narrow winding road that is probably worthy of a postcard in october but it is august and the grass is brown as far as i could tell joe castle still lives in calico rock after his brief career ended he returned home and dropped out of sight there had been stories about him but with time and with virtually no access the journalists and reporters had forgotten about him one of the last efforts had been a visit by a writer for sports illustrated in but the town had quickly closed ranks and almost no information was exchanged the reporter could not find joe and was asked to leave by his brother red as i enter calico rock i tell myself for the hundredth time that i am being foolish not only would i fail in my little mission but there is also an element of danger it is a lovely village on a bluff above the white river trout docks are bunched near the bridge fishing is important along the river i park in front of the shops on main street and for a moment i wonder what it must have been like thirty years earlier when joes friends and family gathered in crowds to listen to vince lloyd and lou boudreau call the games during that magical summer i can almost feel the heartbreak when joe went down i am looking for a man named clarence rook the owner of the calico rock record the small weekly newspaper that has been reporting the towns business for half a century mr rook has been with the paper for almost that long and if he chooses not to cooperate i really have no alternative plan the office is on main street three doors down from evans drug store i take a deep breath and walk inside a young secretary in blue jeans greets me with a big smile and friendly hello im looking for mr clarence rook i say in a wellrehearsed line hes pretty busy she says still smiling can i help you no but thanks i really need to see him okay can i have a name paul casey im a reporter with baseball monthly these lies will not last long but the truth simply will not work right now interesting she says and what brings you to calico rock im working on a story i reply well aware of how vague i sound okay she says retreating let me see what hes doing she disappears into the back i can hear voices the walls are lined with framed copies of old editions and it doesnt take long to find one from july the bold headline read joe castle in stunning debut with cubs i take a step closer and begin reading the story was written by clarence rook as were most of the frontpage articles and it was filled with unabashed pride i have a copy of it in my scrapbook mr rook will see you she reports nodding to a narrow hallway first door on the right thanks i say with a smile and head for the rear clarence rook is a colorful sightred cheeks white shirt red bow tie red suspenders probably seventy years old with a thick gray beard and a mop of mark twainstyle white hair he is chewing on the stem of a pipe one that rarely leaves his mouth and he is behind an old wooden desk covered with stacks of assorted files and papers to one side is a battered royal typewriter circa still being used mr casey he says in a highpitched energetic voice as he thrusts forward his right hand clarence rook i shake his hand and say nice to meet you sir thanks for seeing me like this no problem have a seat i sit in the only chair that is not filled with assorted debris where you from he asks with a smile that reveals a mouthful of tobaccostained teeth santa fe i say oh beautiful country out there ms rook and i drove out west a few years ago stopped in santa fe to see the okeeffe museum spectacular country wouldnt mind living there myself yes sir we enjoy it but you have a pretty nice town here indeed we do i was born just up the road in mountain home dont guess ill ever leave how long have you owned the paper i ask in an effort to kill some time with preliminary chitchat he seems perfectly willing to do the same bought it twenty years ago from mrs meeks who owned it forever she hired me when i was a kid never thought i would spend my life publishing a paper but ive loved every minute of it so you write too no sir im not a writer not a reporter the smile vanishes as his eyes narrow and he tries to digest this i continue and my name is not paul casey its paul tracey from a drawer he picks up a pouch of tobacco slowly fills the bowl of his pipe tamps it firm then strikes a match he never takes his eyes off me and after he blows a small cloud of smoke he asks have you ever been told you favor warren tracey ive heard that before yes any relation hes my father as expected this is not well received for thirty years i have often hesitated when giving my last name usually it does not get a reaction but there have been enough uncomfortable moments to render me gunshy he puffs hard for a while glaring at me and finally says you could get shot around here i didnt come here to get shot mr rook why are you here son my father is dying of pancreatic cancer hell be gone in a few months another puff another cloud im sorry he says but only to be polite i doubt if this news will cause too much anguish here in calico rock i say he nodded and said youre right about that most folks in these parts would enjoy watching warren tracey burn at the stake and slowly i realize that does anyone else know youre here no sir only you he takes a deep breath and stares at a table lamp trying to collect his thoughts a clock on his wall gives him the time as i wait somewhat nervously hell either order me out of his office or decide to chat a bit longer im betting on the latter because he is after all a reporter and naturally curious where is your father these days he asks florida he left the family when i was twelve and weve had little contact over the years were not close never have been did he send you here no sir he doesnt know may i ask then what exactly are you doing here i want to talk to joe castle and im hoping that you know the family pretty well indeed i do and i know them well enough to tell you that joe doesnt talk to strangers and he sure as hell wont talk to the son of warren tracey sunday july wrigley field was once again packed with fortyone thousand fanatics another crowd estimated at ten thousand mingled outside the stadium looking for tickets drinking beer listening to the radio and in general getting as close as possible to baseball history adding to the excitement was the fact that juan marichal was starting for the giants and his road games generally increased the gate though his better years were behind him marichal could still beat any team on any day with his highkicking windup superb control intimidating tactics and dogged competitiveness marichal was colorful and always dangerous in the previous thirteen years he had pitched many games at wrigley and he had won far more than he had lost he wasted no time in causing trouble when joe dug in in the bottom of the first marichals first pitch was aimed directly at his shoulder joe hit the ground and barely missed being maimed and wrigley almost exploded from the cubs dugout there were shouts threats lots of cursing at the mound where marichal rubbed the baseball smiled and considered the next pitch as a rookie in his fourth game joe knew it was not the moment to charge the mound he had to earn that right and it would happen soon enough keep your cool his brother red had advised him theyll start throwing at you before long the next pitch was a fastball and joe swinging from the left side ripped it down the right field foul line a screaming bullet that froze the defense and stunned the crowd the ball was clearly foul but it kept rising and rising until it landed high in the upper deck the pitch had been outside by six inches and was traveling at something close to ninetyfive miles an hour and joe had easily yanked it foul marichal was impressed willie mccovey took a step back at first and joe noticed this the third pitch was a fastball inside joe broke with the delivery his bat trailing marichal was at the end of his theatrical delivery and in no position to field a bunt mccovey got a bad jump tito fuentes raced to cover first but to no avail the ball rolled through the baseline chalk for forty feet then bounced slightly to the left when mccovey picked it up joe castle was sprinting past first base now fourteen for fourteen mccovey said nothing to the kid when the crowd settled down marichal stepped onto the rubber and looked at dave rader behind the plate he went into his stretch kicked high as always and joe was halfway to second by the time marichal released the ball raders throw to fuentes was perfect but much too late after a leisurely slide into second joe bounced to his feet looked at marichal shrugged smiled and spread his arms as if to say you throw at me ill make you pay two pitches later he stole third then scored on a passed ball in the bottom of the fourth he blooped a single to shallow center for his fifteenth consecutive hit marichal then caught him leaning and picked him off first as joe had predicted they eventually got him out in his sixteenth at bat in the bottom of the seventh inning joe crushed a ball to deep center and for a second it looked as if it were gone but the center fielder garry maddox drifted back and back until he was on the warning track then back some more until he was almost touching the ivy three hundred ninetynine feet from home plate maddox caught the ball and the streak was over joe was at second base jogging watching maddox and when the out was final he turned and headed to the dugout the crowd rose again in thunderous applause and joe took his time leaving the field after the game the cubs announced that his jersey would be changed number was set aside and for the remainder of his brief career joe castle wore number the following thursday the mets began a fourgame home series against the cardinals that was a runup to the allstar game of course i knew the pitching rotation my father was scheduled to get the ball thursday night and i wanted to be at shea stadium thursday afternoon before he left for the game we managed to talk a little baseball as usual he was preoccupied and going through his pregame jitters he was aloof on most days but when he was about to pitch he was so distant i wondered if he actually heard my voice he was thirtyfour years old and trying desperately to make something of his declining career looking back im sure he was frightened at the prospect of aging out of baseball the years were slipping by and the great warren tracey was proving to be not so great after all in the mets rotation he was the fourth man behind jon matlack jerry koosman and the incredible tom seaver as the teams headed into the allstar break his record was four wins and six losses and his earned run average was a bloated the new york sportswriters were demanding a new fourth man the mets were two games under and apparently going nowhere congratulations on making the allstar team he said we were on the patio in the shade drinking milk shakes he had a banana shake one he made himself precisely six hours before he took the mound one of his little quirks all baseball players especially pitchers have them he once told me so i started looking for a quirk thanks weve been practicing every day this week first games saturday against rye at two oclock sorry i cant make it the mets played at the same time saturday so both of us would be happy he wouldnt be at my game and i wouldnt be at his you gonna pitch saturday he asked i doubt it right now im number two behind don clements hes twelve he couldnt have cared less he sipped his milk shake and gazed across the lawn lost in his own world i really couldnt blame him on the days i pitched i thought of nothing else i could not imagine how nerveracking it must be to walk to the mound at shea stadium in front of fifty thousand fans and perform what about this joe castle guy i asked he snorted his disapproval not a bad start but these guys flame out once or twice around the league and we figure them out every rookies got a hole in his swing sooner or later we find it he seldom said nice things about other players even his own teammates at the age of eleven i thought this was odd but it would take a few years to understand that he was so insecure about his own game he could rarely admire that of another player wait until he starts seeing the hard slider he said his words trailing off as his mind drifted away i wasnt going to argue or cause trouble i was just thrilled to be talking baseball with my father not a bad start after seven games joe had twentyfour hits in thirtyone at bats with nine home runs and nine stolen bases say dad i would like to see you pitch tonight ill take the train in and stay out of the way tom can come with me he frowned and took another sip it would be safe to assume that the son of a player would have all sorts of perks including pregame passes on the field locker room clearances and of course access to tickets it did not work that way with warren tracey he did not want me hanging around and often complained about other players who let their kids crawl through the dugout before game time he considered this to be highly unprofessional to him the turf was sacred ground and only those in uniform should be allowed to step on it he flatly refused to speak with any reporter on the field before a game because in his opinion the press should be confined to the press box ill see what i can do he finally said as if this were some great favor my mom would not allow me to ride the train alone so i had invited tom sabbatini i guess your mothers not going to the game he said talk about a volatile subject my mother went to a few games each seasonas few as possible we sat with the other mets families and i knew some of the players kids though we were not friends because no one else lived in white plains my mother refused to socialize with the other wives and it was many years before she explained why my father chased womenon the road at home in spring training whenever wherever it didnt matter to warren my mother knew this though im not sure how she knew as with every professional baseball team there were players who fooled around and others who did not i dont know the percentages and i doubt if a reliable study has ever been undertaken who really wants to know as my mother explained to me years later all the wives knew the reputations of the philanderers and it was safe to assume that every mets wife knew warren tracey could not keep his pants on she felt humiliated sitting in the section for the players families with jill and me and trying to pretend we were just another happy family by july my parents had endured twelve years of a bad marriage both were making their own secret exit plans that night tom and i took the train to grand central then the subway to shea stadium our seats were perfectten rows from the field near the mets dugout my father pitched well going six strong innings and giving up only three hits but the mets blew a tworun lead in the ninth on the way home the subway was filled with rowdy mets fans some of them drunk occasionally on these trips or around the little league field or even at school i would hear someone complaining about warren tracey new york sports fans are rabid and wellinformed and they do not suffer from a lack of opinions i was at shea once when they booed tom seaver whenever i heard a derogatory comment about my father i would always flinch and resist the temptation to return the insult often though the complaints were legitimate i made it home checked in with mom then hurried to bed i did not want to be awake when he got home if in fact he made it back his worst drunks were on the nights after he pitched he wouldnt play again for three days so why not blow it out and raise some hell the following saturday the white plains east allstars lost to rye in the first round of the regional tournament and the mets lost to the cardinals i didnt play and neither did my father of course as a starting pitcher he would never play on his day off but i should have played an inning or two during the regular season when i was not pitching i roamed the outfield i hit in eighteen games sixth highest in the league and late in the game against rye we needed a hitter at the plate our coach though felt otherwise looking at the brackets near the concession stand i suddenly felt lousy i would be the starting pitcher in our next game monday afternoon against eastchester and my father would be in the vicinity he did not make the national league allstar team did not even come close though in his opinion he should have been considered the allstar break ran for three days with the game to be played in kansas city on tuesday night with a schedule that runs from the first of april to the end of september eightyone games at home and eightyone on the road big leaguers cherish the allstar break those not chosen to play often dash home or enjoy brief vacations the year before after being overlooked yet again my father and a teammate spent the break trout fishing in montana then met the team in san francisco when the schedule resumed listening carefully i had unfortunately heard no such talk of a fishing trip this year when my father watched me play he never sat in the stands with my mother or the other spectators he didnt want to be bothered once a kid asked for his autograph and he griped about it for a week he played for the mets therefore he was famous and did not wish to mingle with ordinary parents to get away he would find a spot on the fence not far from our dugout and from there alone he would growl and yell advice he despised all of my coaches because they of course knew so little about the game invariably they tried to engage him because of who he was and his rude behavior was embarrassing on several occasions i was compelled to apologize to a coach the tournament was played in scarsdale and as we drove to the ballpark no one said a word in the car jill and i were in the rear seat and she was pouting because she hated baseball my father was sore because a writer in the times that morning had said the mets could not win the pennant with warren tracey in the rotation i was a nervous wreck and my stomach was aching my mother flipped through a magazine as if all were well when i took the mound i could barely grip the ball my first pitch was a weak fastball that the batter lined hard but directly at our shortstop i took a breath and felt better my second pitch was a fastball that the batter popped foul to our first baseman two pitchestwo outs this might be easier than i thought the third batter was trouble and everyone knew him his name was luke gozlo a big kid with a big mouth and a big bat to back up his words he would later be drafted by the red sox and fade away in the minors my coach said repeatedly dont put the ball in the center of the plate a walk is better than a home run i was trying my best to walk him when my third pitch trailed inside luke lifted his front foot attacked the ball and as soon as he hit it i felt sick our left fielder never moved the jackass stood with his hands on his hips and watched the ball as if he were watching a jet fighter buzz the field it landed in the parking lot luke whooped and hollered as he rounded first and second his fist pumping in the air what a jerk he stomped on home plate and yanked off his helmet so everyone could see his grinning face i threw three fastballs as hard as i possibly could and struck out the cleanup hitter as i walked off the field never run my father had insisted the pitcher never runs off the field my father was waving me over my coach though suspected trouble and met me at the foul line he put his arm around my shoulder told me to shake it off and escorted me into the dugout where i was safe from my fathers advice luke gozlo came to the plate in the top of the fourth with the bases empty and no outs my father yelled paul to get my attention but i pretended not to hear him my first pitch was a fastball that luke hacked at and missed and as our fans were cheering i heard my father say knock him down paul i looked at my coach he heard it too and he was shaking his head no i had hit a few batters but never intentionally the year before i had bounced a fastball off the helmet of kirk barnes the sound was sickening he cried for an hour and both of us almost quit the game and i wanted no part of luke gozlo he was a tough kid the type who would wait in the parking lot after the game and beat the hell out of me i walked him on the next four pitches none of them remotely near his head or near the strike zone with a and count on the cleanup batter i hung a curveball a huge mistake he crushed it and when it cleared the fence luke started whooping it up and showing his ass again as he rounded the bases at that moment i wished i had beaned him i struck out the next two then walked two then got lucky with a long fly ball to deep right field as i walked to the dugout i glanced at my father he was shaking his head frowning mumbling with both arms folded angrily across his chest i thought about hitchhiking home maybe i could catch a ride with a coach or a teammate maybe i could just move in with the sabbatinis and have a normal life with the team trailing and facing elimination our coach decided to change pitchers i wanted to keep playing but i was also relieved to be out of the game and tucked away in the dugout eastchester won and our season was over my career was over too i would never again put on a baseball uniform my father waited perhaps two minutes into the drive home before he reached the point where he could no longer stay quiet that was a pathetic game he began my mother was ready to explode and she snapped dont start it warren dont even think about it just shut up and drive i couldnt see his face but i knew it was bloodred i knew his first reaction would be to stop the car slap her across the face then attack me in the rear seat passing motorists would be treated to the sight of another tracey family brawl postgame on the shoulder of the road truthfully though he only hit my mother when he was drunk that was no excuse but as the seconds ticked by slowly i was comforted by that fact a pathetic game at that point in his career he had won sixtyone games and lost eighty what about that pathetic record what about the pathetic game against the dodgers back in may when he gave up six runs in the first inning and left with the bases loaded and only one out what about the pathetic game three weeks ago in pittsburgh when he took a fiverun lead into the seventh inning and blew it before the mets could warm up a reliever dont get me started i knew his stats better than he did but if i opened my smart mouth i knew he would punch me i managed to hold my tongue so did he and we survived the drive home as he turned off the ignition he said lets go to the backyard paul i need to show you something i looked at my mother for help but she was hurrying to get out the backyard session turned ugly real fast then violent when it was over i vowed to never play again as long as he was alive joe arrived home in the early hours of monday morning the lights were on his parents were waiting as he parked at the curb he noticed the large poster staked near the mailbox it was a replica of the back of a cubs game jersey with a bold blue number in the center of it he looked aroundevery yard on church street had the same poster later he would realize that every front lawn in calico rock displayed one too as well as the windows of every store office bank and café his mothers family was from south louisiana and joe had been raised on cajun food his favorite was red beans and rice with andouille sausage and at three oclock that morning he devoured a plateful then he slept until noon charlie castle was eight years older than joe he was married with two small children and lived in a new home on the edge of town the family and many friends gathered there late tuesday afternoon for hot dogs and ice cream the real purpose though was to see joe to touch him to make sure he was real and to somehow and in some dignified way convey the immense pride they felt he made it easy at home far away from chicago far away from anywhere really the past twelve days seemed surreal and at times he seemed as dazed as his admirers he signed autographs posed for photos even kissed a few babies the allstar game was on in the den but everyone was outside they had joe to themselves but only for a moment the world was clawing for him greatness was waiting and joe would soon return to center stage i watched the allstar game at home with my mother the sabbatinis invited me over but i had a black eye and refused to leave the house my parents were at war and eventually my father had fled to the city where he would no doubt go to a bar and start more trouble before he left he apologized for hitting me but the apology meant absolutely nothing i hated the man i think my mother did too jill had long since given up on him the game was in kansas city and it turned into a celebration of willie mays who was the greatest allstar performer ever in a remarkable twentyfour games he had twentythree hits including three home runs three triples two doubles and a highlight reel full of great defensive plays now he was fortytwo years old sitting on the bench for the mets and planning to retire at the end of the season i was the only kid i knew who had actually met willie mays early in the season the mets had their annual family day at shea stadium most of the players wives and kids were there to meet each other and pose for photographs there was ice cream autographs tours of the stadium and locker room and lots of souvenirs my father had reluctantly allowed me to take part in this wonderful event i had my picture taken with willie mays tom seaver rusty staub and most of the mets my mother had these enlarged to eight by ten and they were neatly filed away in my scrapbooks i had thick ones for tom seaver and willie mays the only two mets to make the allstar team as i watched the game i wondered what they really thought of warren tracey sure they were teammates but i doubted if they cared much for my father as much as i tried to loosen him up he rarely talked about the other mets he ran around with a couple of relievers from the bull pen and he would occasionally tell a funny story about something that happened around the clubhouse or on the roadstories that were suitable for our ears his manager yogi berra was good for an occasional laugh but the big metstom seaver willie mays jerry koosman rusty staubwere offlimits looking back i think he resented their success for the american league the fans had selected such greats as brooks robinson reggie jackson and rod carew catfish hunter started on the mound in the national league the reds had three starterspete rose joe morgan and johnny bench the cubs had tworon santo and billy williams hank aaron was at first base a record fiftyfour players made it into the game and i had the topps baseball card for every one i knew their ages birthplaces heights weights and all their stats i did not deliberately memorize all this data i simply absorbed it the game was my world the players my idols the game though had just delivered a nasty blow and i was a wounded boy the right side of my face was swollen and the eye was closed i was so happy my father was not playing in the allstar game because i would not have been able to endure it he never came close though with his twisted ego he felt slighted it was such a relief to have him out of the house my mother sat nearby reading a paperback paying no attention to the game but staying close to me after he stormed out and things calmed down she told me that he would never hit me again i took this to mean she was about to leave him or he would leave us or there would be some manner of a breakup i whispered this to jill and we were delighted at first then we began to wonder where we would live what would happen to him how could mom survive without his income as the scenarios unfolded we had more and more questions troubling ones i suppose every kid wants his parents to stay together but as the day wore on i found myself torn between the uncertainties of a divorce and the pleasant thoughts of life without my father i leaned toward the latter when ron santo walked to the plate in the second inning curt gowdy and tony kubek couldnt wait to launch into the joe castle story they had been at wrigley just ten days earlier for that historic event and recapped it as santo worked the count off catfish hunter after eleven games joe had forty at bats twentynine hits twelve home runs and fourteen stolen bases he had hit safely in every game and more important the cubs had won nine of the eleven and were in first place in the national league east wrigley field had sold out not only for each of the six games joe had played there but for every game until after labor day kubek offered the same speculation that was making the rounds the wise men of baseball including my father were predicting that the pitchers would soon catch on to joe and find his weaknesses his current batting average of was ridiculous and certain to plummet as he made his way around the league gowdy was not so sure i didnt notice any holes in his swing he said nor did i kubek quickly agreed hes struck out only twice great balance he stays back incredible bat speed poor ron santo was overshadowed by his rookie teammate who at that moment was eating his aunt rachels homemade strawberry ice cream in calico rock arkansas and oblivious to the game when play resumed on july the cubs opened a fourgame series in cincinnati against the big red machine the most dominant team of the s with a lineup that included pete rose johnny bench joe morgan and tony perez the reds narrowly lost the world series in seven games to the as then won it all in and they were leading the dodgers by two games in the national league west as usual a large crowd was on hand and most were curious to see if the bat of joe castle had cooled off during the allstar break it had not joe hit a solo home run in his first at bat and barely missed another one in the fourth inning he was three for four in game one two for five in game two two for four in game three and one for three in game four the teams split the series and the reds would go on to win ninetynine games and take the national league west for the series joe went eight for sixteen and his average dropped to another obscure record was suddenly in sight in a red rookie by the name of chuck aleno made a dazzling debut by hitting safely in his first seventeen games a modernday record that stood until aleno cooled off considerably and left baseball three years later after playing in only games and hitting the experts of course were still predicting such a collapse for joe castle joes sixteenth game was in pittsburgh and he got things started in the top of the first with a standup triple the crowd and the cubs were drawing well on the road applauded politely pirates fans had been spoiled with the likes of roberto clemente willie stargell and al oliver and they knew their baseball they were watching history and though they wanted a win they were also pulling for this new kid the second game went fourteen innings joe got five hits in seven at bats he tied alenos record with a home run in his seventeenth game then broke it with two doubles in his eighteenth when the cubs left pittsburgh for a threegame series in montreal joe had played in nineteen games had hit safely in each and was sporting a gaudy batting average of with fourteen home runs and seventeen stolen bases records were still falling baseball had never seen such a furious start by a rookie the cubs were the hottest team in baseball and led the pirates in the east by six games the august issue of sports illustrated had on its cover the smiling face of joe castle the photo was shot from the waist up a baseball bat ran the length of his broad shoulders and he held both ends tightly with his hands his biceps were sufficiently flexedit was the look of raw power the bold caption above his head read calico joe and below his chestthe phenom the writer spent time in calico rock he interviewed joes family friends and former coaches and teammates the article was thorough fair and balanced and provided the first indepth look at joes background a valuable source was clarence rook sports editor of the calico rock record and unofficial baseball historian for izard county arkansas mr clarence rook asks me to leave the newspapers offices on main street and i do so i have two scoops of vanilla at an ice cream shop two doors down and listen to some casual town gossip as i watch the languid foot traffic on the sidewalk after killing an hour i drive three blocks west and higher up the bluff to a house at south street where mr rook has lived for the past fortyone years he is waiting standing on the front porch already in his drinking clothes the house is a rambling old victorian with wide sweeping covered porches high arching windows painted gables all different colors the most dominant being a soft pastel maize the small lawn and flower beds are as neat and colorful as the house a beautiful place i say as i walk through the swinging gate of a white picket fence its a handmedown my wifes family welcome he is wearing a white linen shirt with a tail that falls almost to his knees a pair of bulky white britches that bunch around his bare ankles and a pair of wellworn and scuffed espadrilles he is holding a tall slender beverage glass with a straw in his right hand and with his left he waves at the side porch and says follow me fays back there somewhere i follow him over the creaking boards and under the whirling ceiling fans the porch is crowded with white wicker furniturerockers stools drink tables a long swing covered with pillows fay is ms rook a spry little woman with white hair and a pair of large round orangerimmed glasses she welcomes me profusely grabbing my hand with both of hers as if she has not had a guest in years from santa fe she says i love santa fe the home of the most fascinating woman i wish i could have met and that would be why georgia okeeffe of course fay is an artist mr rook adds though this is becoming obvious we are on the back porch by now high above the white river in the distance and i have unknowingly entered the studio of a serious painter stacks of easels racks of perfectly organized paint bottles boxes of brushes of all sizes and shapes a few samples of her work reveal an impressionist fascination with flowers and landscapes would you like something to drink mr rook asks as he steps to a small bar sure the house drink is lemon gin he says as he pours a yellow mix from a pitcher into a glass filled with ice i have never heard of lemon gin but it is apparent i will not be given a choice of cocktails that stuff is dreadful ms rook says rolling her eyes as if the old boy might have a problem he thrusts the glass at me and says its not real lemon gin which im told is real gin flavored with lemon which sounds awful but this is more of a lemonade with a bit of gordons thrown in to spice it up cheers we tap glasses and i take a sip not bad we shuffle to the side porch and find seats amid the wicker ms rook is a study in bright colors her white hair has a streak of purple above the left ear her toenails are painted pink her cotton dripdry dress is a collage of reds and blues you must stay for dinner she says we eat from the garden everything is fresh no meats is that okay there was no way to offer a polite no and besides i have already realized that a good restaurant might be hard to find in calico rock nor have i seen a motel if you insist i say and this seems to thrill her beyond words ill go pick the squash she says bouncing to her feet and hurrying away we sip our drinks and talk about the heat and humidity but soon find our way back to more important matters he begins you have to understand paul that the castles are very protective of joe if you met him lets say randomly out there on the street for example though that would never happen because joe is seldom seen around town but anyway if you bumped into him and tried to say hello he would simply walk away i cant imagine joe chatting with a stranger it just doesnt happen over the years weve had the occasional journalist show up looking for a story there were a couple of pieces written a long time ago and they said things that werent nice such as joe is brain damaged joe is disabled joe is bitter and so on the family is very distrustful of anyone who shows up and wants to talk about joe thats why they would never allow him to speak to you could i talk to his brothers who am i youre on your own but i wouldnt recommend it red and charlie are nice enough but they can be tough guys and when it comes to their little brother they can turn nasty real quick they carry guns like a lot of people around here hunting rifles and such the lemon gin is settling in and i want to change the subject to anything but guns i take a long sip as does mr rook and for a moment the only sounds are the whirling blades of the ceiling fans finally i ask did you see him play at wrigley a wide nostalgic smile breaks across his face and he begins to nod twice fay and i drove to chicago early in august of that summer the sports illustrated piece had just been published and the world couldnt get enough of joe castle how did you get tickets scalpers there were a lot of folks around here who wanted desperately to get to chicago for a game but word was out that you couldnt get tickets joe got a handful each game and there was always a fight for those i remember drinking coffee one morning downtown and mr herbert mangrum walked in he had some money and he had just flown to pittsburgh to watch the cubs said he had to pay a scalper for two tickets in pittsburgh herb was a big talker and he went on and on about seeing joe in pittsburgh so you drove to chicago with no tickets thats right but i had a contact we got lucky and saw two games spoke to joe after the first one the kid was on top of the world we were so proud which games august and against the braves you missed the fun he got ejected the next day mr rook licks his lips cocks his head and gives me a strange look you know your stuff dont you yes sir i do could you please drop the sirs and the misters im clarence and my wife is fay okay clarence what do you want to know about the short happy and tragic career of joe castle how many games did he play clarence asks knowing the answer thirtyeight and i have the box score for every one he wouldve played fortythree but for the ejection on august the day after you saw him play clarence smiles nods takes a long sip and says youre wrong paul he wouldve played three thousand games if he hadnt been beaned he sets his drink on the table stands and says ill be right back he returns with a cardboard box which he sets on the floor next to his sofa from it he removes four thick threering binders all matched and perfectly organized he places them on the wicker table and says this is the book i never wrotethe story of joe castle many years ago i started the first chapter then put it aside this is not the only unfinished project mind you in fact there are many and i suppose the world is a better place because of my tendency to procrastinate how can a newspaper editor procrastinate doesnt your life revolve around deadlines some deadlines sure but because we stare at the calendar all day long we tend to shove aside our other projects so why didnt you write this book truthfully it was the family i talked to red one time and he didnt like the idea this town is too small to make enemies and if the family wasnt willing to cooperate then the book was not worth writing he flips through the second binder and finds the tab for august sit over here he says patting a spot next to him i move around to take a look eager to see his research this is one of my favorite stories he says pointing to an article in the tribune about joe getting ejected for charging the mound there was a large photo of a brawl by early august of that summer the pitchers were throwing at joe more and more its part of the ritual of being a rookie especially one who happens to be on a tear but the cubs had ferguson jenkins and rick reuschel two tough guys who threw hard and were known to protect their hitters there were rumors that jenkins and reuschel and some of the other cubs pitchers had spread the word that if joe got hit the retaliation would be swift as things turned out joe didnt need any help the braves had a journeyman lefty named dutch patton a big thick guy six five or so and the first time up joe ripped a double then stole third we were still in chicago but couldnt get tickets to the game so we were watching on television when joe came up in the third inning patton threw at his head and almost nailed him the cubs dugout went berserk the fans were ready to riot joe yelled something at patton and he yelled something back the home plate umpire got involved a very tense situation joe got back in the box dug in and patton went into his windup just as he released the ball joe dropped his bat and sprinted toward the mound he was so quick and fast he caught everybodyincluding patton and the catcher johnny oatescompletely off guard ive seen the film clip a hundred times and what happened was pretty frightening patton managed to swing his glove at joe who ducked and shot a right cross into pattons mouth a left hook to the nose knocked him down and like a jackhammer joe pummeled him with five more shots to the face each one drawing blood patton left the field on a stretcher didnt wake up for six hours and didnt pitch for a month johnny oates finally managed to pull joe off and by then there were forty players on the field slugging it out the brawl lasted for ten minutes and there were something like seven or eight ejections joe was suspended for five games and the cubs lost all five as he talks i listen intently and flip through his binder i have a copy of the tribune story along with the photo but my little scrapbook on joe castle is nothing compared with the spread before me i know the story of joes retaliation against dutch patton and clarence has not missed a detail what was so funny at least to me was that i had seen joe pull the same trick before clarence is saying when i ask as he pauses and waits for me to prompt him when he was seventeen in a high school game against heber springs scouts all over the place all here to see joe first time up he hit a ball over the lights in right field the second time up the pitcher threw at his head he kept his cool waited when you charge the mound your biggest threat is being tackled from behind by the catcher all three of the castle boys understood this rather basic part of the game joe waited until the pitch was thrown then sprinted to the mound it was pretty ugly these were kids and the benches did not empty as fast as they do in the big leagues clarences words trail off as though he doesnt want to finish the story did he hurt the pitcher lets just say the kid didnt pitch for a few days maybe weeks maybe never i dont know but im sure he lost his enthusiasm for throwing beanballs joe was not a bully just the opposite he was a really nice kid but he didnt like guys throwing at him who broke up the fight the umpires no player on the other team wanted to get near it i flip back and forth and come across the cover of sports illustrated ill bet this caused some excitement around here oh yes not that there was a lack of excitement that summer everybody in town wanted to talk to the reporter let me refresh your drink there paul he takes both glasses to the back porch i follow and peek into the kitchen where fay is slicing eggplant when the drinks are ready clarence repacks his pipe and lights it with fresh lemon gins in hand we walk down the rear steps and gaze at the white river where did the nickname come from i ask clarence chuckles and takes a sip sports illustrated i guess thats the first time i ever heard of calico joe but it stuck the chicago writers ran with it and never looked back they had shoeless joe a half century earlier so i guess it was irresistible its such a perfect nickname it is or was we watch two men in a boat cast their lines and drift with the current what does joe do around here i ask he takes care of his baseball field his field yes joe castle field over at the high school he mows the grass every morning he rakes the dirt pulls weeds lays the chalk sweeps the dugouts and in general putters around the field five days a week if it snows joe scrapes it off the bleachers when its raining he sits in the dugout third base side and watches the puddles form around the infield when it stops raining he gently spreads the dirt around so there will be no puddles the next time about this time of year after summer ball is over hell paint both dugouts and the press box its his field can i see him tomorrow again im not his keeper you can do whatever you want but would he speak to me ive already explained that paul joe doesnt speak to strangers would he speak to my father if i brought him here clarence coughed and glared at me as if i had insulted his wife are you crazy maybe hes dying clarence and before hes gone i would like for the two men to have a word what kind of word im not sure but ideally i would like my father to apologize have you discussed this with your father no not yet and before i do i need to know if joe will agree to a meeting i doubt seriously if that can happen paul and it would be a huge mistake for warren tracey to show up here in calico rock that could start some serious trouble it took a week for the black eye to fade away and i spent most of the time in my room reading and looking in the mirror my father stopped by twice with clumsy efforts at making peace but i was not in the mood when you get backhanded by your father the pain lasts far longer than the bruises mercifully the mets left town for a long road trip and i ventured out of my room and tried to enjoy the last month of my summer break on august the mets shut out the astros in houston my father pitched seven innings gave up only three hits walked only two and won his fifth game of the season i listened to the game in the den and as usual recorded every pitch and play on my official mets scorecard i knew it was his best game in many years and as lindsey nelson and ralph kiner said nice things about my father i couldnt help but feel a tiny bit of pride although grudgingly i was getting in bed when he called home and wanted to chat about the game we stayed on the phone for half an hour as he recounted the highlights and patiently answered my questions and when we eventually said good night i was so excited i had trouble sleeping four days later he pitched a completegame fourhitter against the padres for his second win in a row a rare feat for warren tracey because he was on the west coast he did not call me after the game but late the next morning he checked in from his hotel room and we talked for almost an hour my mother was happy because i was happy but she was also suspicious about his sudden interest in me my bruises were gone and the emotional scars were fading or so i thought in the new york papers the battle was still raging over warren tracey and whether he should get benched or sent down his two consecutive wins cooled his critics but did little to arouse any support the mets were coming to life though it looked as if no team could catch the cubs joe castle was still redhot and frontpage news in chicago and wherever he happened to be playing i made the calculations a dozen times and assuming no sudden changes in the pitching rotations the lineups injuries or disruptions due to weather the cubs would arrive at shea stadium on friday august joe castle would make his new york debut and my father would be on the mound the cubs would be in first place in the east and the mets in all likelihood would be in second when i considered this and i did so at least ten times each day that august my stomach would tie itself in knots and i could not swallow water warren tracey versus joe castle my feelings for my father were hopelessly mixed and confused for the most part i despised him yet he was my father and he was a professional baseball player pitching for the new york mets how many elevenyearold boys could make such a claim we lived in the same house we had the same ancestors name address his success or failure had a direct impact on me i adored his parents though i rarely saw them he was my father damn it i wanted him to win however the world of baseball was revolving around joe castle he sold out wherever he went and the seats were often filled during pregame batting practice he was hounded by reporters so fiercely that he was hiding from them on the road fans flocked to the cubs hotels hoping for an autograph or a glimpse young women were sending all types of proposals marriage and otherwise his teammates and coaches were devising schemes to protect his privacy insanity ruled off the field but between the chalk lines joe castle continued to play like a kid on a sandlot he sprinted after foul balls lunged into the stands turned lazy singles into doubles bunted with two strikes violently broke up double plays tagged up on every fly ball to the outfield usually had the dirtiest uniform when the game was over and through it all ripped baseballs to all corners of the field the thought of joe digging in against my father was overwhelming but as the long hot days of august moved along i found myself thinking of nothing else my buddies were hounding me for tickets the four games against the cubs were sold out new york was waiting his fivegame suspension for punching out dutch patton ended on august and with a talent for the dramatic joe returned to a raucous wrigley field for an afternoon game against the dodgers he singled in the first doubled in the fourth tripled in the seventh and when he stepped to the plate in the bottom of the ninth he only needed a home run to complete the cycle the cubs needed a home run to win the game batting righthanded he poked a blooper down the right field line and as it rolled slowly to the wall the race was on ron santo scored easily from second with the tying run and when joe sprinted to third he ignored the coachs signal to stop he never slowed down the shortstop took the relay looked at third where joe would have an easy triple then hesitated at the sight of him streaking home the throw was perfect and the catcher joe ferguson snatched it and blocked the plate ferguson was six feet two pounds joe was six feet two pounds in a splitsecond decision neither chose to yield an inch joe lowered his head left his feet and crashed into ferguson the collision was thunderous and spun both players in violent circles in the dirt joe wouldve been out by three feet but the ball was loose and rolling in the grass it was an insidethepark home run his first and it was a miracle that both he and ferguson walked away from the collision though both did so rather slowly after thirtyone games he had sixtytwo hits in at bats with eighteen home runs and twentyfive stolen bases he had made one error at first and had struck out only six times his batting average of was easily the highest in the majors though he had not had enough at bats to qualify for the official ranking as expected his average was slowly declining ty cobb the greatest hitter of all time had a career average of ted williams joe dimaggio joe castle was not yet being compared to the great ones but no rookie had ever hit after at bats on august the mets were at home against the cardinals and my father was starting after winning two in a row he had lost a onerun game to the dodgers and got roughed up by the giants but avoided taking the loss his record was six and seven and he was feeling good about his game after his banana milk shake he asked me if i would like to ride with him to shea stadium this of course meant that i would be allowed to hang around the locker room dugout and field for hours before the first pitch i jumped at the chance he promised to drive me home after the game which of course meant he would not be hitting the bars the tension around the house had thawed somewhat my parents were civil to each other at least in the presence of jill and me for two uncertain kids this only confused matters i was in the mets dugout watching the cardinals take batting practice soaking in the sights and sounds reveling in the rarest of moments when willie mays walked by and said hey kid what brings you here my dads pitching i said thoroughly awestruck tracey yes sir and then willie mays sat down beside me on the bench as if time meant nothing he said i cant remember your name paul tracey i said nice to see you again paul i tried to say something but froze your dads pitching well these days he said seems like he told me youre a pitcher too yes sir but our seasons over ill be twelve next year lou brock was in the cage for the cardinals spraying baseballs everywhere we watched him take a dozen swings then willie spoke to another player who walked in front of us when we were alone again he said you know i never wanted to pitch you gotta rely on too many other players to succeed you can be having a great day on the mound then just like that somebody makes an error and you lose the game you know yes sir i would agree with anything mr mays had to say or you strike out twenty give up two hits and lose the game one to nothing you know what im saying paul yes sir plus i could never throw strikes which is tough when youre trying to pitch ive had that problem occasionally i said and willie mays laughed out loud he tapped me on the knee and said good luck to you paul thanks mr mays he jumped to his feet and was yelling at one of the cardinals i looked at my knee for a long time and vowed to never wash that pair of jeans a few minutes later wayne garrett and ed kranepool sat nearby and began watching batting practice i inched a bit closer so i could eavesdrop you hear what castle did today garrett asked as he chomped on bubble gum no kranepool replied four for four with two doubles off don sutton off sutton kranepool asked in disbelief yep i thought the kid was cooling off guess not should be a wild weekend around here you got any spare tickets are you kidding i sat alone eight rows from the field and close to the mets dugout my father gave up a home run to joe torre in the first inning then settled down and pitched well he ran out of gas in the top of the seventh with the mets leading and when yogi berra pulled him he received an impressive ovation from the crowd i was on my feet clapping and yelling as loud as possible he tipped his cap to me and at that moment i realized how much i wanted to adore him his record was seven and seven his next start would be against the cubs after two lemon gins i am sufficiently mellow and want no more clarence seems unfazed by the booze and when he goes for his third i decline and ask for water fay is buzzing about cooking and setting the table on the back porch the sun is falling and its last rays glisten across the white river below us clarence and i sit under a maple tree next to the vegetable garden and talk about the castle boys their grandfather vick castle signed with the cleveland indians in and five years later made it to the big leagues but for less than a month he played in ten games before being sent down after the season he was traded then broke an ankle and his career fizzled he returned to izard county and ran a sawmill before dying at the age of fortyfour bobby his only son and joes father signed with pittsburgh in and in he led the aaa international league in hitting and rbis he was destined to start at third base for the pirates in but the war got in the way he joined the navy and was shipped to the pacific where he lost half a leg to a land mine his oldest son charlie signed out of high school with the washington senators and bounced around the minors for six years before he called it quits red the middle brother signed with the phillies in but couldnt get out of single a he quit joined the marines and volunteered for two tours of duty in vietnam clarence enjoys his narrative and does not need notes i am amazed at his ability to recall though i have no way of knowing his level of accuracy there is something about his twinkling eyes and bushy eyebrows that leads me to believe that this guy is not beyond embellishment but it doesnt matter he loves to talk and tell stories and the castle family is obviously a favorite topic i am delighted to be here and happy to listen even when charlie and red were playing he is saying everyone was talking about joe when he was ten or so a little fellow he hit four home runs in a game against mountain home that was the first time he got his name in the newspaper i went to the archives and pulled it out in i got flooded with folks wanting all sorts of background on joe castle i spent half the summer digging through back copies when he was twelve he led our allstars to a thirdplace finish in little rock and i ran this huge frontpage story about the team big photo and all when he was thirteen he stopped playing with the kids and spent all summer with a mens team joe played first red at second three and four in the lineup and they mustve played a hundred games thats when we realized he might be special the scouts began showing up when he was fifteen charlie was in the minors red was in the minors but everybody was talking about joe i was covering a state playoff game in may down in searcy and he hit a baseball that bounced off a school bus in a parking lot feet from home plate can you imagine a sixteenyearold kid hitting a foot home run with wood not aluminum the scouts were drooling shaking their heads in disbelief pretty amazing clarence dinner is ready fay yells from the porch and we do not waste time that barbecue pork sandwich for lunch was now at least eight hours in the past directly under a ceiling fan fay has set a beautiful table small and round with freshcut flowers in a small vase in the center there is a large bowl of tomato cucumber and onion salad and another of grilled squash and eggplant over brown rice she waves at the food and says two hours ago it was still on the vine we pass the bowls and begin eating i feel compelled to at least make an effort to discuss her art but decide against it a visit like this will never be repeated and i want to hear and talk about joe castle after some chatter about my wife daughters and job i manage to get things back on track what was it like in when the draft was approaching i ask clarence chews swallows takes a sip of water and says pretty crazy we thought he would be the number one pick in the draft at least thats what the scouts had been saying for two years the town thought he was about to get rich fay adds top money back then was for the early picks in case you havent noticed this is a small town folks were openly discussing what joe might do with all his money then something weird happened in late may calico rock was playing in the finals of the state tournament over at jonesboro and joe had two bad games he had not had a bad game in ten years then bam two in a row some of the scouts got spooked i guess the cubs took him in the second round offered him and away he went what happened to the money i ask he gave to his church fay says and to the high school right clarence that sounds right another went to dress up the little league park where he had played so many games seems like he paid off the mortgage on his parents home which wasnt that much no shiny new corvette i ask oh no he paid for hank thatchers ford pickup hank had just died and his wife was selling some of his stuff she didnt want the truck so joe bought it i remind myself again of why i do not want to live in a small town such personal details would never be discussed or even known in a city i cannot remember the last time i have eaten vegetables as fresh as fays sara cooks healthy meals but i have never tasted squash and eggplant like this delicious i say for the second or third time thank you fay replies graciously i notice that she eats very little clarence washes his food down with water but the lemon gin is still close two fishing boats float quietly by on the river and head for the docks below the bridge in the distance our conversation drifts to fays sister who is dying of cancer in missouri and wants them to visit her over the weekend the cancer talk brings things around to my father when was he diagnosed fay asks last week its terminal just a few months maybe weeks im so sorry she says have you seen him clarence asks no im going down tomorrow as i said were not close not close at all never have been he left the family when his baseball career flamed out and soon remarried hes not a nice person clarence not the kind of guy youd want to spend time with i believe that i read a story about him years ago after baseball he tried to make it as a golfer but that went nowhere seems like he was selling real estate in the orlando area and not doing very well he was still adamant that he did not throw at joe but the writer was skeptical i guess were all skeptical you should be i say why is that i wipe my mouth with a linen napkin because he threw at joe i know he did hes denied it for thirty years but i know the truth there is a long pause as we pick at our food and listen to the whirling of the old ceiling fan just above us finally clarence lifts his lemon gin and gulps down an ounce he licks his lips smacks them and says you have no idea how excited we were how much it meant to this town and especially to the family after producing so many great players a castle had finally hit the big time i wish i could say im sorry you cant besides it was thirty years ago a long time fay observes as she looks down at the river a long time maybe but never to be forgotten i dont suppose you were there clarence says indeed i was august shea stadium my father was in a foul mood when he left the house alone i dropped a few hints about riding to the stadium with him but he wasnt listening the new york papers were relentlessly hyping the game and one writer my fathers loudest critic described the matchup as a contrast between youth and age warren tracey age thirtyfour and over the hill versus joe castle the brightest young star baseball has seen since the arrival of mickey mantle in jill was away at a camp in the catskills i cajoled my mother into taking an early train to the city i wanted to watch batting practice and more important get my first live look at joe castle we stepped off the subway at two and a half hours before the first pitch and the atmosphere outside shea stadium was electric i was surprised at the number of cubs fans most of them wearing white jerseys with the number across the back some were families who were well behaved but many were young men in packs roaming around like street gangs yelling drinking beer looking for trouble they found it new york fans are far from shy and seldom back down from a challenge i saw the police break up three fights before we passed through the turnstiles disgusting my mother said it would be her last trip to the ballpark shea held fiftyfive thousand and it was already twothirds full when we settled into our seats the cubs were taking batting practice and there was a swarm around the cage at home plate ron santo billy williams jose cardenal and rick monday were in one group and as they rotated through i searched the outfield until i saw him as he turned to chase a fly ball i saw the name castle across the back of his royal blue hitting jersey he caught the ball near the right field foul line and a thousand kids screamed for his autograph he smiled and waved and jogged back to a group of cubs loitering in right center probably talking about the women up in the outfield bleachers by then i had read many descriptions of joe castle in high school some scouts had worried that he was too thin he weighed pounds when he was eighteen and this had bothered a few of the experts however his father had been quoted as saying hes not even shaving yet let the boy grow up and he was right in the minors joe had filled out thanks to a combination of nature and hours in the weight room he had broad shoulders and a thirtythreeinch waist he wore his game pants tight and one article in the tribune gossiped about the avalanche of provocative mail he was getting from women across the country as i watched he seemed to glide across the outfield as the bats cracked and baseballs flew everywhere i saw my father in the mets dugout sitting alone going through his pregame ritual it was far too early for him to head to the bull pen and begin stretching odd though that he was in the dugout usually at two hours and counting he was in the locker room getting a massage from a trainer with ninety minutes to go he put on his uniform at seventyfive minutes he left the locker room walked through the dugout and headed for the bull pen head down refusing to look at the opposing dugout the more i thought about it the stranger it seemed baseball players and especially pitchers are fanatics about their rituals my father was three and one in his last six starts and four days earlier had pitched perhaps his best game in the last five years why would he change things my mother bought me a souvenir program then some ice cream and i chatted with the fans around me eventually joe drifted to the cubs dugout opposite where we were sitting he got his bats put on his helmet and began limbering up to get away from the stands he stayed close to the batting cage when it was his turn he jumped in bunted a few then began spraying the ball to all fields bodies moved closer to the cage photographers were scrambling into position and clicking away in his second round he cranked it up and the balls went deeper and deeper he unloaded in his third round from both sides of the plate and hit five straight bombs into the bleachers where hundreds of kids scrambled to get the souvenirs the cubs fans were screaming with each shot and i would have cheered too but i was in the mets section plus my father was the opposing pitcher and it did not seem appropriate when he walked to the mound in the top of the first the fans gave him a rowdy welcome there was not an empty seat in the stadium and for over an hour the cubs and mets fans had been yelling back and forth when rick monday lined to short on the first pitch the stadium roared again two pitches later glenn beckert popped out to right field and warren tracey was cruising the announcer said now batting and playing first base number joe castle i took a deep breath and began chewing my fingernails i wanted to watch then i wanted to close my eyes and just listen my mother patted my knee i envied her apathy at that crucial moment in my life in the life of her husband in the lives of countless mets and cubs fans across the country at that wonderfully supercharged moment in the history of baseball my mother could not have cared less what happened next not surprisingly the first pitch was high and tight joe batting lefthanded ducked but did not fall nor did he glare at my father it was a simple brushback welcome to new york the second pitch was a called strike that looked low but joe did not react the third pitch was a fastball that he slapped into the stands near us the fourth pitch was low and inside the fifth pitch was a changeup that fooled joe but he managed to foul it off i was holding my breath with each pitch i was praying for a strikeout and i was praying for a home run why couldnt i have both a strikeout now for my father a home run later for joe back and forth in baseball you always get another chance right i pondered these things between pitches a complete nervous wreck the sixth pitch was a curve that bounced in the dirt three balls two strikes billy williams on deck shea stadium rocking the cubs ten games in first place the mets ten games back but winning my father versus my hero joe fouled off the next eight pitches as the at bat turned into a dramatic duel with neither player yielding an inch warren tracey was not about to walk him joe castle was not about to strike out the fifteenth pitch was a fastball that looked low but at the last second joe whipped his bat around scooped the ball up and launched it to right center where it cleared the wall by thirty feet for some reason when i knew the ball was gone i looked back at the mound and watched my father he never took his eyes off joe as he rounded first and when the ball cleared the fence joe gave himself a quick pump of the fist as if to say all right it was nothing cocky or out of line nothing meant to show up the pitcher but i knew my father and i knew it was trouble the home run was joes twentyfirst home run in thirtyeight games and it would be his last the score was tied when joe walked to the plate in the top of the third with two outs and no one on the first pitch was a fastball outside and when i saw it i knew what would happen next the second pitch was just like the first hard and a foot off the plate i wanted to stand and scream look out joe but i couldnt move as my father stood on the mound and looked in at jerry grote my heart froze and i couldnt breathe i managed to say to my mother hes gonna hit him the beanball went straight at joes helmet and for a second for a long dreadful second that fans and writers would discuss and debate and analyze for decades to come joe didnt move he lost the ball for a reason no one especially joe would ever understand or be able to explain or recreate or reenact he simply lost sight of the ball he had said that he preferred to hit from the left side because he felt as though his right eye picked up the pitches faster but at that crucial split second his eyes failed him it could have been something beyond the center field wall it could have been a slight shift in the lighting he could have lost the ball as it crossed between my fathers white jersey and home plate he could have been distracted by the movements of felix millan the second baseman no one would ever know because joe would never remember the sound of a leather baseball hitting a hard plastic batting helmet is unmistakable i had heard it several times in my games including twice when i had unintentionally hit batters i had heard it a month before at shea when bud harrelson got beaned i had heard it the summer before at a minorleague game i attended with tom sabbatini and his father it is not a sharp bang but more like the striking of a dull object on a hard surface its frightening enough but there is also the immediate belief that the helmet has prevented a serious injury it was not the sound of joe being hit what we heard was the sickening thud of the baseball cracking into flesh and bone for those of us in the crowd close enough to hear it the sound would never be forgotten i can and do still hear it today the ball made contact at the corner of his right eye it knocked his helmet off as he fell backward he caught himself with his hands behind him on the ground and paused for a second before passing out there are so many scrambled images of what happened next the crowd was stunned there were gasps and a lot of oh my gods the home plate umpire was waving for help jerry grote was standing helplessly over joe the cubs bench was ready to explode several players were out of the dugout screaming and cursing at warren tracey the cubs fans were booing loudly the mets fans were silent my father walked slowly to a spot behind the mound took off his glove put both hands on his hips and stared at home plate i hated him as the trainers hovered over joe and we waited i closed my eyes and prayed that he would get up shake it off trot down to first then at some point charge the mound and bloody my fathers face just like dutch pattons my mother stared at the field in disbelief then looked down at me my eyes were wet minutes passed and joe was not getting up we could see his cleats and uniform from the knees down and at one point his heels appeared to be twitching as if his body were in a seizure the cubs fans began throwing debris and security guards scurried onto the field jerry grote walked past the mound and stood next to his pitcher i watched my father closely and at one point saw something that did not surprise me with joe flat on his back unconscious seriously injured and convulsing i saw my father smile a gate opened in right field and an ambulance appeared it stopped near home plate a stretcher was removed and suddenly the doctors medics and trainers were much more agitated whatever joes condition was it was getting worse they quickly loaded him into the ambulance and it sped away all fiftyfive thousand fans stood and applauded though joe heard nothing during the break the cubs had time to review their options warren tracey had fanned on three straight pitches to make the final out in the bottom of the second so he would not bat again until the fifth inning with ferguson jenkins pitching for the cubs no one in the world of baseball doubted for a second that my father was about to get beaned retaliation would be swift and hopefully at least for the cubs brutal and painful however yogi berra might decide to pull tracey for a reliever thus preventing the payback the cubs could also retaliate in the bottom of the third by knocking down one or two of the mets hitters this would probably result in a freeforall which was exactly what the cubs wanted as they watched their fallen star ride away in the ambulance the problem with a brawl was that their target would be safely tucked away in the dugout what the cubs wanted was the head of warren tracey and the manager whitey lockman devised the perfect solution to pinch run for joe lockman inserted a parttime player named razor ruffin a tough black kid from the memphis projects which he escaped by playing football and baseball at michigan state he was built like a fireplug and could run like a deer but as the cubs were learning he struggled with lefthanded pitching he entered the game and took his time stretching at first base the beaning of joe castle caused a thirtyminute delay in the game and after he was gone the umpire allowed warren tracey a few warmup throws the stadium was subdued the mets fans were uneasy and the cubs fans were exhausted from screaming and booing billy williams stepped to the plate and dug in from the left side williams a future hall of famer was an easygoing type but at that moment any pitch even close to his head would start trouble razor ruffin took a lead but stayed close to the bag he was in the game to fight not steal traceys first two pitches were far outside he had lost his rhythm and was throwing not pitching with the count and williams hit a lazy pop fly to center an easy third out when it was obvious the ball would be caught by don hahn razor ruffin broke for the mound as warren tracey watched the fly ball ruffin slammed into the back of his knees and knocked him halfway to third base ruffin then pounced on him with both fists and began flailing away the cubs who of course knew the plan launched a full assault and engulfed tracey and jerry grote the rest of the mets were a few steps behind but within seconds one of baseballs ugliest incidents was under way fistfights spun off as old scores were settled bodies hit the turf as four dozen great athletes kicked and punched and tried to kill each other with their bare hands at the bottom of the pile razor ruffin and warren tracey were still locked up choking gouging trying to break bones and draw blood the umpires were hapless in their efforts to separate the teams security guards poured onto the field normally the coaches would try to unlock their players but not with this brawl as it continued the fans went wild and shea stadium seemed on the verge of a riot bedlam reigned until a few of the veterans for both teamsron santo rusty staub billy williams and tom seaversucceeded in pulling their teammates away from the action when the pile was uncovered warren tracey bounced up with a bloody nose and pointed his finger at one of the cubs the umpires shoved him away and two of his teammates dragged him toward the dugout he was cursing shouting and bleeding until he disappeared order was finally restored both managers were ejected along with tracey ruffin and six of their teammates by the time the game resumed i was too stunned to think clearly i had witnessed a nightmarethe gruesome beaning of joe castle followed by the emotional shock of watching my father get pummeled by an entire team my mother was fed up too id like to leave now she whispered me too i said we rode the train home without a word i went to my room and crawled into the bed i did not turn on the television though i was desperate for news about joe i was determined not to fall asleep because i had to know if my father came home that night i doubted he would and i was right shortly before midnight the phone rang and my mother answered it a male voice threatened to kill warren tracey and burn down our house in the process my mother called the police and at am my mother and i were chatting with an officer at the kitchen table it was the first of many threatening calls for the next few months we lived in fear and of course my father was rarely home to protect us at the age of eleven i wanted to change my name the mosquitoes find us and we retreat from the porch fay serves strawberries and cream with some strange herbal tea in the cluttered library from ceiling to floor the walls are covered with rows of books and there are neat stacks around an old desk indeed there are books all over the house most covered with dust and packed on sagging shelves much like an old secondhand bookshop the rooks are wellread and thoroughly engaging as conversationalists i have talked enough and want to listen for a while we were listening to the game on the porch werent we fay clarence asks yes around front ill never forget it as the evening progresses i realize fay knows almost as much about the game as clarence very sad vince lloyd and lou boudreau seemed to know immediately that joe was not getting up lou flat out called it a beanball a payback since joe had homered the first time up as we waited and waited they filled in the gap with some research warren tracey had led the national league in hit batsmen in and was tied for the lead in lou called him a headhunter among other things both agreed that joe seemed to freeze when the pitch was released you could tell from their tone that the situation was pretty grim has joe ever talked about it around here i ask not on the record but maybe to his friends or even his brothers not to my knowledge clarence replies a few years later a reporter from little rockwas it the democrat or the gazette fay i think it was the gazette she says its in one of the notebooks but this guy showed up and managed to get an audience with charlie and red he quizzed them about how joe was doing these days and so on he also asked about the beaning and they said that joe simply doesnt remember it thats the only time i can recall the family talking about it mustve been twenty years ago is there brain damage i ask clarence and fay look at each other and it is obvious there are things not to be discussed in my presence i dont think so he says finally but hes not a hundred percent fay says clarence is one of the few townsfolk joe will speak to not talk to as in a conversation but he has always liked clarence and will at least acknowledge his presence im not sure anyone other than his mother really knows what goes on inside his head clarence says and he lives with her yes three blocks away it is almost pm and fay is ready for bed she gathers the dishes gives me instructions on where to sleep and says good night as soon as she is gone clarence says i need a little digestif you as far as i can tell clarence is cold sober he did not finish his last lemon gin over dinner and shows no sign of being tipsy same for memy last sip of alcohol and the last sip of lemon gin in my lifetime was two hours earlier my clock is running on mountain time one hour behind arkansas so i am not quite ready for bed and i want to listen to clarence such as i ask he is already on his feet lumbering out of the room ozark peach brandy he says and disappears it is a clear liquid with a slight amber tint he pours it from an ominouslooking jug into two small shotlike glasses when he sits down we touch glasses and he says cheers now be careful you need to sip it very slowly at first i do a blowtorch could not be hotter on my lips and tongue i keep a game face and manage to choke it down with flames scorching my esophagus until the last drop hits my unsuspecting stomach he watches me carefully waiting for some comical reaction and when i keep my composure he says not bad huh what is itgasoline its a local product made by one of our better distillers and untaxed i presume highly untaxed and illegal as hell he takes another sip i thought moonshine causes blindness and liver damage it can but you gotta know your source this is good stuff some of the bestlight tasty virtually harmless harmless my toes are burning as the child of a violent alcoholic i have never been attracted to the drinking life and after an evening of lemon gin and moonshine whiskey i realize how wise i have been the second sip is easier and the third is the best he says i take an even smaller sip and it burns less probably because of the scar tissue left behind by the first tell me paul how did you know your father was going to bean joe he asks reaching for his pipe and tobacco pouch thats a long story i say trying to find my tongue he smiles and spreads his arms we have all night i usually read until midnight and sleep till eight i take a third sip and actually get a slight taste of peach flavoring he was of the old school if a batter hits a home run then the batter wins the duel his reward is obvious he gets nothing more its a sin to insult the pitcher by showing off in any way standing at the plate and admiring the drive flipping the bat loafing around the bases to soak up the attention and heaven forbid any show of selfgratification or emotion no sir the batter wins and he circles the bases quickly and gets to the dugout otherwise he pays for it if a batter does anything to show off then the pitcher has the right to knock him down that was straight from the old code and my father swore by it that might not work in todays game clarence says blowing a cloud of smoke i wouldnt know clarence i havent watched a game in thirty years so did joe do something to show up warren tracey you were there vince lloyd and lou boudreau said repeatedly that joe did nothing wrong well according to warrens official party line the answer is no no because he soon began claiming that it was an accident he did not throw at joe that it was simply a pitch up that got away from him i suspect that once it became obvious joe was seriously injured warren changed his tune and started lying you seem awfully certain about this when i was a little boy five or six i decided i wanted to be a pitcher because my father was a pitcher i was pretty good and got better as i grew up i didnt get a lot of backyard coaching because he was seldom at home but we lived in the same house and some of his knowledge rubbed off on me i guess i was pitching once and a kid hit a home run a real shot and he danced and yelled all the way around the bases my father was there which was a rare occasion and the next time this kid came up my father yelled knock him down paul i was eleven years old and didnt want to throw at anyone the kid did not get beaned my father was furious after the game we had a big fight he slapped me around the backyard told me i would never make it as a pitcher because i was a coward afraid to throw at hitters he was a nasty person clarence another sip another puff and youll see him tomorrow thats right for the first time in several years and you think you can convince him to come here to calico rock i have no idea but ill try it seems like a long shot on both ends i have a plan it might not work but im trying he pours some more moonshine after a few minutes i begin to nod off does this stuff knock you out i ask definitely youll sleep like a baby im gone thanks i go to bed in their guest room beneath the hum and breeze of a ceiling fan only three blocks away from the small house where joe castle lives with his mother the last time i saw him he was on a stretcher being rushed off the field away to a new york city hospital leaving behind forever the brilliance of his game the dreams of his fans and the promising career that would never be fay is consumed with her work at her easel when i say goodbye i thank her for the hospitality and she says the guest room is always available i follow clarence back to main street where we park and walk to evans drug store as we enter he says you might want to stick with paul casey just to be safe no problem i have used that alias more times than he can imagine the café is filled with the early morning crowd all men and clarence speaks to a few as we head for a table in the rear i manage to avoid having to introduce myself evidently clarence is a vegetarian only at home where fay is in charge of the menu away from her he orders eggs and bacon and i do likewise waiting on the food we sip coffee and listen to the enthusiastic conversations around us at a long table near the front window a group of retired gentlemen are worked up over the war in iraq there are plenty of opinions and little regard for who else in the café might hear them i assume this is a fairly conservative town politically i say to clarence oh yes but its usually split during elections izard county is all white but there are a lot of your oldtime roosevelt democrats still around theyre known as dropcord democrats thats a new one rural electricity brought in by the new deal way back why is the county all white its historic there was never much farming around here so no slaves no reason for black folks to settle here now i guess they prefer to go elsewhere but weve never had a problem with the klan if thats what youre thinking no thats not what i was thinking the wall above the cash register is covered with rows of team photoslittle league softball high school basketballsome current others faded with the years in the center is a framed cover of the august edition of sports illustrated calico joe the phenom i look at it and smile i remember the day it arrived in the mail i say we all do probably the greatest day in the towns history do folks around here still talk about joe seldom its been thirty years you know i cant recall the last conversation about him the eggs and bacon arrive the war wages not far away we eat quickly and i pay the check cashno credit card i dont want anyone to see my name clarence decides we should take his cara maroon buickbecause a strange vehicle with outofstate license plates might stir suspicion not surprisingly the buick smells like stale pipe tobacco airconditioning is not an option and we make the short drive with the windows down the high school is a mile or so from main street in a newer section of town i know that calico rock is too small for a football team so when i see lights i know the baseball field is close in the distance in center field a man is riding a turf mower thats him clarence says fall classes have yet to begin and the lots are empty we park near an old rodeo arena cross a street and approach the backstop from behind some bleachers we climb to the top row and settle into a spot shaded by the small press box the field is beautiful the bermuda grass is lush and green everything else is wilting under the august sun and drought but the turf of joe castle field is thick manicured and well irrigated the base paths and infield dirt are meticulously groomed the mound looks as though it has been hand sculpted a tenfootwide warning track of crushed limestone circles the entire playing surface and there is not a weed visible just beyond the chainlink fence in left center is a large scoreboard with joe castle field across the top and home of the pirates along the bottom joe is on a red spiderlike mower with various cutting decks and numerous blades a serious machine obviously built for playing surfaces he wears a black cap with the bill pulled low and glasses not surprisingly he has put on weight over the years hes here every day i ask five days a week its the middle of august there wont be another baseball game until what march middle of march if its not snowing so why does he cut the grass and prepare the field every day because he wants to its his job hes paid oh yes joe came home just before christmas of he spent two months in a hospital in new york then the cubs flew him to chicago where he spent several weeks in another hospital red and charlie drove him home in time for christmas he was talking about playing some more but we knew the truth just after the first of the year he had the stroke a massive one he was at home by himself and by the time they got him to the hospital in mountain home there was some damage his left side is partially paralyzed youll see when he walks does he know were up here yes he saw us park walk over find a seat he knows were talking about him its likely he will not get close enough to say hello and before the day is over either red or charlie probably charlie will call me and want to know what i was doing here and who i had with me ill tell him youre my nephew from texas a high school baseball coach who wanted to admire our field okay back to the story why is joe paid to take care of the field after the stroke it was obvious he was disabled and needed a job so the school system hired him as a custodian fulltime with health insurance and pension and for thirty years joe has been taken care of he works on the field putters around the gymnasium and when the baseball team has a game he sits up here in the press box and works the scoreboard what a great idea we take care of each other here in calico rock paul especially joe joe finishes a long sweeping cut from the right field foul line to the left then whirls around for another one the mower is close to the outfield warning track if the blades are actually clipping the bermuda i cannot detect it the uncut portion looks as pristine as the swath hes just finished what are you thinking clarence asks firing up his pipe again what could have been where would joe be now had it not been for the injury how great could he have been thatll drive you crazy i did it for years then realized its a waste of time the story of joe castle is nothing but a great tragedy its difficult to accept but after a while you try to move on is it a good idea for warren tracey to come here to meet with joe a long puff a large cloud of smoke the temperature has to be close to ninety already and i wonder how a person can enjoy smoking in such heat you know paul sitting here as we are it seems impossible that your father would show up shake hands with joe and talk about their past yes it does do you really think you can convince him to come im going to try clarence i think i can do it how blackmail joe turns for the final swipe at the outfield grass he has yet to look in our direction i dont suppose i want to get into that clarence says no you dont we watch and listen to the mower finally clarence says yes in my worthless opinion it would mean a lot to joe if warren tracey shook his hand and offered his apology the two have never spoken never met since that night it strikes me as a good idea but how in hell can you pull it off its a long shot clarence but i need your help i want you to speak to his brothers and clear it on this end otherwise im wasting my time joe parks in foul territory outside the left field line and turns off the mower he swings his right leg over braces himself and hops down he grabs a cane and shuffles toward a storage shed he walks with a pronounced limp with his left foot dragging behind his right foot advancing in stutter steps his shoulders dipping as he slowly moves forward that poor guy i say and a part of me feels like crying that beautiful young kid who could fly from home to first in under four seconds who stole second and third backtoback seven times in thirtyeight games who turned lazy singles into thrilling doubles that magnificent athlete with greatness emanating from every part of his game has been reduced to a crippled custodian who mows grass that does not need mowing just the thought of itwhen joe was thirty years old and should have been in the prime of a great career he was instead doing exactly what he is doing now very sad clarence adds joe disappears into the storage shed we probably wont see him again i guess we should leave as we return to main street clarence agrees to approach charlie and red and explore the idea of a meeting i repeat the obvious warren does not have long to live there is no time to waste we stop by the calico rock record where i find a cup of coffee it takes a while to say goodbye we have enjoyed our time together and sincerely hope we meet again soon leaving the town i have no idea if i will ever return four hours later i am in memphis i fly through atlanta on my way to tampa where i rent another car and drive east toward winter haven long after the police officer left my mother and i sat in the den and watched westerns the doors were bolted the shades were drawn every light in the house was on the officer promised to patrol our street and we were still afraid perhaps we should have dismissed the call as a prank by an irate cubs fan who found our number in the phone book but it felt much more serious than that we had never received such a threat and given the trauma and emotions of the night we were unable to shrug it off and go to sleep during a commercial my mother asked how did you know he was going to hit joe castle she was on one end of the sofa i was on the other both of us were still dressed because thats the way he plays baseball i replied why do they allow beanballs i dont know ive never heard a good reason such a stupid sport she said i didnt argue we were also afraid that warren might stagger home and cause trouble he had been forced off the field with a bloody nose so he wasnt badly injured in the brawl but if he wasnt home by am he wasnt coming home he was probably in a bar showing off his bruises bragging about his skills as a beanball artist and no doubt taking credit for the mets win i dozed off but at am my mother nudged me and said heres the news channel out of manhattan began the day at am with news weather and sports and they didnt waste time getting to the story a wild night at shea the reporter gushed as the footage rolled from a camera somewhere near the mets dugout the tape showed the beanball and joe going down again in slow motion and again as the reporter described it in detail he said that joe was in serious condition at mount sinai hospital in manhattan at least he was alive next up was the brawl and just as in real time it seemed to go on forever having been an eyewitness i had seen enough the entire episode made me sick and depressed and as i realized later it would turn me against the sport when the sun was up i walked to the end of the driveway and retrieved the new york times i glanced up and down the street to make sure everything was safe but at the time did not realize i would be looking over my shoulder for many months to come my mother sipped coffee and flipped through section a i of course read every word about the game and all of its related issues the front page of the sports section had two large photos the first was joe on the ground seconds after being hit and before the trainers crowded around him the second was a beautiful shot of razor ruffin flattening my father with a bruising tackle ruffin had no comment after the game nor did warren tracey yogi berra whitey lockman or any other player or coach there was little doubt though that the fighting was far from over the two teams squared off again at pm that afternoon the doctors at mount sinai werent saying much but joe was unconscious and in serious condition the phone rang and we both stared at it for a second i was closer so i slowly lifted the receiver hello an agitated voice yelled warren tracey is a dead man my mother quickly unplugged the phones the chicago newspapers were outraged beaned screamed the headline in the suntimes just above a photo of joe castle on the ground his helmet nearby the tribune was somewhat more restrained its headline read mets find way to stop castle midmorning saturday commissioner bowie kuhn met with his executives in the offices of major league baseball in new york city after reviewing the footage and talking to eyewitnesses he suspended razor ruffin and whitey lockman for ten games warren tracey for five and eight other players for three games each his office issued a banal statement wishing joe castle a speedy recovery shea was sold out again for the saturday game with many more cubs fans there and looking for trouble a smoke bomb landed near home plate just after the first pitch was thrown by tom seaver the game was delayed for fifteen minutes while the air cleared the mets fans booed the cubs fans cursed the atmosphere in the park was tense security was beefed up considerably and uniformed policemen stood almost shoulder to shoulder along the warning track joe had been hit by the third pitch thrown to the third batter in the third inning and with perfect coordination a wave of smoke bombs rained down on the field as tom seaver threw the third pitch to burt hooton the cubs starter in the top of the third inning fights broke out as mets fans attacked the bombers arrests were made the game was delayed for half an hour as warnings blared from the pa announcer an ugly situation was getting worse i tried to watch the game but could not i wanted to leave the house and hide at the sabbatinis for a few hours or a few days but then my mother would have been by herself so i stayed in my room turned the radio on and off and killed time when the mets were in town and my father was home i usually waited a couple of days before clipping articles from the sports page for my scrapbooks but i was bored and he wasnt home and i frankly did not care what he thought sitting at the kitchen table i carefully cut out the stories from the times then went to my closet where i kept a dozen scrapbooks photo albums and card collections i maintained these in a meticulous order and to my knowledge no one ever touched them but me because of the avalanche of stories and photos of joe castle and his historic debut i had reassembled all of his material into his very own scrapbook the only other players to be so honored were tom seaver willie mays hank aaron and catfish hunter the rest of the scrapbooks were collections of memorabilia articles and photos dedicated to entire teamsthe mets the mets the big red machine the oakland as and so on two years earlier i had opened a scrapbook dedicated to my father but there simply was not enough material to sustain it my joe castle scrapbook was missing i searched every inch of my closet and my room and when i was certain it was not there i stretched out on my bed and stared at the ceiling jill was away at camp and besides she wouldnt touch anything remotely related to baseball nor would my mother our home had a basement with a small washroom an even smaller utility room and a large game room with a television and a pool table from the game room there was a door that led to the backyard coming home at all hours of the early morning my father often crept into the game room and passed out on the narrow sofa sometimes he slept there when my parents were fighting sometimes they fought there away from jill and me often on the days when he pitched he would spend hours down there alone with the shades pulled and lights off lost in his own world he considered the game room to be his own private little territory and that was fine with the rest of us if he wanted it for himself we were happy to stay away i eased down the stairs flipping on lights in the game room i found my scrapbook on an end table next to the sofa it was open to the eightbyten photograph inscribed to me to paul tracey with best wishes joe castle next to the scrapbook was an orange mets stadium cup his cup the only cup from which he would drink his banana milk shake precisely six hours before his first pitch he had once flown into a rage and broken dishes in the kitchen when he couldnt find the damned cup i froze when i realized what i had discovered it was like walking into a crime scene and having a delayed reaction as the truth settled in alone and in the semidarkness the criminal had quietly plotted his actions then inadvertently left behind the evidence i backed away and went to find my mother we were both rattled frightened and tired and we decided to leave we packed our bags quickly locked the house and drove to hagerstown maryland to stay with her parents for a few days warren could have the house and the death threats and all the baggage and debris he so richly deserved i didnt realize it at the time and im not sure my mother did either but it was our first big step toward separation the mets won the second game of the series that saturday and did so without having to fight for it two pitchers were ejected for throwing at batters and both teams were itching for another brawl but with so many players suspended the issue of winning games became more important than winning beanball wars baseball waited for joe to wake up to snap out of it put some ice on his wounds return to the stadium and continue to dazzle and set records but as of sunday morning he was still in a coma the mets won sunday and on monday night completed a fourgame sweep the cubs had roared into new york with a tengame lead and they limped out of town reeling and already feeling the pressure of another lateseason collapse they had won twentyeight of the thirtyeight games in which joe had played but they were obviously a different team without him on august warren tracey started at shea against the pirates he gave up a single to the leadoff hitter then walked the next two with the bases loaded he hit willie stargell in the ribs it was not intentional but nonetheless stargell didnt appreciate being hit especially by a pitcher who was by then the most notorious headhunter in the game he said something to my father as he slowly walked to first base and for a moment things were tense the umpires on high alert jumped in and prevented trouble his next pitch was a fastball down the middle and richie hebner hit it four hundred feet for a grand slam by the time yogi could get him out of the game the pirates were up with no outs four days later on september labor day my father walked to the mound at busch stadium in st louis and was met with a thunderous round of boos and hisses he lasted two innings walked four struck out none hit no one gave up five runs and was rapidly pitching himself out of the rotation the new york sportswriters were howling for his replacement with joe castle still unconscious in a new york hospital warren tracey was hated everywhere he went his name was toxic his pitching was a disaster his teammates were winning but they were also tired of the distractions he brought to the game it was obvious he wasnt worth the trouble he was causing after his first two or three wives warren began marrying for money instead of looks and lust one of his later ones florence died from heatstroke and left him with a nice home and some cash in the bank he isnt rich but comfortable enough to avoid work and spend his days at the club playing gin rummy and golf and drinking when he was about fiftyfive roughly ten years ago his then wife karen i believe convinced him to sober up and stop smoking to his credit he did though the damage to his body had been done poor karen she soon realized he was far more agreeable on the sauce than off they divorced and never solo for long he took up with agnes the current wife they live in one of those typical florida gated communities with rows of lowslung modern houses tucked along fairways and ponds and around putting greens everyone is over sixty and drives a golf cart on the subject of golf as soon as his baseball career ended warren plunged headlong into what he hoped would be a new career on the tour he hooked up with a pro somewhere near sarasota and played and practiced for hours every day he was thirtyfive and the odds were against him but he felt as though he had nothing to lose he qualified for the citrus circuit a lowbudget south florida tour sort of like class b minorleague baseball he won his second tournament and got his name in the fine print of the miami herald someone saw it that someone told others and a rough plan came together at the next tournament just as warren was about to hit his first tee shot a pack of cubs diehards began jeering and cursing him he stepped away exchanged words and waited for an official to intervene such tournaments though are not heavily secured or supervised and the hooligans refused to go away when his first tee shot landed in a small lake the cubs fans cheered and howled they followed him from hole to hole on the front nine and he fell to pieces the concentration of a golfer is fragilewitness the strict rules regarding fan behavior at a pga event warren though was far from the pga and the citrus circuit could do little to control what few fans showed up they stalked warren tracey and wherever he played they waited in ambush in one tournament he birdied the first three holes in silence then was verbally assaulted by several large belligerent young men as he approached the tee box on number four his scores continued to rise along with his blood pressure and when he shot an in the second round of his fifth tournament he quit evidently there are a lot of cubs fans in florida and over the years warren had a number of runins with them on golf courses he also had fights in bars stores and airports and for a long time he traded in cash and avoided credit cards he once got screwed out of in a condo deal by two men who were cubs fans and deliberately suckered him into the transaction the surname tracey is not that common and for years after the beaning it meant trouble for warren the ancient security guard clears me through the gate it is early evening and couples are biking and walking for exercise along the footpaths next to the winding street the golf course is deserted everything is green and wellgroomed according to my research the home was appraised at and had been purchased by warren and agnes five years earlier i didnt keep records but it must be the fifteenth place he has lived in florida in the past thirty years i suppose warren is the restless type he tires quickly of wives and homes i have not seen him in four years sara and i did the obligatory disney world trip with the girls and for some reason i thought it was important for the kids to at least meet their paternal grandfather what a disaster he did not want us in his home nor did he want us to meet agnes so we met for lunch at a chain restaurantwinks wafflesnot far from his gated community and he struggled to be civil he had not met my children before and warren in the role of grandfather was a pathetic sight he was a stranger to the girls to sara and to me as well and he could not have been more uncomfortable saras parents live in pueblo colorado and we see them several times a year they adore their granddaughters and are as involved in their lives as possible so the girls had a clear idea of what a grandfather should be warren though completely baffled them he was unsure of their names thoroughly uninterested in small talk and showed no warmth whatsoever because he had neither the desire nor the ability and when he glanced at his watch thirty minutes into the little family reunion it was noticed by all of us afterward i promised sara and the girls that they would never again be subjected to my father i knew they approved of this decision later once we were home the girls told their mother that they felt sorry for me they could not comprehend how a nice guy like their dad could have such a lousy father parked on the cobblestoned driveway is a mercedes that is at least fifteen years old i ring the doorbell and agnes eventually answers this is our first facetoface meeting it will be brief neither she nor i want to spend ten seconds together she is the latest victim in a long sad list of vulnerable and desperate women who out of loneliness or some other unfathomable reason agreed to marry warren tracey as i follow her through the foyer i wonder how many husbands she has been through but i really dont care warren is in the den watching television some breed of delicate little lapdog on the sofa next to him he rises quickly manages a smile and offers a hand as i shake it i am impressed by his appearance his skin is pale his movements slow but for a dying man he looks remarkably healthy he mutes the television but does not turn it off nothing he does regardless of how rude surprises me i back into a chair while agnes sits on the sofa next to the dog ill get rid of her in a minute we kill some time talking about his surgery and i feign interest next its the chemotherapy which will start in a week im gonna beat this thing paul he says a wellrehearsed line delivered with no conviction he seems to think i care he seems to believe i have traveled from new mexico to florida because i am concerned about him there is no doubt in my mind that if i were hospitalized and on my deathbed warren tracey would find an excuse not to show up why then does he think i am interested in his chemo why over the years ive learned the answer hes special he played the game maybe he didnt put up hall of fame numbers but he was still one of the elite who made it to the big stage his entire life has been lived in his own little selfabsorbed narcissistic world where he is a cut above the rest i feed him quarters and keep him talking how long will the chemotherapy last what do the doctors really think i know a guy whose uncle lived fifteen years with pancreatic cancer is more surgery a possibility he does not ask about my wife my daughters his daughter or her children as usual its all about warren agnes whos a little on the chunky side and easily as old as warren just sits there rubbing the dog and grinning goofily at warren as if his narratives are witty and original it doesnt take much to amuse agnes i decide after ten minutes i wonder if it has crossed her mind that in virtually all polite circles she as the hostess is expected to offer me something to drink i look at her and say say agnes i have a few things i need to discuss with warren in private you know family stuff rather personal could the two of us have a few minutes she does not like this at all but warren smiles and nods his head at the door she huffs out of the den closing the door behind her i reach over take the remote turn off the television sit back down and say guess who i saw this morning warren how should i know always the smartass right always yes joe castle thats who i was in calico rock yesterday afternoon and last night and this morning i saw joe i suppose you were just passing through no not at all i went there for the purpose of seeing him his shoulders sag a little as the air gets heavier i am staring at him but he has found something on the floor to hold his gaze a minute passes then another he finally grunts and says something you want to say i move closer to him and sit on the edge of the coffee table two feet away i realize how little sympathy i have for this dying old man there is far more anger than pity but i promised myself i would not visit our past i want you to go see joe warren now before its too late before you pass away before he passes away there will never be another time like now go sit down with him offer a hand offer the truth offer an apology at least attempt to close this story he frowns as if in severe pain he looks at me as his mouth falls open and for a while he cannot speak im serious warren you have lied for thirty years about what happened but you and i both know the truth for once in your miserable life stand up and admit youre wrong apologize youve never reached out to him you would never face him you would never face the truth quite the opposite youve lied and lied and lied until you probably believe your own lies stop the lying tell joe the truth and tell him youre sorry you got a lot of guts coming here with this crap he snarls i have far more guts than you old man if you had a backbone you would go see him ill go with you well make the journey together and when its over youll feel a lot better about yourself arent you the wise one i am on this matter anyway his pale face has reddened with anger but he holds his tongue another minute passes what did you say to him he asks nothing we didnt speak i saw him from a distance he walks with a bad limp and a cane thanks to you i did not intend to hit him i raise both hands and laugh here we go again the biggest lie in the history of organized baseball and whats worse everyone knows its a lie including both of us get out of my house i will in a minute lets face the truth warren you wont make it to christmas the odds are heavily against you when you die those who know you are not going to say things like good ole warren he loved his kids or good ole warren what a generous soul or warren truly loved his wives nothing like that warren because it doesnt fit the one thing that will be mentioned in your obituary if you have one at all is the fact that you threw the most famous beanball in the history of the game and in doing so you deliberately destroyed one of the most promising careers of all time thats what theyre gonna say warren and you cant do a thing about it please leave ill be happy to leave warren just let me finish you can never undo the misery you createdthe neglected kids the tormented son the abused wife the alcoholism the philandering the long trail of debris youve left behind cant fix it warren even if you are so inclined which im sure you are not but there is one person you can reach out to and perhaps make his life a little brighter do it warren do it for joe do it for yourself do it for me youve lost your mind i reach into my jacket and remove some folded papers i want you to read this warren its titled the beaning of joe castle by paul tracey son of warren i wrote it many years ago and ive revised it a thousand times every word is true my plans are to get it published as soon as possible after your death ill start with sports illustrated baseball monthly the newspapers in chicago not sure after that but ill bet somebody will want to print it i dont want a dime i want the truth to be known i drop the papers onto his lap the only way to prevent this from being published is to go with me to calico rock and see joe blackmail you got it warren oldfashioned blackmail but for a good reason i toss a business card onto the sofa and say im at the best western down the road if you want to talk ill meet you at your favorite spot winks waffles at nine in the morning he was scratching his forehead when i left the room i did not see agnes on the way out i check into the best western call home and chat with sara then head downstairs to find something to eat the restaurant is empty and uninviting but there are a few salesmen swapping stories over drinks in a lounge i choose a table order a sandwich and a glass of tea and notice a television in a corner the cubs are playing the mets with the sound on mute i stare at it the first baseball game ive watched in thirty years on september warren tracey started against the padres in san diego he walked two in the first inning but got out of trouble with a basesloaded double play he walked two more in the second then gave up backtoback doubles on the air ralph kiner referred to his pitching as batting practice by the time yogi berra pulled him the padres had a fiverun lead and two runners on and the mets who had won eight of their last ten were in trouble in his last three starts warren had completed just three innings given up seventeen runs on twelve hits walked thirteen and had an era that approached triple figures since hitting castle he had lost his ability to throw inside and every hitter in the national league knew it the new york sportswriters and fans were screaming for his head and it was obvious the mets had to do something the team was winning with the exception of warren and there was open speculation about who would replace him in the rotation and there was more pressure on september the mets were scheduled to arrive in chicago for a threegame series and there was an excellent chance that the sight of warren tracey on the field at wrigley would lead to bloodshed the death threats were pouring into the mets home office in anonymous letters to the editors to the homes of some of the mets players the chicago sportswriters were speculating about how dangerous wrigley would be if the mets were foolish enough to put tracey on the mound commissioner bowie kuhn was watching the situation closely on september three weeks after the beaning the mets released warren tracey of course my father did not call home with the news that he had been cut from the roster that would have required some maturity and courage on his part the mets were in la and as i tuned in for the pregame show i heard lindsey nelson and ralph kiner talking about the decision by the mets front office to get rid of warren tracey he had pitched himself out of a job and they spent some time recapping his season and career a month earlier he had a record of seven and seven and was pitching effectively but since the castle incident he had been a disaster i could hear the relief in the voices of nelson and kiner no one traveling with the mets wanted to go into wrigley the following day with warren tracey around my mother was playing tennis at a club a few blocks away i decided that she should hear the news that her husband was suddenly out of work and the sooner the better i rode my bike over watched her play from a distance and when she finished i caught her as she was leaving the court she took it hard not only was he cut from the team but at thirtyfour his career was surely over i had no idea how much money they had saved if any though my mother kept a pretty tight budget and now that he had nothing to do he would spend more time at home a prospect that none of us looked forward to our little world was unraveling my father was out of work and over the hill he was drinking more staying out more and fighting more with my mother who was dropping hints about a new life one without him we had changed our phone number twice because of the anonymous calls and now had a private number it was not unusual to see a police car parked in front of our home we were frightened the cubs won two of the three games against the mets there were no fights no beanballs and no ejections when the series began the teams were tied for first in the national league east and with fifteen games to go no one could afford another suspension or injury without joe in the lineup the cubs had won eleven and lost thirteen their tengame lead three weeks earlier had been reduced to one they were sinking chicago style while the mets were winning to cubs fans the beaning of joe castle had been a deliberate attack planned by the mets to get him off the field so their team would falter in warren tracey the mets had the perfect attack doga journeyman headhunter who could do the dirty work and then get thrown out with the trash seaver koosman and matlack could stay above it all this was not just idle chatter from drunks in a bar many of chicagos sportswriters were now conspiracy theorists and fanning these flames there was still a fervent though fading dream that joe would snap out of his coma hop off the bed hustle out of the hospital and take up where he left off but with each passing day the sad reality settled in a bit deeper wait till next year the cubs were famous for saying but now they meant it wait till next year when joes back and hes a year older and more experienced just wait on september the day after the series ended and the mets moved on to montreal joe castle woke up and spoke to a nurse this was reported on the local station and my mother heard it first she told me and i rode over to tom sabbatinis to discuss this exciting news mr sabbatini knew what i was going through and he offered to take us to the hospital the following saturday after school the next day i went to the library and read the coverage in the tribune and suntimes joe was still in serious condition but at least he was awake talking and eating red was by his side and agreed to allow a reporter from the tribune inside the room for ten minutes the reporter asked joe how he felt and his response was i have felt much better he was described as sedated groggy and not always responsive to questions there was a photograph a heartbreaking picture of joe castle with his head wrapped in thick gauze much like a casualty from combat his right eye was covered too the eye was of grave concern to his doctors mount sinai had been deluged with cards flowers gifts and visitors wanting to see joe a temporary shrine had been set up in a wide open foyer on the ground floor in the center there was a large photo of joethe same one from the cover of sports illustratedand to each side were long wide panels of corkboard hundreds of fans had tacked on notes cards and letters to joe at the foot of the panels were cardboard boxes filled with flowers chocolates and other gifts tom and i wrote letters though we didnt share them before they were sealed in envelopes in an effort to get joes attention my letter began with dear joe i am paul tracey warrens son i am so sorry for what my father did i went on to gush about how closely i had followed his career how great i thought he was and how badly i wanted him to get better and return to the field saturday morning we took the train into the city it was a beautiful fall day the leaves were turning and blowing in the breeze as we strolled through central park when we entered the hospital from fifth avenue a handpainted sign read joe castle wall and an arrow pointed to the left we found the wall and tacked our letters side by side as close to his photo as possible a volunteer explained that the letters cards and gifts were collected every two or three days and would be given to mr castle at some convenient time in the future she thanked us for coming where is he i asked she looked up and said fourth floor but im afraid you cant go there hows he doing today ive heard hes improving she said and she was right according to the newspapers he was slowly making progress but a dramatic comeback seemed doubtful we hung around for a few minutes looking at the assortment of letters cards and gifts i glanced up and down the wide corridors in the distance all busy with the typical hospital foot traffic i was tempted to drift away find the elevators and somehow make my way to the fourth floor where i could cleverly sneak into joes room for a private chat but good judgment prevailed mr sabbatini grew up on the lower east side and knew the city like a cabdriver he was also a yankees fan a pleasant one he had tickets and we rode the subway to the bronx to the house that ruth built and spent that beautiful afternoon watching the yankees with thurman munson graig nettles and bobby murcer play the orioles with brooks robinson boog powell and paul blair tom and i decided that we had been narrowminded in the selection of the national league as our only potential home we discussed the possibility of also playing for a team in the american league mr sabbatini agreed that this was wise on our part something was different though my dreams were not as clear and exciting my love for the game was not as deep i joked along with tom as we discussed which american league teams would be acceptable we evaluated the important factorsuniform colors stadium size winning tradition great players from the past and so onbut it was not as much fun as it had been a month earlier mr sabbatini listened and laughed and offered his advice he was an exceptionally nice person generous with his time and always kind with his comments he seemed especially concerned about me he understood the earthquakes and aftershocks that were rattling my world and he wanted me to know that he was in my corner i walk into winks waffles at and ask for a table by the window the place is full of seniors consuming far too many calories thanks to the latest coupon scheme devised to attract those over sixtyfive the hostess is reluctant to seat me where i want to be seated so i inform her that im expecting at least three others this works and i get my table which as i recall is very near the one we had four years ago when my girls met their paternal grandfather for the first and last time i drink coffee read the newspaper and watch the parking lot at a golf cart appears from the path next to the restaurant its warren alone he parks in a row of other carts stands slowly and stretches his back then walks with the careful movements you would expect of a man who is recuperating from a nasty surgery sick as he is there is still the unmistakable walk of an old man who was once a great athlete head high chest up a trace of a swagger hes holding sheets of paper no doubt my little memoir about his beanball i wave him over and he joins me no handshake no smile his eyes are red and puffy as if sleep eluded him he opens with a pleasant you cant print this piece of shit well good morning warren sleep well you heard me i can and will warren why the crude language hit a bit too close to home surely youre not calling it a pack of lies its a pack of lies the waitress appears and he orders coffee when shes gone he says what are you trying to prove nothing what im trying to do is force you to face the consequences for one of the few times in your life arent you the wise one im not trying to be wise warren you have a lot of unfinished business in your life and this is one loose end you can wrap up before youre gone im not going anywhere im fighting this thing tooth and nail and my doctors know a hell of a lot more than you do i am not going to argue about whether he is dying if he thinks he is in the lucky percent who will live for five years i am in no position to say otherwise his coffee arrives and the waitress asks about the others who might be joining us its just the two of us i say are you ready to order sure i guess i should have a waffle blueberry with sausage nothing for me he says gruffly waving her away who do you think will print this crap he asks do you read sports illustrated no theres a senior writer there named jerry kilpatrick baseball is his favorite beat a chicago guy my age ive talked to him twice and hes interested in the story and the truth joe castle will never be forgotten in chicago and kilpatrick thinks the story would be great especially after youre gone you dont know the truth he growls we both know it warren he sips his coffee and gazes out the window finally he says you have no idea what youre talking about you dont know the game are you talking about the code warren the little unwritten rules of baseball one of which says that beanballs must be used to number one get guys off the plate or number two retaliate when one of your players gets hit or number three put a guy in his place if he shows up the pitcher i cant remember numbers four and five is that what youre talking about warren because if it is then youre dead wrong because joe didnt crowd the plate nobody was throwing at your hitters and joe did nothing to show you up you wanted to hit him in the head because you envied his success and you liked to hit players and start trouble and well i dont know warren what was your reason for the beanball you used it so often maybe you realized you couldnt get him out so you hit him in the head was that it warren youre clueless okay then explain things to me warren why do you have no regrets about intentionally hitting joe castle in the face its part of the game sort of like the football player who breaks his neck or blows out a knee never to play again the boxer with brain damage the race car driver whos killed in a crash the skier who falls off a mountain its sports okay bad things happen and when they do you dont run around crying and apologizing and trying to make everything okay thats not the game as i knew it i will not bicker i could blow holes in his twisted logic for the next hour and gain nothing we take a break and listen to the chatter around us alone the two of us for the first time in decades in fact i cant remember the last time i was alone with my father ive seen him half a dozen times since he abandoned us and only a couple of those little meetings were his idea there is so much i would like to say none of it pleasant and i battle the urge to unload a lifetimes worth of debris but i promised myself i would not beat him up given his attitude at the moment i doubt if warren tracey would sit still during a round of verbal abuse hes still a fighter the waitress delivers the waffle a thick dessertlike creation smothered in whipping cream i take a bite of link sausage something sara would never consider buying and dive back into our little session so finally after thirty years youre admitting you deliberately hit joe im really hesitant to say anything to you because you might add it to your little short story here since youre divulging family matters anyway i dont trust you fair enough you have my word that anything you say here today will not be included still dont trust you im not going to argue such things as trust and responsibility warren why did you throw at joe castle he was a cocky kid and i didnt like what he did to dutch patton dutch and i played together in cleveland he was not a cocky kid no more so than any other major leaguer and you did not play with dutch patton in cleveland dutch never played for the indians i take a small bite of a large waffle without taking my eyes off him his mouth drops open and his eyes glow as if he might throw a punch suddenly he grimaces and exhales as a jolt of pain shoots through his midsection i forgot what hes going through are you okay i ask im fine you dont look fine ill be all right im thinking about playing golf tomorrow i appreciate the change in subjects we talk about golf for a few minutes and the mood lightens considerably then it darkens again when i realize he has played golf since he was six years old he won the maryland open when he was seventeen and he has never played a single round with me i understand the dna thing but the man across the table is nothing but my biological father nothing more i make quick work of the waffle and sausage and slide the platter away you were trying to explain why you beaned joe i dont think we finished that part of the conversation youre so damned smart why dont you explain it he snaps angrily oh i know warren ive known for a long time there were several reasons you wanted to hit joe all twisted and pretty sick but as you say that was your game you resented his success and the attention he was getting in your warped mind he showed you up after he hit his home run in the first inning you wanted to be the first tough guy to hit him in the head you loved hitting people and starting trouble and you were envious because i along with countless other little boys in the summer of worshipped joe castle you had slapped me around you were trying to make amends trying to be my hero and you couldnt stand the thought of me dreaming of becoming some other player all of the above and probably more but thats enough i dont have access to your thoughts thank god so it was all about you i didnt say that warren only you know why you did it the sick part is that you cant admit it youve lied for thirty years and never had the spine to admit what you did this sounds much harsher than i want it to be his shoulders sag a little and there are tiny beads of sweat on his forehead he pinches his nose and almost under his breath says im sorry i slapped you around paul i roll my eyes in frustration and want to curse youve apologized a hundred times for that warren im not here because of the slapping im not here to dredge up your deficiencies as a father i buried those a long time ago with a paper napkin he wipes the sweat from his face his skin has lost what little color it had he takes a sip of coffee and stares at me in a voice that is suddenly weak and raspy he says i threw at joe but i swear i didnt mean to hurt him i was waiting for this one of baseballs greatest lies one of the lamest excuses in the history of sports i shake my head in disbelief and say gee what a surprise the same asinine copout pitchers have been using for a hundred years so let me get this straight warren you deliberately throw a fastball at a batters face at ninety or perhaps ninetyfive miles an hour from sixty feet away a distance that gives him less than a second to react with the intent the goal the dream to see the ball hit him somewhere above the neck and knock him to the ground preferably in a state of unconsciousness if they carry him off no big deal if he misses a few games no big deal yet when the beanball actually does serious damage you can hide behind the old faithful gosh i didnt mean to hurt him cant you see how utterly ridiculous this is warren you sound like a fool for saying it again i am aware that this sounds too harsh but im fighting anger right now he drops his head nods at something then looks through the window there is a crowd of seniors waiting around the front door the hostess keeps looking our way i think she wants our table but im in no hurry he finally mumbles it was just part of the game your game maybe i shoot back but then you were a headhunter i was not then why did you throw at their heads why didnt you throw at joes thigh or hip or ribs anything below the shoulder thats what the code says right warren the code says sometimes you have to hit a guyi understand that but the code also says you never throw at a guys head but you were a tough guy werent you warren you wanted to hit joe in the head im bored with this conversation what do you want paul lets take a trip together go to calico rock you can sit down with joe and shake hands say what you want to say have a long chat about the game about life whatever ill be there joe has a couple of brothers who take care of him im sure theyll be there it will mean a lot to joe and his family i promise you warren you will not regret doing this lets close this chapter now he picks up my story and says and if i dont then youll get this published after im gone thats the plan i reply doubting now that the blackmail was a good opening strategy quickly he rips it in two tosses it at me and says go ahead ill be dead hes on his feet and working his way through the crowd at the front door moving nicely for an old sick man he gets in the golf cart grips the wheel and pauses as if hes hit with another sharp pain he gazes into the distance waiting deep in thought and for a second i think that maybe he has changed his mind then he drives away and i am certain i will never see him again on september the doctors released a statement about joes condition because of the trauma to the optic nerve joe had lost at least percent of the vision in his right eye and the loss was permanent the probability of joe playing again was in their opinion extremely low the news broke the hearts of cubs fans their annual wait till next year suddenly lost all of its promise and excitement the greatest prospect in their long frustrated history would never play again it also crushed the spirits of the players joes teammates were struggling without him and the news from new york was devastating later that afternoon they were blown out by the braves and they would lose the next three falling two games behind the mets who were winning and on the verge of clinching the national league east the mets would go on to beat the reds for the pennant and do so without a player hitting over or a pitcher winning twenty games in the second coming of the miracle mets they pushed the as to seven games before losing the world series the miraculous yet tragic career of joe castle came to an end his numbers were mindbogglingin thirtyeight games he had at bats seventyeight hits twentyone home runs twentyone doubles eight triples thirtyone stolen bases and fortyone rbis his batting average of was the highest ever but would not be entered into the record books because he didnt play enough other records would stand the first rookie to hit three home runs in his first game the first rookie to hit safely in his first nineteen games the first rookie to steal a base in nine consecutive games the first rookie to steal second and third in seven different games and his most famous fifteen consecutive hits in fifteen at bats he tied several other rookie records including four hits in his first game but on september his numbers meant little to him and his fans my father eventually came home after being released by the mets and during the first family dinner he tried to appear upbeat about his future supposedly several teams were interested in him for the season negotiations were under way deals being offered we listened and pretended to believe him but we knew the truth in an effort to stay busy he painted the inside of the garage installed new gutters worked on his car and seemed to be making plans to live there for a long time my mother was playing a lot of tennis and secretly looking for a job i came home from school one afternoon and as usual planned to leave as soon as possible and hustle down the street to the sabbatinis my father was in the den watching television and when i walked through he said say paul you got time for a catch i need to keep my arm loose as bad as i wanted to say no i couldnt do it sure i had vowed to never again toss a baseball with my father an open area where we had a small backstop and a wooden home plate he grabbed me by the arm and said first of all dont ever ignore me again like that you hear me im your father and i know a thousand times more baseball than those clowns who call themselves coaches i tried to pull away but he dug in with fingernails he was getting angrier with each passing second you hear me dont ever ignore me again yes sir i said but only to keep from getting hit he let go and put his finger under my chin look at me he snarled look me in the eyes when im talking to you theres a right way and a wrong way to play this game and you got it all wrong never i repeat never let a hitter show you up like that at any level of the game i dont care if youre eight years old or playing in the world series never let a hitter show you up like that this is how you handle that type of an asshole get up there i took the bat and got in a stance at home plate he backed away maybe fifty feet he was wearing his glove and he had three baseballs in it i was an elevenyearold kid without a batting helmet facing a pitcher for the mets one who was not only angry but in the process of teaching me the crude art of hitting a batter the code says hes getting hit okay so the next time he prances his cocky ass up to the plate its your job to hit him same as if one of your guys got plunked then you gotta protect your team are you listening to me yes sir i do it with three pitches some guys go right at them and hit them with the first pitch i dont do that because most batters are looking for it on the first pitch i set them up my first pitch is a fastball a foot outside he took a windup and threw a fastball a foot outside it wasnt full speed but then i wasnt fully grown the pitch looked awfully fast to me dont step out he growled second pitch same as the first another windup another fastball a foot outside now this is when you nail the son of a bitch hes leaning in a little thinking im picking at the outside corner so hes not thinking about getting drilled im not gonna hit you in the head so dont step out okay dig in paul like a real player i was terrified and couldnt move he took his windup and threw the ball at me not high and not as hard as he could but when the ball hit my thigh it hurt like hell and i think i screamed he was yelling see youre gonna survive thats how you do it two fastballs away then you hit the bastard preferably in the head he scurried around and picked up the three baseballs while i rubbed my thigh and tried not to cry give me the bat and get your glove he said i was now the pitcher and he was at the plate two fastballs outside lets go i delivered the first one in the grass and three feet off the plate you gotta hit the catchers mitt paul come on damn it he snarled as he waved the bat like a real hitter his career batting average was i threw the second pitch outside and higher now he said taking a step toward me drill me right here he tapped the side of his head stick it in my ear paul he was back at the plate in his stance stick it in my ear you cant throw hard enough to hurt me i was forty feet away gripping the baseball wanting desperately to throw a pitch that would knock out his teeth spill blood fracture his skull and lay him out flat on the grass i kicked high delivered and the ball went straight down the middle of the plate a perfect strike as it bounced off the backstop he picked it up threw it back to me and said come on you little chickenshit hit me with the damned baseball i threw another fastball one that was higher but still over the plate this made him even angrier and after retrieving the ball he fired it back it was getting dark he threw the ball much too hard it glanced off the webbing of my glove and hit me in the chest i shrieked and started crying and before i realized it he was in my face yelling if you dont take this ball and hit me in the head im gonna beat your ass you understand as he stomped to the plate i glanced at the house upstairs jill was peeking out her bedroom window my third effort at beaning him was as unsuccessful as the first two the pitch was high and inside but not close enough to do the damage i wanted to show his disgust he reached out with his left hand and caught the pitch barehanded what an insult to a pitcher but then i really didnt care i just wanted to get away from this madman he flung the bat toward the house and came after me youre a coward you know that paul nothing but a coward it takes guts to throw at batters but a pitcher has to do it not in little league i managed to say in every league i guess i was too small to punch so he slapped me across the face with the back of his left hand protecting of course his pitching hand i screamed and fell down and just as he grabbed me by the collar i heard my mother yell get away from him warren she was standing ten feet away holding the baseball bat something she had probably never done before in her life and aiming its barrel at my father jill was hiding behind her for a few seconds no one moved then seeing the opportunity i crawled away put the bat down he said you hit him in the face she said what kind of animal are you he hit him with the baseball too jill added shut up he snarled a few more seconds passed as everyone took a breath we slowly made our way inside each carefully watching the other my parents went to the basement and fought for a long time and when they got tired he left excerpt from the beaning of joe castle by paul tracey son of warren killing time in the atlanta airport i call clarence rook it has been slightly more than twentyfour hours since i said goodbye to him but it seems like a month youll never guess who called me last night he says charlie or red charlie said he got a call from joe who said i showed up at the field with a stranger and he was just checking in to make sure everythings okay thats what charlie always saysclarence everything okay i said sure charlie just a nephew from texas who wanted to see the field why didnt you tell him the truth i ask well i did later i got to thinking about it chatted with fay and so i called charlie back said i had something important to discuss with him and red and could we meet for coffee we did this morning at a quieter place north of town i told them all about you your visit and so on he stops talking and this is not a good sign let me guess they did not weep with sorrow at the news that warren tracey has terminal cancer they did not a pause another bad sign and the idea of him coming to calico rock to meet with joe how was that received not very well at least not at first in fact they didnt like the idea of you being here will they shoot me if i return no they warmed up considerably even promised to talk to joe and see if he likes the idea i pushed a little but its really none of my business what about the meeting with your father i decide to spin it i got the door open i think we had some frank discussions a lot of old family stuff nothing you want to hear the problem is that he is in denial about his cancer and until he faces the prospect of death he will be hard to persuade poor guy maybe but i could not reach the point where i actually felt sorry for him i ask about fay and the conversation runs out of gas an hour later i board the flight to dallas sara and the girls are waiting with a late dinner when i finally get home the girls have no idea where i have been or what ive been doing so we talk about the weekend we are about to spend camping in the mountains sara though is curious after were finished and the girls are gone i replay the trip as we clear the table whats next she asks i have no idea i might wait a couple of weeks and call warren ask about his chemo maybe bring up joe again whats your favorite saying dear didnt get halfway didnt get halfway to first base yep that pretty well sums up my little visit with warren hes still the tough guy and he could take it to his grave probably will are you glad you went yes very much so i got a glimpse of joe castle and hes doing as well as possible i guess i got to see warren which doesnt mean much now but it could seem important one day and most important i had a glass of ozark peach brandy whats that moonshine they serve it with dinner no its strictly an afterdinner drink at least in the rook household clarence called it a digestif what does it taste like liquid fire sounds delicious any other excitement not really are you going to call jill not tonight maybe later i doubt if she wants to hear about warren a week later i leave the office for lunch and drive to a cityowned multifield complex where most of my friends have coached their sons in the various youth leagues but for a few groundskeepers the place is empty the season is over i climb the bleachers of the big field as it is known a regulationsize diamond with a center field wall four hundred feet away i sit in the shade below the press box and eat a chicken wrap it is august thirty years ago tonight i was sitting with my mother in shea stadium watching my hero joe castle walk to the plate to face my father i slowly recall those images and again hear the sound of joe being struck the horror the chaos the fear the ambulance then the fighting and the aftermath his skull was cracked in three places his cheekbone was broken he was bleeding from his ears and the doctors at first thought he was dead that time and place seem so far away now the beanball ended two careers and im not sure what it did to me it broke the hearts of millions of people so i wasnt the only one wounded but i was the only one aside from my parents who knew joe was about to get drilled in the head i wonder if joe is marking the anniversary is he doing what i am doingsitting alone in a ballpark remembering the tragedy and longing for what could have been somewhere in his altered state does he look back with bitterness at what happened i certainly would thirty years later and i still get choked up thinking about the needless injury and the ending of a beautiful career i suspect this date means nothing to warren tracey he is probably on the golf course he dismissed the beanball decades ago its sports bad things happen after lunch is finished i sit and try to think of some way to put the story of joe castle behind me i finally admit that im not sure that will ever happen two weeks pass the girls return to school and i get lost in my work our normal happy life resumes and i slowly forget about the idea of a reunion in calico rock the phone rings one night and rebecca our tenyearold answers it she runs into the den and says dad its some man named warren wants to talk to you sara and i look at each other neither can remember the last time warren called our home whos warren rebecca asks your grandfather sara says as i head to the kitchen the call has no purpose as far as i can tell his voice is scratchy and weak and he informs me that chemotherapy is not pleasant he has no appetite so hes losing weight along with his hair agnes drives him to the hospital twice a week for the infusions which take two hours each in a depressing room with a dozen other cancer patients hooked up to their drips he stuns me by asking hows the family and when sara walks through the kitchen and hears me talking about our children she is shocked he informs me that he called jill a few hours earlier but no one answered the phone warren tracey is calling his children he must be dying i check in with clarence rook once a week but these conversations get shorter and shorter there is not much news in calico rock and i am not sure how he fills up a newspaper every wednesday i call warren occasionally not really out of a deep concern over his health but more to remind him that i am still around and i want something we never discuss joe castle in the second week of october i am in the middle of a meeting with my boss and colleagues when my cell phone vibrates at my company it is not a crime for a cell phone call to disrupt something important i step into the hall and say hello to agnes warren is in the hospital internal bleeding low blood pressure fainting spells the doctors just completed another scan and the cancer has spread rapidly tumors are everywhereliver kidneys stomach and worst of all the brain he has lost forty pounds she believes warren is finally accepting the fact that cancer will kill him what am i supposed to say i dont know this woman and i hardly know her husband i offer a few halfbaked sympathies and promise to call tomorrow i do but go straight to voice mail three days later i am driving home from work when warren calls my cell he says he is back home feels much better has changed doctors because the old ones were idiots and has a fighting chance of beating his cancer at the beginning of the brief conversation he sounds alert chipper full of energy but he cannot maintain the ruse by the end his voice is fading and his diction is not as sharp i go through my short list of things to say and i am ready to finish the call when he says say paul ive been thinking about that trip to arkansas oh really i say avoiding any trace of excitement yes i like the idea not sure my doctors will approve of me traveling but lets give it a try sure warren ill make some calls the worst part will be the long drive just me and warren in the car with so much history to cover and no desire to go there our flights take us to little rock and i arrive two hours before him i eat lunch kill time work on my laptop and find a spot to observe the arriving passengers its a small airport with lots of open spaces natural light and not too much traffic according to our last phone call his doctors said no to the trip and this only heightened his determination he finally admitted the cancer is now in control of things and he has stopped chemo i doubt if ill make it to christmas paul he said as if the holidays meant something to him christmas when i was eight he was playing winter ball in venezuela and was a noshow at christmas jill and i opened gifts near the tree and my mother could not stop crying i wonder if warren remembers all the things i remember he appears in a crowd with other passengers from atlanta hes wearing a cap because he has no hair and he walks with a slow but determined step he has shriveled into a small man with a girlish waistline and sunken chest hes rolling a small carryon behind him and hes looking around for me i almost rented a hybrid for environmental reasons but realized we would be shoulder to shoulder for hours instead were in a large suv with as much room as possible between the two front seats not much is said until little rock is behind us he has aged ten years in two months and i understand why his doctors said no to the trip he nods off repeatedly and for a long time says nothing then really opens the door with god its nice being away from agnes i laugh and think of all the wild directions this conversation could now go what number is shefive or six i ask a pause as he calculates then agnes is number five karen was four florence was three daisy was two your mother was the first impressive that you can still remember the lineup oh some things you never forget got a favorite he thought about this for a while we were on a twolane road with farmland on both sides i never loved anyone like i loved your mother at first anyway but we were too young to get married for love its your mother for money that would be florence for sex daisy gets the gold star sorry i asked she was a stripper daisy what a body you left us for a stripper you wouldnt blame me if you saw her onstage how long did it last not long i really cant remember and i did not leave you for a stripper the marriage was over when i happened to meet daisy in a strip club of course where else does one meet a stripper dont know i have no experience in that area good for you were you ever faithful to mom without hesitation he says no why not i dont know he says in frustration why do men do anything why do they gamble away fortunes or kill themselves with booze or marry crazy women i dont know you drag me out here in the middle of podunk arkansas to ask why i chased women no i did not i dont really care now how is your mother shes doing fine i see her several times a year shes beautiful as always i almost add that shes far better looking than agnes but let it pass does she know im sick yes i told her back in august as soon as i heard about it i doubt if she cares should she care warren he takes a deep breath then begins to nod off i silently urge him to fall asleep to take a long twohour nap his cancer is extremely painful and when he is awake he seems uncomfortable he keeps painkillers in his shirt pocket weve touched briefly on his marriages one subject i had planned to avoid after he takes a nap i hit pay dirt with a simple question did you ever play baseball in arkansas oh yes in the texas league we played the arkansas travelers several times a year a wonderful old stadium in downtown little rock nice crowds the door swings wide open and warren springs to life forgotten games old teammates strange happenings locker room humor curfew violations life in the bus leagueswe stay on the subject of minorleague baseball for a lot of miles but he tires easily and his long narratives stop suddenly when he needs water or a few moments with his eyes closed he nods off again things are quiet then hes awake and remembering another story during his long difficult career he was stationed in dozens of small towns some of which he has not thought about in years they come back to him now in a flood of memories i am surprised to learn that warren is a fine raconteur with a flair for the punch line the more stories he tells the more he remembers why have i never heard these we do not talk about joe castle and the reason for this trip i have no idea what warren will say but i have a hunch he does he coughs grimaces takes a pill then nods off again we are in the hills now and its getting dark on the edge of mountain view about an hour south of calico rock i spot a nice clean motel and pull in i pay cash for two single rooms warren says hes not hungry and needs to lie down i get a burger from a fastfood place and take it back to my room clarence is waiting inside the front door of the calico rock record the morning is bright the air light and cool a far different feel from my last visit in august main street is coming to life we arrive at am as scheduled warren slept for ten hours and says he feels good im very sorry about your illness mr tracey clarence says sincerely after they shake hands thank you and its warren okay sure would you like some coffee we would and we gather in clarences wonderfully cluttered office for the morning ritual of coffee clarence brings us up to speed on the latest conversations with the castle clan they have yet to agree to a meeting but they havent ruled one out either clarence thinks things will go well if we simply show up i knew before i left santa fe and warren knew before he left florida that such a meeting might not take place but we agreed to try anyway on the phone warren said he would feel better having tried to speak with joe if indeed joe has no desire to meet we ride with clarence across town to the high school again joe is on his red toro mower slowly and meticulously riding back and forth across the outfield cutting grass that is no longer growing it is october and the grass is turning brown near the third base dugout we climb the bleachers and take a seat two middleaged men are sitting in the first base dugout red and charlie clarence says as we settle into our places with nothing to do but watch joe cut grass there is no one else around its almost am and the high school is busy in the distance and he does this every day warren asks hes to my left clarence to my right five days a week if the weather is nice clarence says march through november its a beautiful field warren says they give an award each year for the best high school baseball field in the state weve won it so many times i cant keep up i guess it helps when you have a fulltime groundskeeper after a few more surgical cuts joe lifts his blades and heads for the first base dugout he kills the engine gets off the mower and says something to his brothers one of them steps out of the dugout with two folding chairs that he carries to a spot just in front of home plate thats red clarence says quietly red unfolds the chairs arranges them so that they are facing the pitchers mound and when their placement suits him he takes a few steps in our direction stops and says mr tracey i think thats you i say to warren who gets to his feet and slowly makes his way down the bleachers to the field he is met by red who extends a hand and says im red castle nice to meet you they shake hands and warren says thanks for doing this joe is shuffling toward the chairs his cane poking the ground in front of him his feet doing their sad little stutter steps his left arm and hand hang by his side and he works the cane with his right hand when he is close enough he stops and offers it warren takes it with both of his hands grasps it and says its good to see you joe when joe speaks it is in a highpitched halting staccato as if he knows precisely what the next word will be but getting it out requires some effort thanks for coming they sit in the chairs at home plate and red goes back to the first base dugout with their shoulders almost touching they sit for a moment and stare out beyond the mound their thoughts known only to themselves you have a beautiful field here joe thanks from where we sit we cannot hear them red and charlie are seated on the bench in the dugout likewise too far away to hear a long way from shea stadium clarence says softly a thousand miles and a thousand years thanks for doing this you did it paul not me im happy to be in the middle of ita reporters dream how many diehard baseball fans in this country would kill to have our seats right now i shake my head a couple of million in chicago alone joe says sorry about the cancer thanks joe just a bad break you know bad luck sometimes you get lucky sometimes you dont joe nods he is acquainted with bad luck a minute passes as they sit and stare and ponder what to say next i think were supposed to talk about baseball joe thats the reason im here joe is still nodding okay how often do you think about that night at shea stadium joe the last time we saw each other not much dont remember much well im envious because i remember too well it was a beanball joe one i threw at your head as hard as i could possibly throw a baseball i wanted to hit you to knock you down to put you in your place and all that crap it was intentional joe and ive regretted it ever since im sorry i apologize it was a nasty meanspirited really stupid thing to do and it ruined what was destined to be a great career therei said it im sorry joe joe nods and nods and finally says its okay its okay warren is on a roll and wants to unload everything i meant to hit you joe but i had no idea all the bad stuff would happen i know that sounds crazy you throw a fastball at a guys head with the clear intention of hitting him yet you say you didnt really mean to hurt him its foolish i know so i guess i was a fool as well as an idiot its okay its okay when i let it go i knew it was ontarget i knew it would land somewhere above the neck but it was too perfect and for a split second you didnt move when it hit i could hear bones break a lot of people heard bones break that night it was pretty scary i knew you were hurt when they put you on the stretcher i thought you were dead god im sorry joe its okay warren there was a long gap in the conversation as both men continued to gaze into the distance warren says do you remember your first at bat that night the home run i remember every home run warren smiles typical hitter at one point you fouled off eight straight pitches i had never seen a bat that quick i threw fastballs sliders curves changeups even a cutter and you just waited and waited until the last possible split second then flicked the bat and fouled them off the home run you hit was four inches off the plate i fooled you all right but you recovered and hit it almost four hundred feet thats when i decided to hit you i was thinking well if i cant get him out ill just knock him down intimidate him hes just a rookie just part of the game maybe a lot of players have been hit in the head but few got hurt ray chapman was killed by a pitch in mickey cochrane never played again after taking one in the head tony conigliaro was a certain hall of famer then he got beaned in the eye i hit him once did you know that tony c yep in i was pitching for cleveland tony crowded the plate and he was fearless i drilled him in the shoulder and never felt bad about it sometimes you gotta hit a guy joe you know that but you dont try to hurt someone its never part of the game to throw at a guys head hes got a family a career that was my mistake you hit a lot of people warren takes a deep breath and readjusts his weight he took a pain pill an hour earlier and its wearing off true and i have a lot of regrets joe when i die they wont say anything about what a lousy husband and father i was they wont say much about my mediocre baseball career no what theyll write about is that one pitch i threw a million but theyll talk about the beanball that nailed joe castle the one ill always regret me too both men find this funny and begin laughing softly you have every right to hate me joe i cost you so much in the blink of an eye your career was gone and there was no one to blame but me it would be nice as im getting close to the end to know that you dont hate me is this asking too much i hate no one even me come on joe surely youve had some really evil thoughts about me over the years i did but not now you said it was an accident and i wanted to believe you but i was lying joe it wasnt an accident i lied about it for thirty years now im telling you the truth does this make you hate me no you apologized i accept warren puts his right hand on joes left shoulder and says thank you joe youre a much bigger man than me im still batting a thousand off you warren laughs loudly and joe follows we watch and are amused at their ability to laugh ive known my entire life that warren tracey has no sense of humor so its obvious joe has said something funny i think theyre getting along clarence observes i suppose they have to if a fight breaks out warren has no one in his corner theyre in no mood for a fight charlie told me yesterday they admired your father for wanting to see joe what was their hesitation two reasons they were afraid it might upset joe and bring back a lot of bad memories and theyre afraid this little meeting might somehow get leaked and end up in a story somewhere i assured them that would not happen right of course so how did you blackmail your father into coming the blackmail didnt work hes here because he wants to be here hes a tough guy and its taken the reality of death to soften him up hes looking back at a sloppy life with a lot of regrets what an awful way to die yes im sure it is joe looks at the first base dugout and says charlie red his brothers get to their feet and leave the dugout warren stands looks at us and waves us down we meet in front of home plate and i shake hands with joe castle he wears a cap and thick dark sunglasses to cover his bad eye his hair is half gray and he looks nothing like the smiling kid on the magazine covers of thirty years ago in all fairness though who does look the same after thirty years charlie and red are nice enough but would rather observe than participate at my request clarence has a camera and i explain to the castles that i would like some photos to record the meeting will they be published red asks only with your approval i say he and charlie are suspicious but they agree to my surprise clarence has brought something else from a small plastic bag kept somewhere inside his coat he pulls out two baseball capscubs and mets he hands them to joe and warren and says i thought it would be a nice touch to photograph you guys in these joe looks at his with a frown and warren does the same they are hesitant as if the caps bring back too many memories just a thought clarence says retreating as if he might have screwed up the entire meeting then joe creases the bill of his cap removes the one advertising a feed store and puts on his cubs cap like all ballplayers he adjusts here and there until it feels right when warren removes his golf cap his head is as slick as an onion not a single hair and for a split second we recoil at the horrors of chemotherapy it is a reminder that he doesnt have long with the caps in place we take a step back and clarence snaps away the two players are standing smiling with joe leaning on his cane clarence has a better idea he suggests we move to right center and use the scoreboard of joe castle field as a backdrop this we do and after a few dozen shots of joe and warren i wedge myself into the frame and stand between my father and my old hero all smiling the eightbyten will be the final entry in my joe castle scrapbook suddenly there is nothing left to do the two have met said what needed to be said and posed for photos we say our goodbyes and leave the field driving back to main street clarence says that fay would like to have an early lunch on the porch if thats okay i glance at warren in the rear seat and he is shaking his head no i do not want to offend fay or clarence so i say thats nice but we need to hit the road warren has a pm flight i dont feel bad about this because ive seen enough of calico rock and being so hospitable the rooks would love nothing more than to spend the entire afternoon on the porch swapping stories and taking more photos then the lemon gins no problem clarence says he parks and we meet at his rear bumper i thank him again and he offers his best wishes to warren i promise to call with updates not far out of calico rock warren who has gone silent asks me to pull over he gets into the backseat and falls asleep the trip and the meeting with joe have exhausted him and hes finally hit the wall he is still wearing his mets cap according to the radar map the weather from santa fe all the way east through little rock and down to florida is perfectly clear yet both of our flights are delayed warren is fading fast and i want him on a plane back to agnes before there is an emergency i dont care to deal with the delays have crowded the little rock airport and we pass a few hours doing the mundane things passengers do while waiting throughout the afternoon when he was awake and felt like talking our conversations were light he never mentioned joe though i have not been around him enough to gauge his moods or thoughts it is obvious that his wheels are turning i am sure the subject of death is paramount as it would be for anyone in his condition i am sure he has regrets but neither of us wants to go there warren cannot begin to repair our troubled history with a few eleventhhour apologies and we both understand this i am not sure he wants to try but i am certain i do not want to hear it his appetite comes and goes and when he says im hungry we find a small table in a crowded airport lounge when the waitress asks if we want something to drink warren smiles and says yes i want a tall mug of draft beer i order the same and when shes gone he says ive been sober for ten years with two months to go why not why not sobriety is overrated paul he says with a grin i was much happier when i was drinking i cannot smile along with this because i remember him hitting my mother when he was drunk i wouldnt know i say the bar has three large televisions all tuned in to the world series yankees versus marlins the beer arrives we tap glasses say cheers and take sips he savors his as if he were dying of thirst he smacks his lips and says oh how ive missed this we order sandwiches and watch the game it doesnt take long for him to disapprove look at these guys he snarls look at how fat they are especially the pitchers a minute later look at that guy in the world series making millions a year and he cant run out a pop fly once again i am struck by the absurdity of what im doing having a beer and watching a baseball game with my fatherfor the first time in my life and only because he is now dying the food arrives and we turn our attention away from the game he has made a few derogatory comments about these modern ballplayers and i gather that warren is not much of a fan so are you planning another story one about this little trip of ours he asks as he bites into a turkey club no i have no plans i think you should i think you should take the first story add the second chapter and get it printed and do it now before i die i dont care you want the world to know the truth so do i publish it that was not the deal warren who cares about the deal i kinda like the idea of people knowing i went to see joe castle and after all these years i said i was sorry i havent done that too many times in my life im sure you havent publish it i dont care i couldnt do it without the approval of the castles you saw how protective they are then get their approval write it show it to them and ill bet you can convince them well talk about it the idea is intriguing we order another round and finish eating a guy walks by and says the mets suck and keeps walking we realize its the cap and laugh one delay leads to another and its almost pm when warrens flight is called his gate is near mine and we walk slowly along the corridor they are boarding when we arrive he takes a deep breath and looks me in the eyes listen thanks for doing this it means a lot to me and it meant a lot to joe a real burden has been lifted its known as the restorative powers of forgiveness arent you the wiseass i suppose its true paul youre a lot wiser than me because youll live a life with few regrets me ill die with a long list of things id like to do differently this is not a pleasant way to go you cant fix it now warren he offers a hand and we shake youre right but i have a lot of regrets paul i have no response to this i cannot offer a shallow and meaningless oh its okay warren all is forgiven we shake hands again and its obvious he wants a quick embrace i do not he turns and drifts away and never looks back agnes calls every other day with the latest on his deteriorating condition hes stopped eating his systems are shutting down hes in the hospital hes back home hes been turned over to hospice warren is behaving like the warren of oldunable to place the calls himself unwilling to talk sara asks me repeatedly if i want to go see him no i have already seen him jill and i chat occasionally its the tracey family at its finestwarren talks to agnes who calls me and i call my sister jill does not want to talk to him to see him or to show up at a memorial service after he is gone he lingers and the calls from agnes become monotonous i look at the calendar thanksgiving is approaching and i hope warren does not upset our plans he does not he dies on november at the age of sixtyfive alone in a hospice facility agnes tells me that a memorial service is planned for friday of the following week sara and i have a somewhat testy and prolonged disagreement about whether she should attend the service with me i am adamant that she is not going she feels some sort of weird obligation to pay her respects to a man she hardly knew a man who skipped our wedding and offered not a single word of congratulations when our three girls were born there is no family to sit with and mourn there will be no postburial gettogether sara has no business going besides i dont want to blow another on a plane ticket when the discussion is over she grudgingly concedes a lot of people die in florida and many are retirees without deep roots in their communities because of this the burial business is efficient and streamlined the services tend to be small quick even impersonal warren wanted to be cremated and his wishes are carried out his memorial is held in the windowless chapel of a mausoleum not far from his home with perfect timing i arrive alone fifteen minutes before the service and find agnes sitting in the familys private waiting room some family its agnes and her daughter lydia a person ive never met and me you would think that a man who married five women would generate a bit more interest we sit and talk and the clock absolutely stops agnes again asks me if i want to give a eulogy or say a few words again i politely decline and use the excuse that i might not be able to control my emotions and do not want to embarrass myself emotions aside any warm and touching thoughts or stories i could add at this point would be outright fabrications lydia who eyes me suspiciously finally gets down to business you know paul weve already read his last will and testament i throw up both hands and say i dont care whats in it i want nothing i will accept nothing if my name is mentioned i will refuse to take anything he left you and jill each agnes says dividing the spoils before the burial seems in bad taste but i let it pass i cant speak for jill i say but i dont want it he never gave me a dime when i was in high school or college or when i needed a little extra and im not taking his money now i guess thats between you and the lawyers lydia says and i get the impression she has had some experience with lawyers i guess so and he left to a baseball field in calico rock arkansas agnes says this actually makes me smile and i say thats nice good for warren i am not going to ask about the size of the estatethe timing is bad and i dont really care and ill find out later during probate we move next door to the chapel there are about twenty seniors standing around the front pew whispering waiting all in fine spirits it seems the attire is florida geezer casuala lot of sandals and not a single jacket or tie i avoid introducing myself to these people i will never see them again and im not about to swap a story or two about how great my old man was i assume they are neighbors golfing buddies or agness friends i also assume that none of the men played professional baseball and shared a locker room with warren tracey i know for a fact that there are no members of the mets the chapel has dark stone walls and feels like a dungeon an appropriate mournful hymn is being piped in a man in a suit asks us to please be seated thankfully there is no reserved pew for the family i ease away toward the rear agnes has yet to shed a tear and i suspect she will not be the only one to make it through with dry eyes the friends and family sit and wait and absorb the mood music i dont know why i am here warren is gone and if he could watch he would not give a damn if i showed up or not the notion of properly paying ones respects is ludicrous the dead person could not care less he is lying up there in a casket or in warrens case a small blue urn next to the podium what did yogi berra say always go to other peoples funerals otherwise they wont go to yours a guy in a black robe appears probably of the generic dialapriest variety because warren tracey never went near a church maybe agnes belongs to one the priest chats with her soothes her then steps up to the small podium spreads his arms like charlton heston at the red sea and says welcome the rear door opens quietly and catches my attention three men enter the chapelred castle then joe with his cane and jerky gait then charlie they ease into the rear pew without making a sound all three are wearing navy blazers and white shirts by far the best dressed of anyone here i am shocked and then i am not what a brilliant classy thing to do instinctively i get up and walk back to where they are sitting i ease into the pew in front of them and whisper to red thanks for coming all three nod what are you doing here i ask charlie points to joe and says joe wanted to take a road trip welcome the priest says louder in our direction i look at him and he seems ready to rap our knuckles for talking during his sermon i stay where i am with the castle boys and we endure a meaningless ritual that is painfully stretched into thirty minutes the highlight is a eulogy by marv somebody from of course the golf club marv tells a real kneeslapper about playing golf with warren one day warren was driving the golf cart his ball was in the water he got too close to the edge of the pond flipped the cart marv almost drowned and warren avoided getting splashed with a single drop of water we laugh because we are expected to marvs not much of a speaker and i get the impression he drew the short straw i can just see these old goats sitting around the mens grill playing gin rummy arguing about who will speak at whose funeral okay marv you do warren and ill do yours and fredll do mine the priest does a credible job of filling in the gaps he reads some scripture relying heavily on the book of psalms he hits the high points of gods love goodness forgiveness salvation and it becomes obvious that whatever agnes is she is not catholic jewish or muslim he never mentions the fact that warren played professional baseball winding down he informs us that warren will be interred down the hall on wall d of the third pavilion but that this will be done privately family only i decide to skip this i have no desire to see the hole in the wall where warrens ashes will spend eternity agnes can handle it shes the only one who might stop by once a month for the next three months touch his name in stone and try to conjure up some emotion i know ill never be back besides i want to talk to joe the meditation room is empty and we claim it for the next few minutes its even more of a dungeon than the chapel and gives the appearance of never being used we move four chairs into a circle and have a seat im very touched that you guys would drive this far i begin red says joe hasnt been to florida since spring training of he wanted to get out of town and so here we are i remind myself that all three played minorleague ball and like most prospects they arrived in camp each spring just like the veterans moving up and down the ranks of the minors and riding the buses they have seen more of the country than i have thank you for coming i say charlie says and thank you for bringing your dad to calico rock it meant more to joe than youll ever know joe is smiling nodding content to allow his brothers to do most of the talking red adds it really meant a lot joe says sorry about your dad thank you joe hes still wearing the sunglasses to hide his bad eye but just above them a slight indentation is visible at the corner of his forehead they said he stopped breathing three times on the way to the hospital red says joe has something for you with his good hand joe reaches into the inside pocket of his blazer and pulls out an envelope though i have not seen it in thirty years i recognize it immediately it is the letter i left on the joe castle wall at mount sinai hospital in september joe hands it to me with a wide smile and says here i want you to have it i slowly open it and remove my letter i absorb the carefully printed heartache of an elevenyearold boy dear joe i am paul tracey warrens son i am so sorry for what my father did as i read on i am overcome with the emotions that ran so deep that summer and fall for six weeks joe castle was my world i thought about him constantly i read everything i could find about him i followed every one of his games knew all his statistics i even dreamed of playing on the same team with joehe was only ten years older if i broke in at twenty he would still be in his prime we could be teammates then he was hurt then he was gone then he was history when i finish the letter my eyes are moist but i am determined to collect myself thanks joe red says the cubs did a nice job of collecting all of joes stuff including several boxes of letters and gifts left at the hospital a few months after joe came home they shipped it all down and its been in moms attic ever since charlie takes over six thousand letters from the hospital alone over thirty thousand total a couple of years later joe was going through the letters and came across yours he put it in a special place joe says its very special thank you joe i feel myself getting choked up again after a long silence red changes subjects mr rook down at the newspaper said something about a story you were writing a story about your dad and joe is this true sort of ive written one story but dont worry im not going to publish it charlie says why not why dont you write a story about bringing your dad to calico rock meeting joe telling the truth about what happened you could even use one of the photos of joe and warren with their team caps on joe is smiling and says i would like that charlie continues we might want to look at it first you know just to be safe but weve kicked it around and we think there are a lot of baseball fans out there who would enjoy the story you know joe still gets letters im not sure how to respond warren wanted me to finish the story and get it published now joe does too give me some time to think about it i say would it be a book red asks i dont think so probably a long magazine piece well for what its worth we like the idea good ill give it some thought mr rook likes the idea too charlie says clarence and i have discussed the idea on two occasions i think he secretly wants to write the story himself but he cannot bring himself to say so we chat for a few minutes they are curious about me and my family my mother and sister and what happened to us after warren was gone when i mention that i am a graduate of the university of oklahoma this is instantly met with disapproval they are diehard razorback fans and of course their team is superior we banter back and forth with the football chatter that sustains so many conversations in november the meditation room is suddenly in demand some mourners arrive and we leave there is no sign of agnes marv the priest or anyone else who said goodbye to warren and we make our way out of the mausoleum the brothers are headed to key west for two days of deepsea fishing something joe has wanted to do for years we shake hands and say goodbye in the parking lot i watch them load into a latemodel pickup truck with a club cab and a razorback bumper sticker i wave as they drive away two hours later im on the plane headed home i read my letter and again feel the pain of a broken little boy i put it away open my laptop and begin writing the story of calico joe authors note the mixing of real people places and events into a novel is tricky business this is a story about the cubs and mets and the season but please all you diehard fans dont read this with any expectation of accuracy i have completely rearranged schedules rosters rotations records batting orders and ive even thrown in some fictional players to mix it up with the real ones this is a novel so any mistake should be promptly classified as part of the fiction allow me to thank a few folks don kessinger is an old buddy from the oxford days he read the first draft of calico joe and found a few areas in need of more work he was the cubs shortstop from to and can hold his own with any bigleague raconteur don later managed the white sox and he was replaced in by tony larussa who made his final appearance as a player for the cubs in before the arrival of joe castle and who wore briefly number joes first number one of tonys favorite dinner topics is baseballs code and more specifically the ins and outs of protecting ones teammates and retaliation and the complications of throwing inside thanks also to david gernert alan swanson talmage boston michael harvey bill macilwaine gail robinson and erik allen john grisham december
