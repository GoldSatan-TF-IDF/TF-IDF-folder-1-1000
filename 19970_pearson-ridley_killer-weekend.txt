ridley pearson killer weekend the first book in the sun valley series for marcelle and our love of idaho prologue a s she stood in her small closet undressing for bed elizabeth shaler was annoyed to find some mud left behind by a running shoe that she now put away about the size of a dollar bill the mud covered the carpet and spanned the crack of the trapdoor that led down into the threefoothigh crawl space beneath the house liz pulled on a cool cotton nightgown at her feet cracks appeared in the mud then widened and spread these cracks had nothing to do with where she stood but were instead the result of upward pressure from beneath the trapdoor liz just shy of six feet tall and athletically fit placed her dirty laundry into the wicker hamper and tidied up her hanging clothes were organized by color and type her shoes neatly ordered on the shelves had she glanced down she might have noticed the widening cracks in the mud might have noticed the hatch coming open she looked around the bedroom for the biography she was currently reading only to realize shed left it in the kitchen as she headed down a narrow hallway lined with her familys photographic history behind her the crawl space hatch popped open an inch from within the darkness there appeared the top of a knitted ski mask followed by a pair of skittish eyes the kitchen and the adjoining living room afforded liz a spectacular view of the horizon dominated by sun valley s rugged mountain skyline still aglow at pm she loved this place her second home so far from new york and the political life shed chosen she poured herself a glass of water grabbed the book from the counter and headed back down the hallway both hands occupied patrolman walt fleming groaned earlier in the summer the town had adopted a free bike campaign thirty bright yellow bikes had been spread around town as community property with the understanding no one would steal them they were used by anyone wanting to pedal from one place to the next but the instructions on the bikes clearly stated they were to be well cared for and left in any of the many bike stands around town a policy prone to abuse walton a bike himself one of four officers assigned to pedal patrolspotted one of the bikes dumped into some bushes a half block up the hill from the community library he inspected it for flats or damage and finding none decided to walk it down the hill to a bike stand in front of the library he was on his way downhillwalking awkwardly between the two bikeswhen he spotted a crawl space screen vent ajar on a house foundation he might not have noticed but the framed wooden screen was bent and splintered on one cornersuggesting it had been pried open worse he knew this house it was on the kpd watch list the residence of elizabeth shaler new york s young attorney general a woman whose politics and guts he admired the shaler family had been coming to sun valley for fifty years her parents were featured in photographs with ernest hemingway on the walls of the sun valley lodge he continued walking a few more yardsthe click click click of the bike gears the only sound on the street but the appearance of that screen nagged at him a rookie cop he was always looking for trouble right or wrong he connected the jimmied screen to the ditched bike and he decided that together they gave him reason enough to investigate he laid the bikes down on the curb and worked his way backquietlyto take a closer look her hands occupied liz bumped the bedroom door shut with a throw of her hip she headed straight for the end table with the glass of water and the book the overhead light went off she smelled somethingsomeonesour and she turned around defensively but as she did a hand clapped over her mouth before she had a chance to react her arm was twisted up behind her back and she was driven down to her knees it happened fast one second the glass of water was tumbling to the carpet where it shattered against the end table the next her hands were clamped behind her and her wrists and mouth were bound with duct tape the intruder dragged her painfully by the hair to a chair in front of the vanity and sat her down more duct tape secured her to the padded chair tears streamed down her face the only light in the room was street light seeping in through the blinds and a rosecolored hue from the digital clock by the bed he wore a ski mask and a black tshirt but the blue hiking shorts seemed out of place this was no ted bundy he had a small scar on his left knee he smelled sharply of sweat she faced the mirror he moved nervously behind her you stand for all the wrong things he said his voice taut and youll pay for that he sounded like he was trying to talk himself into this nonetheless he owned her and this bothered her more than anythingthis sense of control he enjoyed you take companies apart with no thought for the people who actually work there come out hereyou and all the obscenely richand leave the rest of us behind to scrap and fight for a job thats long gone what do you care theres always a few weeks in sun valley to look forward to i saw the article in vanity fair i know all about you hed tagged himself shed only broken up a few monolith whitecollar companies he was a reader of vanity fair he was in over his head her attorney instincts kicked in if only she could get the tape off her mouth and reason with him a knife blade glinted riddle me this how far does a woman politician make it without a face he cut her then a hot thin line of blood running across the back of her neck she felt it sting suddenly he was for real and this changed everything at the end of this you will look like the monster you are he said she turned away from the reflection in the mirror determined he not see her fear as she did a movement to her right won her attention the doorknob turned the intruder was fully focused on the mirror moving from side to side behind her brandishing the knife prattling on now where should we start huh he cut a strap off the nightgown exposing her left breast whats a woman without her tits he asked her reflection he amused himself with his own answer richard simmons he cackled loudly sounding like an old crow shaking now from terror she knew better than to look at the door but couldnt help herself someone else was in the house an accomplice shifting in the mirror from her left to right he caught her looking he raised the knife in that direction his face contorting behind curiosity she saw the door coming open judging by his expression this was no one he expected she threw her weight back in the low chair and went over colliding with him tying him up she screamed behind the duct tape the bedroom door flew open a figurea uniformclosed the short distance and threw himself into the intruder the two stumbled across the room in lockstep and smacked into the wall she heard a whoosh of expelled air the crack of bone the swish of the knife blade a wet visceral grunt she struggled against the tape to get free the men separated the knife handle protruding from the belly of the one in the uniform he staggered backward and a flash of light appeared from his side the loud clap of the guns report deafened her the intruder thrown back by the bullets impact wailed and spun and fell to the floor writhing in pain a bitter smell filled the room you shot me you fucking shot me the intruder whined squirming in pain fuck fuck fuck fuck the cop staggered toward him the gun extended the intruder froze the cop viciously stomped on the gut wound and the intruder passed out the cop bent over him and she heard the metallic click of handcuffs are you all right he asked her his voice guttural and wet she groaned through the tape tried to nod officer wounded he said speaking into a radio clipped to his shirt he recited her street address and a series of codes he then took two steps toward her and fell first to his knees before collapsing forward his head on her bare chest their faces only inches apart your honor he said and then he passed out eight years later present day thursday one s ix men all wearing white hard hats and orange ear protectors huddled in one corner of what was to become a themed fast food restaurant thats a wrap that would sport vinyl wallpaper of monroe bogart julia roberts tom hanks and harrison ford not twenty feet away on the far side of a temporary wall passengers hurried down a long hallway that connected salt lake airports concourses c and d the entrance to the work site was through a thick sheet of black plastic sheetrock dust covered the floor along with scraps of aluminum conduit pieces of electrical wire and a half dozen used paper cups from the starbucks down on concourse d there was debate among the workers about how to install a length of ventilation duct the architect had neglected to note the location of the sprinkler system theres no way billy that youre going to get around that pipe the foreman said at last and you sure as shit cant go through it billy disagreed to illustrate his suggestion he dragged two sawhorses to below the spot in question threw two lengths of aluminum studs across them and climbed up while the foreman shouted out for him to use a stepladder because he didnt want to lose his workmans comp record but by then there was no stopping billy he punched a section of ceiling panel up and into the space above and slid it to one side shining a flashlight he poked his head up inside what the fuck he said he withdrew his head and addressed his fellow workers is this one of those hazetherookie things because if it is it sucks when no one answered billy jumped down and used a broom handle to knock the additional ceiling panels out of the way the fourth panel wouldnt budge neither would the fifth or the sixth he tried another and it lifted partially billy carefully slid it to the left now he and the others could see up into the false ceiling what is that one of the men said a suit bag it was a sixfoot length of bulging heavy black plastic zippered shut the foreman took a tentative step forward that aint no suit bag said the smallest of the six workers a man with a goatee and a tattoo of three xs on his neck he spoke softly which was not his way thats a body bag and theres something in it two w alt fleming pulled the white grand cherokee marked blaine county sheriff to the curb in front of elizabeth shalers home as he sat behind the wheel staring up at the house walt realized he was rubbing the scar through the shirt of his blue uniform a firm reminder of that evening eight years earlier it still pulsed hot from time to time for no reason at all it did so now he felt oddly nostalgic for a moment reliving the event that had propelled him to the front page and secured his bid for county sheriff an election hed won by a landslide now a household name liz shaler had recently returned to her sun valley homealbeit a second homeallegedly to announce her candidacy for president walts job along with the people inside was to keep her alive he radioed dispatch that he was leaving sd his cherokee and heading inside a black porsche cayenne parked behind the cherokee and out from the passenger seat stepped patrick cutter with his george hamilton golfers tan and porcelain white smile walt acknowledged dick obrien cutters security chief visible through the windshield obrien stocky and with an irishmans nose offered walt a mock salute two darksuited minions a man and a young woman both of whom judging by their black clothing knew nothing about dressing for the arid idaho summer attempted to follow cutter but were quickly turned back by their boss they returned to the idling car a little sheepishly liz shalers s ranch home would have fit inside patrick cutters sixbay garage walt wondered how that made cutter feel as he bounded up the walkway like a kid arriving home from school the secret service agent held the door for walt looks like dryer called in the varsity walt said to patrick cutter theres been a credible threat cutter announced it struck walt as both odd and unfortunate that patrick cutter no matter how many billions he was worth should have such intelligence ahead of local law enforcement with the cutter communications conferencec less than twentyfour hours away the proper chain of command would have been dryer walt and then obrien who would tell cutter not the other way around cutter could read a mans face dont worry walt no ones pulling an end run on you dick obrien received the intel ahead of even dryer thats not possible walt blurted out without thinking thats the way it is cutter said we do a lot of business with the military believe me those are our satellites theyre using for christ sakes he winked a mannerism walt found intentionally offensive they stood half in the house a man with bad acne scars approached from the open kitchen he was dressed like a preppie wearing a white shirt no tie a blue blazer blue jeans and loafers he offered his hand to walt while still too far away for them to shake adam dryer he said at last walt said the man tried a little too hard with the handshake you guys have not met an astonished patrick cutter asked not facetoface dryer said still shaking walts hand but if email were any judge were practically married mr cutter mentioned a credible threat walt said getting free of the mans eager hand did he dryer asked looking at cutter disappointedly have you met the ag dryer stepped out of walts line of sight elizabeth shaler was on the phone in the kitchen her eyes lit up at the sight of walt and she waved enthusiastically then pointed to the phone and scrunched up her face into complaint she wore a sleeveless white shirt with a simple string of pearls the countertop blocked sight of the rest of her but she hadnt added a pound if anything he thought she looked a little too thin and not a day older than when the two of them had been in this house together under much different circumstances i guess you have dryer said seeing shalers reaction he sounded almost jealous its a small town walt said or was cutter added trying too hard to be friendly until people like me moved in right sheriff everybody take a deep breath walt said everythings fine i want to hear about this threat but first i think im being summoned in fact liz shaler was waving him over to her and pointing down the hallway she placed the phone down gave walt an affectionate hug and said to dryer im going to steal him for a minute as she led him by the hand walt felt a pain in his gut just beneath the scar liz shaler sensed this somehow and inquired too familiar im fine its been too long she said closing the door of a small study behind him oh my god how good it is to see you she devoted her full attention to him if it was an act she was profoundly gifted and you mrs shaler liz please are you kidding me its walt not sheriff is that okay i prefer it really good to see you so much has happened she said where to begin walt felt she owed him none of this and was about to say so but her energy silenced him i appreciated your note she said about charlie it was a tragedy i wasnt even sure youd see my note that it would get through to you it did you never met him did you no maam but your note was very kind as if you had it meant a great deal to me and stop it with the maam walt fought back a smile he said we stay in here too long and dryers going to have me vetted you would have liked himcharlie and he you he knew all about youabout your saving me hardly of course you did she said do you suppose adam dryer doesnt know i would doubt it isnt that strange and should i tell him your decision entirely he said youd rather i didnt she said i can see it in your eyes gosh its good to see you isnt it strange how something like that connects two people i feel likewell im gushing forgive me its an honor to be part of your security detail ohplease i loathe the secret service not the men themselvestheyre just doing a jobbut being watched and accounted for twentyfourseven its absolutely oppressive were going to have a tight net around you this weekend i hope youre still speaking to me monday she grabbed both his hands in hers monday and the monday after that and every monday forever walt i can tell youre nonchalant about this but ive never forgotten that night and i never will may there never be another one walt said amen to that a knock on the door probably another fundraising call she said so the rumors are true he asked she bit back a smile her eyes were positively luminous she smelled like a garden of lilacs i have absolutely no idea what youre talking about she pulled open the door there were five people jammed into the hallway all vying for her attention not exactly the same as running for county sheriff he said over her shoulder unsure if shed heard him or not he glanced up the hallway toward the bedroom he remembered hearing the glass break could still feel the grip of his weapon cool in his right hand as he slipped it from the holster could still feel the hot jolt as the knife entered him hed shot three men in the line of duty since that first timehad killed one of them but nothing came close to this memory and though he hadnt admitted it to her he too felt a kindred bond with this woman unlike anything he had with anyone she had heard him for she turned over her shoulder and spoke to him as if able to block out the five voices all speaking at once you didnt tell me about the divorce and im going to honor that but when youre ready id like to hear about it if youre okay with that they moved as a group then back down the hall until she let out an earpiercing whistle without touching her lips walt had once had a baseball coach who could whistle like that her entourage shut up and she was tall enough that when she rose onto her tiptoes she lifted above them i have a security meeting with sheriff fleming agent dryer and patrick cutter right now its confidential and none of you are invited after that im going flyfishing for the afternoon and after that im yours again i ask you to respect my schedule and for the time being to leave the house and take a break jenna that means you too okayso go go the group of handlers dispersed immediately a moment later it was just the secret service detail of four agents including dryer and patrick cutter and walt he noticed for the first time that some press was encamped across the street in front of the library their dark lenses aimed like rifle scopes lets get to it dryer said clapping and rubbing his hands together one of dryers men lowered and twisted the living room blinds shut then left through the front door walt noticed another of the detail stood outside the kitchen door the four of them took seats on a couch and a pair of art deco overstuffed chairs that had been a part of the house since the s a rectangular glass coffee table covered in magazines and newspapers sat as an island between them as the fourway conversation began walt took a quick assessment dryer was efficient and down to business as hed learned to expect of the government man cutter seemed slightly aloof and impatient a man with his eyes on the bigger picture walts job seemed to be to play the paranoid local cop but he resisted playing to the stereotype for her part liz shaler found it in her powers to give each person her full attention while scribbling out the occasional note to herself walt envisioned the discussion as a transcript written from the recording made by the digital pen that patrick cutter placed in the center of the coffee table with everyones permission fleming so a credible threat dryer a telecommunications intercept most likely the nsa although we got it from the bureau cutter dick never tells me who we get this stuff from but its obviously for real dryer very real fleming do we have a transcript dryer its coming which probably means well get it tuesday or wednesday after the conference and ms shalers talk sunday morning are long behind us government work fleming but credible dryer mentions ag and a price of five hundred thousand dollars shaler my stock has gone up the first man to try to kill me was a volunteer cutter dick feels its of concern certainly but it was apparently stated vaguely enough that it could be for any date now or well into the future fleming i take it means we make adjustments have we considered canceling the talk cutter lets not get carried away fleming youll excuse me sir but any of us getting carried away is what were trying to prevent dryer any talk of cancellation is premature weve received twelve threats in the past three weeks this is by far the most credible but we need more intel cutter its the end piece of the conference i will honor and respect whatever decision you make liz but you know the stakes shaler no ones canceling anything walt is just looking after me i appreciate it and im going to listen to him and give it some thought dryer it comes back onto you sheriff we all report to you cutter but not the decision making liz can make up her own mind about appearing or not fleming i agree with special agent in charge dryer we need as much intel as possible has the threat been assigned dryer it didnt come from oc thats what we got from the bureau not mob a third party someone unknown to them is behind the buy that could be good news could be bad but at least its not some crime family because that would scream duck and cover as far as im concerned fleming and maybe still does dryer for now we stick with the plan my guys cover her in transit and in situ your boys clear the routes handle crowd containment traffic flow and advise us on backdoor routing if theres any investigation to take place thats going to have to come from you sheriff its not what we do and i dont have the staff ive asked the bureau to stay on top of this but you never know theyre overworked and underpaid just like the rest of us most of the rest of us cutter i can offer any of dicks team he has a couple dozen men on the ground as far as i know most if not all are exbureau or military no one with less than twelve years a bunch of investigations among them fleming ill get with obrien then thank you shaler i want you all to know that this isnt the first time and wont be the last im sure i feel very safe in your care id like to be kept up on what we know and id be the most comfortable if sheriff fleming acted as gobetween so i trust agent dryer that every effort will be made to keep the sheriff in the loop at all times fleming sure thing what the transcript would never reveal walt realized were the nuances of glances and telegraphed body language that accompanied the discussion patrick cutter believed he had the most to lose he worked himself up throughout the meeting growing steadily more agitated special agent in charge dryer maintained a dispassionate calm but failed to make eye contact with walt even once confirming how uncomfortable he was with walts theoretical control of the conferences security and his relationship with liz shaler dryer was a takecharge man and he saw walt as standing in his way liz shaler had stood up for walt perhaps a little too much focusing her attention nearly entirely on him over the tenminute discussion embracing walt as her ally and perhaps even using this support as a threat to patrick cutter and agent dryer walt came away better informed but oddly less confident of his own position there were games at play both subtle and overt the unspoken but clearly apparent alliance between cutter and dryer was what he feared mostthey meant to have liz shaler to themselves and now saw walts participation as an impediment a commotion at the front door grabbed their attention and it was a mark of their high nerves that both dryer and walt reached for their weapons three t he guard at the front door announced the guides here dryer responded show her in at five feet eleven fiona kenshaw stood an inch taller than walt she wore her brown hair up in a ponytail pulled through a ball cap that read kiss my bass she wore a purple tshirt pulled snuggly over her firm frame and a pair of hiking shorts with multiple pockets small world sheriff dryer offered walt a look that said you know her too fiona works for the department parttime as our crimescene photographer walt explained our waiter at dinner last night liz shaler said let it slip that she had a masters in marine biology from scripps skibummed three years ago and never left only in sun valley a man followed her through the front doorunannounced walt noteddrawing everyones attention including fionas it was danny cutter patricks wayward younger brother a radiantly handsome man in his early forties who bore little physical resemblance to his older brother danny owned a room the moment he entereda quality other men envied and women found irresistible danny had parlayed this into personal gain for most of his life danny blew past fiona to liz whom he kissed affectionately and hugged he shook hands all around including with walt apparently bearing no grudge over his arrest two years earlier an event that had been a major setback to his business career despite the fact that walt had the mans photograph and fingerprints on file at the officea drug possessionhe couldnt help but like danny liz leaned toward walt look i know danny had some problems but theyre behind him now walt found her sympathetic tone illuminating it wasnt easy to stay upset with danny cutter for very long danny approached fiona with the elegance of a bullfighter he shook her hand and unabashedly sized her up walt half expected fiona to curtsy walt caught dryers eye danny wasnt announced by your guy why not mr cutters known to us dryer explained hes a personal friend of ag shalers listen were aware of his priors sheriff if thats your concern my concern is that whoevers coming after her needs access if youre not screening every single personmyself included danny cutter dryer asked incredulously hes vulnerable hes a convicted felon on probation and he has accessopen access walts phone rang sparing him more of a reply he slipped through the door and took the call outside it was nancy his assistant transportation security administration director from salt lake city airport is holding for you can i put him through whats it about walt asked said its urgent or i wouldnt have bothered you urgent the front door guard overheard this walt headed to the cherokee for privacy he slid behind the wheel and dont forget your father nancy said who could forget my father he mumbled okay he said into the phone as he started the engine for the sake of the airconditioning put him through listen we dont know exactly what weve got only that in this new era of sharing intelligencethere was no doubting his sarcasmits my responsibility to pass along this kind of thing in a timely fashion nate capshaw spoke slowly as if imagining each word before uttering it or maybe walt thought he was considering his choice of words for the sake of legality carefully weighing how it might read on a court transcript sometime down the road this won walts attention and much appreciated walt said workers here found a body this morning just over seventy minutes ago walts internal alarm sounded why call the blaine county sheriff about a body at the salt lake airport it was inside a body bag that was in turn hidden inside the suspended ceiling of a commercial space under construction between our c and d concourses capshaw was reporting a murder that showed great premeditation walts rapid breathing was amplified by the cell phone still warm capshaw said his hands were sweating on the wheel so why me our video surveillance was down on that concourse because of the work going on but one of my guyslisten this is a long shotbut he followed a guy on a hunch thought maybe he recognized him from a past life used to be a state cop in rhode island this is about the same time as whoevers in that body bag was being done right my guy loses the suspect in ethe e concourse frickin madhouse e with all these regional jets but this guy in the body bagthis was a pro job no question about that no id on him labels cut out of the clothing face cut up fingertips removed some teeth pulled a real fucking messexcuse the french this guy was meant to be a john doe and hes going to stay that way and the thing of it isall the cameras we got in eworking cameras im talking aboutand we never get a decent look at his face are you kidding me this guys fucking baryshnikov the way he moves keeps his back to the cameras the whole time then we lose him in the mens room but why me walt asked again seven flights departed from e in the minutes after we lost him im calling all seven destinations starting with you because the first flight to depart was headed up there to sun valley youve got that shindig up there this weekend right offers a guy like this some fairly big targets sounds like he got his target walt said call the fbi field office ask them to check with washington i think theyre going to be interested in your john doe the flight arrives there in fifteen minutes capshaw said jesus why didnt you say that five minutes ago walt flipped on the flashers sped away from the curb he ran the red light at the intersection of sun valley road and highway and headed south give me whatever description youve got walt said waiting to launch the siren until the phone call concluded it was twenty minutes to the airport on a good day four s even minutes latereight minutes before wheels downbcs dispatch had rallied three of its eight cruisers two had sealed friedman airport the third driven by deputy tom brandon pulled up to the terminal only seconds behind walt weve got six minutes walt told brandon a bigboned thick man in his later twenties a pair of aviator glasses hid his dark eyes tommy brandon had been ski patrol on the mountain for six years before applying to the sheriffs office his star had risen quickly and with it walts reliance on him suspect is average to tall dark hair black tshirt jeans or black jeans sheriff other deputies often addressed walt informally by his first name brandon never had and walt appreciated it that description fits half of the guys in this valley its all weve got and pete pete wood ran security at the small airport his guys were trained to unzip bags and stare at xray machines i briefed him on the way in his guys will keep their distance this guy killed a man in salt lake walt said keep alert tommy sounds like hes pretty good with a knife at least hes coming off a plane he should be clean should be walt said ominously if hes got checked luggage he could have a piece in there so if and when we get a twenty we keep him away from baggage claim we do not want a hostage situation got it the friedman terminal looked blandlike a onestory brown shoeboxwhen compared with its extraordinary backdrop a string of foothills rising a thousand feet off the valley floor this midsection of the valley the town of hailey eleven miles south of ketchumsun valley qualified as the transition point between high desert to the south and alpine to the north leaving the southfacing slopes of the foothills barren covered in nothing but kneehigh wax weed and sagebrush the north slopes holding snow longer in the springtime and the moisture it contained were covered in evergreen the sound of a plane on approach caused both men to turn and look up showtime walt said brandon raised his voice above the roar of the turboprop what about shoes shoes walt nearly had to shout suspects change their hair their face but just as often leave on the same pair of shoes do we have a photo no photo shoes walt said sounding impressed you arent careful sheriff ill run against you in the next primary walt studied his deputy for the crack of a smile or any sign that he was kidding but brandon maintained a poker face from the other side of the small terminal came the sudden winding down of the turboprops the plane had landed five t he forward door of the brasilia emb was lowered and as the gatechecked hand luggage was wheeled around on a trolley walt watched from inside the glass of gate a welllit space shared with three car rental agencies along the back wall baggage claim was accessed by three garage doors the trolley was stacked with roller bags fly rod tubes duffel bags and a wicker gift basket passengers descended the steep stairs picked over the trolleys contents and headed toward the terminal waiting for someone walt turned and recognized the woman behind the hertz counter from a fundraiser the week before yes as a matter of fact has the divorce gone through i havent seen it in the paper sorry to hear about that she didnt sound so sorry yeah walt briefly took his eyes off the line of arriving passengers julie right the wildlife dinner i did the door wearing the elk antlers how humiliating was that i had to endure endless comments about my nice rack walt avoided checking out her rack by returning his attention to the arrival the first few passengers were retirement age then came two families with young kids then several men who looked like the cutter conference prototypes ceos dressing down in blue blazers buttondown shirts and khaki pants a silverhaired golfer and his wife wearing matching st andrews sun visors followed the four executives im bothering you julie said busy at the moment walt said on the job seriously whats up just a meetandgreet maybe we could do this later he suggested still not taking his eyes off the arriving passengers sure she said walt didnt like letting her icy tone go uncorrected but he had no choice he checked over with brandon who shrugged still no suspect the arriving passengers began to mill about blocking his view of the plane walt moved closer to the arrivals door in order to get a better view a snarl had formed around the baggage trolley two female baggage handlers were arguing with a guy his back to walt he caught brandon s eye once more and signaled that he was headed outside the dry hot air slapped him in the face he hurried toward the commotion holding his weapon in the holster as he jogged a baggage handler spoke up you cannot go back there sir walt felt a surge of adrenaline someones trying to breach security he couldnt make out what the man said but it made the woman even angrier walt involuntarily unsnapped his holster whats going on here he asked grabbing the man by the shoulders and spinning him around he wore wraparound sunglasses and carried a white cane in his right hand he pulled away stumbled and nearly fell over a loose bag walt steadied him apologizing and introducing himself in alternating strokes the man was blind whats the problem here he asked finally the passenger composed himself i asked to see my dog hes a service dog i shouldnt be made to wait ive explained to him sheriff the woman said that no one besides us can go back there sir your dogs back there he nodded vigorously they required me to kennel him and to check him like baggage they made me sign a release because of the july heat i just want to make sure hes okay we can do that walt said but were going to have to do it inside at baggage claim shes just doing her job no ones allowed back there walt glanced over his shoulder wondering how many passengers hed missed during this encounter he hoped brandon had gotten a good look youre the sheriff seriously the blind man sounded amused a wry smile overcame him blaine county sheriff yes lets take this inside okay rafe nagler he switched hands with the cane and stuck his right hand out into space walt took hold and they shook hands im here for the cutter conference theres supposed to be someone here to pick me up well get it sorted out can i offer you walt took him by the elbow the blind man allowed himself to be led thank you sheriff im sorry for the confusion he said your first time here yes ive heard wonderful things did you know theres a ski program for the visually impaired not this time of year walt said no nagler smiled maybe not but kayaking and rock climbing kayaking seriously nagler leaned his head back and laughed showing his teeth im bullshitting you he said but the rock climbings for real walt grinned but of course the man couldnt see it then he faked a laugh which sounded stupid ive never attended the cutter conference but its said to be the single most important such meeting in the country patrick cutter knows how to throw a party walt confirmed the journal called it the most influential three days to the communications business nagler said sounds right called patrick cutter a kingmaker disney bought abc as a result of this conference brighton distilleries acquired a film studio and changed its entire business plan and you are a dreary professor invited to bore the executives for an hour on saturday i doubt that walt pulled open and held the door the airconditioning catching in his throat a welcome relief he eagerly scanned the interior brandon was nowhere to be seen do you see rickys kennel nagler asked oversized items are delivered at the far end im good now sheriff thank you nagler extended his cane and gently broke walts grip he negotiated his way through a minefield of pulled luggage and impatient passengers walt rose to his toes and saw brandon standing alone no suspect anxiety flooded him this was the perfect place to identify and arrest a possible hit man arriving to kill shaler right here and now the contrarian in him wanted to believe that the murder victim in salt lake city had been the intended target that the job was over and done that the feds had gotten it wrong that he and obrien and dryer had nothing more to worry about this was how cutter would spin it possibly dryer along with him time worked against him baggage arrived sliding down the short stainless steel chute with a jarring bang like cows at a feeding trough the passengers approached and nudged one another aside the crowded space became more chaotic with passengers wielding bags the terminals automatic doors clapped open and shut walt spun a full circle his frustration mounting another few minutes and the terminal would be all but empty he signaled brandon and caught his attention the two men stepped outside in concert each through a different door together they inspected the parking lot for anyone whod managed to slip past unnoticed brandon stood by the taxi stand and hotelvan pickup he leaned his head into several of the vehicles scanning the boarding passengers over walts radio came brandon s voice ive got zilch ditto walt replied hang onweve got a situation inside brandon announced walt turned and hurried back into the terminal six a wall of onlookers blocked walts view he crossed the room and forced his way through the small crowd that had gathered at the same time brandon reached the center of the huddle it was nagler the blind man again kneeling on the floor in front of a creamcolored kennel he was crying or cursing patting the floor violently feeling for his cane catching it with his right hand he lifted it roughly as if to whip the confused baggage handler walt jumped forward and grabbed the mans forearm and peeled the cane from his fingers hold it walt said sternly sheriff naglers face was flushed and splotchy the sunglasses had slipped down his nose giving walt a fleeting glimpse of a milky eye with no iris no pupil only a sickening yellowwhite bulb theres been a tragic accident the baggage handler said bullshit nagler said they killed my dog they killed ricky the heat the handler said she fingered a large neon orange

check any luggage sir brandon spoke up his low voice drawing naglers attention ever the practical one always thinking ahead nagler fumbled in his back pocket and pulled out a ticket sleeve stapled to the inside of the sleeve was a bag tag he handed it in brandon s direction brandon took it and passed it to naglers driver she went down the line of the few remaining bags and checking baggage strips pulled out a hardshelled samsonite no one read me the release nagler muttered he swung his cane out in front of him but without the energy that had fed his initial anger wheres the car ricky could have gotten me out of here just fine he tested the area with the cane and made his way slowly karen platt dragging his suitcase brandon shut the wire door and hoisted the dog kennel like it was a loaf of bread tough break he said to walt walt glanced around having almost forgotten about their suspect he felt the weight of defeat elton johns goodbye yellow brick road leaked out of speakers in the ceiling shit he thought hed have that tune stuck in his head the rest of the day seven r afe nagler pulled himself out of the volvo his white cane at his side a voice summoned in a thick eastern european accent the man sounded big he grabbed nagler firmly by the arm welcome to the sun valley lodge thank you nagler swung his cane the bellman took him by the arm lodge or inn he asked as he was

across the pond that provides additional rooms and houses our conference and banquet facilities karen platt his driver called out that shed take care of his bag she sounded both anxious and nervous as

handled his reservation with aplomb she retrieved a leather tote bag for him loaded with gifts from the c she noted mention of his service dog theres been an accident nagler said his voice tight rickys not with us the receptionist and the bellman both offered their condolences nagler and the bellman rode the elevator to the third floor discussing the hotels history and construction they arrived at the room and the bellman admitted him nagler pulled a bill from his left pants pocket and handed it to the man left pocket tens right pocket ones listen nagler said after following the bellmans quick description of the rooms layout ricky my dog was my eyes ive grown quite dependent on him its not that i cant negotiate with my caneof course i canbut im out of practice if you could

naglers bag arrived the bellman placed it on a stand and offered to unpack it nagler declined as the bellman retreated toward the door nagler stopped him saying theres a movie theater isnt there the opera house yes does it run a matinee by any chance sun valley serenade shows every day at five sonja henie and john payne with glenn miller excellent can i escort you over yes please around four fortyfive that would be perfect see you then the name is karl sir thank you karl for everything my pleasure sir ill see you later this afternoon the door clicked shut nagler was alone he locked the door and threw the security lock he then felt his way into the bathroom closed the door and locked this as well he located the sink closed the drain and washed and dried his hands he removed the mirrored sunglasses and with his left index finger held his eyebrow firm as he pulled down his lower lid with the other hand exposing his eyea bloodshot yellowish orb then he pinched the surface of his eyeball and removed the contact lens and he could see again eight d anny cutter made two mistakes the first was to look it in the eye the second was to turn and run from it hed been struggling at the time to catch up hed hooked into a snag off the western bank of the narrow big wood river at first hed thought it was a submerged branch because hed felt a little give as he tugged on the fly rod but then with no more give left in it he was thinking rock that the adams fly intended to float had nonetheless dipped below the surface and was currently tangled in some green moss adhered to a rock far in the recesses of his anglers mind lurked the distant possibility that he was actually onto a fisha lunkerand that it had sat down and was awaiting his next move so he moved toward it but a moment later he was certain hed snagged he wanted to catch up with fiona the guide and liz shaler now about thirty yards downstream for two very different reasons liz was an important friend fiona was hot never mind that a pair of secret service agents one on each side of the river crept through the thick underbrush and shadowed the attorney general as best as possible never mind the ease with which theyd eavesdrop on any conversation given the amazing quiet of the river he could work around that fiona had led them across a private bridge to a secluded estate hidden deep within the starweather subdivision they were midvalley about five miles north of hailey the river turned slightly east about a half mile down the water was knee deep and moving swiftly the bottom rocky uneven and slippery it was framed within walls of towering cottonwood trees on either side broken by stands of aspen tangles of chokecherry and the colorful shock of golden willow slowly the group in front of him moved in unison downriver he stepped carefully toward his snagged fly reaching it he slipped his hand underwater and followed the taut line he pricked his finger on the sharp hook and happened to glance up a cougar less than ten yards away for an instant he was stunnedawedby the sight then something more primordial kicked in as he realized he was too close the cat was poised ready to pounce to strike this wasnt a discovery channel moment she was hunting and he was meat he turned and ran splashing forward slipping on the mossy stones sucking the waders heavily out of the water down the river the sound drew the attention of the others who turned hopefully expecting to see danny cutter in control of some massive trout instead they saw him stumbling frantically across the river aimed slightly downriver to allow the current to help his movement his running was awkward and urgent bees fiona kenshaw said he got into but she cut herself off as the cougar burst offshore into the river as if running on the surface her paws weightless her flight graceful and undisturbed good god danny heard the charge behind him it sounded like a bull elephant in desperation he glanced over his shoulder turning slightly upstream with this motion his rod moved like a whip with the cougar one pounce away from striking the graphite tip of the ninefoot rod sharply struck the cat on the nose the animal dropped its head and went head over heelsa half flip that threw a shower of water at danny and knocked him down into the river the cougar took off in the opposite direction without an ounce of lost momentum it hit the shore in full stride blurred into the tawny grasses and vanished living up to its nickname ghost of the rockies cutter lost his rod as his waders filled fishermen drowned in less water unable to regain balance victimized by the panic and the weight of waterfilled waders danny aimed his feet and legs downstream he used the current to help him stand chilled to shivering he staggered toward the rivers edge and collapsed onto terra firma winded and dazed somehowmiraculouslyhed escaped a cougar attack he was alive unhurt he took it as an omen an arbitrary warning of the preciousness of life and he swore to god it would not go unheeded nine w alts office door swung open followed by a strong wind that turned out to be his sisterinlaw myra she of the nervous constitution and skeletal frame her voice could crack glass what if you showed kevin one of those horrible shots of a car all smashed up by a drunken teenager maybe that would shock him into thinking straight maybe hed forget about those canyon parties or maybe you could lock him up for an afternoon you know right here in your jail and show him what thats like if youre busted for drugs hes your nephew after all ill take care of it myra ill speak to him walt said without turning from his computer you can go now am i interrupting he knew that voice he angled to see fiona just behind myra who blocked the door fiona wore the small tight tshirt and hiking shorts hed seen her in earlier though her hair looked worse for wear and her face was shiny with sunscreen i called you walt reminded how could you be interrupting myra anything else good then get out of the doorway and let her in myra was none too subtle about looking fiona up and down and then glancing back to walt judgmentally myra walt chastised but myra couldnt help herself i like what youve done with the uniforms she told him then she added youd better call kevin out she huffed off fiona entered slackjawed my brothers widow walt explained has installed me as a surrogate fathersometimes an awkward fit i had a stepmother i hated she said sliding into a captains chair that faced his desk in the impossibly small office she kept her legs extended long legs made longer by the shorts but cut off by the desk which was something walt regretted thanks for saving me he said anytime i called because you need help with some photos you explained over the phone its been a long day danny cutter was nearly killed by a cougar you want to run that by me again she explained her witnessing the attack from thirty yards downriver we packed up and came back early and danny headed off to lunch with his brother men you cant really just pick back up like that can you let me tell you something if that had happened to me the first thing id have done is spend half the day on the phone telling anyone whod listen then id have a long hot bath or two and then a bottle of wine or two business as usual forget it thats two attacks in ten days the yellow lab i shot the photos remember that was disgusting you ought to do something about it the cougar not my department fish and game but youre right they should certainly hear about the attack on danny what do you think of him danny hes okay not professionally i know you busted him i mean as a person dont really know him kind of difficult to separate the two but first impressions she asked he asked you out walt stated yeah is that bad walt knew danny cutter as a womanizing playboy whod had a twothousanddollaraweek cocaine habit prior to the bust he thought the cocaine part had gone away he wasnt sure the other part ever changed he liked the man in spite of his criminal record we got some crimescene photos from salt lake he told her pretty gruesome stuff but theyre lousy photos id like to enlarge some crop and zoom some others above my skill set she looked out the top of her eyes at him and said disdainfully i see i need them pretty quickly its a date is all a guy named capshawtsa down in salt lake thought it important enough to send these i have a five oclock with everyone whos anyone connected to c security but as i said the photos are pretty heavy if youd rather not do them maybe you could give me a fiveminute course in photoshop for dummies ill do them myself she sounded angry just tell me what you want the surprise in the photos especially under enlargement was the degree of the horrors the victims fingers had been cut off with precision teeth had been pulled shown in the photos with a latexgloved thumb holding the dead mans upper lip up over the gap but worst of all the face was disfigured and both eyes had been carved out of the sockets fiona battled her way through the work none of my business she said but why do you even want these you realize theyre far more disgusting as closeups right but evidence is evidence you can see everything in the originals so i dont get it can you load them into powerpoint and burn a disk for me of course i can but it wont make them any easier to take what is it they say about first impressions walt asked rhetorically youre a diseased individual she said but youd watch it he tested of course i would but im sick that way like you this goes no further than this office he paused to make sure he had her attention theres been a credible threat on liz shalers life he watched as the shock registered at first i wondered if this killing in salt lake might be related happened this morningless than eight hours ago but once i saw these once i went through what you just went through it was no longer if but how jesus this guys here he lowered his voice now i need to get several others to make that same jump ten c ristinas lunch crowd had thinned out an hour earlier leaving only a few tables occupied on the restaurants back deck at the wait staff dressed in all black hurried about servicing the remaining tables a cougar are you sure patrick cutter wore a pink golf shirt with the c logo embroidered on the breast he focused intently across the table at his brother of course im sure give me a break did you tell anyone patrick asked i got out of the shower about ten minutes ago besides in case youve missed the news im not overly eager to spend time with walt fleming walt could have been a lot harder on you yeah yeah what about liz shes all right danny set down his fork eyed his brother with disbelief i almost get mauled by a cougar and all you can think about is your keynote speaker patrick pursed his lips fear not paddy shes all yours shes going to give her talk announce her candidacy and your precious conference will go down in history congratulations patrick shook his head but not a hair moved that is what its all about right danny asked how many millions of your own money do you spend on this thing and for what a little respect youre the rodney dangerfield of wall street paddy the sad thing is nobody has the balls to tell you if it was all about my vanity would bill gates attend warren buffett ian cumming the conference serves its purpose or i wouldnt do it that money could be put to better use says the man who cant hold on to a dime youre hardly one to talk youre off fishing and chasing tail when youre still ten short on your angel round it irks you doesnt it my turning you down danny asked his tone softened the offer still stands patrick said and its an incredibly generous one but one i cant accept it just seems to me dont start please danny placed his napkin on the table and pushed his plate away growing more serious keeping it in the family and i wish i could but i cant of course you can patrick said you choose not to theres a big difference i choose not to because youve bailed me out of every one of my screwups for as long as i can remember not that this is a screwup its not for once ive got a chance at something that could actually work and your help with the business plan was minimal it was not minimal there you go again dont do that you helped and im grateful but when it comes to financing it ive got to do it myself youre the one with all the right gut instincts you dont become a billionaire on luck ive got to do this paddy thats all you know that feeling when you know youre right then at least start with stu holms this fits right into his latest round of acquisitions danny joked dont tell that to liz shell slap another antitrust suit on him heaven help us patrick said any tricks to stuart holms other than not mentioning liz shaler patrick grinned and stabbed at the slices of chicken in his salad hes old school you wont get a second chance practice on sharples and jenkins save holms for when youre ready youve got several strong talking points trilogy has done well regionally the push to national distribution isnt that big a stretch lean on the fact that the big bottlers filter the water and that your source is two miles deep stu likes a good story so dont be shy hell appreciate the evolution and growth youve done a good job danny thatll mean something to him you won the trademark on organic water thats huge hell see the value save that for last all good stuff danny said patrick dripped some dressing onto his shirt danny couldnt help himself the pink shirt doesnt work paddy you look like youre wearing house insulation you think patrick blushed tugged on his shirt and then looked around the restaurant selfconsciously danny saw surprise register on his brothers face just before he heard the warm soothing voice behind him well look what the cat dragged in hey you two ailia holms was strong and fit like so many of the sun valley women soon to be middleaged with a body that peeled off ten years she held back a restless playfulness her red hair forewarned her personality she was a comfortable flirt in a bright green top and oilily stretch pants that cleaved to her backside as she bent to peck patrick on the cheek speak of the devil patrick said she fauxpatted the top of her head taking advantage of the moment to show off the latest augmentation to her breasts devil are my horns showing she gave danny an awkward hug that perhaps intentionally thrust her breasts into his chin long time no see stranger true story everything good ailia asked unflinchingly for a guy who just spent fourteen months in club fed you mean i dont care where youve been danny its good to see you is all you look good and you soailia patrick said tell us about london we didnt go as it turns out stu got hung up with some deal surprise youve been hereall along patrick asked danny was suprised by the obvious disappointment on his brothers face we knew youd be busy preparing for the conference looks like a great one by the way elizabeth shaler you waited long enough to announce that patrick reached for a chair from an empty table ailia waved away the offer id love to but i cant stay stus waiting she leaned into danny a second time and pecked him on the cheek see you tonight i hope she whispered she gave patrick an air kiss looking forward to tonight and hurried off both men tracked her through the tables dont go there patrick cautioned youre damn lucky stu never found out about you two the first time who said he didnt stu is many things but charitable is not one of them nor is he forgiving i thought the whole town knew apparently not patrick flagged a busboy well take the check the scrawny kid turned around and clearly recognized him ahyes sir he lingered a little longer youre mr cutter right yes i am im all over the gsix he patted his pocket did you opt for multiplayer patrick asked its bitchin kevin cristina the proprietor called from the next table shed overheard check kevin said to her spinning around to tend to the vacated table danny asked his brother the gsix a gaming cell phone multiuser over evdohighspeed wireless teens are our fastestgrowing market you never stop patrick took it as a compliment you really think the pink doesnt work eleven w ith the contact lenses removed his full vision restored milav trevalian studied the mirrored reflection of rafe nagler the corners of his lips twisted up stretching the theatrical facial hair glued to his face a grin of satisfaction for having made it through the loss of the dog ricky was no prop he needed the dog hed also left his backpack behind a calculated risk necessitated by the incompetence of the airline the brasilia s lack of overhead baggage space had required all passengers to gatecheck their carryons but either the salt lake or sun valley ground crews had mixed it in with the checked baggage when it failed to appear on the pickup cart trevalian had lost his temper quickly changing horses and directing his rage at the baggage handlers with the unexpected loss of the dog and the sheriff all over him hed feared trying to recover the backpack this because he couldnt be sure if he hadnt left an old airline identity tag attached to it with the opaque contacts in place making him truly blind he carried two sets one translucent he hadnt been able to see if there was a tag there or not he couldnt afford close scrutiny so the bag and its contents had been left behind trevalian unpacked naglers suitcase tried on the unfamiliar clothes and discovered the dead mans shirts fit fine the pants though big in the waist could be made to work with the help of a belt he noticed small bumps of thread had been sewn into tight knots on the insides of the back pockets of the pantsbraillelike personal codes allowing nagler to determine color he found the same handsewn bumps on the shirttails and also on the socks he unpacked the mans clothes into the dresser drawers hung shirts and pants in the closet and spread items from the toilet kit on the bathroom counter he even smeared some toothpaste to imitate the man missing his toothbrush still contemplating a way around the death of the dog he settled down onto the bed and lay back waiting came easy for him milav trevalian had the patience of a saint twelve i t felt strange to enter his own vehicle as a guest but the secret service would occupy the blaine county sheriff offices mobile command centerthe mccfor the next four days a rockandroll tour bus confiscated in a drug bust and remodeled and equipped with every conceivable trick the mcc was currently parked in front of the post office in the obnoxiously large parking lot that fronted the sun valley resort deputy special agent in charge scott ramsey sat behind a laptop computer in one of two opposing booths behind him hung a seating chart for the inns ballroom each seat labeled with a guest name ramsey gave walt a nod three other agents stood and scattered into the back of the bus from where walt could hear a live feed of cnn ramsey had the thick neck and shoulders of a steroid user dryers onsite in the hotel but busy at the moment i told you that over the phone lets make him unbusy if we can not possible how can i help you walt laid the stack of photographs cropped and printed by fiona down on the table we have a visitor walt said ramsey flipped through the first five or six his face impassive give me the fouroneone salt lake city airport this morning the victim was discovered zipped up in a body bag and hidden inside a hung ceiling in a restaurant under construction we got lucky i guess you could say he was still warm i believe his killer is the same person contracted to do shaler ramsey continued flipping through the photos glad i ate a while ago i can take these directly to the attorney general but i thought i owed special agent dryer the courtesy of a conversation if you say thats not important then thats not important thanks for your time he scooped up the photos turned around in the small space offering ramsey his back ramsey stood hang on he squeezed past walt and led him into the sun valley inn the resorts conference hotel walt felt color rise as he recognized snippets of conversation flood down the hall from one of the conference rooms he rounded a corner and was greeted by a parade of familiar faces just leaving a meeting some of the men stopped to shake hands with him better late than never sheriff someone called out nothing like missing your own meeting a familiar but unidentified voice said reflexively walt doublechecked his watch though he already knew the time the security orientation meeting wasnt scheduled for another fortyfive minutes and here it was breaking up thirteen w alt entered the stuffy conference room prepared for a turf battle with adam dryer he was entirely unprepared for what he saw his father the two men sat next to each other at a linencovered table on a dais at the end of the boxy conference room the dais was raised a foot off the floor facing rows of portable chairs separated by a center aisle reminding walt of a courtroom and he the attorney pleading his case jerry fleming lifted his head and met his sons surprised stare i left a message walt checked his cell phone there was no message indicator thats bullshit walt said jerry fleming served as director of security for avicorps out of seattle the worlds largest aircraft manufacturer hed taken the job and its sixfigure salary a detail he loved to mention to walt who moved the five oclock walt asked jerry answered not dryer the cocktail party at cutters tonight put a little hitch in our giddyup it was in everyones best interest to advance it an hour the five oclock was my meeting mine and obriens you have no say in this apparently i do jerry said your father brought us intel that first rights is planning to protest the conference adam dryer made every attempt to make this sound of the utmost importance i left you a message on your cell phone about the meeting being advanced walt gave him a look careful son jerry fleming said you stay out of this walt said wish that i could my companys going to have people at the cocktail party and the five oclock didnt give me and my team time to get in place a conference like this is fluid son you know that his father was a fount of security clichés you want fluid try piss and vinegar the presence of first rights requires additional planning dryer said the wto in seattle that first rights walt asked the same dryer said walt now stepped forward and placed the salt lake photos in front of dryer who gravely flipped through the stack passing each photograph on to jerry fleming son of a bitch jerry said meeting eyes with his son this is salt lake he scrutinized the photographs organized mind experienced with a knife late twenties early thirties single it isnt a serial killer dad its a hit man ive hunted them son jerry said all youve done is study them the upside dryer said raising his voice and making a conscious effort to separate father and son is that clearly our intel was wrong when and if this dead guys ever ided what do you want to bet his initials come back ag we got all worked up over nothing and this hit walt said drawing the quotes just happens to occur a couple hundred miles south of where ag shaler is giving a speech give me a break the intels solid the planning for the body bag is the kicker that should bother us because its an indication of premeditation he paused allowing that to sink in this kill confirms the intel we need to know the victims identityfastand his role in this because the man behind that knife is on his way here or is here already youre entitled to your opinions sheriff dryer said but until we have the identification until we have any kind of evidence connecting this kill to the conference it would be irresponsible to initiate hysteria over what might be nothing initiate hysteria walt asked you want another look at those photos this guy is a prowhoever he is whatever his purposeand hes within three hundred miles of here all im saying is wed better sit up and take notice jerry interrupted the debate saying theres a cocktail party in a little over two hours and first rights intends to march on this conference wheres our focus on a city three hundred miles south of here in another state or on the business at hand i need route clearance and a twovehicle escort from the ags residence to patrick cutters residence on or about six fortyfive pm dryer informed walt its already on the itinerary youll have your escort walt stepped up onto the dais to collect the photographs i want to show these to liz shaler out of the question dryer barked out quickly she deserves to understand the degree of the threat the ag is my responsibility dryer reminded shes speaking at the conference and that puts her with me are we really going to get into this if you want a few minutes with her ill arrange it but no photographs no one should see these who doesnt have to walt took this as a minor victory thank you he said jerry fleming made a show of checking his watch ive got to get moving walt lets do this at the party cutter doesnt want uniforms present walt reminded so lose the uniform dryer said meet me at the cocktail party sheriff you and the ag will step out for a minute see if you can come up with a game plan for first rights by then weve got to hit this proactively see you at seven walt said fourteen a knock came on the hotel room door at before answering trevalian unlocked the dead bolt on the door that connected to the adjacent room knowing he would need this later he then rechecked his appearancethe face of the man rafe nagler in the bathroom mirror satisfied he grabbed his cane and answered the door here to take you to the movie sir trevalian wore naglers wraparound sunglasses but not the opaque contact lenses the lenses he now wore provided a horrid sight if anyone caught a glimpse of his eyes but allowed him to see though a little muddier than usual karl turned out to be a brute of a man well over six feet with wide shoulders a big brow and deeply recessed eyes he led trevalian by the elbow out into the heat and sunshine along beautifully landscaped paths and past an outdoor mall of boutiques to the north the pioneer mountain range tipped with snowfields rose like the alps karl bought him a ticket and at his request showed him to a seat in the back row of the opera house theater a large auditorium that seated four hundred its seats faced a productionsized stage in the middle of which hung a commercial movie screen rows of exit doors flanked the seats on both sides the washrooms were not out in the foyer but instead accessed at the back of the hall behind where trevalian now sat karl offered to arrange for someone to meet him later but nagler politely declined as the film started trevalian counted seven others in the cavernous theatertwo families both sitting much closer to the distant screen he casually checked behind himself the red velvet curtains were pulled across the entrance to the lobby fifteen minutes into the movie nagler slipped off to the mens room and locked the door he removed and pocketed the facial hair and wig he left the stall to wash the coloring out of his eyebrows and lashes at the sink five minutes after entering the mens room he departed one of the side doors as milav trevalian his white cane collapsed and tucked into his sock sun valleys pedestrian mall included a bookstore a minimarket a gallery and several ski and apparel shops that in the summer carried mountain biking garb white rafting paraphernalia backpacking supplies as well as tshirts sweatshirts ball caps and golf goodies trevalian paid cash for a small overnight bag some tshirts and two pairs of chinos that would fit him better than naglers wardrobe at the minimarket he bought toothpaste a toothbrush some deodorant and a razor he headed back to the lodge checking in asked the young blonde whose name tag read hannah prague czech republic trevalian could have spoken fluent czech to her but he resisted showing off meisner trevalian supplied the name the reservation was booked under and slid across a valid credit card also in meisners name i requested a room that yes i have it right here she said running her finger across the screen we were able to accommodate your request your room communicates with mr naglers my friend is sightchallenged trevalian explained when i realized we were both going to be here yes of course after he filled out the register she handed him a key may i have one of our bellmen no thank you enjoy your stay trevalian thanked her and crossed to the elevator rode it to the third floor then let himself into the room rented to meisner less than a minute later with the hallway door locked and secured he opened the shared door that connected to naglers room he could come and go now as he pleased under the guise of either identity trevalian pulled a cold beer from the minibar and cracked it open he worked the television remote disappointed the lodge did not offer adult inroom movies and flipped to cnn both the dog and the missing backpack were problems requiring solutions but hed established the two identities he had the connecting rooms calling from the meisner room trevalian arranged for a rental car through the weekend he had errands to run in ketchum he had a bomb to build fifteen i n the middle of arranging for barricades to help control the expected protests from first rights walt was alerted by tommy brandon of an unexpected complication youre not going to like this sheriff brandon began hed elected to call walt on his office phone rather than relay any message through dispatch telegraphing that secrecy was an issue but i went back onto the taylor crabtree surveillance after the airport and i just followed him to one seventytwo northridge thats myra s place right walt relived his sisterinlaws earlier intrusion into his office and her pushing him to do something about her wayward teenage son kevin yeah walt said sowhat do want me to do brandon asked taylor crabtree was a sixteenyearold jd suspected of drug trafficking in meth and selling to minors like himself hed flunked out of wood river high had been given a second chance in the silver creek alternative school and had been tossed after three strikes on drug use for the past two weeks walts deputies had kept him under nearly roundtheclock surveillance and now hed walked in to visit walts nephew take a coffee break walt said ill look into it roger that brandon said im on the cell if you want me to pick the surveillance back up ill call and thanks tommy far as im concerned brandon said i went on the break a half hour ago none of this goes into my report until and unless you say so appreciate it walt disconnected the call knowing he wouldnt condone cooking a report to favor his nephew but if he could get a read on the situation or break it up ahead of anything illegal then maybe hed spare myra and kevin another family disaster he pulled into myra s driveway and opened the car door to a blast of dry heat he shut it loudly making a point of announcing his arrival and then used a sliding glass window in the nextdoor neighbors house like a mirror to watch the back of myra s house hed been fifteen once himself two kids spilled out the back door like the place was on fire walt took off after them down the driveway around the corner past the vegetable garden and the disused swing set he vaulted the low postandrail fence into a neighbors backyard just in time to catch one of the two escapees in profile eric he shouted in his best sheriffs voice two women looked up from their flower beds across the street walt shouted a second time the boy stopped walt was angry with the kid for causing him to sweat through his uniform what the hell eric kevin said we could could what could be there at the house the boy was more out of breath than walt kevin said it was okay kevin works thursdays walt said testing he just got back from cristinas i swear weve been in there maybe ten minutes walt knew it was more like thirty kids we the boy hesitated i can check all this out walt said he looked the boy over considered asking him to turn his pockets out but he was afraid of what he might find who was the other boy he asked instead already knowing damn well and before you answer remember that lying to a sheriff is a bad idea eric lowered his eyes crab he said after a moment taylor crabtree walt paused eric the best advice i can give you is to not go places you know you shouldnt go youre a good kid you hang around a boy like taylor crabtree and its guaranteed that youll be seeing more of me yes sir now go on eric took a step or two then broke into a run a minute later kevin greeted his uncle from the far side of the screen door on the back porch hey uncle walt his lanky frame looked all the thinner with his shirt off his pants hung below the elastic of his underweara fashion statement for some but not for kevin no one in the family had fully processed the loss nearly a year earlier of walts brother bobby least of all kevin walt had tried to fill the void had neglected his own family in the process and had now paid for it with his own divorce walt had never been real good at getting close perhaps kevin read that awkwardness as something else hed never been receptive to walts advances the one thing that connected them was now dead and they both reminded the other of him so much that it hurt hey yourself walt said eric and taylor crabtree sure took off in a hurry what was that about he shrugged dunno maybe the cop car and the uniform didnt help maybe taylor crabtree is bad news kevin took a moment to study the places where paint had chipped from the doorjamb so youve said are you going to tell mom you kidding me you think i want to be on the

kevins face revealed his internal disconnect walt had seen that face beforethe oh shit here it comes again look that any teenager learns to command walt wanted to take the kid and hug him to hold him he knew myra he didnt imagine anyone had done that since the funeral but something stopped him grandpa called you understand what im saying about crabtree walt owed it to the boy to get his point

one misstep and hed be at the center of a fire so hot so incendiary that it would easily consume him and a wing of the hotel before help arrived the litter of packaging overflowed the wastebasket into a pile on the tile floor he finished assembling the coleman camp stove hed removed the vent grate allowing him to clamp and ducttape a batteryoperated fan into its rectangular hole allowing the fan to evacuate the soontobetoxinridden air more quickly he lit both of the colemans burners and began to hum quietly he inspected his various purchases hed bought no more than two items from a single store untraceable undetectable unbelievably easy to the left of the sink he found the bottle of bleach he broke its seal and filled a pyrex bowl then with the fan running brought it to a boil he weighed out the table salt substitute and added it to the bleach and continued boiling until the battery tester registered full charge full charge indeed he removed the bowl and set it to cool in the icefilled sink he then filtered out the crystals recovering the bleach to boil it again an hour later he was heating distilled water with the crystals and filtering this as well at the end of this process of fractional crystallization he had relatively pure potassium chlorate which he ground to the consistency of face powder he melted equal parts vaseline and wax dissolved it over the camp stove and then poured it over the potassium chlorate in a large tupperware bowl wearing a pair of rubber gloves he kneaded this until thoroughly mixed and set the bowl outside in the corner of the balcony pulling a potted plant over to conceal it he doublechecked that the privacy please tag was on the door and the dead bolt was still engaged as a finishing touch he angled the desk chair beneath the inside doorknob ensured no one could enter the meisner room without a battering ram he then cleaned up the bathroom grouping the various ingredients in a brown paper bag beneath the sink he entered naglers room closed and locked the connecting door pausing only briefly to once again reconsider each and every step lightheaded with excitementor was it the fumeshe proceeded to the mirror in naglers bathroom and resolved himself to the patient application of the facial hair the clothing and finally the milky contact lenses that made him blind he had a party to attend seventeen w hat have i gotten myself into liz shaler asked jenna her plainfaced executive secretary whod worked with her for nearly ten years liz was putting the finishing touches on her face in front of a mirror in what had once been her parents bedroom youll be fine jenna assured her im whoring and we both know it i might as well just spread my legs and get it over with just dont let the tabloids see you ill bet ive had a half dozen of these very people or at least their companies under some form of investigation or inquiry in the past six years and now im asking them for money how hypocritical is that youre not asking anyone for money give me a break youre going to make your positions clear and if some of these people choose to support those positions then fine it is so much more complicated than that and you know it were tricking the system patrick cutter and i and i should know better this kind of thing always backfires youre doing nothing wrong nothing illegal weve vetted this six ways to sunday your job is to have fun its only a couple days you mean its my last couple of days feels like some kind of sentence everything changes sunday morning dont kid yourself about that jenna everything she dabbed a cotton ball at the edge of her eyes we will not have a moments rest for the next fifteen months and twelve days we are going way out on a limb here since when have we not been out on a limb im comfortable as a whore is that what youre saying beats working for a living the women exchanged smiles in the mirror though liz shalers sank into a grimace i hope im not making a mistake of course you are but whats the alternative i could be a ski bum liz suggested or sit bored on a dozen boards you made your point liz chided shed heard this often from her advisers nowhere to go but up hows this she asked turning to show her face a million bucks jenna said i hope youre wrong liz said because we need a hell of a lot more than that just to get out of the starting gate eighteen s tanding on the ushaped wraparound balcony that overlooked the living room of his nineteenthousandsquarefoot home patrick cutter surveyed the cocktail party hed thrown for early arrivals to c below him the elite of america s communications industry comingled and made merry fortified by the best champagne liquor and wines served in crystal flutes and heavy cutglass tumblers the appetizers had been created by a chef from a small provençal gîte located two kilometers south of gorde many of the guests knew one another contributing to the lively hum of conversation that hit patrick cutters ears like music his wife trish glanced up from a tightly knit group on the floor below in february shed spent thirty thousand dollars on her face so this was her comingout party of sorts she offered him no wink no nod no subtle smile but the sparkle in her lasercorrected eyes said enough a success the conference was off to a good start he hoped it would shape the direction of the communications industry in the months to come still these changes were subtle sometimes they reached the front page of the wall street journal this sense of history and his place in it as a leader thrilled him in three days time liz shaler was to announce her candidacy for president at his conference how could pride be a sin when it felt so good who would not forgive him that little indulgence this conference was all about indulgence his gaze swept the crowd he caught a voyeuristic glimpse down the dress of the lead violinist in the classical quartet where the hell was liz shaler he spotted and tracked the unmistakable red plumage of ailia holms as she and her husband stuart stopped and chatted to friends he made a mental note to keep stu away from liz shaler no need for a scene a waitress took drink orders the group erupted in laughter he watched as ailia gave stu a subtle tug and then led him over to the head of the worlds leading manufacturer of fiber optic cable ailia never missed a beat as stu engaged in small talk ailia rose to her toes seeking out their next obligation but when she lingered a little too long in one direction patrick followed her gaze to its target danny alarms sounded in his head if ailia wanted danny it was for only one reason patrick sought out the nearest staircasethere were six in this houseand made his move to intervene nineteen w alt parked the sheriffs office cherokee at the end of a long line of vehicles hugging the shoulder of adams gulch road and headed on foot down the curving driveway adorned with twentyfoot blue spruces and a gorgeous array of flowers which like so much of residential ketchum and sun valley had been built in the past ten years that meant each of the towering trees had been purchased mature and transplanted at a cost of fifteen thousand dollars per tree it was a most conspicuous display of wealth but nothing compared to the house itself fashioned from five antique new england barns each dismantled and transported and reassembled into an interconnecting village the compound looked like a small new england village two welldressed hostesses both wearing c badges greeted walt and offered an orrefors crystal champagne flute bearing a frosted c logo the flute bubbled with a krug judging by the chilled bottles just inside the front door the glass is compliments of mr cutter the blonde informed walt walt had worn a freshly pressed buttondown shirt and his best pair of chinos but knew how out of place he looked compared to the linen poplin and silk on display the front door cut within the enormous barn door opened into a vast space of weathered wood and glass broken into several smaller rooms the living rooms most prominent feature was a dry stack fireplace with a sixfoothigh open hearth that currently held an opulent arrangement of cut flowers and cattails a balcony surrounded the second floor looking out onto a massive chandelier made of interconnecting antlers walt tried not to stare at the women the jewelry the sheer blouses the tempting necklines tried not to succumb to the swirl of french perfumes the gleaming white teeth of flashing smiles and the heady rush from the champagne he retired the halffilled glass on a passing tray and spotted a few faces he knew all of whom were private security keeping to the walls or behind one of the dozen handhewn timber posts allowing their employers free rein all told he counted four one hovering near bill gates another close to sumner redstone he expected to find most of the guys out back with the rest of the helpthe drivers chefs and personal assistants he looked for liz shaler expecting hed find dryer within an arms length and caught sight of patrick cutter coming down a staircase looking very much like a man in a hurry attempting to look casual in less than a minute walt declined offerings from four different hors doeuvres trays he watched as cutter reached the bottom of the stairs and seemed to change directions heading straight to the front door some faces turned in that direction the buzz of conversation briefly diminished walt glanced back over his shoulder new york state attorney general elizabeth shaler had arrived cutter succeeded in reaching her first though nearly out of breath conversation slowly resumed shalers name echoed around the room flanked by two men in blue jeans and blue blazers one of whom was adam dryer she looked right past cutter and spotted walt and waved walt wasnt sure of etiquette he returned a small wave feeling the eyes of a hundred envious strangers bearing down on him twenty d anny cutter saw ailia approachingwithout stu wanting to avoid any gossip he excused himself from a group of his brothers friends and headed to the toilet he passed one of the bars dodged a few greetings cut through the library done sumptuously in suede and african leathers following discreet signs to the powder room taped on doorjambs he needed a gps he passed another of the directional signs noticing that someone had already crossed out the d in powder there had been a time when danny had been caught up in all this himself the show the exaggerated lifestyle the pretense there had been a timeprior to the swhen sun valley had been about skiing in the winter and hiking tennis or golf in the summer but la riots earthquakes and fires had given way to white flight the hollywood set the arrival of attitude the glass and steel replacing the funky log establishments on main street he and his brother were a part of that sea change for the valley and it wasnt anything to be proud of chasing sobriety was about as terrifying as being chased by a cougar and though danny was all for success especially his own he had no desire to be any of the people in this room including his brother briefly he thought hed keep right on walkingout the back door if he could find it concerned that ailia was looking for him and knowing how easy it was to get caught up in her web he kept moving with her husband as a potential investor he wanted to avoid complication and succeed or fail on his own finding the powder room occupied he headed up one of the many staircases the second of the five connected barns contained a hotel kitchen and a similar sized laundry room on the ground floor and three guest suites upstairsliving room bedroom bathone of which he currently occupied he bounded up to the top of the stairs and turned quickly toward his room this hallway connected to the central barns ushaped balcony that overlooked the living room where the cocktail party now raged in taking the corner at the top of the stairs too quickly he nearly knocked over a guest the man who wore wraparound sunglasses dropped a canea thin white cane he was blind danny made immediate apologies twentyone t revalian had found the perfect view from the balcony hed watched shalers grand entrance hearing someone bounding up the stairs hed turned and forced a collision to win sympathy over suspicion now on his knees he patted the floor searching for his cane even though he could see it to his right sorry the man whod knocked into him was profoundly goodlooking and polite in his supplication no problem he said moving tentatively toward the stairs and grasping for the handrail youre a long way from the party the man observed birdseye view trevalian openly smirked at his own joke i was taking the dime tour he was now halfway down the stairs and with the man behind him he couldnt risk observing shaler as hed intended but given that hed counted at least four security escorts around her it was better not to test their abilities to spot people like him if you give me a minute i could show you back downstairs ive got a fiftycent tour that might beat your dime i can find my way thank you he added to his voice the curt edge of a man who was used to and resented being patronized because of his disability he followed the banister around the turn of the landing and continued down the stairs a gorgeous redhead arrived at the base of the stairs hello she said hello trevalian answered looking in her general direction and raising his head like a dog sniffing the wind the air smelled of ambrosia and something earthy and pungent you didnt happen to seethat is im sorrydid anyone pass by you just now she asked trevalian knew intuitively to stay out of this the man whod run into him had clearly been in a hurry but to make a love nest or to avoid one and then from above up here ailia her cheeks flushed and her eyes sparkled excuse me she said hurrying past him leaving trevalian awash in her complex scents and to his surprise aroused twentytwo y ou look a little lost a friendly voice said from behind walt he turned to find clarence stillwill a fixture in the wood river valley for the past forty years hed been a river guide a saloon owner a magazine and book publisher and was currently an organic farmer on twenty acres outside of fairfield and for good measure he and his wife filled in as bartenders for friends who ran the most popular catering company in town clarence was a big man but well proportioned so it didnt show until you stood right next to him part cowboy part college professor he manned a wine bar between two potted trees walt took a beer money like this yeah walt said this househes here what three weeks a year if that talk about a crime i know why the civvies clarence asked im undercover yeah you fit right in here ive got to do the impossible convince a woman not to talk it really is a thankless job jerrys involved how is it between you two about the same walt said bobbys death the great divide it was a real loss hows the kid messed up yeah clarence said kinda figured we all are gail and ia lot of that was losing bobby i figured you two forever you and me both cant live with em cant kill em cheers to that walt said hoisting the beer in case you missed it tommy lee jones keeps checking you out walt looked to see dryer staring him down guys like that clarence said indicating dryer theyll put up a fight but they wont take you to the mat at the end of the day its just a paycheck for them your lips to gods ears a waitress interrupted and placed an order as clarence went to work walt looked up to see danny cutter in profile clear across the room up on the balcony he was chatting up a redhead with quite a profile walts cell phone buzzed and he ducked behind a potted tree to answer a womans grating voice cleared the wax from his ears kevin tells me were invited to dessert with you and jerry up at the pio is that for real hello myra why are you whispering im kind of in the middle of something but it sounds noisy kevins right dessert is for real my treat the pio maybe eightthirty quarter to nine he checked his watch realizing if she hadnt called he might have forgotten the dinner with his father the salt lake photographs had pushed all else from his mind but jerry she asked what if hes drinking then youll be doing me a big favor by coming walt said honestly okayokay but he starts dumping on kevin were out of there and ill be right behind you walt said he hung up the call wondering what hed gotten himself into twentythree t ell me you werent running from me ailia said danny took a little too long to say dont be silly she gestured to the nearest guest room marked guercino on the door indifferent or trying to be danny said but why new leafs dont turn over easily oh god dont tell me you bought the whole twelvestep thing i bought it but it was on credit five minutes dont make me beg she led him down the hall and into the first guest suiteas it happened his she closed the door with authority im going to skip the missingyou part and how hard its been and get to the point i can help you danny want to with stu im talking about trilogy i beg your pardon patrick told me all about it hes in a snit you wont keep it in the family but hey if its stu and me its almost family anyway dont you think i think this is my business and paddy had no right to oh come on hes looking after you were all looking after you and at least one of us is looking right at you she stepped closer a dozen sweet smells swirling in front of her im not the enemy you know if she moved another inch toward him their bodies would touch now he felt her body heat it mixed with her scent and his head swam allieno ah come on why deny a girl a little pleasure her breath smelled of red wine you know how i am about pleasure the longer she stood there the weaker his will he inhaled deeply and some hairs danced toward his face she whispered let me help please she tentatively placed her hands on his waist above his hip bones im not going to beg she said not until our clothes are off at least you know how i get she smiled and as much as he wanted to see her as selfserving and shallow a middleaged flirt to be turned off by her he found himself quite the opposite he liked aggressive women she knew this about him and exploited it ive been fantasizing about you danny for over a year now in the shower alone at night thats a lot of fire needs putting out you know me he felt his resistance failing her perfumes invaded him and hit like a drug his skin burned where she touched him feel where im the warmest she said pushing her hips forward and burning through to his thigh more scents escaped from her necklinedark lusty odors that didnt come from a bottlescents that were designed to trigger urges and instincts and he was a fool to think he could prevent it he drank them down and they fed him and the addict in him so barely confined wanted more hed sworn no internal oath against this he had no battle with her physically he needed this and she knew it and the offer that now came out of her in an expression of hands and a willingness of her lips parting to kiss him so overwhelmed him that he didnt simply give in to it he thrived on it he pulled off her clothes down to that tangle of dark and devoured her in a flurry of impulse while she pleasured herself behind guttural coughs as she sped toward climax down in the living room the quartet played on their strains heard as muted sentimental nonsense while in the room behind a wincing call for more the real music played to its finale twentyfour p atrick cutter couldnt find them hed lost track of ailia and danny and while overcome with joy at the arrival of shaler he wanted to spare his brother from doing something stupid added to his motivation was jealousy but he kept that in check for the time being having left liz shaler in capable hands he now searched more aggressively he crossed through the kitchen briefly sidelined by heinz his german chef imported from southern france ironically the complaint involved stuart holmss personal chef who had taken over one of the three ovens without regard for heinz patrick settled the man down and got out of there in a hurry holmss chef traveled with stuart everywhere supposedly to provide a special diet to the wall street wonder he was currently preparing finger food for a party of one chef raphael delivered each plate of treats to his boss personally making a great show of it and convincing somepatrick was sureto believe it was holmss party not his the delay heightened his sense of urgency he had to find ailia before she relit his brothers fuse and perhaps blew them all up in the process passing his wifes study he stopped short may i help you the man sitting behind her desk wore dark sunglasses he had a mustache and beard and looked vaguely familiar are you a waiter the man asked im the owner actually patrick cutter may i help you only as the man stood out of the chair did patrick spot the white cane leaning against the desk its rafe nagler mr cutter patrick muttered an apology and hurried across the room after some awkwardness of unknown etiquette on patricks part the two shook hands so glad you made it he said stonebrook was honored to be invited you have a marvelous reputation the foundation youre speaking of my reputation is as im sure you are aware that of a loner a recluse thats exaggerated i assure you the nostradamus of new technologies youre entitled to your eccentricities mr nagler were happy to have you youre in my wifes study did you know that her study the man asked he smiled good god how embarrassing i was looking for a place to sit down is all you found one but maybe youd prefer something a little closer to the party or if you want some solitude i can send a waiter no please nagler said ill rejoin the party with pleasure i heard about your dog and im gravely sorry for your loss i cant imagine what youve gone through were looking into some possible remedies its kind of you but dont trouble yourself im pursuing some options im not bad with a cane if you excuse mistaking a study for the dining room cutter laughed and then helped the man to the door turning him toward the noise of the reception if youll excuse me he said pleased to meet you nagler said heading toward the din patrick headed a few steps toward the north staircase when something pulled at him and he reentered the study it was narrow and long not easily mistaken for a dining room that sat twentyeight he couldnt identify what bothered him about naglers explanation but it was enough to draw him to the far side of his wifes desk and next to the chair where nagler had sat now he realized what had called him back the reflection of the computer screen in the window behind her chair it should have displayed the screen saver a photo of bald mountain in winter instead it showed the windows home screen the screen saver only left the screen if the keyboard was touched or the mouse moved nagler could have bumped it he supposed gnawed at by lost time he took one last look before returning to his search for danny but a nagging sensation remained how had nagler bumped the keyboard or mouse given that both were at the far end of the desk twentyfive a s walt followed dryer and shaler out of the living room and into the sumptuous library he caught a brief glimpse of the blind man rafe nagler just leaving by the front door it reminded him to try to find nagler a loaner sight dog sowaltwhat is it liz asked once dryer had pushed the door shut she sat down heavily in a leather chair and rubbed her right calf walt glanced over at dryer who returned an unsympathetic look the photos weighed heavily in walts back pocket we have evidence your honor of a horrific killing in salt lake city it makes me wonder if we can provide for your safety adam i feel differently but promised the sheriff face time with you of course she said giving her attention to walt immediately soured dryer walt reviewed the discovery of the body at the salt lake airport describing it as a gruesome murder but avoiding anything too graphic per his arrangement with dryer he finished by saying theres a possibility this ties in to the most recent threat there is no evidence connecting the two walt countered a possible suspect was followed by a tsa agent to the e concourse where he subsequently disappeared the first flight leaving that concourse was bound for sun valley your honor her eyes tightened and fell away from walt to an unfixed stare i see as she regained composure she looked up at dryer who wouldnt look directly at her we met that flight walt said having received this intelligence in advance and failed to identify a suspect matching the description wed been given but i should caution that doesnt mean he wasnt on that flight its a lot to process she said walt said evaluation of an event like this can take weeks im told the fbi has seized security video from the airport that might have helped us anticipate a wrestling match with homeland over those tapes were heading into a weekend dryer reminded and that doesnt help us any so theres no way to know who this dead man was or why he was killed she asked walt suggested two possibilities one that the intelligence intercept had been a ruse and that the target of the contract was now dead two that the dead man was killed because hed recognized the killer or had seen something he shouldnt have or she said i can hear it in your voice walt come on im a big girl one of shalers handlers knocked on the library door but dryer took care of it he glowered at walt and tapped his wristwatch out of sight of shaler theres always the possibility this murder was a warning walt said how so she looked horrified a message to youto usto let us know how serious they are how professional how capable theyre telling you not to run not to announce your candidacy speculation dryer interrupted i asked him to speculate liz shaler countered intimidation she asked walt your honor walt said i have no doubt that between agent dryer and me we can put a screen around you at the various functions this weekend but none of us can absolutely guarantee your safety this person killed inside an airportabout as secure a facility as you can get these days all im saying is if youre having any reservations about announcing your candidacy you might want to change things uphold a press conference sooner rather than later move the announcement back to new york if there is a killer out there itll throw him off there you are patrick cutter announced as he charged through the door he dismissed walt and dryer without so much as a glance been looking for you everywhere a little business to attend to liz shaler said she looked over at walt and he saw apology on her face cutters arrival had slammed her back into the reality of her headlining his coveted conference he wondered what it felt like to be drawn between power and money and ones personal safety he got his answer more quickly than he wanted well she said pulling herself up out of the chair but slowly as if suddenly more heavy or painful ill count on you to keep me up on any developments walt day or night okay smokybackroom deals patrick cutter said in his obligatory sarcasm theres been a murder in salt lake that has all the markings of a professional hit walts voice was filled with frustration well good cutter said without missing a beat we must have been given bad information what a relief with a penetrating look he challenged first dryer then walt and finally shaler to contradict him walt was about to when liz shaler caught his eye and silently called him off who needs a drink cutter asked ever the jovial host im buying he laughed at his own joke took liz shaler by the elbow and led her to the door before walt gathered his courage as cutter opened the door there stood stuart holms about to knock for a moment tension filled the short space between holms and shaler your honor holms said mr holms shaler returned i know weve had our issues holms said i was just wondering if we might get a minute together i would hope we could both put the past behind us and keep an open mind toward the future from what i read in the press liz shaler said the past is hardly behind us youve made your opinions of me abundantly clear id like to discuss that another palpable silence fell between them lets all get a drink cutter moved her through the door come on stulets get this worked out liz glanced back at walt furtively still outwardly apologetic with the music and the drone of excited conversation entering the room like a wave walt found himself making a parallel to marie antoinettes lowering her head into the guillotine three clocks tolled throughout the house within a few seconds of one another pm he was late for dinner twentysix w alt joined his father at a table in the near corner of the pioneer saloons restaurant just below a wall display of barbed wire jerry sat with his back to a pair of rawhide snowshoes the tabletop was sealed in so many coats of polyurethane that it looked like a piece of amber sorry im late nothing new a bouncy waitress arrived walt ordered a house salad and ribs his father a bowl of corn chowder a thick cut of prime rib and another scotch jerry already looking drunk indicated a copy of the express weekender hed been readinga seasonal supplement to the towns weekly paper this just in youve got birds shitting in your county dog pound and a cougar snacking on yellow lab mountain dogs the wild west certainly offers challenging crimes walt had no desire to mention salt lake and start an argument beats working for a living you should patch it up with gail for the sake of the kids gail is where she should be dad leave it alone shes your wife was the truth of the matter is she was a great wife a terrific wife but a lousy mother she never rose to the job and knew she never would say what you want but some women arent cut out for it just as some guys arent and shes one of them it was never going to work this is you talking shed tell you the same thing i promise its going to wreck the kids jerry mumbled trying to sip scotch at the same time believe it or not theyre way better than they were now when they see her its for a few hours a half day at most and she can handle that just fine thrives shed grown gloomy and shorttempered it was a bad scene shes your wife i know it violates your ozzie and harriet sensibilities dad but its working leave it alone if it aint broke but it is broke no its not and why we go around on this every time we talk i dont know whats with that five minutes passed in silence walt didnt hear the nearby conversations or the music or the guys behind the grill calling out ordersonly a droning whine in his ears that the beer would not quiet his fathers voice saying shes your wife why the end run this afternoon why cut me out like that walt said how can that possibly help anything you took that all personal it wasnt like that you cant stand the thought of me running this can you i never said that a second scotch was delivered along with the salad and soup jerry ignored the soup if she made the announcement early walt said it might help youve had protection experience jerry found this amusing save your energy for this cougar another silence descended their meals were delivered is it so impossible that we all might actually work together walt suggested is that your experience talking wheres this coming from what did i do to deserve this jerry made a point of dramatically checking his watch we dont have near enough of that kind of time dont mix me up with bobby jerry slapped the table his drink jumped he won the attention of a few nearby tables he leveled his bloodshot eyes at walt wiped his wet lips with his napkin and then carefully sawed through his slab of prime rib i asked myra and kevin to join us for dessert walt said if you dont want to see them course i do kevin needs us dad needs us as role models not constantly at battle maybe we could declare a truce for a few minutes tonight jerry sought answers in his reflection in the drink what battle and at some point weve got to clear the air on bobbys death the mans eyes flashed darkly kevin and myra need closure keeping it to yourself im not keeping anything to myself you think youre protecting us i know your hearts in a good place on this but its boomeranging all the kings horses and all the kings men jerry said we cant help bobby but we can put this family back together dad you and gail are doing your part right jerry pulled on the scotch rescuing the ice cubes from drowning he peered out from beneath his brow cruelly then set the drink down without a sound walt spotted myra and kevin by the grill scanning tables here they are walt said remember dad hes not a little boy anymore jerry drained the drink shut the hell up twentyseven t revalian occupied a high stool in a darkened corner near the entrance to the duchin lounge at the place was jumping immediately to his left a madison avenue type remade in threehundreddollar jeans and colorfully stitched cowboy boots made sloppy with a woman twenty years his junior they drank from martini glasses she had an annoying habit of reapplying her lipstick between sips and kisses joe fosa filipino in his sixtiesanimated jazz standards and show tunes with keyboard flourishes the bass player pulled the drummer along and the dancers never rested at standing room only the volume of conversation overpowered the attempts of young waitresses taking orders trevalian nursed a drambuie not out of any great love for the potent liqueur but because it promised to color his breath for the next several hours and that might prove important he had yet to find a way to work around the loss of ricky the idea had been to establish himself with the dog so that a substitution wouldnt be noticed at the set break he studied the clientele the clubby familiar way they moved from table to table saying their hellos with air kisses and firm handshakes bits and pieces of conversation reached his corner golf film and some politics elizabeth shalers name surfaced more than once he kept an eye on the door in case she happened by hed read the new yorker piecehed read nearly everything written about her knew her better than she knew herself old habits died hard when the band began again it did so as a quartet behind the enchanting voice of a dirty blonde in her midthirties she wore a tightfitting red cocktail dress with a plunging neckline that tickled her navel shed worked on her face to look young and innocent but her smoky emotionally charged voice added to her years she won herself light applause but deserved better another place another time and he might have been interested shaler never showed the combo stopped at the snifter on the piano overflowing with twentydollar tips the tables slowly emptied ahead of the am closing trevalian left the lodge stepping out into the surprisingly chilly mountain air he walked quietly along the beautifully lit paths past the shops the theater and the pond reaching the inn he continued on out into the parking lot and beyond finally reaching a delivery alley moonlit gray scattered clouds raced overhead sliced into pieces by the mountain peaks he worked into a slight stagger for appearances sake and proceeded down the narrow strip of asphalt toward the loading bays behind the inn from the study off cutters kitchen trevalian had found the wifes outlook program up and running and hed scanned her calendar for appointments and appearances two entries had mentioned shaler by name the opening luau on friday night and the luncheon on sunday at am rafe nagler had an invitation to the luau but not to the luncheon his foray tonight was to study the layout of the banquet room ahead of her keynote on sundayto pace off exit routes and familiarize himself with the look and feel of the ballroom through eyes not clouded by prosthetic contact lenses his skin cool his heart rate calm trevalian casually entered a loading bay and moved through a dark service hallway behind the banquet room he passed food service trolleys discarded aprons and a wall phone with a stretchedout cord the corridor smelled unpleasant but not unfamiliaryears of spilled salads comingling with the stain of human sweat he pulled open a fire door marked banquet room c he stepped inside sand the entire ballroom floor was covered in it three inches deep or more trevalian sank into it both astonished and horrified then he recalled the friday night dinner had been themed a luau and he marveled at patrick cutters excess would it stay the weekend or would it be removed by sunday if it stayed it would prove a formidable obstacle for him his eyes were just beginning to adjust when he heard voices at the far doors someone was coming inside twentyeight n early an hour earlier at am walt had hit a wall of fatigue while attempting to catch up on paperwork preparing to call it a night hed been organizing the salt lake photos when he saw one of the retail spaces tornapart ceiling then he checked shalers master schedule grabbed his gun belt and took off at a run now at nearly am driving north he called obriens cell phone did i wake you he asked i wish answered the security man walt asked did your guys check the banquet room after the workers got out of there you worry too much i like that about you weve got all day tomorrow the first real event is the luau tomorrow night shalers scheduled for a walkthrough and sound check at am preregistration he could practically hear obrien thinking we need to sweep the room walt announced im heading up there im going to do a walkthrough tonight tonight how bout first thing in the morning weve got to move patrick back into the residence he dined in town following the party walt could hear obriens despair private security often amounted to little more than babysitting hed never envied his father his sixfigure salary for this reason obrien offered to send two of his guys over to help walt im good ive got patrols doing nothing this time of night with obrien still making offers walt politely signed off and called tom brandon brandon was off duty when he failed to reach him walt turned off into the red top trailer park with so many of the trailers looking the same he drove past brandon s on his first try it wasnt the trailer but his wifes car that stopped walt on the second try gails minivan was parked in brandon s driveway he slowed then continued on catching sight of the trailer in his rearview mirror dark locked up for the night he pulled to the corner stopped and threw his head against the steering wheel he couldnt catch his breath his heart was doing a tumbling act he squeezed out tears before he knew it then leaned back and wiped his face on his sleeve he kept checking the rearview mirror the minivan and the trailer now quite small in the frame hoping hed gotten the wrong place the wrong car he drove around the block again and this time checked the plates stopped at the same corner ached the same way he thought back to brandon s comment about running against him in the primary and he saw it on a whole new level his deputy was doing his exwife stealing the best thing in his life never mind that it had to end it didnt have to end like this and for a brave moment walt considered confronting them both then he drove on in a daze of confusion a lump like a piece of coal rammed down his throat he did his best to control his voice and summoned his patrols over the radio but a bear had been reported tearing up trash cans midvalley and his two available cars had responded he headed to sun valley alone and afraid in a way hed not felt his fathers sarcastic sting about the nature of crime in the valleyhis jobechoed uncomfortably in his mind gail had moved on it was all but unthinkablebut think about it he did he checked in at the inns front desk not wanting sun valley security mistaking him for a prowler the bavarian woman behind the desk said no one was to enter the banquet rooms until morning he touched his sheriffs badge pinned to his uniform im not asking im just letting you know im here if youd like id be happy to wake larry raffles walt pulled out his cell raffles managed the resort she declined though a little frostily dangled a set of keys and led walt down a walnutpaneled corridor she unlocked a set of doors for him and accompanied him inside a geometric shape of light flooded across lavishly decorated tables andsand the young woman found some lights enough to navigate ill make sure its locked when i leave and ill stop by the desk so you know ive left he thanked her the door clunked shut behind her the room was shaped like a shoebox with walt in the center of one of the long sides he faced the elevated riser from where liz shaler would give her talk it currently held six potted palm trees gift boxes sat at each place setting envy nibbled at waltthat cutter or anyone should have this kind of disposable income he dragged his feet through the thick sand wishing he could take his boots off he reached the riser knee height and rimmed with a navy blue skirt through his grief frustration and fatigue something tugged at him hed come to respect such sensations he stood absolutely still blood thumping past his ears his throat dry wishing for more light he spotted a bank of dimmer switches forty feet away almost automatically he unsnapped his holster felt the cool of its gnarled grip moved silently sweat breaking out all over him the bank of light switches was too far he felt drawn to his right and he followed his instinct his boots moved absolutely silently in the sand he passed one table after another looking left right ahead and behind the tablecloths cascaded down to seat height screening the area beneath the tables leaving fifty hiding places to search his radio clipped to his waist spit with static sheriff whats your twenty a blur to his right a mans form raced for an exit slammed a door open and vanished before walt got a decent look at him running now walt reached for his radios handset and called out the code for a suspicious person tenoneohseven in pursuit on foot sun valley inn request backup his belt snagged a tablecloth and dragged it off to the sound of exploding wineglasses he burst into a service hallway that was pitch black he reached down and silenced his radio took two steps forward smashed into a food dolly tripped and went down on one knee jumped to his feet his eyes stinging to pierce the dark the suspect had disappeared twentynine t revalian hidden behind a meal cart kept his back to the wall he knew the quickest way out the service hallway to the loading platform he knew hed be exposed for several seconds if he ran but a moving target at least the sheriff was less than ten feet awayunmoving barely breathing more professional more careful than hed have thought with his back literally against the wall he once again calculated the time and distance to the end of the hall he walked himself through the sharp left turn to the loading dock he had no desire for confrontation only escape he hesitated only briefly then he shoved the food cart and ran thirty w alt drew his weapon as the cart smashed into the wall he didnt remember grabbing his flashlight but there it was held with the gun as if a single piece the dark shape of a man juked right and left zigzagging down the hall and was gone walt turned left at the end of the hall and broke through hanging ribbons of sheet plastic used as a cold barrier he jumped off the loading dock lost his balance and fell forward as he came to his feet the suspect was now twenty yards ahead of him a very fast runner walt holstered the gun at a full sprint he wasnt going to shoot only to find it was a high school kid or the wayward son of a hotel guest he followed out onto the first fairway of the sun valley golf course and heard the tickticktick of lawn sprinklers before he felt the first cold shower within seconds he was soaked through his boots slogging through the spongy grass he trailed the suspect by twenty yards as he followed him through a wall of towering evergreens and out into a back parking lot the man ran well and showed no signs of slowing having increased the gap between them beyond the lot loomed a field of white tents that walt recognized as the sun valley art show closed for the night the tents covered two acres and offered the suspect a place to get lost he disappeared there walt several long seconds behind walt slowed to a walk catching his breath listening for the man he was soaked through his boots squishing with each step the vendors had lowered the walls of the tents he took his weapon back in his hand aimed the flashlight tent to tent yanking back flaps and peering inside he worked down the row the man was here walt leaned forward for the next tent when a sharp snap of fabric turned him around in time to see the darkened figure take off and disappear around a corner walt cut through between tents arriving in the adjacent aisle he saw a tent jerk and wiggle as his quarry caught a foot on a rope walt crashed through into the next aisle he spotted the man to his right just rounding a corner walt took off at a sprint hugging the same corner the other man jumped out and connected with walt shoving him and using his momentum to lift him off his feet walt was catapulted into a tent across the aisle crashed into and through the front wall of canvas and took out the legs of a portable table he rolled came to his feet tripped over a horse saddle and went down hard a harsh beam of light filled his eyes sheriff that you what the hell the voice belonged to a sun valley company security man out of breath walt coughed out a guyrunning he pointed after him the security man just stood there confused what guy walt pushed past the man into the aisle empty what guy the guard repeated whered you come from walt asked how could you not have seen him didnt see no one heard you crashing around over here came running get on the radio i dont want any cars leaving the main lot anyone with wet hair gets detained wet hair yes sir walt took off toward the lodge the hit man was here to kill liz shaler he had no doubt now given the element of surprise the man could have done far worse to him stabbed him broken his neck taken his gun but hed attempted none of these and instead of making him an amateur it marked him a pro hed done the minimum required to get cleanly away intentional or not the man had delivered a message and whether dryer chose to or not walt intended to listen friday one o ver the incessant din of the weather channel danny cutter heard the telephone systems unique ring tone that signaled an arrival at the front door of his brothers compound he continued on the elliptical as he used the television remote to view a fisheye image of ailia holms dressed in a twocolor gray zippered shell white ipod wires in her ears she stared up toward what was supposed to be a hidden camera she mouthed hello her hair was pulled back into a single ponytail her cheeks red with the cool morning air danny resentfully disembarked the trainer punched a button on the phone and told her be right there the gym occupied the upper floor of the swimming pool barn he navigated his way back through the series of renovated barns to the front doora twominute brisk walk a towel draped around his neck he answered the door hey there ailia said stepping inside without invitation danny eased the door shut sleep well she used her vixen voice the voice of the woman who had seduced him the night before hes not here danny said hes up at the lodge the rest of the guests all arrive before noon she touched his cheek hot and sweaty just how i left you last night you could try his cell im taking a run out adams gulch she explained you want to come with patricks compound abutted state forest land aspen and evergreenshrouded mountains were braided together with interlocking bike and foot trails im just wrapping up he said declining theres coffee if you want staff arrives at eight isnt that right she checked her watch and cozied up to him we could put that twenty minutes to good use rain check he said she complained it doesnt rain much here danny you know that she stepped away and looked around the room youd never guess there were a hundred people here last night she had a sultry walk as she prowled the room he felt himself stir he wanted none of that already resenting the night before can i leave a message or something or something she said allie she turned to face him come on danny im just kidding around they both knew differently why so serious ive got news for you good news for a change the least you could do is pretend youre glad to see me we talked about this not really i dont remember talking all that much he fought back an urge to just walk away and leave her before it got out of hand again ive arranged a meeting between you and stu he felt his breath catch i expressly asked you can thank me now if you like she checked her watch weve still got eighteen minutes she closed to within an arms reach you know how hard it was to set up a meeting given his conference schedule danny felt his face flush dont gush with thanks all at once i can take it in little bits or little bites or whatever i asked you to leave it alone you know me danny im impulsive he took her by both wrists and backed her up several feet against a couch shit danny that hurts he drove himself against her pelvis against pelvis is this what you want allie nice and rough you want it on the couch on the kitchen counter where youre hurting me she gasped you love it fuck you you wish he let go of her stepped back panting she inspected her wrists shit danny i think you

fucked up he said not anymore dont be so sure she pulled the heavy front door open morning sunlight had broken onto the opposing hillside setting it on fire she didnt look at him just walked outside she started into a slow jog turned at the end of the drive and broke into a full run danny stepped back inside shaken by what hed done he wondered where such anger came from and worse where it could lead two v eterinarian mark akers low voice growled as he walked stiffly and slightly bowlegged toward the sun valley lodge walt at his side this guy must be charmed you pulled off a miracle his dark brown eyes peered out from his tanned bearded face in his right hand he held a dark blue nylon leash leading a finelooking german shepherd we walt corrected and i dont even know how we did it he has maggie to thank and patrick cutters wallet this is costing north of five hundred bucks a day walt whistled whats amazing is she looks just like his dogthe one that died animals and commercial aircraft shouldnt mix the lodges portico was crowded with vehicles valet personnel and bellmen one of the bellmen caught sight of the dog and moved to intercept mark aker service dog walt said being delivered to a hotel guest sure thing sheriff walt had called ahead nagler had tried to talk him out of the offer we may have to sell him on this walt warned i doubt it aker replied toey will sell herself three w ith the opaque contact lenses blocking his vision and anxiety welling in his chest trevalian awaited the arrival of the sheriffthe sheriffyet enjoying the irony that the man was now supplying him with a dog that he desperately needed he sat on a couch in the lobby karl the bellman as his eyes here they are karl announced oh sir shes a finelooking dog trevalian stood a finelooking german shepherd you should see everyone looking at her queen of the ball mr nagler the sheriff sheriff nagler said i believe you may have met mark aker yesterday he and aker shook hands in less fortunate circumstances the vet said but allow me to introduce toey toey nagler said karl took the cane from trevalians hand and aker put the leash into his grip trevalian squatted and toey immediately licked his face shes service trained aker said and ready to go are you now toey trevalian said petting the dog furiously shell direct you to a handrail on stairs on your signal aker said shell move through a doorway and return to working position a smart girl are you trevalian said take her for a spin aker asked i couldnt possibly but youve got to the sheriff said its all been arranged trevalian looked up in the general direction of that voice play hard to get he thought sheriff do you have dogs three then you know theres a bond of trust that forms between the handler and the animal whatever i do with toey will only corrupt whatever training shes had to this point will spoil her for her real owner as much as id love her company and her help id be doing a disservice to her and the people who trained her three days is not going to undo fourteen months of training trevalian leaned his head far back smiled and rocked side to side if anyone happened to catch a look behind his sunglasses they would see only milky orbs without pupils or irises toey he said excitedly you want to take a walk he imagined aker and the sheriff silently congratulating themselves he wondered how theyd feel two days from now taking hold of the dogs service harness he ordered in a crisp voice walk together they maneuvered around the crowded lobby trevalian stifling a grin of satisfaction the sheriff of all people he had his substitute his original plan was back on track four t he mountains rose steeply on either side of him a narrow canyon called chocolate gulch with a creek that snaked between two dozen custom homes the mouth of the canyon intersected highway to the east while to the west it was covered by vast stands of lodgepole pine and douglas fir the rolling green of which was broken only by rock outcroppings copses of aspens and patches of deadfall with his dog in the lead the tall nondescript man held to a game path a narrow sometimes aimlessly bending strip of bare dirt and rock cut into the side of the hill by years of use by deer and elk below him the rich green lawns were laid out like quilt squares connected by stitching of postandrail fences he shifted the rifle to his opposite shoulder hunched low and moved stealthily his breath shooting staccato puffs of gray fog out in front of him the dog pulled eagerly leading him to a stand of saplings hearing voices he ducked and peered down at the houses below and located the source of that sound a man and woman in a hot tub he wanted to avoid being seen men with rifles drew attention the dog had picked up a fresh scent and he intended to stay on it the rifle shot would announce him but by then the deed would be done and hed have earned his pay less than a quarter mile later with the last of the homes behind him he slowed as the dog slowed she glanced at him then shivered head to toe in excitement as she lifted her front paw into a curl on point she leaned forward it took him a second to spot his target forty yards below she sat with her back to the hill quietly he slipped the rifle off his shoulder he lowered to one knee and brought the sight to eye level a stream of drool fell from the dogs mouth to the dry leaves with the target now magnified he held his breath and gently squeezed the trigger the gun recoiled in his grip and the shot rang out echoing down the canyon like a beautiful piece of music the cougar spun sharply trying to bite the dart that dangled from its haunch then it twitched and its front legs went out from under it it looked once up the hill at its assailant collapsed completely and rolled onto its side five w alt blew across the top of the coffee mug as dick obrien stabbed a roasted potato shoveled some scrambled egg on top of it and stuffed it into his mouth fuckin delicious he said his teeth yellow with egg not hungry walt said the lodges lobby restaurant hummed with conversation while waitresses dressed like heidi their busts bulging moved between tables shuttling trays the room smelled of cinnamon and maple syrup walt sat across from obrien at a table near the door so well lock down the banquet hall tighter than a teenager obrien said i have daughters walt reminded watch yourself it could have been anybody this guy is already here it could easily have been one of the first rights kids obrien said you know that walt this guy was in shape careful he knew tactics does that fit the profile of your average wto protester listen you know what kind of headache this is for me id just as soon shaler head back to new york but the boss this is his moment in history you wont convince him walt looked at him skeptically the coffee was battery acidor maybe that was his stomach you married walt asked happily listen well lock down the ballroomthis is after my guys sniff itand well keep it locked and under guard right up until the speech agreed obriens demeanor instantly changed and walt didnt need to look over his own shoulder to see it was patrick cutter behind him sheriff cutter said taking a chair by walt that was a heck of a thing you did for rafe nagler we did walt said including him but yeah it was a good moment were just discussing last night obrien said i heard you had a runin true story walt said and that you were unable to identify the trespasser he was in the banquet room and he didnt want to be caught walt sipped the bitter coffee for me that speaks volumes just dont speak it too loudly cutter said walt lowered his voice we have to assume it could have been the contractor i assume no such thing cutter said we were just running down a bunch of other possibilities obrien explained first rights chief among them and i was pointing out walt said that this guys behavior was totally pro never looked back was familiar with avoidance tactics vanished into thin air when it came time and if he left the property he did so on foot we locked down the parking lots and came up blank so youve got nothing cutter said ive got a sore side from where the guy hit me and real strong suspicion of the kind of person i was dealing with walts cell phone rang he checked the screen and took the call as he listened his face tightened obrien signaled for the check as walt finished the call and hung up fish and game took down a cougar out chocolate gulch darted it the one that went after my brother patrick asked possibly what the hell do you do with a drugged cougar obrien asked kill it i hope said patrick things a menace theyll probably cage it down at the poundthe humane society in hailey walt said she was wearing a tag so this is at least her second dose of drugs not good because obrien asked surprisingly patrick interrupted they used to use pcp to drug the bears and lions it was discovered with the bears that the drug made them overly aggressive released back into the wild they presented more of a threat to humans not less im impressed walt said i sit on the societys board and the cougar obrien asked walt she doesnt stay there forever im guessing they have a pen there that can hold her walt said they wont want to destroy her but they cant rerelease her tough being a cougar obrien said in captivity yes agreed walt patricks assistants appeared in the doorway looking for him he sensed them turned and signaled for them to wait a minute he said to obrien keep me up on this yes sir i will and you too sheriff i want to know what youre thinking obrien signed for the check walt protested but not too hard cutter left with his two assistants he was immediately approached by conference guests walt walked out with obrien i wouldnt want that many friends i thought youre elected obrien said yeah i am but thats all rigged he said patting obrien on the back six t he pavement stopped at a variegated edge where chunks of tar met brown dust marking the boundary between civilization and wilderness walt spotted fionas beatup subaru among the vehicles parked at the chocolate gulch trailhead he was calling his location to dispatch when she knocked on the side window startling him he looked at her noticing for the first time a constellation of freckles under her jaw but as he rolled down the window the freckles moved down her neck nothing but fly specks on the glass some detective he thought you mind if i tag along she asked pam wants some shots pam brummell was the publisher of the weekly newspaper the sun valley sentinel no problem he rolled the window back up and climbed out its actually not my scene fish and game they walked together at am the sun was quickly warming the air the treecovered hills alive with sunlight the sky an indigo blue i hope youre not gloating over the fact they got the cougar before the cougar got anyone else because thats blind luck if you ask me for one thing walt said i dont gloat for another we have no way of knowing if this is the same cat its a very dry summer a lot of game is coming out of the hills for the river this is where the yellow lab was killed yes but you and danny cutter and liz shaler were ten miles south of here cougars cover a lot of territory but thats a good hike walt admired her from behind as she mounted the trail she walked a bit like a cat herself they reached a backpack on the game trail and looked down through the woods to see the cat lying on her side a man kneeling next to her walt and fiona scrambled down the slope the cat lay by a slow trickle of a stream her black eyes open giving the impression she was dead but the steady rise and fall of her rib cage said otherwise the agent had spread petroleum jelly over her open eyes to protect them from drying out but the result was a deathly gaze sedated the man introduced himself as a fish and game agent he looked vaguely familiar to walt shes beautiful fiona said already preparing her equipment hell of a shot walt said from up on the game trail yeah i got lucky being downwind or shed have bolted the dart still dangled from her shoulder there was something sad about seeing so graceful and powerful an animal brought down like this a collision of man and nature the pungent decay of soil and the mint of the evergreens comingled the agents doga yellow labwas tied to an aspen sapling walt asked is that dog trained for explosives by any chance no just a tracker walt thought he knew all the tracking dogs in the valley this one was new to him whats to become of the cat fiona asked now taking photographs the agent pointed out the ear tag and explained shed be caged and theyd look for a home for her and if you cant find a home for her she asked we usually do we have a month or more the agent answered doesnt seem fair fiona said do we even know if shes the one who killed the yellow lab i mean is she guilty of anything well be able to watch her stool for hair and bones thats one place caging her helps could she possibly have been down in starweather yesterday afternoon walt asked a male can travel twentyfive miles at night while hunting this one could have been in hailey last night starweather no problem fiona finished taking shots packed up her bag said goodbye to them both and trudged back up the hill it would help if we could connect this cat to the yellow lab walt told the agent there was an attack on a fisherman putting all those to bed would be a good thing we wont be able to confirm any of that and what i didnt want to say was chances are we wont find her a home walt looked down at the beautiful creature and felt depressed cougars and humans the agent said pausing is not a good mix add pcp into it and its a nightmare waiting to happen shes trouble sheriff may not be her fault but trouble just the same yeah walt said but she got here first were the interlopers the cats openeyed stare stayed with him on his return to the trailhead fionas car was gone he thought about finding gails car parked at brandon s trailer and his chest tightened hed spent the night on his own couch unable to sleep in their bed hadnt slept much at all he realized his marriage had officially ended it wasnt just talk and tears and lawyers anymore and it left an aching hole in him that even work couldnt fill he wanted to take the day off maybe hike up into the pioneers with the dogs he wanted change something to take away all the reminders of his own failure he climbed back into the cherokee and held firmly to the wheel unable to drive unable to move seven t revalian had a problem for his plan to work he had to take possession of the second dog a dog trained for scentand then make a switch the sheriff and the vet had unwittingly provided a dog to get his plan back on track but the vet mark aker from whom hed arranged to purchase a scent doga trackerweeks ago by phone had been introduced to nagler that same morning when delivering the service dog trevalian felt it too great a risk to allow aker to meet trevalian and nagler in the same day for fear he might make the connectiondoctors were if anything observant but this was the day prearranged for him to buy the tracker so hed timed his arrival in the lobby of akers veteranarian services an expansive log structure a few miles south of ketchum at a time he knew aker to be busy with an emergency surgery he hid his impatience from the receptionist wandering an area crowded with parakeet cages racks of kitty teasers and sacks of pet food then his impatience gave way and he approached the counter for the third time i dont mean to be rude but is there anyone else i might talk to about this he asked im afraid he asked that you wait she answered but the sale has been in place for several weeks he protested im under time constraints mark thinks of these animals as members of the family he handles all the sales personally but shes ready of course then could i at least see her he asked of course you can im so sorry its taking so long she came around from behind the desk and led trevalian out of the building across a courtyard to a small barn the moment they entered a half dozen dogs started barking callie was a threeyearold german shepherd with an energetic face and two black socks on the hind legs trevalian knelt and petted and talked to the dog shes trained to track yes he asked the receptionist all the search and rescue dogs are she replied all are expert trackers yes trevalian asked for a demonstration and the receptionist humored him he watched and listened carefully to the specific commands used he committed them to memory along with callies expressions and reactions she gave him two full demonstrationsthe dog obviously enjoying the game of pursuing a scent and receiving a reward for her success trevalian glanced at his watch making sure the receptionist saw him do so certainly it cant make any difference who takes my cashiers check mark would kill me weve spent over a year training callie hes going to want to say goodbye trevalian considered killing her himself and if he loses a twentythousanddollar sale trevalian proposed for the first time he saw a crack in her determination he pressed on i could call him to make sure weve covered everything leave you my cell phone number well she didnt sound as convinced as before maybe i can interrupt him she said why dont we try one more time as trevalian followed her back to the main building he looked for any security cameras that might be recording him and saw none the receptionist disappeared into the back of the building returning a moment later i think youre in luck she said hes at a point in the procedure where he can take a minute or two to come out and meet you as his gut twisted trevalian attempted to look pleased im going to run over to the other building the woman said i wont be but a minute mark should be out shortly thank you she hurried through the door obviously pleased to be rid of him when she returned she found mark aker in his scrubs his gloves removed standing next to the reception desk with a perplexed look of confusion and irritation so aker asked her his voice revealing the degree of his annoyance is this some kind of joke mr meisner was right here a minute ago she said but the reception area stood empty eight t he gargantuan white tent shimmered in the late morning sunlight an imposing edifice of vinylcoated canvas supported by a steel superstructure more than fifty yards long and thirty wide it occupied most of a field adjacent to the art fairs temporary tent city walt parked across from the first rights protest where several dozen kids in their twenties were already gathered they waved posters and shouted global capitalism equals world starvation a hundred yards to the west wellheeled guests converged on the great white tent sun valley police maintained a perimeter around the protesters walt moved toward the tent where four of his deputies were working with obriens team to secure the event c was ten minutes away from its am opening for walt it felt like horses in a starting gate the months of planning came down to this moment he fought a fatigue headache and the soreness from the chase the night before the tent could seat an audience of twelve hundred in folding chairs the stage could hold a sixtyperson symphony orchestra at present the tent held four hundred folding chairs a bookstore and a coffee house with a dozen café tables on persian rugs a dale chihuly chandelier hung overhead robert kelly oil paintings lined the interior walls there were potted trees azaleas in bloom custom pillows and a red silk draped ceiling that created the atmosphere of the interior of an achaemenid tent dryers agents were clustered at the front row near liz shaler who was seated classical music played from speakers on either side of the stage and drowned out the anticapitalist chant obriens team swiped arriving attendees with security wandsnot enough of an imposition to be bothersome but enough precaution to imply a sense of security moving past the café and down the center aisle walt noticed that the tents side walls usually left open were tied shut with locking plastic cable ties the only way in and out was the one entrance through which walt had just come it might have been a result of his aborted pursuit the night before it might have been the sight of the protesters or the faint sound of their chanting it might have been his fathers presence it might have been his imaginations unrelenting imagery of brandon fucking his wife but whatever the reason he felt agitated and unsettledthat feeling like hed forgotten something patrick cutter wearing a blue blazer over a peach golf shirt stood conferring with his assistants to the right of the stage he looked confident and proud when a commotion began at the tents entrance it drew walts attention he turned and hurried toward it a pair of college kids confronting obriens guys walt had taken only a few steps when obriens guys converged from every direction most of obriens guys by the look of it eager for action as walt approached he caught a look in the eyes of one of the protesters a kid wearing a green first rights tshirtand it was not a look of despair or concern over being caught but one of satisfaction almost glee the kid made the mistake of looking toward the stage with anticipation walt immediately reached up for his radio stage entrance all units crash it now the two protesters had been sent as a diversion obriens men had swarmed leaving other areas unguarded now running down the center aisle walt shouted out red badge the three agents guarding liz shaler pulled her out of her seat pushed her into a crouch and formed a circle around her they rushed her to the side of the tent cut the plastic bands binding the tent panels and whisked her outside it all happened in a matter of seconds people jumped out of their seats blocking the stage walt couldnt get to patrick cutter whom he now also identified as a possible target he scrambled up onto the stage dodged across the set a coffee table a standing lamp and two leather chairs ahead of him he saw the far wall of the tent wave the result of air pressure the moving wave headed in cutters direction walt dove facefirst across the stage straight off the edge and into the person creating that wave something wet spread down him and as he pinned the kids arms restraining him he saw the blood it took him a moment to realize it was neither his nor the kids instead it was chicken blood intended as a political statement he rolled the kid over to cuff him the kid shrieked and hollered slogans about capitalism and human rights brandon appeared and quickly escorted the boy backstage patrick cutter hurried along the side of the stage to walt sheriff oh my god he said seeing the blood down his front how did you where did he come from thank you a thousand times thank you no problem walt said were lucky it was just a stunt you saved me a huge embarrassment are you all right sheriff he finally thought to say im fine im going to get out of here walt headed backstage cutter called after him i suppose that thing last night was probably just a dress rehearsal for this right walt turned the blood covering him from chest to knees his face and hands were smeared in it it was a different venue he said and that was a man last night not a college kid other than that yeah theyre pretty much exactly the same nine a t am sharp fifteen minutes after the conclusion of patricks opening address in the tent an event of unbridled excess that included a gift of a cutter communications mobile phone for every guest and marred only briefly by the disturbance stuart holms sat down with danny cutter in the hospitality suite stuarts head of security a balding man in a hawaiian shirt who introduced himself as emil made a quick sweep of the suite and left before he shut the door he gave danny the eye as if danny were trouble and the first thing that came to dannys mind was an image of ailia holms riding him the night before her face a grimace of wellearned pleasure stu holms took the couch selected a piece of cheese from a tray and nibbled on it so he said he looked much younger than danny remembered him a face job he wore a pair of creamcolored slacks and a dark green shirt he had wet eyes thin hair and ears like bird wings he needed more sun but his teeth were perfect dentures he seemed to be looking right through danny not at him so trilogy looks pretty damn good on paper or i wouldnt be here it is good danny said playing to his own strengths cheerful optimism came easily for him we have significant market penetration brand loyalty with our customers and fabulous packaging what we dont have is a national presence which is where my ten million comes in yes i get all that but listen danny i dont love paying for marketing and advertising infrastructure sure squawkcom could provide all your communications needs networking cabling phone and data the million you have in this budget will be more than enough we can save you a lot there your bottling plant makes sense to me securing your sourceabsolutely necessary imperative even but ad dollars not me not my money take that out of the cash flow of your existing business move my money into salaries and transportation human assets but i hate advertising whoever buys anything because of an ad they see danny

hemingway school on the west side of ketchum facing an athletic field and an overforty intramural soccer game walt had changed out of the bloodsoaked uniform shirt and into a black special tactics tshirt he kept in the back its not a favor youll be paid he said im scheduled to guide on the river most of the weekend its not like that i want you to loan us your camera gear you have your own stuff we dont have telephoto lenses and i cant rent them here in town the soonest salt lake can get them up here is monday and i need them today because there was an incident at the c opening i heard

putting you into that im touched she said sarcastically so ill partner with brandon just the words partner with brandon turned his stomach face recognition software requires good pictures walt highquality fullfrontal shots you think brandon is going to get this right he was transported back to his imagination gail and brandon sweating in the tight confines of the trailers bedroom earth to walt he heard her say okayokay he said youll team up with brandon he agreed anything he thought to keep brandon out of that trailer eleven t revalians trick was to put a liberal amount of vaseline laced with cayenne pepper up both nostrils his nose ran like a faucet and gave nagler the excuse to miss most of the events the beauty of the nagler identity was that the former academic was a virtual recluse rarely seen outside the think tank he did not travel in these circles nor was he known by them he crashed the invitationonly luncheon hed seen mentioned on cutters home computer no one would be so impolite as to bounce a blind man and they did not a place was set and he sat through the outdoor luncheon on the lawn of the guest house only three tables away from the woman hed come to kill had he not cared about his own freedom he might have run a knife through her and been done with it for the secret service agents kept their distance guarding the perimeter but not the woman with his semitransparent contacts in place trevalian could see well enough to not make a mess of eating prior to dessert he excused himself having exhausted his kleenex and wanting to set the hook as expected a secret service agent escorted him and toey to a golf cart that then shuttled him back to the lodge this planted the dogs existence firmly in the minds of the agents back in naglers room trevalian moved quickly with a rehearsed system of changing from one man to the other he locked the appropriate doors hung out the privacy tags and then left the rooms and took the stairs to the ground floor trevalian as hotel guest meisner walked hurriedly into the side lot where hed parked the rental he drove out onto sun valley road and parked along the bike path with a tourist map unfolded on the steering wheel ten minutes later two black escalades driving in tandem pulled up to the traffic light shalers escort he followed well back of the escalades turned and approached a building marked as the library the television crews gave away her home he parked and got out having not figured on such a scene there was no way he could get near her house without either being arrested or his face being shown on national television he studied the suddenly excited reporters and news crews all swilling tullys iced coffees from paper cups their enthusiasm manifested as shouting and screaming waned as shaler entered the house without comment these same news crews would likely be covering the brunch on sunday they would be in the room now he was the one who felt on edge jumpy and excited he passed the next fifteen minutes watching them while trying to find a way inside the journalists suddenly sprang back to life only to realize it was shalers hispanic housecleaner and not the ag at the side door but where they cursed with disappointment trevalian had to contain his excitement for the housecleaner carried a bulging white canvas sack in her arms a laundry bag the maid launched the sack into the back of a beatup chevy slammed the hatch and climbed behind the drivers wheel trevalian was back in the rental in seconds and had the engine running by the time she pulled out of the drive he followed knowing a maid wasnt going to check for tails she drove six blocks and parked he couldnt find a parking place he resorted to double parking in a private parking lot that warned of towing unauthorized vehicles he hurried from the car and caught the door to the suds tub as it swung shut behind the maid she thanked him hello maria a woman with stringy hair said from behind the counter even with two fans running the laundry suffered from high humidity and extreme heat shaler she said tapping on a keyboard and beginning her count as the laundry bag was inverted be with you in a minute she called out to trevalian no problem he said the appearance of this maid was a gift the icing on the cake came as the proprietor apologized to the maid that due to the extremely busy weekend and a broken washer pickup would be monday at the earliest no exceptions maria didnt seem to care she took a receipt offered trevalian a smile in passing and left carrying her empty laundry sack with her for his purposes that empty sack would do but he couldnt see how to get it without making a scene can i help you the proprietor inquired trevalian asked about the pricing threw in a few questions about timing and watched as the woman transferred shalers dirty clothes into a blue sack placed a sticker on it from the order form pinned a tag bearing a second sticker to the bag and then wedged the sack onto the second shelf from the floor with a dozen othersall identical i dont know if you heard she said over her shoulder but were a little backlogged because of a faulty washer im good he said youve been very helpful as he left he made a quick study of the businesss security system a challengebut nothing he couldnt work with twelve w alt met fiona in the parking lot of the golf pro shop she climbed into the cherokee and immediately fiddled with the airconditioning making it colder damn that suns hot she complained she worked with her camera pushing buttons on the back and then passed it to walt who held it gingerly on the small lcd screen he saw a photo of a man he recognized as andy bartholomew the selfproclaimed leader of first rights where is this the chairlift yeah river run you toggle this flywheel to move to the next shot she leaned in close to demonstrate and he tensed noticeably any proximity to a woman was too close for him right now even a bucket seat across a jeep made him feel as if she were in his lap she scorned him for his reaction but went back to her corner he toggled to the next shot what had been a blob in the first photo now turned out to be a mans shoulder also in this second shot the chairlift as a backdrop became more apparent the sun valley company operated a chairlift to the top of the mountain for summer sightseeing bartholomew and the man belonging to that shoulder were clearly in line for the chairlift the third photo caused him to gasp thats dick obrien thats what tommy said he didnt like her referring to brandon by his first name and nearly corrected her what the hell is cutters head of security doing with the leader of first rights tommy said that too i dont care about tommy brandon okay the words were out of his mouth before he knew it fiona sat up straight sorryi he pointed to the camera unable to make eye contact with her whatis going on she asked after a moment she obliged him advancing the images another several photos all taken within a few minutes of one another bartholomew and obrien boarded and rode a chairlift together oh shit walt mumbled sheriff the only reason you ride a twentyminute chairlift with someone like bartholomew is so that no one can listen in he said he threatened him she said thats what tommy said happened the big guy told the younger one that if he made any trouble for the conference thered be hell to pay thing is walt said it only takes about thirty seconds to do that so why all the cloakanddagger involving the chairlift thats a lot of trouble to go througha long ride to share with the guyif all youre going to do is try to scare him so so im going to find out twenty minutes later he and bartholomew occupied the front seat of brandon s bcs cruiser which was parked in a sinclair gas station across from the employee dormitories a few hundred yards from the site of the first rights demonstration walt introduced himself and shook hands with bartholomew a small man with an erudite face despite a grunge appearance he emphasized that the man was here of his own free will and was under no legal obligation to cooperate were cool i heard you took in the view from the top of baldy this morning walt said bartholomew grimaced its a small town i also heard dick obrien took that ride with you bartholomew studied the cars ceiling fabric he released a long exhale i like dick obrienive worked with him on the conference for the past four years i dont want to make accusations against a friend of mine without a complaint to back it up no complaints bartholomew said walt considered leaving it therehed done his duty if he threatened or extorted you mr bartholomew its my obligation to inform you that we will and can protect you against any such malfeasance such a big word for an idaho sheriff but then again sheriff walter fleming youre not your average county sheriff are you quantico trained your college degree at northwestern on a full ride former twoterm president of the states sheriffs association currently serving on the national association of counties your father a former fbi special agent you want a gold star for doing your homework go back to school walt said or do i counter by telling you youre a berkeley grad who joined the peace corps worked for naders election campaign in and then went off track youre an angry teen on steroids mr bartholomew im not interested in you only whether or not dick obrien threatened you i can handle myself which is what im afraid of its my job to handle dick obrien not yours dont mess with him you can relax sheriff his interest was in making a contribution to our cause walt mulled this over a contribution he said fifty thousand dollars twentyfive up front twentyfive when we cross the blaine county border he suggested we park ourselves on the capitols front lawn in boise fifty thousand dollars if you walked thats what the man said and what did you say walt asked i told him to get in line i turned down a hundred grand yesterday im in the wrong business who offered you the hundred no idea bartholomew said an anonymous phone call maybe it was a joke you have no idea who made the offer cutter i can understand bartholomew said he has his gig to protect but the first one who but cutter cares about it that much if you try to do to sun valley what you did to seattle walt warned youll be met with a show of overwhelming force shock and awe he said sarcastically let me tell you something sheriff youre limited to tear gas and rubber bullets and weve seen them both i have national guard reserves on call if you start something i will finish it and whom do i see if im threatened by the sheriff that would be me walt said trading ironic smiles with the man he reached for the missing door handle then knocked loudly on the glass for brandon to let him out walt stood up out of the car to find himself facetoface with his deputy bartholomew slid across the seat and also got out he headed across sun valley road back toward the demonstration sheriff brandon said when walt failed to move brandon was nearly a head taller walt hesitated his head spinning his fists clenched you two could have waited for the paperwork to come through brandon s adams apple bobbed in his throat he stiffened his posture standing at rigid attention walt opened his mouth to say more but then reconsidered shook his head and walked away he didnt look back to check as he crossed the road but he sensed the man was still standing there staring straight ahead and it gave him a much needed sense of satisfaction asshole he mumbled under his breath thirteen t revalian worked out hard before an operation believing it mitigated the adrenaline rushes late friday night he spent forty minutes on a treadmill and an elliptical and another twenty with light weightshalf his typical daily routine with the edge burned off his nerves he found his response time was quicker his thinking clearer as he returned from the late night workout his mind on the suds tub laundry and not the hallways wall of famephotos of gary cooper ernest hemingway jamie lee curtis and clint eastwoodhe spotted a scuffle ahead it appeared to be a feud between a husband and wife the man had hold of her upper arms he raised his voice drunkenly the woman wore a clinging formal dress her bare back to trevalian with each step she took to distance herself the man moved with heran awkward and dangerous dance she broke away from him with a sudden jerk turning toward trevalian it was the jazz singer from the night before the man was not her husband but some lech of a hotel guest trevalian quickened his step the singer spotted him locked onto him her eyes cried for help he knew better than to get involved in this but as the elevator bell dinged and the doors drew open he saw an opportunity the slobbering fool called out hey there you come back here were not done he looked about sixty though fit for his age trevalian moved toward her with deliberate speed her purse thumped against her flank trevalian hooked her elbow with his sweatsoaked arm spun her around on her high heels and escorted her into the elevator the elevator car lifted past the second floor sounding a bell they met eyes hers were bright with appreciation i hope that wasnt your husband trevalian said she held up her left hand no ring the elevator arrived at the third floor he held the door and let her pass she opened her mouth to thank him he said no charge the elevator doors closed and they turned in opposite directions then the violent cursing of a mans angry voice rose up the stairway she turned back toward him hide me please just for a minute on the job trevalian did not get involved he did not womanize five minutes he said he took her by the elbow and led her down the hallway they walked briskly as the mans voice became clearer far behind them trevalian broke into a light jog the woman stopped foisted her purse onto trevalian kicked off her heels squatted down to scoop them up hoisted her dress and took off at a run at the sight of him holding her purse she broke into a nervous laugh with the door to meisners room locked behind them and the jamb loop in place he said you know where the phone is he indicated his own sodden athletic wear and gathering a fresh change of clothes into his arms from the closet said im going to shower i am not going to spring out naked and attack you he said im sure you have someplace to go and if i stay she asked in her husky singers voice the lace of her bra showed she adjusted the lowcut dress could we make it ten minutes instead of five im heading out he was also about to dress in all black although that was enough in fashion not to be a problem when he came back out of the bathroom fifteen minutes later he found her sitting at the desk a hotel bottle of liquor uncapped she was drinking from a coffee mug shed applied some fresh lipstick they probably charge a fortune for these and im sorry but i needed it did you call someone he asked i didnt because she shrugged fine line im not supposed to offend the guests but i dont have to put up with that bullshit either if i bring security into itespecially this of all weekendsitll make it into more than it wasiswhatever he was hurting you hes an asshole but on a weekend like this the place is full of them im sorry he said but you cant stay no problem she rose adjusted her dress again and slipped on her shoes i owe you a drink rain check he said this is sun valley it snows here but it doesnt rain my loss can you walk me out she asked i can get you down to the lobby thatll do she extended her hand lilly peter he said providing meisners first name they reached the lobby without incident scouting the area she said i meant it about the rain check she turned she saw only his back heading down the same hallway from which hed first appeared fourteen j ust before midnight with the summer sky ripped in two by a vivid milky way walt entered friedman memorial airport still reeling over his brief encounter with dick obrien with obrien attending a dessert function at trail creek cabin where the commissioner of the fcc was giving an informal talk on the politics of policy to fortyfive special ticket holders hed suggested meeting walt at the hemingway memorial a welltrodden path less than a mile from the cabin walt had worked his way down through the dark flashlight in hand to hemingways bust the famous writer overheard everything they said obrien defensive from the start lit a cigarette its red ember traveling up and down like a firefly so the big man said i heard you spoke to bartholomew you might have told me you had him under surveillance i might have but i didnt hell of a view from up there obrien said im not telling patrick cutter his business wouldnt be any point obrien said sounding exasperated making that kind of offerit wouldnt hurt if i knew about it damned if i do damned if i dont did bartholomew tell you about the hundred k walt asked he did it wasnt us then who thats the hundredthousanddollar question obrien said let me run this by you if youve been planning to assassinate elizabeth shaler if youve paid out maybe half a million in fees and a good chunk in expenses and advance work wouldnt the arrival of first rights scare you just a little the protesters get nasty obrien speculated it shuts down the conference and you lose your shot at her the hundred grand serves as an insurance policyto make sure nothing upsets the conference obrien whistled tell me im crazy walt said wish i could obrien said lighting another cigarette it felt as if several minutes passed obrien with the cigarette the sound of the creek obrien exhaled a pale cloud i cant take this to cutter as further proof of the hit if thats what youre asking the hell you cant do you trust some guy who let his protesters cause two million dollars worth of damage in downtown seattle patrick cutter wont she should cancel that speech hes going to need more thats bullshit walt said patrick will see this as a negotiating stance nothing more he eats guys like bartholomew for lunch this kid has zero credibility obriens words stayed with walt as he entered the air terminal hed received a message that petethe former volunteer fireman who now ran airport securityhad to see him immediately hed called but reached voice mail heading to hailey anyway he swung by the airport hey walt pete said greeting him at the automatic doors hed been waiting for him pete wore extraextralarge and had hands like an nba player he sounded as if hed smoked from birth what have you got walt asked releasing the handshake before it became a contest yesterday you and brandon pete said the dog thing yes flight seventeenfortysix if you say so walt said he followed down a wide corridor to the two small and unattended airline counters pushed through a door marked authorized personnel only the back room was crowded with unclaimed luggage pete its been a long day the way it works anymore pete said is we gotta send back lost items to salt lake they got the fullsize xray machines down there but we cant scan em because of their size so we open them up in this case we could scan it and we also did a hand search pete walt said again yesterday you were looking for some guy on flight seventeenfortysix today we got ourselves an unclaimed bag from seventeenfortysix he mugged for walt letting him stew i wouldnt have bothered you walt except for its contents its contents walt repeated pete hoisted the bag onto a table and dumped it upside down the contents scattered pete said suture bandages hypodermic needles fuckin traveling emergency room only thing missing is a scalpel and you got yourself a regular surgical suite walt moved the contents around using his pen you touch any of this no sir pete said its good work pete walt said syringes got through security diabetics are allowed syringes see em all the time more than one or two youre usually asked to put it in with the checked luggage not always walt inventoried the contents a navy blue sweater a paperback novel by leslie silbert three boxes of bandage wrap a box of butterfly bandages a pair of forceps two pairs of needle holders two containers of suture marked ethicon and ethicon a box of latex gloves shit walt said no id no none he studied the sweater some hairs looks like maybe some prints on these boxes or the forceps who leaves something like this behind you know wouldnt you come back to get it i would walt returned the contents to the bag he noted a white loop of stretch string at the bottom of one of the back straps this coulda been an id he said could have been tore off years ago walt glanced around the disorganized room and its filthy floor do me a favor and ask these guys to sweep up lets run any loose id tags they find against passenger manifest pete stated done walt wrote down the contents of the bag listen petecould you buy me the weekend before sending it down there walt asked he knew tsa regulations were strict id like to get some of these items to the nampa lab the lab will do weekend work for the right price prints pete said you think its possible i got ya covered itll miss the morning flight shit happens pete sniggered he zipped the bag shut and handed it to walt monday morning i need it back by seven walt thanked him right or wrong he connected the bag to the shooter the medical contents suggested the preparation for injury if the man was prepared to doctor himself he meant business and if such a man was so prepared to treat himself then what exactly did he have planned for liz shaler saturday am one a t a few minutes before am as the bars were closing the quiet streets briefly came alive again vehicles filled main street the sidewalks were crowded with late night revelers a young woman bent over and emptied her stomach into the gutter this was also the hour that city police and deputy sheriffs set speed traps and watched for erratic driving trevalian had a thirtyminute window by am the town would be dead and the cops would respond more quickly to a breakin it took him seven minutes to pick the lock on the back door of suds tub he entered to the alarm systems steady beepinga thirtysecond grace period to enter a pass code he had options open to him if he failed to disarm it in time but he kept a running count as he located the alarm box five seconds flipped open the panel and keyed in the last four digits of the laundrys phone number ten secondsthe warning beep continued he crossed the room to the cash register fifteen secondsran his gloved hand around the shelving and came up with a small key that opened the cash register twenty seconds opened the cash register removed the empty tray cleared away some receipts there on the bottom of the drawer was a handwritten number on a small piece of paper covered in layers of scotch tape twentyfivetwentysix he raced back to the alarm box on the back wall twentyeighttwentynine he quickly keyed in the beeping stopped the red flashing led on the device disappeared he locked the door from the inside he carried a maglite with red tape over the lens cutting back its brightness he ran a quick inspection no motion sensors he rearmed the alarm working under the assumption that leaving a commercial building without its alarm engaged might raise suspicions the box beeped for another thirty seconds and then went silentthe system active he had fifty or sixty identical blue bags to search one of them was shalers he checked the tags and rolled bags out of his way vehicles sped past out on the street a group of noisy kids left their shadows on the front window trevalian had pulled a balaclava over his head but he lifted it to get better vision he worked methodically through the piled sacks ten minutes into it he located shalers he opened it and with the maglite clenched between his teeth searched the contents he took out a bra two pairs of panties and finally touched the holy grail a capilene pullon sports top he sniffed just to make sure sour he tucked these items into a pouch on the back of his shirt pulled the drawstring on the sack and was in the midst of tying it shut when the back door was kicked in simultaneously the alarm box began its countdown trevalian pulled the balaclava over his face police two people came through the door but with them backlit by a streetlamp he saw they were too small to be adults they were just kids he decided to intimidate whos there he shouted stepping forward the kids panicked one turned stumbled over a drum of chemicals rose to his feet and sprinted to the nearest window which he promptly dove through or tried to a crash of glass but he didnt make it all the way thrashing and bleeding he fell back inside the building eric the other kid cried trevalian hurried over to the fallen boy the kid was in shock but still tried to move away from trevalian he smeared his own blood on the floor with his movement trevalian took the boys right hand uncurled his unwilling fingers and pressed the fingers against the gash on his neck push here as hard as you can the alarm sounded a robotic voice announced intruder intruder get out of the house now at a numbing volume the second kid screamed eric and took off out the back door trevalian went after him his buddy needed to keep that pressure up if the boy should pass outbut the kid panicked and ran hard toward the street his attention remained on trevalian a beat too long he ran headlong into an eightfoottall wooden grizzly bear he might as well have been hit by a truck he went down hard and lay still on the sidewalk the boy was out cold bleeding from his ear and nose it looked as if hed shattered the bone around his right eye socket he was breathing a siren grew louder trevalian blended into shadow and disappeared he was well on his way back to the rental before the first cruiser arrived two m ost people when under the harsh tube lighting of the sheriffs office looked somewhat green and sickly but not fiona she had an intriguing look about her fan lines at the edges of her eyes giving her wisdom and her small but pouty mouth something of a distraction walt studied her as she arranged the contents of the lostandfound carryon discovered at the airport she spread them out and began photographing them while maintaining a conversation with him it must strike you as odd she said some guy carrying around all this stuff atypical is how id classify it he said yeah thats exactly how id put it as well hed shut the door to the room and locked it because he didnt want anyone from his office seeing the bag or its contents for now the bag was all his tell me about your father hes here for the conference right she ran off a series of shots the usual sordid history he said sordids a strong word and accurate in this case fathers and sons mothers and daughters as old as the bible she said there wasan event he said a long time ago he felt on the verge of sharing something he had shared with no one she remained focused on the photography an event that does sound ominous she took a few more shots are you going to tell me about it no that hardly seems fair he put me through something he went from god to demon in an afternoon that doesnt sound pretty it wasnt pretty he added and the funny thing is ill bet he doesnt even remember it strange how that happensa kids world crumbles and the adult doesnt even take notice change is good look at what a strong leader youve become as an adult me walt didnt think of himself as a strong leader he felt like a failed husband and father if it had been adolescence it might have made more sense i was nine at the time i still worshipped at his feet at that point and youre not going to tell me its not youive never told anyone he said i dont know if his cell phone rang and he answered it he caught himself holding his breath as a nurse explained the situation to him he hung up its my nephew he muttered hes in the emergency room i gotta go is he all right walt couldnt get a word out hed lost his brother his marriage he couldnt lose kevin too he climbed into the cherokee and sped off his light rack flashing shed started him thinking about the past and he found himself stuck there his father had been drinking walt had no trouble remembering that day the furtive promise had been father to son filling walt with great expectancy hed labeled it a secret mission which further played to walts imagination causing his pulse to race he would not for any reason allow his mother to find out he was given the task of retrieving the neighbors cat a noisy vandal whose crimes included digging up his mothers rosebushes and crying loudly at all hours of the night chippers as the cat was known had become the stuff of legend in their house the subject of many dinner conversations chippers walt had saidan attempt to clarify his mission hes critical to the assignment his father said get chippers into the cage in the back of the car and wait for me the lure of the adventure had been intensified for walt by his fathers brandishing a handgun a sixshot revolver with a barrel as long as a ruler theyd been down in the basement together at the time it was a gray gun wrapped in a damp cloth with the sweet smell of gun oil his father had loaded and unloaded it inspecting it with a careful eye whats that for walt asked excitedly target practice do i get to shoot if youre a good boy if you get chippers into that car like i said but why chippers walt asked hes a hunter isnt he it was true chippers delivered a dead mouse or mole to their back door every so often with a beer pinched between his fathers legs they were off the ford pinto rattled a lot and smelled of exhaust they drove with the windows down chippers moaned in the back whats the mission walt asked now that they were alone and driving into the mountains a good soldier learns to never question his senior officer and he learns to keep his mouth shut even after the mission is over are we clear soldier yes sir thats good because this mission is top secret and id hate to see you lose rank and be prevented from taking future missions no sir wont happen whats a soldiers first duty to god and country the boy answered damn straight youre a good kid you know that to follow orders and never question authority walt repeated anything he could remember his father saying about army service now youre talking to boldly go where no man has gone before walt said his father laughed sipped the beer and returned the can to his crotch i borrowed that one son but thats the spirit you bet it is he looked at walt with a smile his father never smiled he put his eyes back on the road you remember a lot of the shithingsi tell you i try to remember them all walt said proudly youre a good kid have i told you that yes sir you have about one minute ago actually his father chuckled some more just so long as we got it straight between us that this mission is top secret even your brothers not to hear of it is that clear yes sir the idea of walt knowing something bobby did not was nearly too much for him to contain he jittered and jumped around in the front seathaving graduated backseat to front on his ninth birthday asked to fetch a second beer from the cooler he did so a task that required unfastening his seat belt while the car was moving hed never done that before either this was a day of firsts it was only while fetching the beer that he noticed an oilstained towel lying along the backseat he thought about asking but decided not to they drove up the narrow curving dangerously steep and precipitous onelane track to the top of trail creek summit the road was a composition of packed dirt and scree with no guardrails and drops of a thousand feet or more rock walls on the hillside leached water that streamed across the track cutting muddy ruts into the road bed his father handled the car poorly it jumped and skidded as the tires caught in the ruts more than once walt felt they were going over the edge he rode whiteknuckled his eyes straight ahead never questioning his superior officer not even when his father lost control of the car while juggling the beer fucking thing is a nuisance his father muttered under his beer breath walt wondered if this was a comment on road conditions or something else he nearly spoke up but his fathers mood was sliding as it often did he was muttering and talking to himself and looking up the mountain instead of at the road for the rest of the ride walt kept one hand on the door handle ready to jump shortly after they crested the summit the dirt road widened out crossing an open flat expanse of gray green prairie wax weed sage and tumblebush to the east loomed the jagged peaks of the pioneers and the barren faces of the white clouds they turned right onto a dirt track following signs to devils bedstead the name stuck in walts mind he would be haunted by it for the rest of his life a third beer was gone as they arrived at the trailhead unnamed lake devils bedstead an oppressive gray granite monster wearing a skirt of boulders rose from the lake blotting out the sky even in late july it wore a cap of ice and snow the car rolled to a noisy stop on the gravel and his father lumbered out from behind the wheel grabbing for the door to retain his balance it was cooler here despite a powerful sun walt tugged on a sweatshirt hed thrown into the backseat get the cage his father ordered while pissing only feet from the car his father zipped up his pants and came around the car shielding his eyes to survey up the mountain then he looked back down the road from where theyd come he wore the revolver on his belt in a leather holster that carried an insignia from the backseat he withdrew the stained towel that he now unwrapped to reveal a twelvegauge overunder doublebarreled shotgun sunlight flickered dimly off its polished barrels as his old man tucked the gun beneath his left armpit now walt understood what his father had in mind why hed been sworn to secrecy he knew too not to question or go up against his father when hed been drinking so he drew the cage from the pinto his hands shaking his knees weak dad he pleaded breaking his own rules shut up his father snapped this is whats called the laws of nature this son is real justice you ask a person any fucking number of times to get the fucking cat off your propertyand then you take matters into your own hands you remember that he would as it turned out but it had been walts hands not his fathers that had captured chippers walts hands that had trapped chippers in the cage walt who had been giddy about joining his father for this release the prisoner his father said he shook his head fighting back the tears do it son cant we just let him go thats all youre doing butthe shotgun release the prisoner he repeated walt hesitated the first tears escaping open the fucking cage his father hollered so loudly that his voice echoed off the mountain walt opened the cage and a bewildered chippers jumped out the cat landed on the rocky ground behind the car and walked a tight circle its nose working furiously walt sniffled the cat sprang away from him and scampered up the scree toward a stand of douglas fir walts father trotted after the cat across to the copse of trees walt turned toward the lake its surface peaceful and still he covered both ears pressing hard and sank to his knees his nose running his whole body jumped with the reportsa cramp from head to foot wind riffled the surface of the lake they rode back in a sickening silence his father glancing over at him from time to time but never speaking his father occasionally broke into a grin and chuckled morbidly to himself walt hated hima hate beyond anything hed ever experienced so dark and awful that he even considered turning the shotgun on his father and killing him right there killing them both if it came to thatjerking on the wheel and sending the car over the unguarded edge of trail creek pass for the next two years his mother tried to negotiate a truce between them having no idea of the cause of their break she mentioned chipperss absence one night at dinner walt and his father exchanged glances but that was all his father came and went rarely staying more than a long weekend the time between those weekends increasing which didnt bother walt one bit he and his brother bobby took over putting out the garbage fixing the heat tape on the roof ahead of the first snow shoveling the path and driveway his father returned like an unnamed planet and then left as quickly as hed come back to his darkness walt finally broke the silence after waiting for his old man to get in his car about to leave for another several months walt tapped on the window jerry rolled down the glass and sat there waiting ill never forgive you walt said he turned and walked away at twelve years old an orphan three w alt could enter a dark garage knowing there was an armed man inside but something about a hospital gave him the creeps the semiprivate room had one empty bed walt passed under a flickering tv and stopped abruptly glowing monitors connected to his nephew with wires and tubes the boys head was shaved and bandaged purple bruising surrounded his right eye socket a line of stitches at the edge of his lips extended his mouth into a lopsided snarl myra sat in a chair close to the bed she directed a sullen resentful expression at walt you could have prevented this myra mom kevin muttered not his fault she turned and took his hand gently in hers back to sleep its only walt hey kev the boys eyes bloodshot and swollen found walt eric the boy spoke with difficulty no talking kev myra said back to sleep erics okay walt said he saw relief in the boys only eye thank

lift some clothes from the suds so welikescoped the place checked it out you know parked around the corner he paused worked his mouth side to side and started again eric said he could pick a lock but he ended up kicking it in eric kicked the door in walt clarified we got inside and the alarm went off we freaked eric went for the windowdont ask me why i took off and hit a pole i guess why the window if the doors kicked in i dunno why suds tub over something like the goldmine kevin grimaced and then winced with pain i dont know walt myra whined whats going on ketchum police will think this

said sharply not now mom walt stepped closer to the bed and looked down at the boy im giving you a chance that the ketchum officers wont the alarm went off we panicked the boy said im going to sleep now he closed his eye tightly walts radio squawked he listened as the dispatcher called out a series of codes followed by dba akers veterinarian services he checked his watch am two breakins in one night he called in the vets clinic was outside city limits and less than half a mile south of the hospital walt was the closest officer i gotta go he told her but ill be back im not going anywhere she said and neither is he four a ketchum police department squad car its rack flashing red white and blue was parked at a hurried angle in front of the clinics log cabin entrance the front door had been left open and the lights were on he saw the uniformed officer inside using the phone walt parked the cherokee and took over responsibility from the ketchum cop brandon was the next to arrive his trailer only a quarter mile down the road the two men couldnt look at each other mark akers pickup truck pulled in and much to walts surprise so did fionas subaru aker hurried into the building brandon followed fiona collected her camera gear she wore what could have been pajama bottoms and a faded pink tshirt under a down vest and a pair of blue keens im right up the hill in the engls guesthouse i heard the siren she explained if youre here as part of my office he said youre welcome inside if youre here for the newspaper id ask you to hang back understood im here for you she said they caught up to aker in an exam room walt spotted the broken cabinet and the busted padlock clasp on a refrigerator meds he said knew what they were looking for aker donned a pair of latex gloves and looked through the cabinet fiona stepped away from them and began photographing aker glanced out the window shouted oh shit and hurried outside walt followed as he crossed the courtyard aker entered the back barn and threw on some exterior lights animal eyesdozens of thempeered from the dark they let them all out aker shouted walt followed at a run into the back barn empty the cage doors hanging open aker cursed a blue streak pacing back and forth most of these are sick animals how many walt asked the vet shook his head and shot him a hot look theyre under my care he mumbled he threw open another door looking across a second small courtyard oh godmy training dogsi cant believe this who would do such a thing walt thought he knew the answer to that brandon he shouted his deputy came running arriving out of breath walt said when you followed bartholomew did you happen to find out where he was staying five w alt rolled down the window to fight off the internal heat that arose from him sitting two feet from tommy brandon the cherokee passed into ketchum city limits is she there did you leave her there when the oncall came through i think maybe this is between you and her brandon said this is me asking you if my wife was in your trailer when you got the call walt waited for brandon to say something if youre going to sleep with my wife you could at least own up to it shes there he said turning to face the passenger window walt gripped the wheel more tightly how long sheriff a month six months what turn right brandon instructed he navigated walt through back streets to a trail creek condominium that he and fiona had identified while following bartholomew i didnt even know these condos were here brandnew brandon told him walt shot him a look did he mean the condos or his relationship with gail he let it go realizing hed already gone too far but the guy was fucking his wife so he expected a little slack to him condos all looked the same on his fourth ringing of the doorbell he heard footsteps he and brandon displayed the creds for the benefit of the doors fisheye lens bartholomew opened the door barely awake a few questions walt said my attorney bartholomew grumbled he scratched the crotch of his boxer shorts ill write down the number before walt could object hed shut the door when he opened it again he had a phone to his ear and his hair had been finger combed into place not answering he said he set the phone on the side table why dont we try this again tomorrow morning we can do this in hailey if you like walt said hailey as in taking a ride because the local vets was broken into and all the animals liberated sound familiar walt considered himself to be a good judge of character if that was the case bartholomew knew nothing about the breakin its three in the morning im hungover and youve got us wrong first rights is focused on child labor and every humans right to free speech i do not condone or support militant animal rights groups not now not ever he rubbed his head its too late for this if not politics had the animals been released as a ruse to cover the theft of medical supplies he thanked bartholomew and said good night the bewildered man stood watching as he and brandon returned to the cherokee what just happened brandon asked from the passenger seat walt kept his eye on the road as he asked what does she see in you or is it all about the sex right now they drove in silence not a word spoken for the return to the vets as he parked the car walt said we have two kids you know and left brandon in the car thinking about that six t revalian heard a womans voice say isnt that him it came from the hotels registration desk his instinct was to flee he turned and headed up the stairwell pretending hed not heard her comment at am the hotel lobby was empty the woman at registration had to have been speaking to someone the hotel detective he cautioned himself to stay calm they couldnt possibly connect him to the recent events hed changed shirts donned a jacket shalers clothes were in the knapsack slung over his right shoulder sir mr meisner a male voice a few feet behind him he knows my name trevalian stopped and turned on the stairs he was looking at a man in his midforties fit and darkly tanned a full head of hair hed sprung up the stairs like a ballerina yes trevalian said i wonder if you might have a minute you are neil parker he offered a business card sun valley company guest services its three in the morning theres been anincident parker said two things occurred to trevalian theyd found the compound hed cooked or they had him for the breakins its a situation that requires discretion on all our parts parker said im afraid its very late and im very tired and i dont understand trevalian evaluated his chances of breaking the guys neck without any noise not great parker climbed another step trevalian extended his hand to stop the man i dont like tight spaces he explained he could knee the man in the face from this position parker lowered his voice theres been an incident with one of our staff a ms cunningham he answered trevalians blank expression lilly cunningham our lounge singer in the duchin lounge i believe you met lilly he said nothing wondering if hed been set up shed managed to get into his room shed drunk his booze an extortion racket theres been an assault all i need is five minutes really id rather not do this in a stairwell do what lilly remembered your room number thats how i got your name trevalian said nothing she said you got a look at the man parker explained a possible suspect these can be tricky cases to prove hesaid shesaid a matter for the authorities trevalian said please leave me out of it shes not pressing charges the police are not involved but if we can confirm the mans identity he will never set foot on company property again trevalian doubted the explanation i saw her with a man but im afraid i didnt get a good look at him parkers face fell anything about him would help wed like to get rid of this guy trevalian spoke bringing the man into his confidence let me put it this way if you saw lilly and some guy in the hallway who would you be looking at yeahi hear you im sorry trevalian said but thats how it was the man appeared crushed listen you remember anything give me a call the front desk can find me my apologies to ms cunningham the difference is parker said more determined than ever you can choose not to be involved but lillys going to climb back up on that stage with that creep out there looking at her ill sleep on it trevalian said he rounded the landing and hurried up the stairs thinking there was precious little time for sleep his mind had briefly been elsewherea mistake he rarely made he had a switch to make and if possible he wanted to do it now while it was still dark out seven c ivil twilight was listed as am a naval term referring to the first glimpse of a defined horizon trevalian didnt want the horizon or himself defined or glimpsed as he made the switch and so two hours after being stopped by the hotel security man and an hour before civil twilight he made his way out of a groundfloor exit as rafe nagler toey the german shepherd service dog pulled at the harness at his side the first of these switches was changing nagler to meisner for a blind man could not be seen climbing behind the wheel of a car at am the sun valley grounds stood deserted nothing but faux gas lamps and vacant sidewalks he followed sidewalks from the lodge to the indoor ice rink and a dark openended shed that contained a backup zamboni he used the shed as a changing room stripping off and pocketing naglers facial hair wig and glasses he dumped the sport coat therethe only evidence he would leave behind for the next hourrevealing the black fleece vest that had been hiding beneath it he quickly clipped a leash to toeys collar and unfastened the harness concealing it up his back inside the fleece vest he let the string leash play out to where toey had a twentyfoot lead and the two made their way out into the giant parking lot that serviced the resort he appreciated the blackhole quality of both sky and air as he drove north from the resort into national forest he kept a close eye on the odometer as well as the rearview mirror he turned east onto a dirt track marked for pioneer cabin and put a half mile between him and the asphalt he left behind having never seen the twinkle of another set of headlights the darkest hour really was just before the dawn he doublechecked the cars ceiling light making sure it wouldnt turn on as he opened the door he stepped outside the cold mountain air stung his lungs and he coughed immediately trying to stifle the sound he leaned back into the car facing two dogsboth shepherds toey remained in the front seat where hed put her the leash still attached to her collar callie lay down on the backseat nothing but a long black shape he shut his door came around the car and opened the passenger door callie jumped to all fours and stuck her nose from behind the front seat toey bent around to meet noses trevalian yanked on the leash and pulled toey from the car he doublechecked that the small flashlight worked and then returning it to his pocket he led toey off into the dense forest of douglas fir and lodgepole pine a hundred and fifty yards later he knelt and fed her some cheeseflavored chowder crackers from the minibar he lavished her with praise and softly thanked her for being a good dog then he unclasped the leash commanded her to stay and walked away twice he turned back and used the flashlight to ensure she was holding the command her eyes a hollow luminescence in the dark but in the short time theyd been together hed learned that toey was a particularly kind and obedient dog she wasnt going anywhere his original plan had been to cut her throat and bury her out here miles from any possibility of being found but now he walked away then ran knowing she would obey his command and stay for probably ten or fifteen minutes or more he reached the car fastened the guide harness to callie and moved her into the front seat the switch was made and with it hed cleared the last of his obstacles eight w alt awakened in his daughter emilys bed to the ringing of the phone in his own bedroom for the second night hed avoided that mattress he dragged himself out of the stupor of two hours sleep managing to answer the kitchen phone before voice mail picked up its kathy im sorry to call you at home walt dispatch walt pulled himself into focus i tried both your cell and pager first go ahead he rubbed his face to clear his thought it didnt work stuart holms called at five fiftysix am walt checked the kitchen clock seven minutes had passed go on maybe he wouldnt need the coffee just mention of that name had jolted him awake he was a little abusive sir bossy i told him nineoneone took the emergency calls he told me to go to hell walt knew stuart holms by reputation this didnt surprise him what emergency he wouldnt tell me thats what im saying demanded to speak with you personally an alarm sounded in walts head he didnt know stuart holms personally he sounded upset she went on fifteen minutes later walt was refueling the cherokee wearing a fresh starched blue uniform shirt and sipping hot coffee from a travel mug he called the number stuart holms had left with dispatch but had only reached an assistant who said holms needed to speak with walt as soon as was humanly possible yet it was holms himself who met walt at the front door to the colossal modern home out the lake creek drainage nestled at the base of the mountains it felt to walt like a museum of contemporary art holms led him to a café table with a view of an enclosed garden through a wall of floortoceiling windows they were waited on by a slim woman in her thirties who had a french accent stuart holms ordered walt a sausage omelet toasted bagel with cream cheese coffee and orange juice he took smoked salmon capers and guava juice for himself dressed in blue pajamas holms wore a terrycloth bathrobe and sheepskin moccasins he looked younger than walt had imagined him his name had been in the business pages for decades he focused intently on walt and spoke in a croaking voice that needed more coffee i apologize for the secrecy sheriff but theres no such thing as privacy and i need to keep this private i called you because this home is in the county not the city and ive had it on good authority that youre a hell of a lot more trustworthy than the ketchum police chief i dont know about that whats the nature of your complaint not exactly a complaint more like a report its allieailiamy wife she failed to come home last night he looked to walt for some kind of reaction this is entirely out of character and im worried if i raise the alarm itll be over the wire services before ive had my morning swim with patricks conference and allno need to spoil his party a guy like you youve got your own people walt said you want my people to handle it they can i suppose holms said does she carry a cell phone walt asked last i saw her shed gone for a run this was a little after five yesterday evening she missed the luau youve tried her cell phone i called it only to hear it ring down the hall its on her dresser damn awful feeling that is five pm yesterday walt stated how bout the staff did she sleep somewhere else thats what youre asking isnt it with someone else you think shes going to slip back into her room and come out yawning as if she overslept i dont think so the food arrived walt took down the particulars as he ate stuart had expected to see her at the c luau hed left word with the staff that she was to call him the moment she returned home upset with her hed headed home had taken a sleeping pill and awakened at am to find her room still empty walt polished off the omelet he thought of his own wifenearly mentioned it fabulous omelet walt said thats raphael my chef an artist ill tell him hell be pleased we usually give it some time before investigating reports of missing persons but we can act on this if you like my question is what kind of press can you tolerate if we take this itll mean some phone calls questions being asked its going to be pretty clear pretty quickly whats going on i wish i could change that but its going to get out i want her found he didnt touch his own platean artful display of smoked salmon and a bagel walt ran through what his deputies referred to as her she drives a pale green volvo sc holms told him then he reached into his robes pocket and passed a fivebyfour card across the table it included the vehicles registration number her age weight and the clothes shed last been seen ina gray zippered shell a white jogging top and blue shorts a recent photo had been digitally printed in the lower corner i have very competent staff what about your own detail walt asked again we use a company for overseas travel yes new york washington la but not up here raphael goes with us everywhere a few assistants thats all walt studied the photo remembering where hed last seen this same woman on the balcony with danny cutter at his brothers cocktail party yes theres an age gap if thats what youre thinking holms said but im only sixty and a young sixty at that shes beautiful and outgoing and a wonderful conversationalist who likes to talk find her sheriff her favorite places to run the bike path adams gulch hulen meadows lake creek over the saddle and into elkhorn she varies it walt wrote these down on the back of the same card its a lot of ground walt said thats why youre involved well get started walt said and well keep it under the radar as much as possible if you start asking around danny cutters name is going to come up thats not news to me and its behind us just so you know okay walt said though his voice belied him ailia and danny are to be partners in a company im helping him finance those fences are mended walt faintly nodded wondering why if they were mended holms felt obligated to mention them nine a n hour past a sunrise lost to an overcast sky the rain began the dirt road out adams gulch where the pavement ended had turned to pale brown slop low swirling clouds concealed the tops of trees up on the crests of the surrounding mountains the sky fluctuated between a light mist and a steady drizzle mountain weather walt donned a tan oilskin greatcoat bundled in the back of the cherokee along with climbing gear snowshoes and two backpacks capable of keeping him in the woods overnightone for summer one for winter he offered brandon a poncho but his deputy refused the offer content to play the heman macho outdoorsy thing to the limit even if it meant a head cold the parking lot bustled with law enforcement and search and rescue personnel nothing like a missing rich woman to get the adrenaline running a ribbon of dayglo tape was lifted admitting two pickup trucks both carrying dog kennels in their beds alone to the right of the porta potti and the trailhead sign a pale green volvo its engine cold was parked over dry dirt it could have been there an hour or overnight but it belonged to ailia holms and was empty walt addressed the search and rescue team listen up she may be just injured could be out for a morning run and the husband has things confused so lets not scare her to death its possible shes been exposed to the elements overnight make sure youre covered for that space blankets protein bars and water youve got your assignments were using channel fifteen keep off the radios unless it means something okay go the group dispersed walt turned to brandon you and i will take the hill trail ill take the first entrance youll take the second im on it the man replied by the time walt reached the hill trail muddy clay was sticking to his boots like wet concrete heavier with each step twice he stopped to scrape globs off the treads he followed the narrow path up into the trees over rocky rutted ground roped with exposed tree roots with the low clouds and thick forest an unsettling darkness overcame him fionas arrival was announced over the radio she was photographing the volvo in his minds eye walt saw search and rescue spreading out over the trail and covering ground he checked in with brandon the two were approaching each other from opposite directions discovering a snapped branchthe ripped bark greenwalt knelt and studied the disturbance in the trails soil normally dry and powdery the ochercolored dust was skimmed with a layer of rain if prodded the crust of darkened soil gave way to the fine dirt beneath he followed some impressions that told him two things first the leg that had snapped the branch had done so prior to the rain falling second it was a mans flatsoled shoe size nine or ten walking slowly and deliberately not the long strides associated with exercise not an athletic shoe he kept off the path as best as possible and followed the shoe prints calling ahead to brandon to switch frequencies when he met him again on the radio walt instructed his deputy to keep an eye out for the tracks and not to disturb them but brandon professed to know nothing of any shoe prints it was then that walt picked up two other such impressions both heading back toward the parking lot the rain fell heavier now the shoe prints washing away before his eyes walt peeled his coat off and lay it across the trail attempting to protect the matching shoe printsboth heading in different directions he didnt dare lift the coat to see if hed managed to cover them the rain falling steadily now he raced ahead staying off the trail dodging trees and stumps and massive rocks tommy he called ahead on the radio how many times have you seen a guy in office shoes out on one of these trails sneakers brandon called back no these things have a heel and smooth soles keep your eyes peeled somethings not right the cold rain soaked through the shoulders and back of walts uniform he wiped his face on his sleeve in order to see fucking cats and dogs brandon said over the radio the rain had greatly intensified walt was running now looking left and right up the hill and down the narrow trail meandering just below him i got a million running shoes and hiking boots sheriff brandon reported but i got nothing like what youre talking about no office shoes keep your eyes peeled offtrail walt ordered roger that walt felt a tension in his chesta knowing fear he relived watching the shoe impressions melt behind the destructive power of the rain though but a few miles from downtown a half mile from the highway these woods were national forest and subject to the laws of nature not man bears were commonly spotted cougar elk any number of which could scare a runner off a trail pursue the intruder for dinner or out of defense of a calf or cub the combination of the discovery of the unexpected shoe prints and the now torrential cold rain drove home an anxiety that peaked with brandon s next radio transmission sheriff whats your twenty i think ive got something a moment later walt flinched with the sound of a dull gunshot just ahead on the trail a flare brandon had found her ten a womans body bloody and splayed in a tangle of limbs the top of her running suit was ripped baring her chest her neck was canted inhumanly to one side walt placed a space blanket over her to keep off the rain ailia holms had been mauled bear brandon asked im no expert but im guessing cat bite marks on the neck the narrowness of the claws walt ordered the hill trail cordoned off he and brandon established a perimeter around the body using dead sticks with brandon lifting and replacing the space blanket fiona who had trudged up through the woods shot dozens of photographs before anyone disturbed the scene others arrived through the forest deputies a pair of paramedics and a local doctor royal mcclure at walts request he would serve as medical examiner an assignment certain to piss off the county coroner but walt was intent on doing this the right way electing a mortician as coroner did not make him a medical examiner mcclure a wiry man in his midfifties had tight green eyes and a high raspy voice ill be able to tell you more later much more but for now youve got a body dead twelve to eighteen hours trauma blood loss all the appearance of an animal attack walt asked what are the odds that two cougars attack humans within a day of each other who said anything about two mcclure asked these cats cover a lot of ground we darted one and locked it up yesterday down at the humane society the pound walt said she sure as hell didnt do this ive lived here off and on for most of my life and i can only remember one other cat attack before thisand that one was provoked now we lose a yellow lab danny cutter gets run out of the big wood by a cat we dart one and that same night another kills a woman out running are you kidding me in the midst of removing the space blanket for fiona brandon suddenly pulled the mylar sheet aside and let it fall to the ground like a magician whod given up on his trick keep her covered tommy walt said turning from mcclure check it out sheriff brandon said kneeling close to the body what the fuck is that the rain continued to fall in sheets as it had for the past half hour brandon dragged the space blanket back over her once again covering her head and face to below her waist leaving only her lacerated legs exposed walt stepped closer seeing for the first time what brandon now pointed to a small circle of white paint walt guessed its dissolving whatever it is brandon said dissolving fast and look there and there he pointed then he lifted the mylar and studied her more closely its all over her fiona of her own volition scrolled through digital shots while carefully screening her camera from the rain i made pictures of those she said i count sevennoeight on her chest and torso another four on her head and hair its feces mcclure said having touched it with his gloved finger and lifted it to his nose bird feces birdshit brandon asked hows that possible look around her nothing none of the leaves sticks or plants surrounding the body showed any sign of the white splotches doc walt asked its not my place to comment on physical evidence walt looked up into the rain no coverage here the tree branches not touching so where had the birds perched you know that bloodsplatter course brandon said if birdshits anything like blood then the size of these and the tightness of the rings means it didnt fall very far a bird takes a crap from up there its going to hit like a bomb expert testimony if ive ever heard it walt cracked not to mention she rolled all the way down the hill brandon said ignoring walts jab so its got to be fresh right hes right mcclure interjected or she was out running with dried bird feces all over her walt was still bothered by the smoothsoled shoe prints hed followed earlier in the excitement of the discovery hed neglected to send anyone to protect his oilskin and the tracks it covered he did so now by radio but feared a complete loss and theres a question of blood mcclure pointed out fiona brandon and walt all turned inquisitively toward him their faces ran with rainwater blood walt asked i count a hundred and fiftysix lacerations and we havent rolled her yet mcclure said so wheres all the blood eleven o n his second visit in a matter of hours something about the indulgence of the holms estate left walt with a sickening feeling in his gut it was far too big for two people how would it feel now with only one he was informed by a staff member that stuart holms had already left for the conference this kind of thing needed to be done in person walt drove over to sun valley it took him twenty minutes of moving between various talks and coffee clutches meeting rooms and hospitality suites to find holms on the porch of the guest house in a private conversation with the head of disney walt asked to speak to holms in confidence and took the vacated chair theres never an easy way to say this im sorry to have to tell you that we found your wife out adams gulch she was pronounced dead at the scene apparent victim of an animal attack the other mans clear blue eyes ticked back and forth alternately searching the air above walts head his brow knotted and he nodded slightly and sighed then his eyes fell to the plastic tabletop and he dragged his trembling hands into his lap ive known since last night i knew in here he touched his chest shes never not come home before oh god an animal attack a cougar possibly yes was it her period stuart holms asked i dont even know im sorry to say thats when they attack women right a thorough examination is being conducted walt said holms kept his head down he mumbled a cat she liked cats loved cats volunteered at the pound did you know that at some point im going to take a full statement from you sir no hurry but the sooner we can get to that the better holms lifted his head revealing teary bloodshot eyes of course he said walt waited a moment uncomfortably when he said when might we get to that holms looked away at a piece of the sky when i feel up to it sheriff and not a minute sooner twelve i t was difficult for walt to think of a meeting as clandestine when the sun shone so brightly and a pair of yellow warblers darted branch to branch in play the warm springs tributary to the big wood slipped past beneath the concrete bridge connecting to sun valley s river run highspeed quadchairlifts and the glorious river run ski lodge he watched the rivers swirling currents looking for any kind of repeating pattern but he saw none a kingfisher hovered low over the silver brown water staying there for quite some time before zooming up to a cottonwood branch and taking rest dick obrien had no place here he was dressed like a man heading to lunch at yale khakis blue blazer white buttondown shirt thankfully hed eschewed the tie it was the mans shoes that walt paid the most attention to office shoes with heels his mind filled briefly with an image of the dissolving muddy impressions hed followed up the hill trail at adams gulch he swallowed dryly obrien leaned against the bridges wide concrete rail he placed a manila envelope between them sorry for making the meet out here he said just a precaution is all this is walt asked indicating the envelope a dvd cutters home security i helped design it weve got eyes on the gate exterior doors the garages he put half a mil into security on that place this camera is an interior look at the front door from yesterday morningfriday morning in case youve lost track i have one of my guys assigned to monitoring the cameras twentyfour seven he pointed thisincidentout to me yesterday we dump anything like this to dvd for safekeeping anything like what walt asked the escalades got a dvd player if you want it sooner than later obrien said and airconditioning and an electric cooler in the back pop bottled water you cant just tell me worth a thousand words right if you say so a few minutes later obrien and walt occupied the escalades two leather captains chairs that made up the cars middle row of seats the dvd panel was flipped down and glowing blue walt had a cold ginger ale in hand what no popcorn we got snickers in the cooler obrien said in all seriousness peanuts potato chips i was kidding the dvd played walt watched as a sweating danny cutter a towel around his neck opened his brothers front door and welcomed in ailia holms walt dialed the rear air conditioner down a few degreeshed warmed suddenly a time clock ran in the upper righthand corner of the screen obrien narrated once we heard about her out adams gulch i showed this to the boss he took her death real hard i might add and we had a very short discussion about sharing this with you just for the record the boss never suggested blocking it on the screen the discussion grew heated between danny cutter and ailia holms but there was no sound to confirm that then all at once danny grabbed her by the forearms and shoved her against a couch for a moment walt feared he was about to see a rape then the two settled down ailia clearly complained about her treatment danny showed her to the door and she left obrien stopped the playback the screen went blue again those are the same clothes we found her in walt told obrien its yours to do with whatever its not that im complaining but would you turn this over if it was your brother its complicated between themthe brothers very competitive he paused and said in all sorts of things then he met eyes with walt clearly wanting to drive home this last statement its a big help walt said and i appreciate it no problem it may be for danny and i like danny we all like danny obrien said does that include patrick like i said its complicated yes it is as they were climbing out of the car walt couldnt resist nice shoes he said thirteen t he hospital morgue was located down a subterranean hallway wedged between a door marked dangerhigh voltage and another unmarked room used for storage ailia holms lay faceup on a textured stainless steel morgue table with drain slits around its perimeter and hoses coming out the bottom mcclure pulled off the blue ripstop nylon dropcloth exposing her chalk white skin torn by cougars claws lacerations and puncture wounds covered her torso like unfamiliar constellations her pubis was shaved into a short vertical column of red tangled hair walt looked away and recomposed himself mcclure had already done some cutting on her you asked about any bruising mcclure said i did you know about lividity the blood settles into the lowest part of the body an hour or two after death it fixes in six to eight hours he directed walts attention to some dark bruises youll recall that we found her partially rolled up on her left side he pointed this area is an example of fixed hypostasislividity certainly six to eight hours after she was killed she was in this position he nodded toward the sink grab a set of gloves together he and walt lifted and rolled the cadaver just high enough to get a look at her buttocks see that discoloring mcclure asked the right gluteous yes no proof but it suggests early lividity so she rolled and landed partially down the hill and whata couple hours later a coyote pulled her over and she rolled some more could explain it whats the timing eight to twelve hours ahead of discovery perhaps coincidental with her death may i walt asked reaching for ailias left arm of course walt lifted the arm an obvious bruise shaped like a mitten this is antemortem walt asked yes well ahead of the attack maybe as much as a day or more it was early yesterday morning walt told him thats consistent mcclure lifted the cadavers head he pulled back a flap of skin exposing tissue pink muscle and white vertebrae she has a fracture to cervical number seven just above the facet for the first rib another to cervical three the tissue at seven reveals edema consistent with an earlier trauma the cat broke her neck walt said its what cats do fractures her neck mcclure said shes alive but paralyzed toys with her for a while for how long this trauma to the neck occurred an hour or more before the cat mauled her good god most if not all of the lacerations inflicted by the cat were post mortem excuse me mcclure met eyes with walt and just stared cause of death is heart failure she bled out but the timing of all this is speculative my guys are out looking for the original crime scenethe location of the attack all the blood you may not find it mcclure said he answered walts puzzled expression by explaining we luminoled her he picked up a tube light from a workstation get the lights he said walt cut the lights mcclure waved a short black light over the body beneath the neck the stainless steel showed a luminous green indicating blood the body itself showed very little green you cleaned her walt asked i hope you checked for prints first thats just the thing mcclure said i havent washed her theres very little blood and theres a reason for that the dead dont bleed walt thought back to the shoe prints in the mud and danny cutter pinning ailia to the couch the cat still could have killed her and mauled her later ill measure her blood volume the doctor said it meant nothing to walt walt paused she was moved one last point of interest mcclure said switching off the black light and returning the room to the overhead tube lighting shes missing her left contact lens missing walt blurted out probably somewhere in the woods she rolled a long way down that hill you could try to find it but we both know the odds of that still its going into my report would it show if we luminoled the area walt asked no the luminol binds to the hemoglobin if its out there its going to take a handsandknees search who goes running with only one contact walt wondered not realizing until it was too late that hed spoken it aloud it was a long fall mcclure repeated but walt barely heard him he was stuck back on obriens shoes and the impressions that had vanished with the rain fourteen i ts the fishing lady came the voice of the guard at elizabeth shalers front door this was heard over adam dryers cell phone with its twoway walkietalkie feature dryer looked over at shaler who was currently reading the saturday edition of the new york times and enjoying some morning sun in her backyard yes of course liz shaler said answering dryers inquisitive expression he flipped through pages on a clipboard its not on todays appointment list we were supposed to go fishing together remember that was all of a few hours ago but it wasnt rescheduled to the walkietalkie he said give her the mossad and send her in roger that the mossad shaler asked tugging down her sunglasses for full effect or dont i want to know shell be thoroughly searched thats all he better not touch her improperly no your honor several minutes passed before fiona was led through by one of shalers assistants she handed a bouquet of stem flowers to shaler who drank in a whiff before passing them off to her assistant you didnt need to do that fiona took at seat at the patio table i was sorry to cancel was it ailia liz shaler asked was it as awful as everyones saying im not permitted to say sorry about that no dont be i respect you all the more for it she lowered her voice i wish some of the people around here were as discreet i might actually have a life she grinned there was a line of white sun cream showing beneath her nose where shed missed it fiona was tempted to point it out but didnt dryer stood away from them but remained in the yard under the shade of a tree he stared at them from there through his sunglasses is he just going to hang out there fiona asked yes amazing isnt it i would be so bored with a job like that but what are you going to do doesnt it bother you i detest it as ag i dont have protection in new york the governor does the mayor of the city but not the attorney general all this she said indicating dryer is thanks to herb millington who made a big stink to the dnc when it was rumored i would run i shouldnt stay long fiona said anxiously causing liz shaler to look over at her thoughtfully whats going on the flowersyour honorwere a pretext for to get me inside not that im not sorry about missing the session with you i am i absolutely am shaler pushed away the times okay she said youve got my attention fiona very carefully reached into her purse slipped out an envelope and passed it to shaler surreptitiously i shouldnt be doing this i know and ill probably get into a lot of trouble for it i mean a lot depending on you of course you dont have to worry about me she squeezed the envelope photos fiona nodded and smiled falsely because dryers dark sunglasses remained fixed on her from the shade of the distant tree should i look at them now your call fiona said is he looking in this direction liz asked yes waitokay hes checking around liz slipped the envelope open and gasped oh god salt lake city fiona said these are the shots waltthe sheriff she corrected wanted you to see agent dryer wouldnt permit it liz flipped through the stack then she gathered them and returned them to the envelope god she repeated did walt no no fiona said quickly please dont go there this was entirely my initiative there was nothing said nothing implied please dont think that of him you like him walt liz said or you wouldnt have done this she pushed the envelope back across to fiona your secrets safe with me it isnt like that fiona said its just his workits everything to him you know i like him too liz said very much he saved my life you know fiona leaned away looking shocked years ago but believe me you dont forget something like that a person like walt not ever he wanted these photos to scare you into calling off your talk i know that much maybe hes trying to save you a second time fiona couldnt see her eyes through the dark glasses but she imagined them as scared and hell pay for it came the low voice of adam dryer liz shaler jumped and her glasses wiggled down her nose dryer snatched the packet of photos with an arm like a frogs tongue fiona hadnt seen him coming he leafed through the photos and then pocketed them the sheriff was on notice not to show you these your honor it wasnt walt fiona protested it was me and i cant see through that dryer said stripping the glasses off his face and drilling a look into her you tell him he lost his get out of jail card with me leave the photos where they were liz shaler said vehemently and leave us alone fionas my guest which is more than i can say about the rest of you fifteen a s the conference adjourned for lunch walt caught danny cutter outside a breakout room showing no sign of being ill at ease danny agreed to speak with him and the two headed down into the subterranean reaches of the hotel the lodges private bowling alleys dated back to the hotels construction in the s and averell harrimans vision of grandeur the two lanes stood empty at pm on a saturday the alleys had been a playground for gable stanwyck cooper and hemingway walt could almost smell the cuban cigars and the bourbon on the rocks mingling with chanel no never renovated through the subsequent decades the lanes had nonetheless been well maintained while allowing the history to show danny and walt sat across a linoleumtopped table rimmed with cigarette scars if this table could talk walt thought he asked the attendant to give them a few minutes and the young swede took off without comment you mind if i run this thing record our conversation walt held an ipod in his hand a small white brick plugged into its top he placed the device on the table and tried to get comfortable in the chair you do what you have to do danny said tell me about ailia holms yeah unbelievable i thought thats what this was about because danny gave walt a transparent look youre here arent you if you didnt know allie and i had a thing goingthis is before i wentawayyoud be the only one in this town danny cutters good looks got in his way at a time like this walt couldnt think of him as normal a guy that goodlooking and that rich is that past or present tense walt asked the thing cutter adjusted himself in the chair we had a history she wanted to update the files as it turned out keep them current but i discouraged that didnt avoid it completely but discouraged it physically meaning you dont understand physically discouraging someone she can bedifficultto say no to wasi guess i should say cant get used to that he moved in the chair once more then he lowered his voice despite the room being empty i slept with her the night of paddys party the cocktail party at his place during the party it just kind of happened walt had seen the two up on the balcony hallway he maintained his poker face but inside he was reeling hed not anticipated dannys candor that sounds like encouragement to me im talking about discouragement dannys eyes went distant then focused and found walt youre talking about her arms arent you i bruised her didnt i she was pissed at me for that steaming mad said if stu saw any bruisesshe was afraid of stu i gather the resentfuloldman thing is not entirely an act what bruises this was what walt asked but mentally he made a note to check on stuart holmss jealousies she came by the house this is yesterday morning we had words allie liked getting her way and our ways were a little divergent i took it a little too far what can i say shit happens she liked to play the sex card and sometimes quite frankly it got a little old scratch my itch and ill do you favors but i didnt want any favors he paused and rubbed the corner of his lips with his knuckle rehab wasnt totally lost on me who doesnt want the favors of a woman like ailia holms walt asked a man whos had ailia holms danny answered it wasnt those kind of favors it was money stuff i didnt want her help thats all walt said nothing the really strange thing danny asked rhetorically i was attacked by a cougar the day before yesterday did you hear about that he studied walt im sure you did thing could have taken me down taken me out and instead it turns around and leaves me alone just like that gets you to thinking ill tell you what you kidding me you know what i decided i want to be useful to make my life useful to someone something other than me and i want to get there on my own break out the frickin violinsi can see it in your facebut im serious sheriff he scratched his lips again and now allie out adams gulch last night a cougar right maybe the same cougar how bizarre is that its plenty bizarre walt said flatly he noted that danny cutter had put ailias attack as night not even royal mcclure had done so he struggled with seeing danny cutter as guilty he didnt want to believe it so when was the last time you saw her walt probed and thats another thing danny said not answering directly who goes on a run twice in the same day are you buying that thats not allie thats not right the last time you saw her yesterday afternoon i had a meeting with stua business thing allie stopped by he paused ive got to tell you i didnt love ither stopping by and stu was weird about it they had it plannedfrickin choreographedand i was the odd man out and i hate that walt searched the mans face and decided he was telling the truth i dont know how much of this is relevant sheriff but youre probably going to hear it anyway stu agreed to invest some serious money in a thing ive got going ive got to tell you that surprised me in the first place and then he drops this bomb on me that the deal comes with strings attached the strings were allie i take her on as my partner or forget the investment and you didnt like that because because of the strings whether you or anyone else believes it im serious about changing my act but the thing is stu must have known about us what kind of husband sets up his wife like that what kind of fool sense does that make walt made notes wondering at the interconnections and the involvement of the husband maybe later today maybe monday ill get the preliminary autopsy report well know if it was an accident or not since when is a cougar attack not an accident ive got to ask for your passport danny what the man looked shellshocked everything weve discussed here is confidential i hear it come from someplace else im coming after you and let me remind you this conversation was recorded with your consent youre flipping me out what do you mean not an accident i need your passport on my desk by five pm i dont get it by five ill seek a warrant where are you coming from me i liked allie not an accident leave me out of this please no way to do that im sorry to say this danny but you might want to call doug doug aanestad had served as dannys attorney during the drug bust im starting over here i actually have something good going he was pleading now he looked a little pitiful sounded childish as he mumbled i have a business plan a good one ask paddy come on walt you know this town im toast its messy walt said i wish i could tell you otherwise me in a mess danny asked sarcastic anger boiling out of him now theres something new give me a break walt come on please as walt stood he stopped the ipod from recording and pocketed the device he placed a hand on dannys shoulder tried to think of something to say then turned for the door sixteen f iona was leaning against the cherokees front bumper impatiently tapping a newspaper against her thigh she wore khaki capris and a lavender shirt with oversized white buttons valet parking had left the cherokee under the lodges massive portico out of the noonday sun walt unlocked it with the remote and fiona climbed in without invitation as walt took the wheel she said drive me over to my car please its too hot to walk and ive been waiting an eternity she rolled down the window i looked for you everywhere you could have called he pointed out i tried you werent picking up ahi was in the basement the bowling alley she looked at him askance business he said im a sucky bowler dont go there its my fault she said as walt turned into the massive parking lot looking for her car he hoped she might direct him but her tone told him to keep his mouth shut you know when youve got a name or something right on the tip of your tongue but you cant for the life of you remember it it was like that for me she looked at him her eyes begging that he make the connection walt stared back blankly the bird droppings she said holding the newspaper out in front of him now and blocking his vision he took her by the wrist moved the paper out of his way and pulled over what about them i made the photos i was there fiona i know that not those photos she said dismissively as if it was the clearest thing in the world read walt took the paper from her it was folded open to page five the article was titled bombs away county pound goes to the birds walt recalled his father teasing him about the article and theres something else she said walt cut her off let me read i blew it hang on swallows at the pound he said remembering hundreds of them leaving bird droppings on all the cats and dogs she said caught up in his enthusiasm the health department threatened to close them down yes bird droppings walt she stared at him once again somewhat condescendingly the cougar that was darted was transferred to the humane society until fish and game figures out what to do with her she was at the pound walt oh shit yeah thats about the size of it seventeen w alt entered the shed extension of the humane society a few minutes behind his deputy randy anderson and a few minutes ahead of fiona whod headed home to pick up equipment the garish green steel building sat atop a sagebrush knoll three miles out croy canyon west of hailey where coyotes cried in the wee hours of the morning and area snowplows struggled to reach in the dead of winter the volunteer worker a middleaged woman walt recognized from the softball bleachers threatened him with a cup of coffee walt politely declined he and anderson donned latex gloves and slipped their boots into paper covers anderson a lanky guy with a narrow boyish face and big teeth was as close as walts sheriffs office got to a forensics technician hed taken a single course called death sciences at a technical school outside of nampa just after high school you got everything walt asked him not sure he wanted the answer yeah all set anderson hoisted a black duffel bag take me about five minutes to mix the chemicals walt approached the interior door that led to the kennel from the other side came a chorus of loud barking he opened it revealing a central aisle that gave way to shelves of cages of varying sizes on either side the occasional plywood partition segregated the cat cages from the dogs though every effort was made to keep the room smelling clean it was a losing battle to walts left stood a much larger heavily reinforced cage as with others along the left wall it offered a sliding door to an outside run currently padlocked shut pacing silently wall to wall the cougar kept a wary eye on him all down the center aisle he noticed ghostly white stains that had been vigorously scrubbed off the concrete he looked up and saw the scars where hundreds of the swallows mud nests had been plucked off the ridgepole dozens more had yet to be removed a few bold swallows peeked their heads from the remaining nests made of dried mud and grass they looked like tiny caves its a neverending battle the volunteer said from behind him and a health issue most of the smell is the bird poo im afraid were still working on a more permanent solution can we move the cat walt asked oh no sir not us have to call fish and game to do that he shouted anderson will the luminol hurt the cat shouldnt no sir its basically nothing more than hydrogen peroxide then hurry it up twenty minutes later anderson had sprayed the concrete flooring inside most of the cage the cougar wisely chose to stay as far away as possible during this pacing the opposite wall from anderson fiona arrived she had donned a hairnet gloves and shoe covers and made a point to set up her camera gear quickly was she alive when he did it fiona asked we dont know anything yet lets take it step by step anderson returned from mixing another batch he backed them away from the cage and sprayed the outside perimeter as well im all set fiona announced okay then anderson plugged in a twofoot tube lighta black light like the kind mcclure had used in the morgue okay he said somewhat nervously anything bluegreen is evidence of blood walt asked the volunteer to leave the room he shut the door and as he did the dogs barked viciously in a chorus that ran chills down his spine he switched the long wire of overhead lights off the room went dark mixed in with the dogs was the sound of fiona gasping then anderson croaked out in raspy voice mother of god eighteen t he cage floor was stained in ungainly neon green smears and streaks and splatters it looked like a monochromatic jackson pollock painting walt maintained his poise as he imagined a semiconscious paralyzed ailia holms being mauled bitten clawed and dragged around the cage as fiona clicked off time exposures walt thought he heard her crying anderson pointed out the long green tail that tapered from the edge of the cage toward the rooms central drain someone tried to clean it up anderson explained hosed it down maybe mopped spent some time on it ill luminol the brooms and mops well want to check the drain for tissue the brooms for prints walt indicated an area in front of the cage get pictures of this as well please anderson illuminated the area in question interesting he said his teeth glowing white and standing out from his blue face the green smear indicating spilled blood was interrupted by two columnsrepresenting clean concrete these are blood shadows anderson explained i dont want to ask fiona sounded frightened blood splatter traveled out of the cage and was blocked anderson hesitated someone stood here and watched her die nineteen b randon had rounded up patrick cutters sevenperson staff and two security personnel and was detaining them on the patio until further notice ensuring they didnt attempt to manipulate the environment or damage possible evidence doug aanestad read through the hastily scrawled search warrant must be nice to work in a place where judges can be bent to favor at three oclock on a saturday afternoon smalltown living walt said this may take a while ginny will make us both a latté if youll release her for a minute best latté youve ever had patrick gets his beans flown in from colombia pass everyone stays where they are its a fishing expedition walt and you know it she got caught in the wrong place at the wrong time bad luck is all dont i wish you have evidence to the contrary dont you wish walt said i dont share intel with the enemy five minutes and you can put her back on the patio im telling you flown in from colombia youve never tasted anything like this walt answered with a glare aanestad slumped into a living room chair that swallowed him he continued reading the warrant again he mumbled something about walts good fortune by pm walt was following anderson around the house as anderson chased electrical outlets to power his black light when anderson moved toward the master bedroom aanestad steered him clear pointing out that the warrant contained walt to a search for evidence linked to danny his client and not the owner of the house phone calls were made and aanestad won anderson was going through the guest suite when deputies tilly and kaiser showed up beckoning walt to the sixcar garage aanestad followed the vigilante watchdog several of the garage bays stood empty four cars remained a hummer a bmw sports coupe a gleaming black pickup truck and a toyota land cruiser all had their doors open mats out on the poured concrete some seats had been removed walt informed aanestad just fyi we have two teams searching both patricks and dannys cars over at sun valley its all covered in the warrant i saw that i still think its a stretch to include all the vehicles when my client claims to have driven only the lexus but there you have it if you arent careful doug someones going to accuse you of being patricks lawyer i am patricks lawyerlocally he clarified even though he thought walt knew that i represent the family we found it over here tilly said eager to show his prize walt approached the back of the land cruiser with a quickened pulse aanestad was getting on his nerves and anderson s failure to find a speck of blood evidence was beginning to make him look as foolish as aanestad made him out to be tilly pointed into the back of the vehicle where a small white arrow made of removable tape had been fixed to the caramelcolored carpeting walts eyes followed the white arrow and at first he didnt see anything then he moved slightly to his left in order to catch the light better aanestad called out thats patricks car this has nothing to do with danny at the tip of the white arrow lay a single clear contact lens twenty w alt stood to the side and down the hallway from the picabo street room out of the way of the conference guests departing a talk given by the secretary of the treasury having doug aanestad by his side won patrick cutters attention the eye communication was between attorney and client with only a passing glance at walt cutter dealt with a few enthusiastic guests waited to make sure the secretary was properly escorted to the next function and then lingered long enough to have the hallway to themselves for a moment is that room clear walt asked as he shook hands with cutter yes certainly patrick led them into the room and walt shut the door capable of holding a hundred or more the conference room smelled of warm bodies and coffee two food service personnel entered to refresh the ice water and clear glasses from the dais walt asked them to leave and they did so without question as you know the attorney told his client the sheriff and his men searched your residence this afternoon he focused intently on cutters eyes attempting to communicate the severity of the situation he would like to ask you some questions of course cutter blurted out looking alarmed i advise you patrick to check with me before answering do we understand each other each and every question you will check with me before answering given this condition im allowing this conversation to take place but i must have your understanding on this the sheriff wanted to run a recording devicei have prohibited that he wanted to see you alone by himself also forbidden he claims to have reason to suspect you in a possible murder investigation patrick thats right murder danny cutter blurted out despite the golf tan he looked suddenly pale hell get to that aanestad said but theres a good example i dont want you speaking until ive nodded my okay and i want you to think clearly about your answers before giving them cutter nodded walt began by asking some of the same general questions he had asked danny cutter earlier patrick could not recall with any clarity when hed last seen ailia holmshe pointed out the large number of guests he was now dealing with on an hourly basis he thought it might have been as far back as the cocktail party at his residence walt soon moved into more sensitive territory you directed dick obrien to pass along a dvd to me from your home security cameras wait just a minute aanestad conferred with cutter in the corner by a table with a black skirt piled with copies of a book written by the treasury secretary they returned and both men sat down facing walt i did said cutter why would you do that implicate your brother like that cutter checked with aanestad who nodded faintly it seemed the right thing to do its the coverup that gets you hanged sheriff we all know that you could have destroyed it who would have known he checked with aanestad each and every time same answer you could have warned your brother hes an adult who has driven which of your cars this weekend between you and danny i drive the cayenne i gave danny the lexus my wife either rides with me or uses the volvo what about the land cruiser walt asked aanestad shook his head and patrick cutter looking confused raised his eyebrows at walt im advised not to answer that he said walt thought him either a very good actor or someone who knew nothing of the possibility of ailia holmss contact lens being found in his car the keys walt asked kept on a rack in the kitchen all but the cayenne i keep those with me im passionate about the cayenne he smiled it was all wrong walt had expected him to be nervous and agitated aanestad sat smugly observing walts reactionswalts not his clients had some coaching gone on in the corner walt wondered was cutter seasoned enough from his business dealings to bluff his way through this it seemed impossible to walt that cutter if guilty could maintain such a calm facade you were sleeping with ailia holms cutter tried to hold back any reaction but he slowly crumbled feigned astonishment moved into feigned insult walt never took his eyes off the man as the accusation worked through him like an acid his weapon was patience he waited and the waiting was the mans undoing nonsense aanestad complained trying to give cutter a breath of air whered you get that its garbage walt and you know it you should be ashamed trying such a stunt walt had gotten it from a single look dick obrien had given him out on the bridge when mentioning the competition between the brothers but he wasnt about to reveal his source let your client deny it counselor patricks eyes shone wetly as he glowered at walt at least a minute had passed maybe two the airconditioning wheezed from the ceiling again a food service worker tried to enter the room from the far end again walt sent him packing patrick said softly im upset over her loss sheriff we wereclose of course you were aanestad said you and stu shut up doug cutter said how long walt asked this conversation is over aanestad announced doug cutter chided if you cant keep quiet im going to ask you to leave the room aanestads face went scarlet his eyes flashed darkly and he sat back in his chair patrick continued i had dick share the security footage because if danny did somethingif he hurt her in any waythen god damn it for once hes going to pay ill need you to account for your whereabouts last night from nine pm to past midnight without pause cutter replied i was hosting a dinner at the lodge dining room followed immediately by a dessert function out at trail creek cabin the commissioner of the fcc believe me walt every second of my time can be accounted for by me my people and probably several dozen if not a hundred or more witnesses do the legwork the same for danny patrick answered only with a saddened face were done here aanestad repeated this time he won patricks support walt had what he wanted patrick had admitted involvement with ailia holms just as obrien had inferred the man could have easily hired her murder all three men stood walt asked for cutters passport winning another shocked expression have one of your people run it down to my office before five thats less than an hour thats your problem you are way off if you think i had anything do to with ailias death physical evidence was found in the back of your land cruiser possibly connected to the victim doug was prohibited from saying anything about thatthe only condition of his attendance here what evidence thats ridiculous allie and i used that car all the time weve even cutter stopped himself walt said nothing he felt sordid and tired we cared for each other cutter repeated as if issuing his defense thats enough patrick aanestad said taking cutter by the arm and leading him from the room twentyone a few minutes before pm walt parked in his designated space in front of the sheriffs office the officer on duty told him myra was waiting in his office he found her reading the idaho sheriffs association magazine whats up he asked hurrying over to give her a kiss is kev all right better she said they may release him tomorrow he sat down behind his desk and checked his email too many to deal with a stack of phone messages and yet it felt uncommonly good to be back in the office you look like hell im okay he told her are you eating with myra it was always food im good he looked up and she looked down avoiding eye contact myra kev lied to you i know she seemed both relieved and surprised her face brightened hes in with a bad kid he said this isnt like him we both know that how much trouble is he in enough he answered honestly i gave him the whatfor told him we cant keep using his fathers death as an excuse for our screwups ive done it as much as him walt were all guilty of that walt said why is it were so willing to lean back instead of press forward fear of the unknown of the known of tomorrow of failure she worked herself up toward a cry broken by walts tossing her a box of tissues which brought a laugh so thats a good thing he said to get through that i mean i hope its contagious we had a good cry the two of us that hasnt really happened since bobby glad to hear it he wants to talk to you the way she said it her eyes unflinching he knew this was the real reason shed come she closed the magazine and set it aside okay no i mean now walt you need to hear this it can wait if hes getting out tomorrow no i dont think so exasperated he held himself back from saying something stupid something hed regret but his face belied him i probably should have called you she said caught you on the way down valley i know how busy you must be but i wanted to look you in the eye i want you to understand how important this is not for kevini dont mean that for you your job he wouldnt tell me what it is but a mother knows right something happened in that laundrythats all i got out of him something he wont talk to me about ill be heading up valley later on the conference is in full swing youve got to go now walt myra he pleaded he wont tell me only you please please do this hes your nephew he had some choice words on the tip of his tongue he looked at her and nodded he said but were stopping by your place on the way and youre making me a banana and mayonnaise sandwich deal she said brightly and with that tears rolled from her tired eyes twentytwo k evin didnt look as if hed be going home the next day if anything he looked worse than earlier in the day the bruising around his shattered eye socket had spread beyond the bandages and was a horrid orange his one supposedly good eye was pooled with blood beneath the cornea the iris barely discernible you look like shit walt said taking the seat by the side of the bed kevin winced as he stretched the stitches at the edge of his lips into a grin yeah he said your mom said yeah he interrupted im sorry for what happened me too i hear you want to change your story if i can of course you can kev the truth is always a good place to start you might want to remember that there was a guy kevin said a guy walt repeated after a protracted silence in the laundry when we got there up there by the register dressed like a ninja scared the hell out of us a ninja you know a ski mask black clothes over in the bags of laundry a worker a ski mask didnt you say the alarm went off when you kicked in the door it beeped and went off yeah thered been no report of a manager or employee being inside the laundry at the time what was the guy doing scaring the shit out of us walt suppressed a grin then sobered to what he was hearing eric went for the window because of this guy yeah kevin sounded regretful you were or were not trying to steal clothes walt pressed dry cleaners use a solvent kevin said softly meth walt said closing his eyes tightly for cooking meth kevin let out a slow ragged breath yeah who crab taylor crabtree he put you up to this yeah said if we were caught on account we dont have records criminal records wed get off a lot easier than him walt fought valiantly to control his temper and this other guyyour age or what didnt seem like it walt found himself hung up on the alarm having sounded with someone else already inside give me a minute he stepped into the hall to use his cell phone and called trident security the valleys only security firm he identified himself and asked to pull up the entry log for the suds tub on the previous night marveling at how quickly he was provided the information there was a logon at sixforty pm he was told logout at oneohseven am another logon oneoheight we received an alarm at onenineteen called the establishment at onenineteen and passed it on to kpd at onetwentyone am walt clarified that a logon meant logging on to the security system an act that would suggest someone leaving the laundry and that a logoff implied a return yes sir once we caught that alarm we called the client in case it was a false owners supposed to pick up and give us a password that didnt happen no one picked up so we dispatched kpd walt asked for a hard copy to be faxed to him he thanked the guy and hung up and returned to kevin the obvious explanation was an owner or employeesomeone who knew the access code but part of kevins story didnt add up a ski mask over his head youre sure about that it was dark right this was not the description of an employee hitting the cash register i saw him he helped eric put erics fingers on his neck to stop the bleeding the ninja helped eric walt felt confused you said he saved his life the doctor said that walt corrected he helped eric and then when he turned toward me kevins face bunched and walt could see it was painful and ii just ran walt helped him to sit the boy blew his nose and sipped some water through a straw you did the right thing telling me kev were going to work this out i fucked up im so sorry couple of things walt said one youve got to clean up your language two you say nothing to eric and above all nothing to crabtree about any of this i dont want you talking to these guys not a word do we understand each other i got it a nurse cleared her throat she stood inside the door walt had no idea how long shed been there need to change a dressing sheriff she said walt nodded kevin reached out and grabbed walts arm can you stay while she does this it kinda hurts sure walt said he held kevins clenched fist as the nurse removed the bloodied bandage and replaced it with a new one that side of his face had taken a beating the doctors going to come look at this the nurse informed the patient he may want to take one or two more stitches among the bandages and disinfectant walt noticed the sealed needles and suture thats some small suture walt said to the nurse fivezero very small used for face eyes ears nose you mind walt said letting go of kevins hand she passed him one of the sealed plastic bags it contained a slightly curved needle and a coil of very fine suture walt thought back to the contents of the carryon bag found at the airport this is pointzerozerofive he said just to clarify we call it fivezero yes she said five onethousandths of an inch what about three plain old three just the number three as suture number three suture she sounded surprised not in people vets maybebiganimal work theres a joke when youre studying this stuff number five suture is used for towing cars thats the joke she said when walt failed to smile ive got to make another call walt said i understand kevin said remember what we talked about ive got it he left at close to a run his first call was to fiona he asked to see any crimescene photos of suds tub and i was wondering if you could get copies of the contents of that carryon bag to mark aker i realize its a saturday i could have a deputy its no problem walt ill meet you there twentythree w alt didnt bother to call ahead to the vets to check if mark was in given the breakin and the now countywide effort to retrieve the missing pets mark wasnt going anywhere walt entered akers vet clinic with his cell phone glued to his ear both of the cutter brothers passports had been delivered to his office dr mcclure was consulting an optometrist to verify the prescription of the contact lens found in cutters land cruiser fiona entered only minutes behind him got them she declared holding up an envelope the receptionist indicated a door below the sign marked dogs mark aker needed sleep and his beard held cracker crumbs walt spread the photos out on the counter as he said suture needles bandaging hypodermic needles whats that add up to aker studied the photos closing an incision anesthesia or some kind of painkilleris any of that missing from your meds closet we wont know for at least a couple days aker answered were still missing nine dogs seventeen cats and a handful of house pets including a pair of peruvian rabbits confiscated by fish and game of those nine dogs two are my ownsearch and rescue training ten fifteen thousand each one id sold already walt tapped the enlargement of the packaged suture in the photographs number three suture he said not threezero just plain three he looked to aker for some kind of reaction number three is strictly large animal aker said horse or cow or sheep rarely used even around here not people walt said thats what a nurse told me at the hospital no never when i first saw this bag and its contents i was thinking an assassins first aid kit but now i dont know what to think maybe some vet lost it fiona suggested left it on the flight aker rearranged the photographs walt could feel him trying to make sense of it you still could be right aker said its a stretch but if you take all these collectively they could be to close a human wound the large suture simply means its not going to reopen exactly and youre right about the anesthesia andor pain meds with those this makes a fine kit a mobile emergency room walt said i wouldnt go that far walt its a field kit not first aid again he studied the photographs there is one other possibility he took a moment to collect the same instruments and he laid them out on the stainless steel along with several packets of suture they looked like a particularly horrific place setting he nodded to himself and said throw in a very sharp knife or scalpel now he met eyes with walt and you have everything you need for minor surgery twentyfour t revalian understood the endgame these final hours of preparationmuch of it mentalwere for him like an athletes last night before the competition time slowed but he didnt fight it he used what felt like extra hours to doublecheck the plan and prepare for his escape extra clothes sleeping bag water bottles handheld gps hunting knife dry foods he was ready for the backcountry he anticipated the valleys only roadhighway would be roadblocked both south and north the airport would be closed for these reasons he had packed for the wilderness his supplies already in the trunk of the rental from meisners room he dialed an number and a woman answered steel birds excursions this is laura how can i help you its ralph lewis trevalian said mr bloggetts assistant oh yes hello im reconfirming mr bloggetts pickup hell have been in the backcountry a week and i know hell be looking forward to seeing you all she recited the time and the coordinates pm sunday evening n by w trevalian had the location memorized and approved it eight am monday morning if weather prevents and every twelve hours thereafter he said thats correct he thanked her and hung up the call typically unruffled trevalian jolted with surprise at the sound of a knocknot from the door but from behind him he turned to see a womans shapely form out on the balcony although hed pulled his privacy drapes he had no doubt she could identify him as well as he could identify her lilly the jazz singer he wanted to hide he wanted to pull the blackout drapes and he chastised himself for not having done so earlier the back balcony was shared by a dozen rooms and overlooked the outdoor skating rink she knocked again please he didnt need attention drawn to the room who knew how many of the people gathered for an early dinner three stories below might hear her he could make this quick he parted the gauze curtains unlocked the sliding door hello she said shed done well with the makeup he saw no bruises or cuts and though she looked tired there was no selfpity in her face im sorry but im busy lilly she did not take this well sorry to hear about yourordeal please may i come in just for a minute tomorrow would be better he said checking out are you sarcastic nasty no how could you be so spineless she pushed past him sympathy was not in his emotional range shed come to the wrong place he slid the door shut behind her all i needed was a description she complained now patrolling the room slowly her back to him and dont tell me you didnt see him she added accusingly i was looking at you he lied i would have helped if i could have nowat the moment im busy oh i can see that she snapped did he buy you off what he fired back indignantly anything for the right price she asked i helped you he protested i took a chance doing that i had no idea what i was getting into at the timeother than id seen you on stage and i liked your voice he hoped flattery would calm her long enough to get her out the door im singing here again tonight are you sure thats a good idea she shrugged and caught his reflection in the desk mirror making sure he was still watching her he hit me she said he touched me inappropriately im sorry all i wanted was to make sure he was never coming back too much to ask if we could deal with this tomorrow whats so damn pressing mr meisner thats right i know your name so sue me i want an explanation you seemed so nice all they needed was a physical description i think you should go now what youre going to call security or something or something he said he wanted to tell her to stop wandering around the room this above all else worked devilishly against his nerves i just dont understand it she whined how difficult is it she stopped at the connecting door to naglers room he focused on the dead bolt unlocked the door connecting was eversoslightly ajar he watched as her fingers slipped into the opening and pulled you didnt tell me you had a suite she said he moved to shut the doorto cut her off but she was already in a dog she asked whose room is this she turned around looking bewildered when their eyes met hers were filled with fright whats going on here who are you lilly he said oh lilly the weight of disappointment and betrayal impossible to miss twentyfive n ear closing time walt caught up to his father at the sawtooth club a main street restaurant and bar in ketchum that serviced a more subdued clientele than the two rock clubs a few doors down the groundfloor bar was open to a surround balcony for upstairs dining a canoe hung where a chandelier belonged the wait staff was women and men in shorts and tshirts jerry was at the bar making love to a glass of scotch walt had been summoned here he told himself to maintain his cool seeing his father drunk didnt help matters he persuaded jerry onto a couch between two silk ficus trees where he hoped there was less chance of being overheard you shouldnt have used the split tail son his father sounded quite sober despite his looks when you want something done right always do it yourself split tail this photographer of yours youre drunk such a detective you coulda been you know a detective mores the pity walt stood im in the middle of a lot of things right now if youre looking for a whipping boy sit down walt hesitated the door was only a few feet away sitdown walt returned to the couch regretting his cooperating the trouble with the truth is that some people just dont want to hear it youre drunk and im tired maybe another time your girlie girl took the salt lake photos to shaler walt felt himself swallow dryly who fiona dryer caught her and is of course convinced you were behind it oh boy cutters told dryer not to let you anywhere near her before the talk you must be thrilled walt said he glowered no worries he cant roadblock me i wouldnt be so sure dryer can play the federal card couple phone calls and the local guy is out of it thats you walt mulled over his options i dont have much of a role anyway we secure transportation routes thats about it its up to dryer and dick obrien after that theyre the ones that have to keep her safe once inside but if youre right about this shooter i am right walt said the guy is here dad no doubt about it hes here and he means to fulfill that contract so how do i help what he made no attempt to mask his astonishment lets just say hypothetically i was going to help youi have six men with me thats not insubstantial my men will be on the inside you may not be are you playing me walt asked bewildered he glanced around the bar and up into the restaurant whats going on focus son his father said motioning to his own bloodshot eyes what can my guys do on the inside tomorrow what are we looking for you do believe me walt nearly said aloud instead he reached over and sucked down some of his fathers scotch jerry raised his hand and signaled a waitress for two drinks if she goes down on your watch son you not only wont be reelected youll lose any shot at corporate work private work any kind of work youll be blackballed the rest of your life and itll be a stain on the family name walt said bitterly like bobby jerry stiffened thats not what this is about you did such a good job with that one walt said fuck you im offering to help jerry said walt caught sight of the waitress heading back with the two scotches it all felt too cozy he stood before the drinks arrived and threw a fivedollar bill down on the table it landed in a ring of water left from the scotch glass jerry went back to consulting his ice walt moved toward the door reluctantly at first wondering if he was making a terrible mistake sunday one t revalian had three hotel towels laid out on the floor on the first hed placed a pair of his own socks on the second elizabeth shalers jog bra and on the third a pair of naglers shoes find it he commanded releasing callies collar the dog sprang excitedly into action she jumped up and made two circles in the room then came across the towels and nose to the floor moved one towel to the next she sat down sharply in front of the jog bra trevalian stepped forward and rewarded her with a small piece of beef jerky patted her affectionately and praised her he rearranged the towels moving them far apart and began the process anew again callie found the jog bra again she won a piece of beef jerky four out of four he told her good dog two w alt had awakened to an alarm clock at am sunday morning having had four hours sleep he went for a twomile run to wake himself up showered and changed into a fresh uniform by am he was overseeing brandons leadership in securing sun valley road for the onemile stretch from ketchum to the resort while monitoring the sun valley police departments attempts to contain the burgeoning number of first rights protesters who twice had broken through a barricade trying to get closer to the inn and the c gathering only to be pushed back to the area allotted them by am things seemed pretty much in control they intended to briefly shut down traffic on sun valley road allowing for shalers motorcade he had placed deputy tilly his teams second best marksman on top of penny hill working with two spotters best of all his two communications with adam dryer whose agents occupied walts mobile command center had been workmanlike and professional liz shaler came out her front door amid camera flashes surrounded by three of dryers men she met eyes briefly with walt through the gauntlet and to his surprise she seemed to apologize to him or maybe hed taken that wrong they moved her into one of three black escalades walts cherokee led the motorcade tommy brandon in the black hummer took up the rear to the casual tourist and to walt as well this looked like overkill but something told walt otherwise inside he was thinking this isnt enough his cell phone rang and his intention was to ignore it but old habits die hard and he checked the caller id anyway the number came as mark aker walt took the call mark kinda busy at the moment walt said you want to hear this walt knew from the mans tone that it wasnt a social call go ahead weve had thirty volunteers working to find our missing animals as of this morning we have eighty percent found and most of those returned to us thats great but maybe we could do this later among those returned were several dogs and among the dogs were a pair of shepherdsmy search and rescue trainees or so i thought walt decided not to interrupt but he tuned him out slightly to listen in to the running dialogue pouring over the radio all seemed well with the motorcadeand for some unknown reason that made walt all the more queasy we tag our dogs electronic chips placed beneath the skin in the shoulder they both came back without collars so we wanded them just to make sure one had been picked up at the hospital one clear out trail creek some hikers found her thats a long way away but not so far from the lodge true enough better cut to the chase here mark im in the middle of moving shaler were about there the id provided by the chip surprised me it wasnt one of mine after all but i had chipped this dog its toey walt the service dog we loaned the blind guy he must have lost her and been too embarrassed to tell us but what the hell am i supposed to do confront him return the dog to maggie or what what do you want me to do he added meanwhilenews flashim still missing my twentythousanddollar tracker the one you planned to sell walt asked hed tuned out the police band radio under the dash he tuned out more than he should have given that he was leading the motorcade the escalade behind him honked just in time for walt to cut the wheel sharply and turn into the entrance to the lodge and avoid the total embarrassment of missing the turn he felt badly that nagler hadnt mentioned losing the dog he wasnt sure how to approach this himself in his minds eye he saw the contents of the unclaimed backpack spread out on the table as fiona photographed them he saw the gruesome images of the salt lake airport killing the severed fingers the pulled teeth the missing eyes laundry he said pulling the cherokee through the lodges portico shalers escalade pulled in front of the doors laundry walt its mark aker said not understanding walts change of subject all the search and rescue we ever do walt said the dogs are given a piece of clothing right or some personal item of the missing persons a hairbrush a shoe of course they are waltwhat are you talking about s and r the dogs your missing dog is a tracker a sniffer yeah so what he broke into the laundry walt said seeing it clearly now he broke into the laundry he repeated holy shit he was out of the car the phone already back in his pocket the phalanx of press and tourists agents and his own deputies jammed the landing outside the hotels doors as liz shaler was squeezed inside his moment or two of delay had cost himhe was on the outside looking in stand aside he hollered but it did no good liz shalers celebrity had taken over nothing was going to part the crowd there were too many hotel guests and people from townfaces he recognizedwaiting there to be coincidence patrick cutter had arranged a big splashy welcome for her and for the sake of the cameras he lifted up on his toes to see into the lobby liz shaler and patrick cutter were at the center of a knot a camera flashed walt followed its source to a pair of thin arms and finally fionas profile despite the clamor of lizs admirers despite the shouting of obrien and his men for people to get out of the way despite the chaos and confusion fiona somehow turned and looked right at him they met eyes and she immediately understood his problem as he pointed inside fiona was jostled to the side she connected with him once again and waved walt to his left walt backed away from the throng looked left and saw the door a moment later the exterior door leading to the hotel offices locked on a sunday morning sprang open fionas eyes sparkled what a zoo the door closed eliminating much of the shouting from the protesters i know who it is walt announced hes here in the hotel three t revalian stood in line in the inns lobby awaiting his turn at the security checkpoint just past which were the mens and womens bathroomsa piece of the logistical planning that was already drawing complaint at the end of the hall the doors to the banquet hall thats a beautiful dog you have there said a woman behind him he thanked her wondering if she or anyone else had spotted that to a large degree he was directing the dog not the other way around the line moved steadily forward everyone accustomed to and comfortable with the routine women removed their heavy jewelry the men dumped their phones into plastic bins only one woman he saw was also wanded after passing through the metal detector trevalians turn came next hello mr nagler said the young wideshouldered man feeding the xray belt ill take the dog through first trevalian turned his head in that direction but also aimed his face toward the ceiling he passed the handle of the guide harness in that general direction making sure not to appear overly anxious or to put the harness squarely into this mans handsreminding himself to play the blind man the dog was held in check as trevalian searched his pockets he came up with a cell phone some coins and in his coats side pocket a device about the size of a garage door opener he made a good act of feeling for the plastic dish and catching its edge deposited his belongings whats this the guard asked curiously trevalian could see the man was holding the other device my cell phone a garage opener the man asked the dog was led through a metal detector and sounded an alarm dont push it please trevalian said a little too sharply he reached out and found the mans hand and returned the device to the plastic tray shock collar shes still in training well have to xray that collar the harness too no problem of course trevalian said just dont lose her please the guards removed both and ran them through the xray trevalian waited anxiously as the collar and harness were imaged by a third guard behind a tv monitor finally he was waved through the metal detector and passed without incident the bulky collar was reattached to the dog as was the harness once through he returned his belongings to his pockets grabbed hold of the guide handle and moved forward he was inside four t he crowd had thinned the gawkers following liz shalers procession toward a private reception held in her honor prior to her talk walt spotted chuck webb the hotels house detective sheriff chuck i need a room number from you and i need you to put any of your guys you have left over on radios by all the exits i needed this to happen about five minutes ago webb didnt question any of this the urgency in walts voice had convinced him he reached for a handheld radio guests name nagler he racked his memory strange first name i cant remember the blind guy i know who you mean yes chuck spoke into the radio christopher robin he announced its nagler walt repeated thats our internal code to block all doors kids missing that sort of thing my guysll lock them down walt spotted one of obriens men approaching fast cutter intended to throw him out which wasnt going to happenbut it would delay him the room number walt hissed at webb and your passkey i need both right now webb fumbled for a small hub clipped to his belt from which hung a retractable string attached to a plain white plastic card he stuffed it into walts hand he saw obriens man as well and knew trouble when he saw it his radio chirped and webb put it to his ear threetwentyseven he said walt didnt want to initiate a chase with obriens guy but it seemed either that or confrontation that was when someone stepped between them and raised a camera a pulse of white light exploded in the face of obriens soldier fiona walt took off for the stairs the security man cleared his eyes and looked around quickly whered he go he asked webb who answered webb the guard spun around the sheriff was gone and so was the photographer five d anny cutter was on borrowed time the police were after him for ailia holmss murderand his brother was acting strange his fears along with the financial repercussions of her death had kept him up all night he knew he looked beleaguered and beaten down that wouldnt help him any the reception for elizabeth shaler was held in a private dining room danny looked around for stuart holms but knew he wouldnt find him conversation quieted in the direction of liz shaler patrick escorted her through the room making introductions danny tagged along and listened in those in this room had already made campaign contributions the brush with fame was payback he heard someone in the group ahead address the attorney general wed love to give more if only we could your honor but as much as wed like to see you in office were not willing to go to jail for it his bellowing laugh followed patrick piped up saying you might consider her as a speaker for a company event liz looked noticeably uncomfortable at that moment danny understood his brothers determination to make sure liz gave her talk he was overpaying her setting a market value for others to match never mind the tax implications money was money and candidates were allowed to spend their personal wealth on the campaign trail patrick had found a way around the rules and by doing so had made himself invaluable to liz shaler dick obrien appeared out of nowhere he caught patricks eye as obrien shook his head side to side a ghostly pallor swept across patricks face danny knew intuitively this had something to do with walt fleming and the fact that doug aanestad had spent the early morning in private with patrick something was horribly wrong six w alt out of breath stopped in front of fiona right behind him you cant be here he told her yeah well guess what i am a plan formed in his head okaytheres a hotel phone back by the elevator call room threetwentyseven a mans going to answer say youre housekeeping or something but keep him holding that phone yes of course now now she ran down the hall walt followed her with his eyes he waited and waited the phone started ringing on the other side of the door walt waited for the ringing to stop webbs passkey hovering over the card slot but it kept ringing walt slipped in the card the electronic locks led showed red not green webbs card should have been the equivalent of a master key he tried it again red the only explanation he could come up with was that the privacy dead bolt was thrown from the inside he tried the next door over webbs card opened it the room was pitchblack the blackout curtains pulled he called out hello minibar his weapon was drawn and aimed at the carpet in front of him switched on the lights the room was empty there was a connecting door locked from this side he worked through the pulled curtains headed out onto the balcony and crossed to locked and the blackout curtains drawn there also he debated breaking the rooms plate glass window but its tempered glass would explode and that would bring the cavalry that in turn would mean a confrontation with dryer or his men and his fathers warning remained forefront in his thought he returned to fiona stood in the doorway you cannot be here he hissed weve been over that shut the door lock it and stay right there she did so he unlocked the dead bolt to the connecting door connecting doors were pairedeach lockable from its respective roomand hed prepared himself to have to break down the second of the two doors but it hung open a crackunlocked he raised his weapon his chest was tight his mouth dry he eased open the door but his eyes werent adjusted and he couldnt see a thing in the dark room he reached down for the maglite at his belt and the first thing he saw as the light flooded the room was a dog kennel its door open empty seven t revalian was led by a volunteer to his assigned seat at a table that still had empty chairs he introduced himself and awkwardly shook hands with the four already there making a point of naglers insecurity and timidity one of the women stared it took a thumping from her husband to break her trance there was an attempt at small talk but trevalian put a quick end to that the dog lay on the carpet to the right and slightly behind his chair from behind his dark sunglasses he stole a look at the program laid out on his plate it opened with juice coffee tea pastriesi melon the honorable elizabeth shaler attorney general new york state three egg omelet caviar and crème fraîche or mango and strawberry belgian waffle and your choice of north sea smoked salmon irish bacon blood sausage roasted tomatoes quickfried kelp caramelized apples he was amused by shalers listing as part of the menu she appeared to be the second or third course this was not the program hed been told to expect originally her talk had been scheduled to follow the main course not precede it this accelerated schedule affected his planning he had to arm the explosive now well ahead of his original plan he reached down and reassuringly touched the bulge in his coat pocket the shock collars remote control oh my god the woman two seats away gasped she moved her chair back its bleeding trevalian looked there was indeed blood beneath the dog his plan unraveling right before his own blind eyes he steadied his voice she was just spayed ill go check on her let me be your eyes the woman offered i love dogs i can handle it trevalian said sharply he excused himself the dog stood unbothered by her problem and trevalian headed out of the banquet room moving against the crush of incoming guests cost him precious minutes he worried that the woman was going to spring up behind him finally he was in the hall and headed for the mens room as he made it inside two men were just washing up at the sink both caught trevalians reflection in the mirror and both made a point of saying good morning morning trevalian returned leading the dog into the tight stall and closing the door with some difficulty he sat down on the toilet pulled callie to face him her tail swishing back and forth outside the stall door and he waited to hear the two men leave another man entered and urinated but trevalian had no time to wait he removed his sunglasses and holding the dogs collar tightly reached into his outside coat pocket and withdrew a pair of tweezers with no more metal content than a ballpoint pen the tweezers had passed through security undetected and he used them now lowering himself awkwardly to one knee in the cramped space to where he had a good view of callies chest he spread the dogs hair until the pink incision appeareda string of finelooking hookandknot stitches running in a straight line ten inches up her abdomen blood seeped from the middle but he dabbed it with tissue and it seemed to stop he carefully guided the tweezers between the second and third stitches whispering good girl into the dogs ear she tensed with a quick spark of pain but it was over quickly as the tweezers bit down onto a length of wire and extracted it from her chest eighteen inches in all extremely thin aluminum pictureframe wire he wiped it clean with a piece of toilet paper running it up between her front legs he opened the shock collars battery pack and twisted this wire to a second wire inside the shock collar with this connection made the remote device in his coat pocket was now live callie was a fourlegged bomb he pulled her to standing the wire was all but invisible he dabbed her slight bleeding one more time it would have to do he heard a tremendous burst of applause from out in the hall elizabeth shaler was being introduced he reached into the small of his back pulled out the bag hidden there and opened it he slipped the jogging bra out and held it closely to the dogs nose remember this game he said a wan smile forming on his lips as he stood off the toilet the bomb went off he barked out a gasp of surprise heat flooding through him then he realized it was only the toilets automatic flush and he began laughing a dry morbid laugh that resonated and rang out in the small marble stall eight f iona came into the room behind walt as he threw the curtains back i told you to wait he said and i didnt listen he inspected the closet clear whats going on its the dog he said not now when he realized he couldnt explain he tried the bathroom door it was locked he knocked and peered beneath the crack with his flashlight there was no one standing on the bathroom floor he stood reared back and kicked it open the door bounced off the stop and came back at him he blocked its return empty but there was a bloody towel on the floor next to the toilet and a mess on the counter a syringe meds suture a bloody razor blade walt she was scared i see it he caught sight of the trail of blood leading to the tub he pulled back the shower curtain revealing a blond woman her eyes fixed her limbs twisted and contorted unnaturally she was covered in blood fiona tried to speak but stepped back and threw up on the carpet she apologized immediately the vomit still coming from her on the floor by the trash can he spotted several bloodied bandages and a pair of bloodied latex gloves he saw the corner of a cardboard box beneath a bloody towel the box read ess fence another piece of trash caught his attention evertyed surgical suture you all right yes i think call downstairs for chuck webb tell him what we found then tell him im on my way over to the inn theres a shooter at the brunch a blind guy he may or may not have a dog i need backup his backup not the feds have you got that hey fiona got it she whispered keep your cell phone free i may call back here i may want details details she mumbled hey he shouted to break the trance do you have your cell phone she looked up at him and nodded okay he said okay walt hurried down the long hallway to a set of fire stairs a minute later he was outside and running light and sounds blurred the art fair kids playing people shopping another day in paradise he heard nothing but his own quickened pulse people turned to watch the redfaced sheriff at an allout run he was passing through the outdoor mall when his cell phone rang fleming he said walt fionas voice its not her blood shes not cut anywhere i can see can you hear me its not her blood threepointoh walt said largeanimal suture the dog he hurt the dog he pushed himself faster a teenage kid went by on rollerblades bursting through the doors he alarmed the inns desk clerk he turned the corner and ran smack into the security station sheriff he spit out breathlessly he walked briskly through the metal detector tripping the alarm a meaty hand grabbed him by the upper arm spinning him around walt wrestled to break the grip no weapons inside the man said no time walt said out of breath the shooters in there wheres dryer no weapons the two men faced each other walt knew where this was going his father had warned him he removed his gun held it out and broke the mans grip the gun fell he took off an agent close behind him nine p atrick cutter watched from behind elizabeth shaler savoring the moment he saw a room of captivated faces and the unblinking eyes of the five television network news cameras given permission to record liz shaler spoke with authority and passion animating her talk with her beautiful hands there is a growing abyss in this country a divide between haves and havenots that must finally be addressed those of us here today are fortunate to be in the former category but that also puts us in a position of responsibility to have a critical impact on this countrys future an obligation for improvement i see a need for moral certitude yes but administered with a compassion promised by the present administration but never delivered it is time we stand up and say if not me who if not now when the audience erupted into applause a good number jumped to their feet patrick allowed himself a smile then he spotted a redfaced and outofbreath walt fleming at the back of the room and he knew he had trouble walt paused only briefly at the door dryers men were likely on orders to keep him out of this room he searched for nagler for the dog as he walked away from the doors and toward a corner where he could get a look back at the faces much of the crowd rose in applause blocking his view of the room then he spotted his father straight ahead his father spotted him and shook his head as if to say youll never make it ten w e stand at a threshold shaler said from the dais a turning point where we can elect to go back or push forward the choices have never been more clear cutter watched as some heads turned with the sheriffs quick movement here was the very distraction hed hoped to avoiddick obrien would hear about this shaler too took notice of the sheriff angling her head slightlylooking for a possible sign now dryers two agents flanking the stage picked up on him as well liz shaler pressed on we will find solutions with friends from both sides of the aisle but find them we will the best days still lie ahead more applause rippled through an increasingly divided crowd it is no easy task what i propose but i believe i am up to the challenge ladies and gentlemen citizens of the united states i come here today to humbly offer you my services as a fellow concerned citizen a former educator a litigator and yes as a woman she paused and studied the crowd i offer you my candidacy for the president of the united states of america walt continued searching the room for sight of nagler the crowd jumped to its feet he saw nothing but frantic waving and excited faces he risked a look back two of obriens men closing fast walt reached jerry and raised his voice over the thunderous cheering its the blind guymaybe the dog is concealing a piece this is for real dad youve got to go with me on this walt met his fathers questioning look with absolute conviction and confidence you were right walt said theyre coming to get me and they took my piece im with you jerry said okay sorry about this walt said he reached inside his fathers sport coat and took his gun as he spun around there were nagler and the dog on the opposite end of the cavernous room eleven a s the audience rose to its feet trevalian knelt and once again slipped the jogging bra in front of callies snout as he did so he spotted the sheriff immediately both men knew what was going to happen next trevalian let go of the guide harness he said find it the dog took off into the thunderous crowd shaler stepped away from the lectern and began a series of bows it was for her a beautiful moment he looked behind him the cameras rolled he plunged his hand into his coat pocket his thumb hovering over the remotes button twelve l iz shaler waved and bowed her moment of glory upon her cameras flashed brightly a news cameraman tried to part a seam down the standing crowd to get a better shot of the candidate obriens men hurried to cut this off then one of the agents shouted gun he pointed at walt his counterpart dove to take down elizabeth shaler but she had had her eye on walt for the past few seconds when she saw him with a gun in hand she knew hed been right all along walt she screamed walt took a step toward nagler just before he heard someone else cry gun it never occurred to walt that warning was in response to his gun somehow nagler had sewn a gun inside the dog as a means to secret the weapon through securitythat was the picture in walts head by now nagler had removed the gun and intended to use it obviously one of dryers men had been alert enough to see nagler reach for it in his coat pocket what threw him off this notion in those slow split seconds was naglers calm composure his keeping his hand in his pocket and his uninterrupted attention out ahead of himnot looking at shaler but at something much lower in the room the dog at that moment his fathers profile entered his peripheral vision coming in front of him the man was runninga rare enough sight he shouted nooooo as he threw himself in front of walt who recoiled to avoid a collision a loud report of a gun blood sprayed across walts face his father was spun around by the force of the gunshot hed taken a bullet to protect walt and the two met eyes briefly as jerry went down he coughed out roughly go screams and cries as the crowd panicked walt checked the stage liz shaler was pinned down by two agents as men and women stampeded toward the exits he caught one last glimpse of nagler the man was still as a statue his attention locked on the dog and there was the dog nose to the carpet as it roamed in illogical loops sniffing another look in naglers direction but he was obscured by the crowd his father bleeding at his feet the dog hot on a scent and now he knew bomb he shouted thirteen t he dog shied around a fallen chair walt danced through a field of people lying on the floor and crawling under the tables he lunged for the dog caught a back leg she snarled snapped at him and rolled away but walt got a piece of her collar lost his purchase and found his fingers wrapped tightly around something firm and thin the dog yelped and threw walt off her legs in the air as she rolled away from him walt saw a hastily stitched incision running up the dogs abdomen saw that hed been holding a piece of lamp wire that ran from the incision to the dogs collar an image of the discarded box in naglers bathroom ess fence he completed the crossword wireless fence a shock collar a battery carrying enough voltage to trigger a blasting cap trevalians hand inside his coat pocket walt rose and dove again a woman screamed and the dog changed directions walt fell forward and hooked his fingertips around that wire he pulled down hard the dog cried out twisted its neck and bit walts arm the wire broke free walt dropped his fathers gun and picked it back up pandemonium as the two agents dragged liz shaler off the stage but for walt there was only nagler in the room as the man feverishly pressed a remote device that failed to answer a group of fleeing guests obscured his view he glanced over at his father balled up in pain on the carpet he looked back for nagler gone fourteen t revalians plan had been to escape out the service corridor but being so close to the main doors as the stampede of terrified guests approached he went with the flow using it as cover he was carried out and past the metal detector the service corridor would be to his right he turned in that direction separating from those headed for the exit he peeled off the facial hair and ditched the sunglasses worked his arms out of the sport coat and dropped it into a chair now in the bar he spotted an unmarked door to his right and turned toward it the bartender shouted you cant go there but he did go there through the door and a small room of two sinks and shelving and from there directly into the service corridor he headed out the first door marked exit the braying of angry protesters filled the air they stood in the blinding sunlight behind sawhorse barriers marked sun valley police department if there had once been cops there to support that line theyd left at the sound of a gunshot he caught sight of black vehicles speeding off shaler and the secret service the protesters charged forward knocking down the barriers trevalian briefly stayed with the group then broke away hurrying across a patch of lawn toward his rental car parked behind the adjacent dormitory he cut across the grass to the shouts of the protesters free trade equals child slaves he glanced back once instinctively a man jumped from the loading dock a blue uniform the sheriff fifteen i f nagler reached the art fair already crowded with shoppers walt knew hed lose him he considered taking a shot but the man had wisely put himself between walt and the fair lose him to the art fair or risk hitting an innocent bystander following the man through a crowded parking lot walt ran hard to keep up to his right a line of trees blocked the parking lot from the inn to his left tennis courts straight ahead the art fair his only hope was to drop the man ahead of the art fair he angled to his right through a line of parked cars a wall of evergreens and out onto a wide strip of lawn cloistered between the inn and the parking lot in doing so he lost sight of the suspect nagler had started out of the blocks at an incredible pace but that was not sustainable at six thousand feet above sea level not without weeks of training walt paralleled him at the end of the parking lot also the end of the line of evergreens was an access road that headed out of the lot to the southeast it dropped down a hill a shot taken in that direction presented the least chance of wounding a civilian hed have one shot maybe two ten treesnineeight he envisioned each step each motion twoone he turned and slid on the grass lowered his right knee bent his left knee for support braced his left elbow on his left knee hunched forward to sight the weapon he picked up the target a running blur led him slightly and squeezed the trigger sixteen t revalian felt a burning in his right knee and then heard the shot too late his right leg collapsed and he tumbled forward in an ungainly and painful somersault his head dulled he rolled pulled himself up toward standing he went down again blood everywhere his leg on fire he heard screaming then the sole of a boot stomped down on his blown knee and the pain darkened his vision he found himself looking up into the barrel of a gun the sheriff was out of breath and looking down on him seventeen a t pm jerrys eyes opened walt sat in a formed fiberglass chair facing his fathers hospital bed like his nephew before him jerry was hooked up to every kind of wire and tube youre in recovery walt said not sure his father heard him they operated on you got the bullet cleaned you up your lungs collapsed and your right shoulders going to need some physical therapy but all in all you should be pretty happy that those private security boys cant shoot for shit he thought he saw the twinge of a smile and he realized jerry had heard him had understood jerry tried to say something but it came out as more of a dry wheeze walt slipped an ice chip between his fathers lips hed never seen jerry sick had never seen him incapacitated it felt as if this had to be someone else his father croaked out the shooter walt nodded liz shaler is fine im fine no guests were killed his father shut his eyes a moment later he was asleep sheriff walt turned to see special agent in charge adam dryers acnescarred face suspect is out of surgery and has been moved to his room thanks doc says no visitors for four to six hours but well get a crack at him later tonight fyi ill be here walt said im going to stick around yeah sure he said hell of a thing your father did yes it was maybe saved us all maybe so an apology hung between them but it didnt come later dryer said the door hissed shut behind him as he left what a prick his father said one eye creeping open and finding his son walt laughed surprised at how good it felt eighteen t revalian opened his eyes to the sound of beeping he noted the iv tubing and the finger clip monitoring his vitals the bedside curtain was pulled back revealing a private room its wallmounted television dark no phone blackout curtains pulled he wore a hospital gown white with little blue daisies they had a catheter in him alive he thought this was followed immediately by escape he knew how this would go down because hed done a few of these jobs himself eighty thousand patients died unnecessarily in us hospitals each year not all of those deaths were the hospitals fault his being in federal custody was now somebodys worst nightmare phone calls were being made arrangements hed be dead by morning escape he thought for the second time taking in all the medical equipment his wrapped leg the elevated bed the room the temporary absence of handcuffs suggested the nurses needed to move or monitor him during this early going it wouldnt last long he was no doubt heavily guarded from the outside with a bum leg and no weapons he was his own biggest obstacle a sitting duck if he didnt make a phone call within a few hours he looked around the room so little to work with some tubes a few machines too many pillows to count he had several iv stands to work with but they werent going to measure up against tasers and semiautomatic weapons he strained to retrieve the purple plastic tub sealed in stretch film from the adjacent end table there was a washbowl within the tub a toothbrush and toothpaste a comb no razor he wasnt going to win any footraces for all he knew he couldnt put weight on the knee he was trapped theyd caught him he couldnt begin to accept that if he asked they would never bring him a razor he needed for them to bring him one without his asking he spent twenty minutes lying there contemplating this dilemma before spotting the communications jacks in the wall marked ekg he reached for and pushed the button clipped to the stainless steel side rail summoning a nurse three minutes later his room door opened and a matronly woman in blue scrubs appeared behind her looking in briefly was one of the sheriffs men trevalian told the woman my chestim having this pain he tapped his sternum right in here okay she said kindly though both concerned and afraid of him ill let the doctor know well take care of it she knocked to leave the room this was a twist he hadnt expected the door locked from the hallway side nineteen h is name is milav trevalian agent dryer said to walt from the other side of the front booth of the mobile command center currently parked twenty yards from the emergency room we have very little on him at present us attorneys office is stalling us basically because its a sunday and everyone in washington is out on a yacht or a golf course my guess is nothing much happens until tomorrow morning but we question him later tonight walt said it was pushing eight oclock with the doctors permission yes ive got him on capital murder chargesthe singer the woman we found in his bathtub boise is sending up forensics to process that scene thats between you and the ausa i have no idea how theyll want to charge him listen i gave you a shout because the ag wants to see you if youre going to do that it has to be right now shes at the house i cant leave walt said understood ill pass it along dryer pushed some papers aside how is he going to be okay he saved your life walt lowered his head the mans words resonating his uniform shirt was speckled with his fathers blood at one time hed thought hed spend his life hating the man how quickly that had passed he needed time to decompress hell of a thing you did too dryer said it came together it was a group effort the hell it was but its good of you to say so walt motioned to the back of the bus you mind ive got some clean shirts back there help yourself its your vehicle sheriff he grabbed hold of walts arm as walt passed the doghow the hells the dog were awaiting a bomb squad tech from salt lake he checked his watch probably here by now hell work with our vet a fucking dog dryer said sounding exasperated right through our checkpoint knowing he had failed and that at some point this was coming back onto him knowing walts earlier warnings would come back to haunt him yeah walt said how about that twenty a different nurseyoung and overweight in loosefitting blue scrubswheeled in the ekg trolley she maintained a professional air as she asked some questions explained the ekg and then helped him to sit up she got his arms out of the nightgown and folded it across his lap trevalian scanned the contents of the cart he had a chest thick with brown hair but it was his nine scars that caught and held her attention her eyes jumped clinically one to the next and he could imagine her explaining them to herself two bullet wounds three stabbings and four lacerations she dispensed some shaving cream from a can and applied it to several areas on his chest she then shaved him rinsing the razor between strokes in the purple tub of warm water that shed filled in the washroom when she was done she took a towel to him and told him theyd wait a minute for the skin to dry completely could i trouble you for a refill he handed her the plastic pitcher of ice water from his bedside no problem she headed into the washroom trevalian slipped his hand through the side rail and snatched a disposable razor from a box on the lower shelf of the ekg trolley he slipped it under the covers between his legslet her find it thereand lay back on the pillows hed spiked his heart rate and pumped up his adrenaline wondering if that might skew his ekg the nurse returned with the water poured some and actually held the cup for him as he sipped from the straw like taking candy from a baby he thought twentyone t revalian waited for the dinner tray to be removed and the hospital room door to shut and the clicking of the dead bolt in the doorjamb he checked the clock pm the nurses had been checking on him every two hours he administered one last dose of painkiller from the electronic box attached to his bed and went to work disconnecting the iv tube they had removed the catheter in the late afternoon and were no longer monitoring his vital signs so he had little concern of alerting the nurses station to his activities he lowered the side rail unhooked his leg swung it over the bed and waited for the rush of blood and pain to his head to subside then onehanding the iv stand he prodded the ceiling tile and to his relief it moved he was reminded of placing rafe naglers body bag into just such a hiding place at the salt lake city airport how interesting he thought that things should come full circle like this he moved the panel out of the way and slid it to the side but only far enough to look vaguely out of place the key to any ruse was psychologyto push and pull the adversary allowing him his own discoveries trevalian wasnt going to make this too obvious he covered the disposable razor with a towel and crushed it against the vinyl tile floor making sure to pick up every last speck of broken plastic he then removed a piece of adhesive tape from his arm and taped one of the razors two narrow blades to the end of a pen that read st judes community hospital he tested it and added yet another piece of tape for reinforcement now it behaved like an xacto knife the blade holding strongly to the end of the pen a tool a weapon he listened carefully for any indication his crushing of the razor had been overheard silence he checked the clock one last time and then continued his work twentytwo t ommy brandon sat across from room at st judes hospital furnishings compliments of christopher guest and jamie lee curtis read a plaque immediately below the door number you ever see her in that one with arnold brandon asked the secret service agent who had the chair closer to the hospital room door this man was technically in charge he was also unresponsive brandon continued true lies jamie lee that little dance she did funny really funny and sexy come on still the agent failed to acknowledge him this is what they call the technical integration of law enforcement agencies right brandon said sarcastically the politicians are fucking brilliant put a sock in it will you said the agent we start out like this its going to be a long night both agents saw a nurse approaching brandon immediately looked away keeping his eyes on the exit door at the end of the hallway the two men had the entire hallway covered he had an ekg not an hour ago the agent said to the approaching nurse how often are you going to check on him just doing my rounds officer doing my job same as you its special agent the man corrected i was just making conversation and i was just making conversation back weve got to search you the man advised her i know brandon did not take his eyes off the far door he just came on shift youll have to forgive him he doesnt realize youve already been through this three times maddie its all right lets get it over with please she raised her hands out like wings she told the agent you get fresh with me and your senior officer will hear about it special agent in charge the man said correcting her again hes still going to hear about it he patted her downgently and carefullyand cleared her okay you can go inside gee thanks she said she waited for the agent to unlock the door she went inside and he relocked it behind her its sunday brandon told him no one likes getting a call on a sunday every days the same to me the agent said thats kind of sad you ask me brandon fired back with the room door shut brandon was free to look in whatever direction he wanted he chose to stare down the agent but no one did ask you the agent said determined to have the last word brandon could have kept playing but decided against it it was going to be a long night and the sheriff seemed determined to keep him hereand away from his trailerfor as long as possible twentythree o nly seconds after the nurse entered the hospital room there was a pounding on the doornot the casual knock that brandon had grown used to but a frantic fullfisted effort her voice barely made it through the thick door but it sounded as if she was in a panic brandon and the agent took positions both with their weapons drawn and the agent unlocked the door he stepped back prepared for a hostage situation where trevalian was using the nurse to startle them she was redfaced wideeyed and overly excited hes gone she said the bedi checked the bathroom brandon glanced at the agent then punched his radio and rattled off several codes relaying an emergency it was quickly worked out that the agent would go in but without his weapon brandon pulled the nurse out of the doorway get gone he said the agent pulled open the door the bed was empty he edged toward the closet and slid the door across empty glanced under the bed nothing moved cautiously toward the bathroom the door standing open checked the reflection in the mirror firstthe bathroom appeared empty he yanked the shower curtain back no one then he caught it out of the corner of his eye a ceiling panel over the bed slightly askew not like the others clear he shouted he returned to the hallway where several more deputies had gathered he used hand signals to direct brandon to follow together they entered the room he pointed to the ceiling panel brandon climbed onto the end table and popped the ceiling panel out of its frame he poked his head inside and squeezed a flashlight past his chin shit he exclaimed his voice dampened looks like a panel over the bathroom goes up into a crawl space or something he jumped down and repeated the procedure from the countertop in the bathroom he broke away several of the flimsily hung ceiling tiles stretched onto his toes affirmative theres egress here he ducked out of the ceiling and looked down he could be fucking anywhere by now twentyfour w alt had spent the last hour in the mobile command center writing up a summary of events his eyes strayed to a seating chart thumbtacked to a corkboard it was a large sheet showing tables and seating arrangements for the shaler brunch of all the seats one was marked with an x dryer felt his presence what thats the seating plan for liz shalers talk walt suggested yes it is dryer agreed why the x on stuart holms walt asked we were reaching on the off chance the contract on the ag came from someone attending the conference we looked at who failed to attend his was the only empty seat and the initials by his name walt asked explain it to me exactly what it says meal preference do you want a regular meal vegetarian meal do you have your own personal chef are you allergic to wheatyou know how these people are walt referred to his notebook and flipped back through the pages he asked and whats that date printed down there by the file name bottom of the sheet dryer leaned closer sixsix june sixth what is it sheriff stuart holms uses a personal chef name of raphael he said consulting his notebook wont eat a bite if its not prepared by raphael hes fanatic about it well thats stuart holmss seat and hes down for a regular meal whats it matter i think you need some rest what it means i think is that six weeks agoon june sixthholms already knew he wouldnt be attending liz shalers talk and so why bother with meal preference if hes not going to be there walt nodded maybe yeah dryer did a doubletake first looking at the seating plan then back at walt his brow creased tightening his eyes naa but he didnt sound as convinced as a minute earlier a knock on the coachs door was followed by the big head of dick obrien sheriff you got a minute twentyfive w alt climbed out of the mobile command center wearing a fresh black tshirt that read search and rescue on the back obrien apparently never stopped sweating hey there obrien said hey there yourself walt answered how is heyour dad i mean came through the operation with flying colors good to hear yes it is walt said my guywho shot himit was meant for you the gun and all thats comforting i just mean he was doing his job if you can go easy on him we could make a trade you and i walt proposed could we must have steamed him her taking to his brother all over again dont go there walt jealousy is a powerful motivator a man like patrick gets anything he wants right but when your rival turns out to be your own brother what then this is a big mistake was a big mistake his mistake walt said you helped me on the bridge whyd you do that dont know what youre talking about lets say your boss killed hersome kind of accident lost his temper but who took her down there and put her in that cage who did that to her who was it carried her up the hill trail and dumped her he studied obrien who seemed to be sweating more profusely it was his trying to implicate danny that pushed you over the top wasnt it danny was a good fit for it and you knew thats how id see it that danny would go down for it obrien remained tightlipped you must have also known there wouldnt be near enough evidence to prove any of thisit would come down to a jury trial and if danny went down for it hed go down and that would be that i wish i had the slightest idea of what youre talking about the thing i dont get is the workout clothes shed already run that day she wouldnt have gone running again so youor someone elsehad to get her into running clothes it had to be running clothes to sell that shed been out adams gulch but whered they come from those running clothes did she keep some clothes at patricks was that it something she could jump into if his wife came home early i dont get the clothes im glad your dad is doing better he turned to break off the conversation then turned back again ive been within an arms reach of patrick for four solid days walt thats the gods truth you give me cutter and any of your guys involved in the coverup will walk brandon s frantic voice called out a series of codes over the radio walt went running right past obrien clutching his gun belt to keep it from slapping wishing hed had more time to see if the man had been ready to make a deal twentysix w alt paced trevalians empty room brandon standing in the doorway watching he checked the windowsall fixed glass none broken he wandered into and then back out of the bathroom he approached the closet and slid open the doors walt had only glanced in there the first time now he returned for a more thorough look theyd been searching the grounds for the past hour with no sign of the suspect theres a ceiling hatch leads up into the joists brandon said breaking the silence up over the bathroom three of the rooms on this floor have similar access climbing with that knee of his you think walt said he squatted and looked beneath the raised bed he turned over a pillow then another he lifted the bedding and peered under the sheets this guy is seriously wounded and hes clever if were thinking he climbed out through the roof then you can bet he didnt he touched another pillow then spun around sharply on his heels facing the closet again you went through all this he asked indicating the closet brandon answered theres nothing in there unless hes hiding in a drawer walt reached up into the closet and pulled out the pillows as he did so he said did you happen to notice that three of the pillows on the bedthe ones that were under his kneewere stripped of their pillowcases do you pay attention to anything other than the nurses brandon fumed but knew better than to answer walt opened the end of one of the pillowcases taken from the closet then looked up disapprovingly at brandon and shook its contents onto the floor discovering big chunks of foam and fabric a section of a zipper he hurried now and shook out the other pillowcase as well spilling out similar contents help me out walt said spinning back around and lowering the hospital beds side rail the two dragged the mattress off the bed and flipped it over upside down onto the floor the bottom of the mattress had been cut away with something sharp into a human formhead shoulders legs arms three sections of clear tubing had fallen to the floor he was in the room all along walt said faceup under the mattress breathing tubes he said picking them up in here the whole time we were out there looking for him furious at him now walt shouted one officer always protects the crime scene jesus christ tommy he stormed out of the room already putting himself into the contrarian mind of trevalian where would he go how could he hope to escape the valley was there someone helping him then it came to him dryers men and most of his deputies had been deployed to search the hospital top to bottom he hoped he wasnt too late twentyseven t revalian had found his way into town on the most direct route available and one he was quite certain the cops wouldnt think to search or roadblock the bike path hed stoved in the head of a deputy who stood guard outside the bottom of the hospital fire stairs and had left him unconscious and stripped of his clothes a sock down his throat his hands cuffed behind him he had the mans cell phone and now wore his uniform though the shoes were a size small and his feet were killing him a wheelchair had gotten him most of the way into town along the bike path while fifty yards to his right cop cars raced up and down the highway hed ditched the chair at the turn to the ski slopes when the painkillers wore off he was going to be in serious trouble from somewhere near the center of town he called the memorized number and left a page when the recorded message told him to do so he hoped he wasnt too late if a contract had gone out on him it might not be rescinded he waited five minutes passed ten finally the phone rang and he answered the call go ahead a male voice said the engagement was broken off he said so i heard most disappointing i had a little problem getting away from the church but thats behind me now im free free yes but my inlaws are never going to let me out of this town i could use a place to stay thats the problem with being single the man said youll think of something i need your help with this im afraid not you failed to consummate the marriage at that moment a helicopter passed overhead at first trevalian had trouble hearing and hoped the contact hadnt hung up but then much to his surprise the same sound of the helicopter was in his other ear the ear pressed to the phone he scanned the sky and spotted the flashing red and white lights as it flew to the far end of town it hovered and then landed halfway up knob hill it looked to be a private home the size of a country club in the phone he heard nothing the call had disconnected a moment later it rang again and he answered there was no sound of the helicopter in the receiver and he wondered if hed actually heard it coming from the phone or not the bride is still in town the voice said her fathers place try to work things out with her if youre successful contact me again ill see what i can do to assist you trevalian hung up wondering if he could walk any farther twentyeight w alt reached the emergency room at a run a secret service agent guarded the door dryer walt asked not slowing special agent in charge dryer is in the command center tell him its shaler hes going for shaler im not your message boy the agent shouted after him walt jumped into the cherokeeand sped away five minutes later he was negotiating the streets of ketchum he parked uphill a block from shalers house pulled the shotgun from the dashboard and doublechecked its load he realized too late that his protective vest had come back from cleaning and was still in his office the crickets chimed a dog barked in the distance the smell of wood smoke lingered in the air he moved stealthily in shadow avoiding the streetlight quickly closing the distance to shalers house this was the identical route hed ridden as a pedal patrolman eight years earlier and for some reason he thought of his brother and how much he missed him he snuck down a driveway and past a neighbors house he slipped over a rail fence that bordered shalers driveway his heart tight his breath short procedures called for him to wait for backup dryers men couldnt be far behind his earpiece carried the monotonous prattle of his dispatchers voice he needed silence so he called in his location and went offair he approached shalers kitchen door stealthily but not wanting dryers sentries to mistake him for an intruder he paused and studied the layout looking carefully for signs of the agent guarding the back door no one adding to his confusion the interior lights were out this went against protocol the place should have been lit like a christmas tree he carefully made his way to the back door his shoe hit something slippery right as his nose picked up the metallic smell of blood he onehanded the shotgun and checked the shrubbery with his maglite twin soles faced him the agent had been clobbered his head was bleedinga good sign he was out cold walt moved quietly through the door and into the kitchen the all too familiar hallway stretched before him trevalian would have taken the agents gun no vest he reminded himself he crept down the hallway the flashlight off but held beneath the shotgun the first door hung open a small bedroom empty the study door to the right also open the room empty his eye caught a glint on the carpet he reached down and touched it sticky blood it could have been an agents or shalers but something told him trevalians stitches had popped he worked down the hallway passed a bathroom and a linen closet one door remained shalers bedroom consumed by his memory of eight years earlier his courage waned as his scar pulsed with pain he twisted the head of the flashlight kicked open the door and stood to the side expecting a shot then an enormous crash of glass someonesomethinggoing out a window he dove into the bedroom the shotgun pressed tightly against his shoulder looked leftright clear bellycrawled to the louvered doors of the closet clear walt got to his knees shaler lay in the bed absolutely still but then the flashlight caught her it wasnt shaler but a mannequin a safe room a panic room he kicked some errant glass from the broken window and climbed outside a man in uniforma sheriffs deputywas well up the hill keeping to shadow he dragged a leg behind him walt heard sirens approaching halt walt yelled out at the top of his lungs trevalian ducked into shadow police cruisers and sheriffs vehicles slid around both street corners nearly simultaneouslybehind walt and in front of him they stood off aware of the limited range of the shotgun their overhead racks threw off colors as two searchlights were aimed onto walt from opposite directionseach blinding the other car and leaving walt a fuzzy glowing image between them walt was no longer wearing his uniform shirt and the word was out that a sheriffs uniform had been stolen hands in the air a megaphone voice called out walt dropped the shotgun shouting its me he turned to face his own sheriffs vehicle stand down brandon s voice called out to the ketchum police car its sheriff fleming amplified shouting back and forth with walt caught in the middle he knew the quickest way to resolve this was to lie down on the asphalt until the ketchum cop got it right doing so now walt peered into the shadows wondering if theyd lost trevalian again twentynine t revalian arrived at the mansions front door sweating bleeding and out of breath a man on the run he pounded hard on the twin doors pushed the intercom button repeatedly and then pounded on the door again he looked behind him back toward the gate then returned to pounding on the door a man came from the side of the house he wore a blue blazer and a scowl he held a gun and was backed up by a second man behind him who now appeared to trevalians left hands on your head step away from the door good hands where i can see them okayon your knees i cant my kneelisten trevalian said frantically you gotta get me out of here weve got to do this someplace else you know who i am im being pursued he lay down on the driveway we have to hurry fellas the owner of this houseask him but make it quick less than a minute later he was loaded into a golf cart and driven around backthrough a gate in a tenfoothigh fenceand escorted into what appeared to be a guesthouse it was all hardwood floors and stickley furniture indirect lighting and lots of glass the city of ketchum spread out below just past the silhouette of the helicopter sitting on its concrete pad on the edge of a vast lawn four security guards kept their distance the man to speak to him wore a tommy bahama floral shirt and pale trousers he offered trevalian a bottle of water trevalian gulped it down so talk this man said not to you trevalian said with all due respect him or nobody and if you kill me then the three letters that are in a mailbox in town get picked up in the morning and go to the sheriff the newspaper and cnn they contain all the details about this jobthe emails the payments you think anything is totally untraceable you want to take that chance i get what i want out of this and i give you the location of the mailbox and you put a little lighter fluid down it and no ones the wiser and if you think youll beat the mailboxs location out of megive it your best shot he chugged some more water draining the bottle tommy bahama left the building he returned more than ten minutes later with yet another security guardthat made fiveand a man in his sixties wearing a white terrycloth robe and leather slippers mr holms trevalian said id stand but the knees a little worse for wear i believe youve made a mistake stuart holms said waiting as tommy bahama helped him into a seat the mistake was yoursor whoever called me back the package was not at home you had bad intel there was a mannequin in her bed youve got the wrong man holms said im a little short on time mr holms the sheriff is out there looking for me secret service police we havent got long elizabeth shaler cost you payback is payback i understand that if ive made a mistake then turn me over to them if on the other hand ive not then we should be talking about me spending a few days in your panic room or catching a ride in your helicopter stuart holms regarded him with contempt then we wait for the police hide me until they drop the roadblocks trevalian said use your position your power your attorneyswhatever youve gotto keep me well hidden get me to someplace like reno or portland thats it no money no extortion i have a reputation to protect we both do holms exchanged a look with tommy bahamaimpossible to read the location of the mailbox tommy bahama said not yet trevalian said how do you know we wont kill you once youve given us the location of the mailbox holms asked how do you know ill give you the right mailbox what if its a ups drop box that doesnt get picked up until six pm tomorrow night they cant keep roadblocks up indefinitely i dont intend to be here past six pm tomorrow you didnt post any letter holms said you can play that card if you want thought it all through have you holms could no longer sit still he came out of his chair and paced thats what you hired me for tell me otherwise he stopped in front of trevalian glaring it was the helicopter that got you trevalian explained i heard the helicopter over the phone how many guys have their own helicopter in this town more than youd think six pm tomorrow and then youre gone holms stated and ill want those letters the security guys all touched their ears at once perimeter alarms one of them said with his finger to his ear tommy bahama nodded its a fucking army stuart holms growled at tommy bahama tell me you searched him for a wire bahama grimaced and looked over at the lead security guard who stared back vacantly dumbstruck trevalian casually unbuttoned the top two buttons of his shirt revealing the tiny microphone taped to his shaved chest i was a little slow on this bum leg business is business am i right mr holms shoot him holms shouted to the paralyzed tommy bahama the door crashed open and in charged a swat team all shouting at once for hands in the air the third man through the door was sheriff walt fleming he was grinning monday am one t hey separated the suspects stuart holms was confined to the situation room the small conference room down the hall from walts office emil guyot holmss director of security a man outfitted in tommy bahama casual wear was given the coffee room a closetsized kitchen that held a beatup aluminumlegged table for two in the corner adam dryer had no jurisdictional authority to question anyone and with the general consensus being that stuart holms and his attorneys would find some way to get him out of lockup within the next few hours and certainly by morning for walt it all came down to these two interviews he sucked down what remained of lukewarm coffee dryer nursed a milk tea but kept looking into the cup his acnescoured face snarled in disapproval they occupied walts small office overcrowded with stacks of journals piled on the floor and some backcountry gear crammed into the far corner dryer sat facing walts desk brandon walt called out his voice echoing down the hall his deputy arrived promptly the only person in the office who didnt look completely exhausted at am sheriff shut the door walt said brandon closed the office door and stepped inside walt did not offer him the only remaining chair he lowered his voice despite the fact that both holms and guyot were down the hall behind closed doors each being guarded by a deputy i want you to find me a plaster cast a boot impression in the evidence room im thinking the thompson case or maybe the ramone arson adult shoe size no matter what i want it in an evidence bag marked hill trail adams gulch date it yesterday saturday got it brandon said and i need a contact lens find someone out there who doesnt mind making a sacrifice for the cause the office will buy em a new one now heres the important part julie has a whole rainbow of highlighters in her desk i want to use the blue highlighter to make a small dot on the side of the contact lens not too small not too big you got all that shoe impression contact lens brandon repeated go on and close the door behind you brandon left them alone i dont follow dryer said once they were in privacy the ausa out of boise isnt going to get up here until tomorrow around noon walt said referring to the assistant united states attorney you and i both know that stuart holms will have four or five attorneys around him by that timemost from out of stateand that what we caught on trevalians wire while incriminating and enough to give us probable cause may not carry the day in court im no legal scholar dryer said we have trevalians use of one of my deputies cell phonehe stole it at the hospitalthat may be able to be connected to an incoming call he received if we can confirm that call was from guyot then we have a substantially stronger case against them and we took a cell phone off guyot cloned or not that could be the smoking gun we need i can hear in your voice that youre doubting all this dryer said holms is a shrewd businessman you hear words like tenacious and ruthless i have to think that if guyots involved and i believe he is that holms has promised him the moon if anything ever went wrong now it has you can bet the two of them have coached each other rehearsed and worked through all possibilities including this one arrest theyre following a plan thats been in place for at least six weekswe know that from the shaler seating plan maybe six months theyre too well prepared on the shaler front they know what to expect whats coming my one hope is to endrun them before the attorneys get involved fucking attorneys how are your acting skills walt asked with a baby face like this dryer asked even a weary smile did nothing to improve his gangster looks two i m not speaking until i have representation stuart holms announced from the far side of the conference table he looked at home as if this were another of his boardrooms you just spoke dryer said but i get what you mean he sat across from holms whod been given time back at the estate to lose the terrycloth robe and don a pair of slacks and a plaid shirt he wore loafers with no socks he looked old dryers chair fronted a corkboard where walt had had the shaler seating plan hung prior to holmss arrival the man had been facing it now for the past ten minutes the thing about businessmen like you theyre always trying to save money conserve resources a tape recorder ran on the corner of the table stuart holms could barely take his eyes off it he said nothing he seemed to be working hard to keep contempt off his face but it was a losing battle the sheriff has an interesting theory you want to hear it ill take that as a yes its a little farout for mehis theory but hes convinced mr guyot has a lot more to lose than you and so hes starting there with mr guyot down the hall the point being that one of you will deal you think you wont but of course you will everyone goes into this thinking they wont deal and whoever deals first rolls on the other guy and then that other guy ispardon my frenchfucked dryer sipped from his tea and gave it that same look of disgust if you spend the night here dont ask for the tea ill be home within the hour holms said a sunday night early monday actually in july you think you could be right i suppose he sampled the tea again same result he said so heres the thing have you had a chance to look at this seating plan behind me holms looked up and gave the impression this was the first time hed paid any attention to it you know why we got that out to take a look at it because we wondered if any of cutters invited guests had missed the shaler brunch because there could be two reasons for that someone was sick or had a scheduling conflict or someone wanted to avoid being present when the bomb theyd arranged to kill shaler went off and as you can see by the xs only two people missed the talk you and your late wife you should be ashamed of yourself this is the sheriff were talking about but your point is taken anywaythe sheriff said something about a guy named raphael your chef i believe holms did a very good imitation of being bored by all this dryer knew differentlyhe had his eye on a vein in the mans neck his pulse was elevated his eyes dilated and he was growing increasingly restless walts emphasis had been on taking away the mans sense of control it seemed to be working dryer thought he said how you dont eat anything that isnt prepared by this guy raphael and i suppose thats a personal thing and ive got no comment although my personal chef is a guy named mcdonald but i doubt the two know each other so anyway the problem for the sheriff is this seating chart prepared back in june that has you down for the regular meal no raphael and ive got to admit he has a point it seems to suggest you knew back in june that you wouldnt be attending the shaler brunch holms glanced up at the seating chart then his eyes darted to meet dryers before once more landing on the chart wisely he chose not to comment the blue bead on his neck was growing and beating wildly his adams apple jumped as he tried to swallow i figureor rather the sheriff doesthat you wanted to save raphael in case the bomb took out the kitchen help so you didnt book him why lose a good chef heres where it gets a little extreme even for me dryer continued the sheriff believes not only that you killed your wifeor had her killedbut that you planned it far enough in advance to make sure it gave you the ultimate excuse not to attend the shaler brunch who was going to question a grieving widower but thats where the irony comes in because here i am questioning you so maybe that part didnt work so well holms blinked rapidly but still managed to say nothing dryer smiled openly well aware that when contrasted with his acnescarred cheeks he looked menacing when doing so heres what may interest you mr holms it did me the sheriff has no intention of pursuing trevalian and you for the attempted assassination of elizabeth shaler thats why im hereim federal hes state hes leaving all that to my office and the ausa to sort out hes focused on one thing and one thing only the murder of your wife that was done on his turf he says youre good for itsomething about a fingerprint developed on a contact lensand who am i to argue its his show if he wants to make an ass out of himself who am i to interfere holms endeavored to stay calm but it was a battle he was quickly losing three e mil guyot in his tommy bahama hawaiian shirt and what had once been creamcolored trousers looked like he belonged on south beach walt perused a copy of the mans california handgun registration learning what little he could from it so emil you understand that possession of an automatic weapon carries a minimum sentence idaho has very liberal gun laws but on that one were kinda strict he added be advised that im running a recording devicepointing to his ipodjust so we dont get into who said what emil mugged for walt but didnt speak he was no doubt on orders to wait for holmss attorneys the only hope for you on the gun charge is to have it dropped altogether theres no such thing as a lesser charge when it comes to customizing a weapon not in this state ive got nothing to say to you im waiting for my attorney were all waiting for something walt said pleased that the man had started talking for one thing i cant drop the charges without an attorney present youre not dropping any charges no youre right im adding to them walt said hows capital murder suit you he had to give it to the guy he wouldnt want to play poker against emil guyot a guy like stuart holms amazing businessman a legend i hear probably a pretty lousy husband his love is for money and power and since women love both of those too it comes down to control and that can get nasty im recently divorcedor about to be something of an expert hes probably a good guy to work for though right you must make five six times what i do ten ouch walt said he leaned down and set the plaster cast on the table with a thump it was enclosed in a large plastic evidence bag marked as hed instructed brandon then he pulled out the small evidence bag containing the blue contact lens he spread fionas crimescene photographs out like fanning a deck of cards where the handcuffed guyot couldnt help but look at them you strike me as a gambling mana man who knows his way around a deck of cards or a gaming table ive got some odds for you in case youre wondering why we collected your shoes a few minutes ago its because of this he patted the plaster cast thankfully my job doesnt require too much thinking it all comes down to the evidence juries just love evidence the tv show csi thats helped us prosecute cases in ways you wouldnt believe juries eat this stuff up they understand it better they believe it fuck you me whatd i do youre the one who killed her fuck that were taking plaster casts of your shoes right as we speak by the time they dry and are compared to this he said patting the bag again any opportunity to pleabargain is gone tell that to holmss attorney gamble all you like im not talking to you guyot said then what do you call it guyot stared back with a stoic face he promised you a ton of money didnt he promised you hed get you out on appeal if anything went wrong and that youd be rich as croesus when you got out the thing is he was talking about the shaler thing trevalian and maybe hes right maybe he could get you out of that at some point hes a powerful man as i understand it you have no idea hell have you chasing traffic tickets before this is through no its through already its over emil he held up the blue contact lens you know what that is the lab uses fumes to develop prints on certain surfaces they can develop prints on human skin on fabricon things you wouldnt believe contact lenses for instance walt pushed back his chair poured himself some more coffee and sat back down making a point of his fatigue you guys heard about us going into the pound didnt you word got outits a damn small valley and people cant keep their mouths shut and that doesnt help me any ill tell you what once we made that connection i imagine mr holms became a bit concerned the idea had been to blame it on a cougar right but you la guys dont spend enough time here two separate cougar attacks in two days are you kidding me not in ten years twenty forty not ever and when holms realized wed figured out you dumped her in the cage when he knew wed be looking at murder he overreacted you both did he let his jealoushusband side take over you should have been looking for that you been smoking contraband from the evidence room sheriff you better watch out for that walt went absolutely still he let a minute pass then another to both men it seemed much much longer then he took a deep breath let out a long sigh and let his true emotions color his voice you picked the wrong car asshole he waved the bag containing the contact lens in the mans face danny cutter wasnt driving the toyota patrick was dannys the one mr holms wanted framed for this not patrick we were all over danny until we found the contact lens this contact lens the one on which they developed a latent print the blue stuff thats what the fuming doesturns any oils from fingerprints blue but patrick didnt kill herwe can account for every second of his existence and danny never drove the toyota duh you should never have gone along with trying to frame danny youve got to learn when to say no to the boss guyot had lost all his color and found it impossible to sit still his upper lip held a sheen of nervous sweat and his eyes could no longer risk finding walts hes in the other room right now hearing about this same evidence hes being offered a deal a plea bargain now who do you think is the better deal maker you or stuart holms who do you think is going to come out on the short side of this one when you found that contact lens you should have just thrown it out those are your prints on it right well be comparing them in the morning they sure as hell arent his hers if youre luckybut i dont think youre all that lucky emil and forget about him ever springing you for this you go down in this state for capital murder they throw away the key welcome to the wild west the man was breathing hard like a runner at the end of a race all that pentup anger and frustration straining at the edges of his eyes and pursing his lips to where theyd gone white never follow the wishes of a jealous husband walt said he thought of brandon and gail he waved in one of his deputies to keep an eye on the man but stopped at the door and jiggled the bag holding the contact lens and the other one holding the plaster cast you think either of these is going to implicate stuart holms no and he knows that he was counting on that that and the power of your greed he knows all about greed stuart holms all he needs is for your greed to buy your silence through the trial then hes home free and youre the one in the orange suit four f iona ran off a series of photographs as stuart holms emil guyot and milav trevalian were walked out of the sheriffs office in orange jumpsuits and wearing manacles some stragglers from the first rights gathering including bartholomew were contained across the street by the new city hall chanting and waving their fists walt couldnt make out their slogan several of the national reporters had remained in town for the pm news conference conducted by the assistant united states attorney there would likely be even more press by the time the convoy reached boise a good twohour drive he confessed about two minutes after holmss attorneys arrived walt told fiona this was around three am they walked right past him and went in to talk to holms and guyot had a total meltdown lousy customer service itll get you every time but you said holms will get off i said guys like him always get off who knows his poor wife walt had a couple of things to say to that but he kept them to himself tommy brandon was one of the deputies helping to get the two into the waiting vehiclesthe suspects were being driven down separately in their own suburbans the feds had bigger budgets dryer and his men were part of the escort none of the three would have any further contact with one another until the various trials if there were trials and trevalian she asked a lot of this is still up in the air we caught trevalian shortly after my own people tried to arrest me outside of liz shalers hes no newcomer to this he thought he knew the location of the person whod hired him and he parlayed that into a quick deal with the ausa he answered her bewildered look assistant us attorneyand was promised a maximum of eight years if he cooperated which he then did he led us to stuart holms he and guyot he continued will both do time either one could benefit from further pleabargaining there are a lot of stories to tell id like to hear your story the one you wouldnt tell me she said he wondered about asking her out for dinner not a kissatthedoor kind of dinner just food shared across the same table the spark was there for a minute but then it faded behind an aching fatigue that warned he might not wake up for days brandon caught them standing together maybe caught a glint of the spark walt had felt because he looked quickly away when walt busted him for staring as he walked past them he spoke to fiona he tell you about the contact lens frickin piece of genius and he continued into the office genius huh fiona said trying to make walt look at her at some point im likely to wake up walt said watching the suburbans pull out one by one and when i do im going to be dying for a cup of coffee start small he was thinking work your way up to lunch so call me she said i will i hope you will but fear you wont he drove home alone took a shower alone sat down on the bed alone with plans to call mark aker about the dogs condition and wanting to follow up on kevins legal status he looked forward to the girls being home and getting back some semblance of life the phone rang and he nearly didnt answer it but something compelled him tohe had a hell of a time saying no walt liz shalers distinctive new england voice your honor you werent going to call me that remember forgive me for taking so long to call hardly necessary you did it again walt saved me i hope this isnt becoming a habit im going to have to knight you or something he could only think of clichés and he didnt want to use one while he tried to come up with just the right choice of words she interrupted i attended that conference for all the wrong reasons welcome to politics and i listened to the wrong people most importantly i ignored the few warnings you gave me and i feel like a complete ass for doing so i told you i was going to put my faith in you and then i did the opposite didnt i the good news is maybe i learned something here and if i did its thanks to you and thats all i really called to say thank you he was too tired to play games with her i could say something like just doing my job your honor but it sounds so ridiculous that im trying not to but that is the truth more or less i was just doing what i do i like doing it and i like you your honorlizso im especially glad it worked out that sounds equally stupid doesnt it sorry about that no not at all its touching listen i know a little bit about the differences between your father and youits a small valleybut if you ever have anything like an inkling to take your work to the federal level i could pave the way make the transition both smooth and rewarding for you and if i happen to win this electionlets not lose touch in any case if you win this election and make sun valley your winter white house youre going to give me a whole bunch of problems maybe ill vote for the other guy dont you dare walt thanked her for the call and sat on the edge of his bed reflecting on the past few days he considered taking an hour or two to start his report before he forgot the details but he fell asleep still sitting up slumped down onto the bed with his head nowhere near a pillow his feet touching the floor woke up twice from nightmares the first involving trevalian and his thumb on a white button in the second he was being mauled by a cougar he never found his way under the covers he slept buck naked on the bedspread through the rest of monday and into tuesday and when he woke up he made a phone call and headed for a cup of coffee acknowledgments a special thanks to walt femling and the many outstanding officers of the blaine county sheriffs office walt has allowed me to fictionalize his character and just for the record he and his father jerry and he and his wife jenny enjoy wonderful relationshipsnothing like what is depicted here being sheriff in an idaho county the size of new jersey is no easy task walt has worn that badge many years and the citizens of blaine county owe him a huge debt as do i thanks to the colorful personalities
