stephen r lawhead merlin ten rings there are and nine gold tores on the battlechiefs of old eight princely virtues and seven sins for which a soul is sold six is the sum of earth and sky of all things meek and bold five is the number of ships that sailed from atlantis lost and cold four kings of the wester lands were saved three kingdoms now behold two came together in love and fear in llyonesse stronghold one world there is one god and one birth the druid stars foretold prologue they were going to kill arthur can you imagine they would have killed him too but i put a stop to it the arrogance the stupidity not that other was ever one for a scholars cope i expected more from ygerna though she at least had the canny sense of her people but she was afraid yes frightened of the whispered voices frightened of her suddenly exalted position frightened of uther and desperate to please him she was so young so arthur had to be saved and at no little expense to myself i had heard about their sordid plan in the way i have and made it my affair to confront uther with it early on he denied all of course do you think me mad he shouted he was always shouting the child could be male he said suppressing a sly smile it could well be my heir we are talking about uther is a warrior and there is an honesty about that steel does not lie lucky for him he was a man born to his time he would never have made a decent magistrate let alone governor he is a sorry liar as high king he ruled with a sword in one hand and a bludgeon in the other the sword for the saecsen the bludgeon for the petty kings below him ygerna was just as bad in her own way she said nothing but stood wringing those long white hands of hers and twisting her silken mantle into knots staring at me with those big dark doe eyes that had trapped uther her stomach had just begun to swell she could not have been more than four or five months pregnant still she was pregnant enough to begin having second thoughts about the nasty work ahead i do not think any mother could coldly kill her own child or stand by and see it done i am not so sure about uther he of the strong arm and wandering eye pendragon of britain capable of anything which was the better half of his power where the small kings were concerned he was not one to shrink from any course set before him outside on the black rocks the waves crashed and the white gulls cried ygerna touched a hand to her stomach a brushing touch with fingertips and i knew she would listen to reason ygerna would be an ally so it did not matter what uther said or did not say admitted or did not admit i would have my way my way was it was it ever my way theres a thought ah but i am getting ahead of myself i always am this is to be arthurs story yes but there is more to arthur than his birth to understand him you have to understand the land this land this island of the mighty and you have to understand me for i am the man who made him book one king one many years have come and gone since i awakened in this worldsrealm too many years of darkness and death disease war and evil yes very much evil but life was bright once bright as sunrise on the sea and moonglow on water bright as the fire on the hearth bright as the redgold tore around my grandfather elphins throat bright i tell you and full of every good thing i know that every man recalls something of the same golden sheen in lifes beginning but my memories are not less real or true for that merlin a curious name perhaps no doubt my father would have chosen a different name for his son but my mother can be forgiven for her lapse merlin myrddin among my fathers people suits me yet every man has two names the one he is given and the one he wins for himself emrys is the name i have won among men and it is my own emrys immortal emrys divine emrys wledig king and prophet to his people ambrosius it is to the latin speakers and embries to the people of southern britain and lloegres but myrddin emrys am i to the cymry of the hillbound fastness of the west and because they were my fathers people i feel they are my own as well although my mother long ago taught me the folly of this belief it comforts me much i suppose as it must have comforted my father in his times of doubt and as there is much evil in the world there is much doubt also this is not the least of the adversarys servants and there are so many others well and well get on with it mumbler what treasures from your plundered store will you lay before us i take up my staff and stir the embers and i see again the images of my earliest memory ynys avallach the isle of avallach it is the home of my grandfather king avallach the fisher king and the first home i ever knew it was here in these polished halls of his palace that i took my first faltering steps see here are the whiteblossomed apple groves the salt marshes and mirrorsmooth lake below the looming tor the whitewashed shrine on the nearby hill and there is the fisher king himself dark and heavybrowed like a summer thunderstorm stretched on his pallet of red silk avallach was a fearful figure to a child of three though kind as the heart within him would allow and here is my mother charis tall and slim of such regal bearing as to shame all pretenders and possessing a grace that surpasses mere beauty goldenhaired daughter of lieusun lady of the lake mistress of avallon queen of the faery her names and titles like my own proliferate with time all these and more men call her and they are not wrong i was i knew the sole treasure of my mothers life she was never at any pains to disguise the fact good dafyd the priest gave me to know that i was a beloved child of the living god and his stories about gods son jesu kindled my soul with an early longing for paradise just as hafgan chief druid wise and true faithful servant in his own way taught me the taste of knowledge awakening a hunger i have never satisfied if there was want in the world i knew nothing of it neither did i know fear or danger the days of my childhood were blessed with peace and plenty on ynys avallach at least time and the events of the wider world stood off remote trouble was heard merely as a muted distant murmur soft like the wailing of the bhean sidhe the little dark people the hill folk in the stone circles on the far hilltops distant as the roar of a winter storm cresting mighty yr widdfa in the rockbound north trouble there was make no mistake but in those sunsweet days of my earliest remembrance we lived as the gods of an older time aloof and unconcerned with the squabbles of the lesser beings around us we were the fair folk enchanted presences from the westerlands living on the glass isle those who shared our waterworld of marsh and lake held us in great esteem and greater dread this had its uses it served to keep strangers at a safe distance we were not strong in the ways men respect strength so the web of tales that grew around us served where force of arms did not if that sounds to you in the age of reason and power a weak ineffectual thing i tell you it was not in that age mens lives were hedged about with beliefs old as fear itself and those beliefs were not easily altered nor less easily abandoned ah but look here is avallach standing before me on a dewspangled morning hand pressed to his side in his habitual gesture smiling through his black beard as he would always smile when he saw me saying come little hawk the fish are calling they are unhappy let us take the boat and see if we might liberate a few of them and handinhand we go down the path to the lake to fish avallach working the oar little merlin holding tight to the gunwale with both small hands avallach sings he laughs he tells me sad stories of lost atlantis and i listen as only a child can listen with the whole of my heart the sun climbs high over the lake and i look back towards the reedy shore and there is my mother waiting for me when i look she waves and calls us back and avallach turns the boat and rows to meet her and we return to the palace although she never speaks of it i know that she grows uneasy when i am too long from her sight i did not know the reason for it then i know it now but life to a child of three is a heady daze of pleasures spinning through a universe too impossibly rich to comprehend or experience except in frenzied snatches not that it is ever comprehended or experienced in any other way an unimaginable wealth of wonders displayed for instant plunder tiny vessel though i was i dipped full and deep in the dizzy flood of sensation to collapse at the end of each day drunk with life and exhausted in each small limb if ynys avallach was all my world i was given the freedom of it there was no nook too small no corner too forgotten but that i knew it and made it my own stables kitchens audience hall bed chambers gallery portico or gardens i wandered where i would and if i had been king i could not have commanded more authority for every childish whim was honoured with unthinking deference by those around me thus i came to know early the substance and use of power great light you know i have never sought it for myself power was offered me and i took it where is the wrong in that in those days however power was seen differently right and wrong were what men conceived in their own minds and hearts sometimes in truth more often in error there were no judges in the land no standard men could point to and say you see this is right justice was that which issued from the steel in a kings hand you would do well to remember this but these ideas of justice and right came later much later there was living to be done first a foundation to be erected on which to build the man the island of the mighty in those days lay in a welter of confusion which is common enough now but was seldom seen then kings and princes vied for position and power did i say kings there were more kings than sheep more princes than crows on a battlefield more ambitious little men than salmon in season and each prince and princeling chief and king each jumpedup official with a roman title seeking to snatch what he could from the slavering jaws of onrushing night to squirrel it away thinking that when the darkness finally came he could sit in his den and gloat and preen and gorge himself on his good fortune how many of those choked on it instead as i say they were tunes of confusion and the spirit may become as confused as the mind and heart the central fact of my early life was the deep love and peace that enfolded me i knew even then that this was extraordinary but children accept the extraordinary with the same facile assent as the dreary commonplace was i conscious of the things that set me apart from other men did i know i was different an incident from those fargone days stands out in my mind once when at my daily lessons with blaise my tutor and friend a question occurred to me blaise i asked why is hafgan so old we were sitting in the apple grove below the tor watching the clouds race westward i could not have been more than five summers old myself i think you think him old he must be very old to know so much oh yes hafgan has lived long and seen much he is very wise i want to be as wise one day why he asked cocking his head to one side to know things i answered to know about everything and once you knew about everything what would you do i would be a king and tell everyone king yes it was in my mind even then that i would be a king i do not think anyone had ever mentioned it to me before that tune but already i sensed the shape my early life would take i can still hear blaises reply as clearly as if he were speaking to me now it is a great thing to be a king hawk a very great thing indeed but there is authority of a kind even kings must bend to discover this and whether you wear a tore of gold or beggars rags your name will burn for ever in mens minds of course i understood nothing of what he told me then but i remembered so it was that the subject of age was still quite fresh in my mind when the very next day grandfather elphin arrived on one of his frequent visits the travellers were still climbing down from their saddles and calling their greetings as i marched up to the chief druid who as always had accompanied lord elphin i tugged on his robe and demanded tell me how old you are hafgan how old do you think me myrddin bach i can see his smokegrey eyes twinkling with joy although he rarely smiled old as the oak on shrine hill i declared importantly he laughed then and others stopped talking to look at us he took me by the hand and we walked a little apart no he explained i am not as old as that but in the measure of men i am old still what is that to you who will live to be as old as any oak in the island of the mighty if not far older he gripped my hand tightly to you is given much he said seriously and as dafyd tells me from his book much will be required will i really be old as any oak hafgan lifted his shoulders and shook his head who can say little one it is much to hafgans credit that although he knew who i was he never burdened me with that knowledge or the expectations that surely went with it no doubt he had had ample experience with one like me before i imagine my father had taught him much about nurturing a prodigy oh hafgan if you could see me now after that visit although i do not recall it as special in any way i began to travel further from home at least i began to visit the summerlands regularly and my view of the world enlarged accordingly we called them the summerlands because that is what my father taliesin had called the land avallach had given his people grandfather elphin and grandmother rhonwyn were always happy to see me and devoted themselves to spoiling me on my visits undoing months of my mothers hard work charis never complained never hinted at what she thought of their indulgence but let them have their way with me this eventually included weapons lessons undertaken by lord elphins battlechief a crag of a man named cuall who strove with me and some of the younger boys although he had a warband to look after as well cuall it was who made my first sword out of ashwood my first spear also the sword was thin and light and no longer than my arm but to me it was a blade invincible with that wooden weapon he taught me thrust and counterthrust and the quick backhanded chop and with the spear to throw accurately with either hand off either foot he taught me how to sit a horse and guide it with my knees and how when need arose to use the hapless beast as a shield in my sixth year i spent all summer with grandfather elphin hafgan and cuall all but fighting over me between them i saw little of anyone else all summer my mother came and stayed for a few days and at first i was disappointed to see her thinking that she would take me home again but she just wanted to see how i fared once satisfied that it was right and necessary as both hafgan and cuall insisted she returned to ynys avallach and i stayed at caer cam this began a pattern that was to continue for several years winter at ynys avallach with dafyd and blaise and summer at caer cam with elphin and cuall lord elphins caer was a world apart from avallachs palace one bespoke the cool heights of intellectual refinement and otherworldly grace the other the earthy reality of stone and sweat and steel brains and blood cuall aptly put it one day lord brains and blood boy he repeated thats what you have and what every warrior needs will i be a warrior if i can do anything about it you will right enough he said resting his thick forearms on the pommel of his long sword och but you have lleus own way about you quick as water and light of foot as a cat already you tax my craft all you want is muscle on those bones of yours lad and from the look of you that will come in time i was pleased with his pronouncement and knew he was right i was much quicker than the other boys i could make good account of myself with boys twice my age and fend off any two my own size the ease with which my body accommodated whatever i asked of it seemed to some uncanny but to me only natural that everyone could not meld and move mind and body so skilfully was something new to me and though it shames me to admit it i did wear my prowess with insufferable conceit humility if it comes at all almost always comes too late so i learned two things early i would live long and i would be a warrior king the third thing blaises mantle of authority would be discovered by me or it would not i saw no reason to strive after it so thought no more about it but i badly wanted to be a warrior had i possessed even the tiniest suspicion of how heavily this aspiration weighed on my mother i might have reined in my enthusiasm somewhat at least in her presence i was blind and silly with it though and talked almost of nothing else no one laboured harder or enjoyed his labours more than i first awake among the boys in the boys house and out on the yard before sunrise for sword practice or riding or throwing or shieldwork or wrestling i embraced it all with the ardour of a zealot and the summer passed in a whitehot blaze of youthful passion i prayed that it would last for ever nevertheless the summer ended and i returned to ynys avallach with blaise and an escort of warriors i remember riding through bright autumn days passing fields ripening to harvest and small prosperous settlements where we were greeted warmly and fed my mother was overjoyed to see me home at last but i sensed a sadness in her too and i noticed that her eyes followed my every move and lingered on my face had i changed somehow in those few months at caer cam you are growing so fast my little hawk she told me soon you will fly this nest i will never leave here where would i go i asked genuinely puzzled the thought of leaving had never occurred to me charis shrugged lightly oh you will find a place somewhere and make it your own you must you see if you are to be the lord of summer so that was on her mind is it not a real place mother she smiled a little sadly and shook her head no that is not yet it is up to you my soul to create the kingdom of summer i thought the summerlands no she shook her head again but the sadness had passed and i saw the light of the vision come up in her eyes the summerlands are not the kingdom though your father may have intended them to be the kingdom of summer is wherever the summer lord resides it only waits for you to claim it hawk we talked about the kingdom of summer then but our talk was different now no longer was the kingdom a story such as a mother might tell a child it had changed from that time i began to think of it as a realm that did exist in some way and only waited to be called into being and for the first time i understood that my destiny like my fathers was woven thread and strand into his vision of that golden land that autumn i resumed my studies with dafyd the priest at the shrine i read from his holy texts badly patched and faded as they were and we discussed what i read at the same time i continued my lessons with blaise who instructed me in the druid arts i could not imagine giving up either endeavour and in the following years gave myself mind and soul to my study as i gave body and heart to my weapons each summer at caer cam i confess it was not easy i often felt pulled in all directions despite my various tutors attempts to ensure that i should not never did a boy have more caring teachers still it is inevitable i suppose when someone desires so much so badly my teachers were aware of my discomfort and felt it themselves you need not drive yourself so hard myrddin blaise told me one drizzly miserable winter evening as i sat struggling with a long recitation entitled the battle of the trees there are other things than being a bard you know look around you not everyone is my father taliesin was a bard hafgan says he was the greatest bard who ever lived so he believes you do not believe it he laughed who could disagree with the chief druid you have not answered the question blaise very well he paused and reflected long before answering yes your father was the greatest bard among us and more he was my brother and friend but he held up a cautionary finger taliesin was again a long pause and a slight lifting of the shoulders as he stepped away from saying what was in his mind but it is not everyone who can be what he was or do the things that he did i will be a bard i will work harder blaise i promise he shook his head and sighed it is not a question of working harder hawk what do you want me to do i whined just tell me his dark eyes were soft with sympathy he was trying to help me in the best way he knew your gifts are different merlin you cannot be your father if they did not act in me at that moment his words would come back to me many times i will be a bard blaise i am merlin and i am immortal a quirk of birth a gift from my mother the legacy of my father i do not know how it is but i know that it is true neither do i know the source of the words that fill my head and fall from my lips like firedrops onto the tinder of mens hearts the words the images what is what was and will be i have but to look a bowl of black oak water the glowing embers of a fire smoke clouds the faces of men themselves i have but to look and the mists grow thin and i peer a little way along the scattered paths of time was there ever a time such as this never and that is both the glory and the terror of it if men knew what it was that loomed before them within reach of even the lowest they would quail they would faint they would cover their heads and stop their mouths with their cloaks for screaming it is their blessing and their curse that they do i not know but i know i merlin have always known two the boy has the eyes of a preying bird maximus said resting his hand on my head and gazing down into my face he should know his own eyes had something of the predator as well i do not believe i have ever seen eyes of such colour in a man before like yellow gold his smile was dagger sharp tell me merlinus what do you see with those golden eyes of yours an odd question to ask a child of seven but an image formed itself in my mind a sword not the short broad gladius of the legionary but the long tapering length of singing lightning of the celt the hilt was handsome bronze wrapped in braided silver with a great amethyst of imperial purple in the pommel the jewel was engraved with the eagle of the legion fierce and proud catching sunlight in its dark heart and smouldering with a deep and steady fire i see a sword i said the hilt is silver and bears a purple gem carved like an eagle it is an emperors sword both maximus and lord elphin my fathers father who stood beside me looked on me with wonder as though i had spoken a prophecy great and terrible in its mystery i merely told them what i saw magnus maximus commander of the legions of britain gazed thoughtfully at me what else do you see lad i closed my eyes i see a ring of kings they are standing like stones in a stone circle a woman kneels in their midst and she holds the sword of britain in her hands she is speaking but no one hears her no one listens i see the blade rusting and forgotten although romans were always keen for an omen i do not think he expected such an answer from me he stared for a moment i felt his fingers go slack in my hair and then he turned away abruptly king elphin you look fit as ever this soft land has not softened you i see he and my grandfather walked off arms linked two old friends met and recognized as equals we were there at caer cam the morning he arrived i was training the pony elphin had given me desperate to break the wily creature to the halter so that i could ride it home in a few days time the little blackandwhite animal seemed more goat than horse and what had begun as a simple trial with a braided rope harness soon grew to an allout war of wills with mine suffering the worst of it the sun was lowering and the evening mist rising in the valley wood pigeons were winging to their nests and swallows swooped and dived through the still lightfilled air then i heard it a sound to make me stop rock still and listen a rhythmic drumming in the earth a deep resonant rumble rolling over the land cuall my grandfathers battlechief was watching me and became concerned what is it myrddin bach what is wrong myrddin bach he called me little hawk i did not answer but turned my face towards the east and dropping the braided length of leather ran to the ramparts calling as i ran hurry hurry he is coming if i had been asked who was coming i could not have made an answer but the instant i peered between the sharpened stakes i knew that someone very important would soon arrive for in the distance as we looked down along the valley we could see the long snaking double line of a column of men moving northwest the rumble i had heard was the booming cadence of their marching drums and the steady plod of their feet on the old hard track i looked and saw the failing sunlight bright on their shields and on the eagle standards going before them dust trailed into the dusky sky at the rear of the column where the supply wagons came trundling on there must have been a thousand men or more moving in those two long lines cuall took one look and sent one of the warband racing for lord elphin it is macsen confirmed elphin when he arrived thought as much replied cuall cryptically it has been a long time said my grandfather we must make ready to welcome him you think he will turn aside of course it will soon bedark and he will need a place to sleep i will send an escort to bring him i will see to it lord offered cuall and he strode away across the caer grandfather and i returned to the survey of the valley road is he a king i asked though i knew he must be for i had never known anyone to travel with such an enormous warband a king no myrddin bach he is dux bntanniarum and answers only to imperator gratian himself i searched my scant latin dux duke like a battlechief elphin explained but far greater he commands all roman forces in the island of the mighty some say he will be imperator himself one day although from what i have seen of emperors a dux with a cohort at his back wields more power where it counts not long after cuall and ten of elphins warband rode out a party of about thirty men returned the strangers were strange indeed to my eyes big thicklimbed men in hardened leather or metal breastplates carrying short bulky swords and ugly irontipped javelins their legs wrapped in red wool which was tied to midthigh by the straps of their heavy hobnailed sandals the riders pounded up the twisting path to the gates of the caer and i ran round the ramparts to meet them the timber gates swung open and the ironshod horses galloped into the caer between two standard bearers rode maximus his handsome red cloak stained and dusty his sundarkened face brown as walnut a short fringe of a black beard on his chin he reined the horse to a halt and dismounted as elphin came to greet him they embraced like friends long absent from one another and i realized that my grandfather was a man of some renown seeing him next to the powerful stranger my heart soared he was no longer my grandfather but a king in his own right as other horsemen entered the caer elphin turned to me and beckoned me to him i stood at stiff attention while the duke of britain inspected me closely his sharp black eyes probing as spearpoints hail merlinus he said in a voice husky with fatigue and road dust i greet you in the name of our mother rome then maximus took my hand in his and when he withdrew it i saw a gold victory coin shining there that was my first introduction to magnus maximus dux britanniarum and it was before him then and there that i spoke my first prophecy there was feasting that night after all it is not every day that the duke of britain visits the drinking horns circled the hall and i was dizzy trying to keep them filled through a timber hall dark with the smoke of roasting meat and loud with the chatter of warriors and soldiers regaling one another with lies of their exploits on the twin fields of bed and battle i wandered a jar of mead in my hands to refill the empty horns cups and bowls i thought myself most fortunate to be included in a warriors feast even if only as a serving boy later when the torches and tallow lamps burned low hafgan chief bard to my grandfather brought out his harp and told the tale of the three disastrous plagues this brought forth great gales of laughter and i laughed with the rest happy to be included with the men on this auspicious night and not sent down to the boys house with the others what a night rich and raucous and full and i understood that to be a king with a great hall filled with fearless companions was the finest thing a man could achieve and i vowed that one day this fine thing would be mine i did not speak to maximus again while he stayed with lord elphin though he and my grandfather talked at length the next day before the duke departed and returned to his troops waiting in the valley i say i did not speak to him but when his horse was brought to him and he swung up into the saddle maximus saw me and raised his hand slowly touching the back of his hand to his forehead it is a sign of honour and respect an unusual gesture with which to favour a child no one else saw it nor were they meant to he said farewell to my grandfather they clasped one anothers arms in the way of kinsmen and he rode away with his commanders from on top of the earthen bank outside the palisade i watched the column form up and move on through the cam valley a short time later following the eagle standard i never saw maximus again and it was to be many many years before i finally beheld the sword and realized that it had been his sword i had seen that day that is why maximus had looked at me the way he did and that is why he saluted me this is where it begins first there is a sword the sword of britain and the sword is britain three in the spring of my eleventh year i travelled with blaise and hafgan to gwynedd and yr widdfa the region of snows in the mountainous northwest it was a long journey and difficult but necessary for hafgan was going home to die he told no one about this as he found the prospect of leaving his people unspeakably sad it was the leaving not the dying he minded hafgan had long ago made his peace with gfod and knew death to be the narrow door to another higher life and though saying farewell to his kinsmen grieved him deeply yet he yearned to see again the land of his youth before he died so the journey became necessary elphin insisted on sending an escort if he had not done so avallach surely would have given his own way hafgan would have forgone this honour but he relented since it was not for him that the warriors rode with us there were nine in the escort making a total of twelve in all as we made ready to set out that day not long after beltane the fire festival marking the beginning of spring hafgan and the escort had come to ynys avallach where blaise and i waited eager to be off on the morning of our leaving i rose early and pulled on my tunic and trousers and ran down to the courtyard to find my mother dressed in riding garb complete with short cloak and tall riding boots her hair braided and bound in the white leather thong of the bull ring she held the reins of a mistgrey stallion and my first thought was that the horse must be for me hafgan stood nearby and they were talking together quietly waiting for the others to appear i greeted them and mentioned that i had preferred my blackandwhite pony instead instead whatever can you mean charis asked instead of the stallion of course i pointed out that i was fond of the pony and planned on riding it my mother laughed and said you are not the only person ever to master throwing a leg over the back of a horse it was only then that i took in her appearance you would go too it is time i saw the place where your father grew up she explained and besides hafgan has asked me and i can think of nothing i would enjoy more we have been talking just now of stopping in dyfed i would like to see maelwys and pendaran again and i could show you where you were born would you like that whether i liked it or not she meant to go and did the imagined inconvenience to my notion of playing the warrior never materialized my mother was more than a match for the rigours of the journey we did not dawdle or slacken our pace because of her and as the familiar landscape sparked her memory with a thousand remembrances of my father she recalled in vivid detail those first days of their life together i listened to her and forgot all about pretending to be a fierce battlechief we crossed shining mor hafren and came to caer legionis fort of the legions the enormous fortress like so many others in the land long abandoned and falling into ruin stood derelict and empty shunned by the nearby town which still boasted a magistrate i had never seen a roman city before and could find nothing of advantage in its straight streets and houses crowded too close to one another aside from the impressive spectacle of a forum and an arena what i could see of the town inspired little hope for the improvement of life a city is an unnatural place the country beyond was fair to look upon smooth lofty hills and winding glens with stoneedged streams and wide flats of grassland ideal for grazing herds of cattle and sheep and the hardy surefooted little horses they bred and sold in horse markets as far away as londinium and eboracum at maridunum where my parents had fled after their marriage and where i was born our reception was warm and enthusiastic king pendaran considered himself something of a grandfather to both my mother and myself and was overjoyed to see us he clasped me heartily by both arms and said i held you jad when you were no bigger than a cabbage his fringe of white hair feathered in the wind and he appeared in imminent danger of blowing away was this the fearsome red sword i had heard about maelwys his oldest son ruled in dyfed however and with pendarans clucking approval declared a feast upon our arrival and the lords under him with their retinues crowded his hall that night the lords of the demetae and silures were long established in the land and powerful they had fiercely protected their independence despite three hundred years of roman meddling in their affairs a feat ironically accomplished by forming early and advantageous alliances with the ruling houses of rome itself marrying well and wisely and using their power to keep the emperor and his minions at a safe distance like a rock in the sea they had allowed the empire to wash over them but now that the tide was receding the rock stood unchanged wealthy and proud of their wealth they lacked any hint of the vanity that so often derives from riches simple men adhering to the ways of their people and resisting change they had kept alive the true celtic spirit of their fathers a few might live in sprawling villas of roman design or wear the title of magistrate one or another might have comfortably worn the purple but the eyes that looked upon me in the hall that night saw the world little changed since the day of bran the blessed whom they claimed had settled his tribe in these very hills we sat at the high table my mother and i surrounded by lords and chieftains and i began to understand what my people had lost in the great conspiracy when the barbarians overran the wall and attacked settlements as far south as eboracum and along both coasts as well elphin and the cymry prospered in the summerlands it is true but were a people cut off from their past a kind of living death to the celt as to that what had my mothers race lost when atlantis was destroyed after a long and lively meal blaise sang and received a gold armband from maelwys for his song then a cry went up for hafgan to sing he accepted the harp with diffidence and took his place in the hollow square formed by the tables strumming the harpstrings idly his gaze fell on me and he stopped strumming and beckoned me i rose and went to him and he placed the harp in my hands and i thought he meant for me to accompany him what will you sing chief bard i asked anything you like little brother whatever you choose will be welcomed in this place still i thought he meant me to play for him i fingered a chord and thought the birds of rhiannon lieu and levelys what about the dream of arianrhod i asked he nodded and raised his hand stepping away to leave me in the centre of the square shocked and confused i stared after him he merely inclined his head and returned to his place at maelwys left hand what he had done was unprecedented the archdruid chief bard of the island of the mighty had relinquished his harp to me an untried boy i had no time to contemplate the implications of his deed all eyes were on me the hall hushed i swallowed hard and marshalled my fleeing thoughts i could not remember a word of the tale and the pearlinlaid harp might just as well have been an oxhide shield in my fumbling hands i closed my eyes took a deep breath forced my fingers to move over the impossiblywooden strings and opened my mouth fully expecting to disgrace myself and hafgan before the assembled lords when the words failed to come to my great relief and surprise the words of the song came back to me in the same instant my tongue began to move i sang shakily at first but with growing confidence as i saw the song reflected on the faces of my listeners the tale is a long one i would have chosen differently had i known i would be the one to sing it but when i finished the gathering seemed to sit an equally long time in silence i could hear the soft flaring of the torches and the crackle of flames in the great firepit and i was aware of all those dark demetae and siluri eyes on me i turned to my mother and saw a strange rapt look on her face her eyes glistening in the light tears slowly the hall came back to life as if from a sleep of enchantment i did not dare sing again and no one asked me maelwys got to his feet and approached me in full hearing of all present he said no bard has ever sung so well and truly in my hearing save one only once that bard came to this house and after hearing him sing i offered him my tore of gold he did not take it but gave me something instead the name i wear today he smiled remembering that bard was your father taliesin he raised his hands to his neck and removed his tore now i offer the tore to you take it if you will for your song and for the memory of the one whose place you have taken this night i did not know what to think as my father did not accept your generous gift it is not right that i should do so then tell me what you will accept and i will give you that the lords of dyfed watched me with interest i looked to my mother for help thinking to see some expression or gesture to tell me what to do but she only gazed at me with the same wonder as the others your kindness i began to my people is worth more to me than lands or gold as it is i remain in your debt lord maelwys he smiled with great satisfaction embraced me and returned to his place at the board i gave the harp to hafgan then and walked quickly from the hall full to bursting with thoughts and emotions and straining to contain them and make sense of them hafgan found me a little while later as i stood in the darkened courtyard shivering for the night was cold and i had forgotten my cloak he gathered me under his robe and we stood together for a long time without speaking what does it mean hafgan i said at last tell me if you can i thought he would not answer without turning his face from his contemplation of the starstrewn sky hafgan said once when i was a young man i stood in a circle of stones and saw a great and terrible sign in the heavens a fall of stars like a mighty fire poured out from on high those stars were lighting your way to us myrddin emrys he smiled at my reaction emrys is the divine epithet do not wonder that i call you emrys for from now on men will begin to recognize you you have done this hafgan i replied my voice tight with accusation for because of his words i felt the happiness of my childhood slipping away from me and tasted ashes in my mouth no he said gently i have done only what has been required of me only what has been given me to do i shivered but not with cold now i understand none of this i said miserably perhaps not but soon you will it is enough for now that you accept what i tell you what will happen hafgan do you know only in part but do not worry all will become clear to you in time wisdom will be given when wisdom is required courage when courage is required all things are given in their season he lapsed into silence again and i studied the heavens with him hoping to see something that would answer the storm in my soul i saw only the coldorbed stars swinging through their distant courses and i heard the night wind singing around the tiled eaves of the villa and felt the emptiness of one cut off and alone then we went inside and i slept in the bed where was born nothing more was said about what had taken place in maelwys hall at least not in my presence i have no doubi others talked of it if they talked of nothing else it was a mercy to me not to have to answer for it we left maridunum three days later maelwys would have accompanied us but affairs of court prevented him he like some others had once again adopted the custom of the kings of old ringing his lands with hillforts and moving through his realm with his retinue holding court in one hillfort after another in circuit he bade us farewell and would hear nothing from us but our promise to visit maridunum on our return thus we set out once more riding north following the old roman track through the rising heathered hills we saw eagles and red deer wild pigs and foxes in abundance a few wolves in the high places and once a black bear several of the warband had brought hunting hounds and these were given the chase so that we did not lack for fresh meat at night the days were getting warmer but though the sun shone bright and there was little rain the high country remained cool a crackling fire kept away the night chill and a day in the saddle assured a sound sleep how can i describe coming into caer dyvi it was not my home certainly i had never set eyes on those rugged hills and treelined valleys but the sense of homecoming was so strong in me that i sang for joy and rode fit to break my neck up the seacliff track to the ruined settlement we approached from the south on the sea side blaise had described the place to me in detail on the way and i had heard my grandfather talk about it so often that i felt i knew the place as well as anyone born there that was part of it the other part may have been hafgans pleasure at seeing his home though for him as for blaise this was tempered with sadness i could feel nothing sorrowful about the place high on the promontory overlooking the estuary and the sea to the west and surrounded by dense woods to the east and high rocky hills to the north it seemed too peaceful a haven like ynys avallach in its own way to hold any sorrow despite the unhappy events that had taken place there indeed the jawless skull i saw halfburied in the long grass testified to the grim desperation of caer dyvis final hours our warrior escort was subdued respecting the spirits of the fallen and after a brief inspection returned to the horses the caer was uninhabited of course but the ribbed remains of elphins great hall and sections of the timber palisade above the ditch were still standing along with the walls and foundations of some of the stone granaries i was surprised at how small it seemed i suppose i was used to caer cam and ynys avallach but that it would have been a secure and comfortable settlement i had no doubt charis strolled among the grassgrown ruins musing deeply on her private thoughts i did not have the heart to intrude even to ask what she was thinking i knew that it had to do with my father no doubt she was remembering something he had told her of his youth there picturing him in it feeling his presence hafgan too wished to be alone which was plain enough to see so i tramped around after blaise inspecting this place and that listening as he rediscovered his former home he told me stories i had never heard before little things concerning incidents that had happened at one place or another in the caer why did no one ever return i asked the country appeared perfectly peaceful and secure blaise sighed and shook his head ah there was not a man among us who did not yearn to come back no one more than lord elphin then why not that is not easy to explain he paused you have to understand that this whole region was overrun by the enemy not caer dyvi alone the wall the garrisons at caer seiont luguvalium eboracum everything never did men fight better or with more courage but there were too many it was death to stay the land was not secure again for nearly two years and by the time it was safe to return well we had begun life anew in the south if fleeing the lands of our fathers was difficult and it was returning would be nigh impossible he gazed around the caer fondly no let the ashes rest someone will raise these walls one day but not us we were silent a few moments and blaise sighed again then turned to me would you like to see where hafgan taught your father he asked and started off before i could answer we walked from the caer into the wood along an old track now overgrown with burdock and nettle and emerged in a small clearing which had been taliesins wooded bower there was an oak stump in the centre of the clearing hafgan would sit here with his staff across his lap blaise said sitting down on the stump and placing his own oak staff across his lap taliesin would sit at his feet he offered me the place at his feet and i sat down before him blaise nodded slowly with a frown of remembrance and mouth pulled down many and many a time i came to find them so ah he sighed that seems so long ago now was this where my father had his first vision it was and i well remember the day cormach was chief druid then and he had come to caer dyvi he knew himself to be dying and told us so i admit i was taken aback by his bald pronouncement but cormach was a blunt man he said he was dying and wanted to see the boy taliesin one last time before he joined the ancient ones blaise smiled quickly and ran his hand through his long dark hair he sent me off to boil cabbage for his supper there was a long pause and i sat with my arms around my knees listening to the same woodland sounds my father would have heard the chirruping of woodfinches thrushes jays the little furtive rustlings in the winterdry underbrush and light shifting of the leaves the tick and creak of swaying branches i was tending the pot when they returned blaise said when he continued taliesin was unusually quiet and his movements erratic his speech was odd as well as if he were creating the sound of the words anew as he spoke them i remember feeling the same way the first time i tasted the seeds of wisdom but in this as in all else taliesin excelled hafgan told me that he feared taliesin dead so still did the boy lie when he found him cormach blamed himself for pressing the youngster too hard he broke off abruptly and regarded me strangely too hard to do what i asked already knowing the answer he would make to walk the paths of the otherworld to see the future you mean again that fierce appraisal and the slow nod of admission they thought he might see something they could not see he was looking for me blaise did not look away this time he was myrddin bach we all were the silence of the wood crept in once more and we sat watching one another blaise sought guidance for what he was about to do and i was content not to press him but to trust his judgement how long we sat there i do not know but after a time he put his hand to the pouch at his belt and brought out three firebrowned hazelnuts here they are myrddin if you want them i regarded them and would have reached for them but something restrained me a cautious thought wait the time for visions is not yet thank you blaise i told him i know you would not have offered them if you thought i was not ready but this is not my way he nodded and put the hazelnuts back in his pouch never from curiosity he said no doubt you have chosen wisely hawk i commend you he rose shall we go back to the caer now we slept that night in the ruined caer and just before sunrise it rained a soft pattering of falling drops tears from a low sorrowladen sky we saddled our horses and rode inland along the dyvi river towards the druid grove at garth greggyn where we meant to leave hafgan for a few days to meet with his brother druids along the way we passed gwyddnos salmon weir or what was left of it for the nets were long gone several of the poles remained however blackened nubs in the water we paused to see the place where all our lives had in a sense begun no one spoke it was almost as if we stood before a holy shrine for here was the infant taliesin fished from this very weir in a sealskin bag the weir pool made a good ford and as we crossed the river i could not help thinking of that nowdistant morning when an unsuspecting elphin desperate for salmon and a change of fortune pulled a baby from the water instead we crossed the dyvi and continued on into the rough hills and into an older wilder land four at garth greggyn we camped for two days and on the third day the dniids came i halfexpected the gathering to simply appear like otherworld sojourners in elder times even though i knew better the warband waited in the glen below the sacred grove and were happy to do so since like most people they regarded druids in number as a menace to be avoided that is a curious thing having a bard attached to his court was high prestige for a lord and certainly every king who could find and keep one enjoyed enormous benefit also the harpers art was respected above all others including the warriors and smiths sorry indeed was the celebration with no druid to sing and winters were interminable intolerable without a bard to tell the old tales nevertheless let three druids gather in a grove and men began to whisper behind their hands and make the sign against evil as if the same bard that gave wings to thenjoy in celebration eased the harsh winters passing and gave authority to their kingmaking somehow became a being to be feared when he joined with his brothers but as i have said mens hearts remember long after their minds have forgotten and i do not wonder that mens hearts still quake to see the brotherhood gathered in the grove remembering as they do an older time when the golden scythe claimed a life in blood sacrifice to cernunnos forest lord or the mother goddess fear remembers long i tell you if not always wisely after breaking fast on the third day hafgan rose and stood looking at the hilltop grove then turned to charis saying lady will you come with me now i stared another time blaise might have questioned the chief druids invitation but this seemed to be a time for unprecedented events he held his peace and the four of us began the long climb up the slope to the sacred grove the grove was a dense stand of ancient oak with a scattering of walnut ash and holly the oak and walnut were by far the oldest trees they had been sturdy deeprooted youngsters before the romans came planted some said by mathonwy first bard in the island of the mighty deepshadowed and dark with an air of imponderable mystery emanating from the thickcorded trunks and twisting limbs and even the soil itself the sacred druid grove seemed a world unto itself in the centre of the grove stood a small stone circle the moment i set foot in the ring of stones i could feel ancient power flowing like an invisible river around the hilltop which was an eddy in the everstreaming current the feeling of being surrounded by swirling forces of being picked up and carried off on the relentless waves of this unseen river nearly took my breath i laboured to walk upright against it my flesh tingling with every step the others did not feel it in the same way or if they did gave no indication and said nothing about it this of course was why the hill was chosen in the first place but still i wondered that hafgan and blaise did not appear to notice the power flowing around and over them hafgan took his place on the seat in the centre of the circle nothing more than a slab of stone supported by two other smaller slabs there to wait until the others arrived blaise inscribed a series of marks on the ground and then stuck a suck upright over them the sunshadow had not passed another mark on the ground before the first druids appeared they greeted hafgan and blaise and regarded my mother and me politely but coolly while exchanging news with the two druids by midday all had arrived in the grove and hafgan cracking his rowan staff three times against the centre stone declared the gathering assembled the bards thirty in all joined him in the ring and younger filidh and ovates began making their way round the ring with washing bowls and cups of heather water and pouches of hazelnuts i was included in the circle charis stood looking on a short distance away outside the ring her face grave and intense and it came into my mind that perhaps she knew what was about to take place had hafgan told her was that why she had been asked to accompany us my brothers said hafgan with staff upraised i greet you in the name of the great light whose corning was foretold of old within this sacred ring some of the brotherhood shifted uneasily at these words their movement did not go unnoticed for hafgan lowered his staff and asked you resent my greeting why no one spoke tell me for i would know said the chief druid his words were a challenge quiet gentle but spoken with an authority that could not be ignored hen dallpen the man singled out made a slight movement with his hands as if to show himself blameless it seemed to me a strange thing to invoke a foreign god in our most sacred place he looked to the others near him for support perhaps there are others among us who think the same way if so said hafgan flatly let them speak now several others voiced agreement with hen dallpen and more nodded silently but every man there felt the strain of hafgans challenge what was he doing how long have we waited for this day brothers how long his grey eyes swept the faces of those gathered around him too long it appears for you have forgotten why we come here at all why no brother we have not forgotten we know why we assemble here but why do you castigate us so unfairly it was hen dallpen speaking out more boldly now how so unfairly is it not the chief druids right to instruct those below him instruct us then wise brother we would hear you the voice was that of a druid standing beside blaise hafgan raised his staff and turned his face heavenward making a low moaning noise in his throat the strange sound drifted off into the silence of the grove and hafgan looked at those around him from ancient days we have sought knowledge so that we might learn the truth of all things is this not so it is so intoned the assembled druids how should we be slow to grasp the truth when it is proclaimed before us now we know many truths master which truth is proclaimed this day asked hen dallpen the final truth hen dallpen replied hafgan gently and it is this the great light of the world has ascended his high throne and calls all men to worship in spirit and deed this great light you speak of wise brother do we know him we do it is jesu him the romans call christus there were murmurs hafgans eyes swept the assembly many looked away uncomfortably why does his name frighten you frighten us asked hen dallpen surely you are mistaken wise leader we are not afraid of this foreign mangod but neither do we see good reason to worship him here or worship him at all declared another especially since the priests of this christus declaim against us mocking us before our own people belittling our craft and authority even as they seek to extinguish the learned brotherhood they do not understand drem offered blaise gently they are ignorant but that does not change the truth it is as hafgan says the great light has come and is being proclaimed among us is that why he is here the one called drem turned angrily to me i saw other dark looks and understood the reason for the coolness of our reception it is his right to be here said hafgan he is the son of the greatest bard to draw breath taliesin turned against us he left the brotherhood to follow this jesu and now it seems you would have the rest of us do the same are we to abandon old ways to chase after a foreign god simply because taliesin did it not because taliesin did it brother replied blaise restraining his anger but because it is right he who was foremost among us knew the truth of a thing when he saw it that alone argues for the tightness of it well said blaise hafgan motioned me to join him in the centre of the ring blaise nodded encouragement and i stepped forward hesitantly hafgan placed a hand on my shoulder and raised his staff in the air before you stands the one whose coming we have long awaited the champion who will lead the war host against the darkness i hafgan archdruid of the cor of garth greggyn declare it silence greeted this pronouncement even i questioned the wisdom of such a proclamation for clearly many of the learned brotherhood were unhappily nursing wounds they had received at the hands of the christian priests and others were openly sceptical but the words were out and could not be taken back i stood there quaking inside not from anxiety only but from the implications of the archdruids words the champion leading the war host darkness he is but a boy scoffed hen dallpen would you have him sprung fullgrown into life like manawyddan demanded the druid beside blaise there were a few allies among the learned brotherhood at least how do we know he is taliesins son who can attest to his birth wondered one of the sceptics were you there indeg were you blaise and you wise leader were you there well i was the voice took everyone by surprise for by this time they had forgotten that my mother stood looking on i was there she said again stepping forward yes this was why she had come not only to see her son proclaimed among the learned brotherhood but to help if things went awry which as hafgan had anticipated they had from now on hafgan had said men will begin to recognize you that sly fox meant to give it a fair beginning i bore him and watched him bora my mother stepped into the sacred ring and came to stand beside me so there i was hafgan on one side my mother on the other surrounded by unhappy druids feeling the strange power of the grove flowing around me it is not surprising then that i should be taken out of myself to perform an act i was scarcely aware of and remember now only in amazement the druids stood looking on unconvinced a child bom without breath or life taliesin sang life into his still body charis was saying i felt the air shudder around me pulsing with the power of the grove the stones in the sacred circle appeared to change from grey to blue as around us thickened a wall of shimmering glass spun from the intense charged air the enmity of the druids towards me together with my presence had awakened the sleeping force of the omphalos the centre of power on which the hill had been constructed i saw otherworld beings moving among the circled stones one of them tall and fair his face and clothing shining with a gleaming radiance that danced like sunbeams on water came towards me and pointed to the druid seat where hafgan had been sitting i had never seen an ancient one before but part of me expected to see him and so i was not surprised no one else noticed of course nor did i give any indication of the wonder taking place around us the being pointed to the stone slab which rested at the vortex of the hills power i turned to see the stone blue now like the rest of them and shining faintly i stepped up onto the stone and heard the druids gasp behind me for only the chief druid may touch the stone and never with his feet but i stood on the stone and it rose up so highly charged had the vortex become that it lifted the stone with me on it straight into the air from this lofty vantage i began to speak rather the ancient one spoke through me if that is how it was for the words were not my own servants of the truth stop your whining and listen to me indeed you are fortunate among men for today you witness the fulfilment many have lived and died longing to see why do you wonder that the wisest among you should greet you in the name of jesu who called himself the way and the truth how is it that you who seek truth in all ways should be blind to it now do you believe because you see a floating stone i saw that they did not believe though many were awed and amazed perhaps you will believe if all the stones dance at that moment i actually believed that i could do such a thing that i had only to clap my hands or shout or make some sign and the stones would shake themselves from the ground to swing in whirling dance through the glistening air i believed and so i clapped my hands and gave a loud shout it did not sound like my own voice at all for the shout resounded over the land echoing in the glens and valleys round about trembling the stones of the magic ring in the earth then one after another the standing stones began to rise one by one they pulled themselves from their sockets like teeth twisting themselves from the jaw that holds them and they rose trailing dirt to stand in the air and then when all were together in the air those ancient stones began to turn around and around slowly slowly at first but then a little faster each stone began turning around its own axis as it whirled in the air the druids looked on in horror and wonder some cried out in fright i thought to myself that it was a handsome sight those heavy blue stones spinning and whirling in the shining air as in a dream perhaps it was a dream after all if so it was a dream we all shared together with eyes wide and staring mouths open in disbelief once twice and again the stones whirled through their course from my place on the druid seat i heard my own voice ringing high and strange voicing a song or laughter i know not which to the stones dancing in the air i clapped my hands again and the great stones plummeted instantly to earth the ground shook beneath them and the dust rose in a cloud when it cleared we saw that some of the stones had fallen back into their socket holes most however simply lay where they dropped one or another had cracked and shattered and the ring was broken the stone on which i stood had settled back onto its place and i stepped off blaise his face alight with the wonder of what he had seen rushed towards me and would have taken hold of me but hafgan restrained him saying do not touch him until the awen has passed blaise made to step back caught sight of the druid seat and thrust his ringer towards it for any inclined to doubt what we have witnessed this day let this be a sign of the truth of what we have seen i looked at where he was pointing and saw the prints of my feet etched deep into the stone of the druid seat so the great light was proclaimed among the learned brotherhood that day some believed others did not and although none could deny the power of what they had seen some chose to attribute the miracle to a different source it is lieusun some said mathonwy said others who else has such power in the end hafgan lost his temper you call me wise leader he said bitterly but refuse to follow where i lead very well from this day let each man follow who he will i will not remain chief of such smallminded and ignorant men with that he raised his staff in both hands and broke it over his knee then turned his back and strode from the assembly the learned brotherhood was dissolved we followed hafgan from the grove blaise charis myself and two or three others and returned to the glen where the warband was waiting we broke camp at once and rode south towards yr widdfa hafgan wanted to see the great mountain again and to show us where he was born he was angry for a time after leaving garth greggyn but this passed very quickly and he soon appeared joyful and more content than i had ever seen him singing laughing talking long and happily with my mother as we rode along a man freed from a tiresome burden or healed of a wearying pain blaise noticed the change as well and explained it to me he has been divided in his heart for a very long time i think he wanted to force the decision back there and now that it is over he is free to go his own way divided between jesu and the old gods blaise replied as chief druid he must uphold the eminence of the ancient gods of our people though that has become distasteful to him hi the years since he discovered the great light i must have frowned or shown my lack of comprehension for blaise added you must understand myrddin bach not every man will follow the light nothing you or anyone else can do will change that he shook his head though dead men rise from their graves and stones dance in the ak they will still refuse it makes no sense but that is the way of it i did not altogether believe him i thought he was telling me the truth as he saw it and respected his insight but in my innermost heart i thought that if men did not believe the truth it was only because a better way of explaining had yet to be discovered there is a way to make all men see i thought to myself and i will find it two days later we sat on a high hill the wind riffling the sparse grass and sighing among the bare rocks as we gazed at the cold whitetopped and solitary splendour of yr widdfa snow lord winters fortress in that lonely land of brooding peaks and darksome vales it is easy to believe the things whispered before the firelight the tales and scraps of tales men have passed to their children for a hundred generations and more oneeyed giants in halls of stone goddesses who transform themselves into owls to haunt the night on soft silent wings water maids who lure the unwary to rapturous death below the waves enchanted hills where captured heroes sleep the centuries away invisible islands where gods cavort in the twilight of neverending summer easy to believe the unbelievable there among the hollow hills we dismounted and ate a meal on the hilltop then rested i did not care to sleep and decided to walk down to the valley and fill the water jars and skins at the stream it was not a difficult walk nor even very far thus i did not pay particularly close attention to the features of the land not that this would have helped i stumbled and slid down the hill laden with skins and jars swinging from their thongs round my neck and shoulders a quickrunning stream lay in the centre of the valley in among the tight tangles of blackthorn and elder i found a way in to the water and set to filling the skins i cannot say how long i was at it but it could not have been long nevertheless when i gathered up the filled containers and stood to look around i could no longer see the hill a dense grey fog had come down from yr widdfa and wrapped the higher hills in a clotted mass thick as wool i was concerned but not frightened after all the hill stood directly before me all i need do was put one foot in front of the other and retrace my steps to the top where the others waited i wasted no time but set off at once in the event that the others awoke and became anxious to find me missing and a fog filling the valley i quickly found the path i had taken down the hill and began the ascent i walked a long time but came ho nearer the top i stopped and peered into the swirling blankness and try as i might i could not make out where i was on the hillside i called out and heard my cry muted and silenced by the thick damp vapours what to do there was no telling how long the mist might last i might wander the hilltrack for days on end and never find my way worse and far more likely i might stumble over a rock in the path and break a leg or step over a cliff and fall to my death i sat down to think it through it seemed obvious that i had been walking in a circle and equally obvious as i sat there that the fog was settling in i had no better choice than to set off once more as i did not relish spending a cold wet night alone clinging to a rock on the side of the hill so i started walking again but this time slowly making certain that each step led upward in this way though it might take half the day i would eventually reach our camp at the top and in this way i did eventually reach the hilltop only to discover our camp abandoned and no one there i dropped the waterskins and looked around the mist was not as thick as in the valley so i could with a little difficulty make a complete survey of the hilltop the others were gone leaving not a trace behind strange and frightening i called again and again but heard no answering call i went back to the place where we had eaten our meal thinking to find some token of our presence however small but try as i might i could not locate the place not a crust or crumb remained to show where we had been there was not a single hoofprint not a blade of grass disturbed i had climbed the wrong hill in my blind haste to escape the fog i had lost my way and now would have to wait until the mist cleared and i could see where and how i had made my mistake in the meantime i had no choice but to do what i should have done in the first place stay put my cheeks burned with shame at my stupidity i could make a stone circle dance in the air but could not find my way to the top of a simple hill without getting lost it was too absurd for words five finding a nest among the rocks i wrapped my cloak around me and settled myself to wait knowing full well that i might have to spend the night there but i did not like to think about that would the hollow hills claim another victim i did not like to think about that either later as the deepening mist darkened towards dusk and i sat hugging my knees and trying not to be afraid i heard a faint tinkling sound the light jingling of a horses tack one of the warband coming to find me i jumped up and called out the sound stopped and i did not hear it again although i stood still to listen are you there blaise who is it my words fell to earth where they were spoken and there was no answer i retrieved one of the water skins and returned to my huddle among the rocks miserable now i pulled my cloak more tightly around me and wondered how long it would take the wolves to find me i must have fallen asleep for i dreamed and in my dream i saw a tall gaunt man sitting in a room painted with strange designs his hands were stretched flat on the table before him and the eyes in his long withered face were sunken and closed his hair was uncut falling around his shoulders like a net of cobwebs and he wore a rich robe of darkest blue with a brooch and pin of silver inset with tiny moonstones before him on the table was an object shaped like a large egg a polished stone perhaps cradled in a holder of carven wood two wasted candles stood on either side of this eggstone guttering in the fitful wind wafting through the cracks in the walls and windows this man was not alone there was another in the room as well i could not see this other person but knew as one simply knows in a dream that she was there with him oh yes the other was a woman i knew this too before i saw her stretch her hand slowly across the table to entwine her young fingers with those of the man he opened his eyes then for i saw the glint of light from the candles but his eyes were wells of darkness darkness and death i shivered and woke an unusual dream but even as i felt its lingering presence i knew it to represent a real place and that the man i had seen and the womans hand i glimpsed were real i blinked and looked around night had fallen full and darkness was complete the wind stirred swirling the mist and i heard again the light jingling sound this time i did not call out but remained silent crouching among the rocks the sound came nearer but in the fog there was no telling how close it really was i waited presently i saw a lighter patch floating in the darkness swinging towards me through the thick damp air the light brightened intensified divided into two glowing orbs like great cats eyes the jingling sound came from the lights swimming nearer only when they were almost on top of me did the lights stop i moved not a muscle but they knew where to find me by scent i think for the darkness and mist obscured all there were four of them two to a torch swarthy men in rough skin jerkins and kilts their bodies were wellmuscled and compact two had huge armbands of iron and carried irontipped spears all had bronze daggers in their belts but i was not frightened of their weapons for though they were men full grown none were bigger than myself a boy of but twelve summers their eyes were dark and cunning like weasel eyes and the men stood gazing at me through the mist shadows nickering over their faces the torchbearers held their brands high and the other two advanced together to stand over me jingling lightly as they moved i looked and saw a chain with brass bells tied just below the knee of the foremost stranger he squatted on his haunches and stared at me for a long moment dark eyes glittering he pressed a finger into my chest felt the flesh and bone there and grunted then he saw my silver tore and raised his hand to stroke it after a moment he rose again and barked a word over his shoulder the others behind him parted and i saw another figure approaching out of the mist i stood slowly hands loose at my sides and waited while the newcomer came to stand before him he was smaller than the others but carried himself in the way of chieftains everywhere he wore his authority like a second skin and i had no doubt that he possessed rank among his people he motioned one of the torchmen closer so that he could see me properly in the fluttering light i saw that this chieftain was a woman she too looked long upon my tore but did not touch it or me she turned to the one with the bells and uttered a short harsh bark whereupon he and the one beside him took me by the arms and we started off i was more carried than dragged for my feet scarcely touched ground we descended the hill and reached the valley splashed across the stream and from the sound of running water close by followed the stream for a time before beginning another ascent the slope was gradual eventually levelling out to become a narrow track or gorge between two steep hills this track led a fair distance and we walked a time one torch ahead and one behind my companions on either side did not push me neither did they loosen their grip although escape was not possible could i have seen where i was going in the mist i would not have known where to run at last the track turned upward and we began a steep ascent it was a short climb however and i soon found myself standing in front of a round hidecovered opening in the hill itself the chieftain entered and it was indicated that i was to follow i stepped through the opening and found myself inside a large mound dwelling of timber and skin covered with dirt and turf on the outside the rath as it is called appeared in daylight just like any of the innumerable hills around it there were fifteen or more people inside reclining in groups on grass pallets covered with fleeces and furs around the central fire men women children and several lean dogs that looked as though they would have been more at home running the hills in a wolf pack all of them men and beasts alike staring at me as i stood uncertainly in their midst the shechief motioned me forward and i was brought to stand before an old woman no larger than a girl but whitehaired and wrinkled as a dried plum her black eyes were sharp as the bone needle in her hand and she regarded me with frank curiosity for a moment reaching out to touch my leg which she pinched and patted satisfied with her appraisal she nodded to the shechief who jerked her head to the side and i was led to a pallet and pushed down upon it once i was well inside the rath the hill people seemed to lose interest in me i was left alone to observe my captors who aside from an occasional glance in my direction and a dog that came to sniff my hands and legs appeared oblivious to my presence i sat on the furcovered pallet and tried to see what i might discover about these people there were eight men and four women aside from the shechief and the old woman scattered among them were five naked children whose ages were impossible to determine the adults looked like children to me all the adults wore woadstained scars on their cheeks fhain marks as i was to learn distinctive spirals which at the time of cutting had the deep blue powder pressed into the wounds to colour them for ever individuals of the same fhain the word means family tribe or clan wore the same marks i puzzled over who they might be not picti though they used the woad they were too small for painted people who anyway would have killed me outright upon discovery neither were they members of any of the hill tribes i knew about their habit of living underground marked them for a northern people but if so they were far south of their beloved moors these i decided could only be the bhean sidhe the enchanted hill folk as much feared for their obscure ways and magic as they were envied for their gold the bhean sidhe were rumoured to possess great malevolent power and even greater treasures of gold both of which were employed in tormenting the tallfolk whom they delighted in sacrificing to their crude idols whenever they could catch them and i was their captive the clan settled for the night and one by one fell asleep i pretended sleep too but stayed awake to be ready to make my escape when at last judging from the sound of the snoring everyone was sleeping soundly and peacefully i rose crept from my pallet to the doorway and out into the night the mist had cleared and the night was ablaze with stars cold and bright the moon already set the surrounding hills showed as a solid black undulating mass against the deep blue of heaven i breathed in the mountain air and looked at the stars here all serious thought of escape vanished i had only to look at the jetdark night to know that running in such darkness invited disaster and even if i had been so determined on the wind i heard the bark of hunting wolves it came to me that this was why my captors had not bothered to restrain me in any way if i were foolish enough to tempt the wolves so be it i deserved my fate all the same as i stood looking at the stars i heard the rustle of the closing flap and turned to see someone emerge from the rath as i made no move my companion came to stand near me and i saw that it was the shechief she put her hand on my arm but lightly as much to reassure herself that i was still there as to remind me that i was a captive we stood together for a long time so close that i could feel the heat from her body neither of us spoke we had no words but something in her touch gave me to understand that these people had some purpose for me while not exactly an honoured guest my presence was more than a passing curiosity after a while she turned and pulled me with her back into the rath i returned to my pallet and she to hers and i closed my eyes and prayed that i would soon be reunited with my people what the hilldwellers wanted with me i discovered soon after sunrise when vrisa chieftain of the amsaradh fhain their name for themselves it means people of the killing bird or hawk clan took me out to their holy place on a nearby hilltop the hill was the highest around and took some effort to climb but upon gaining the summit i saw a menhir a single standing stone painted with blue spirals and the representations of various birds and animals most notably hawks and wolves in her belt vrisa wore a long flatbladed knife polished and honed to mirror brightness the man with the bells elac as i would later discover kept his hand tight on my arm all the way up the hill and two of the others carried spears the whole fhain made the trek up the hill gathering round us as we came to stand beside the menhir humming softly with a sound like wind through dry leaves a braided leather rope was produced and my wrists were bound tightly my cloak was taken from me and i was made to lie down on the sun side of the standing stone they meant to sacrifice me there was no doubt about that and judging from the bones scattered around the hilltop i was not their first offering but though this might seem boastful to some i was more fearful of being left by my people than having my heart carved beating from my body there was no hate no deception or guile in these people they did not wish me harm in the least and indeed did not consider the sacrifice of my life any great harm at all in their way of thinking my soul would simply take up a new body and i would be reborn or i would travel to the otherworld to live with the ancient ones in paradise knowing neither night nor winter either way i was deemed fortunate that i would have to die to come into one or the other of these enviable benefits could not be helped and consequently did not concern them over much and since it was a journey all must make sooner or later it was assumed that i would not greatly mind so as i lay there on the ground waiting while the sun slowly climbed its way clear of the hills round about this would be the signal when the first rays of the morning sun struck the menhir vrisa would strike with her knife i did what any christian would and prayed for swift deliverance perhaps the knife was poorly made perhaps it was old and should have been recast long ago nevertheless as the sun struck the menhir the humming chorus loosed a mighty shout vrisas knife flashed up and down swiftly as a serpents strike i squeezed shut my eyes and in the same instant heard a cry opening my eyes i saw vrisa clasping her wrist her face pale with pain teeth bared as she bit back another cry the knifes handle lay on the ground its blade splintered into gleaming pieces like shards of yellow glass elac eyes starting from his head gripped his spear so tightly the blood drained from his hands others bit the backs of their hands some lay prostrate on the ground whimpering i rolled up into a sitting position the clans wise woman the gernyfhain pushed her way through the others to stand over me with her hands outstretched while she stared into therisen sun chanting in their singing speech then she made a motion with her hands and snapped an order at the men looking on two of them came to me hesitantly the last act in the world they would have chosen and untied the braided rope and unbound me now men will say that i broke the knife with magic i have even heard it said that it is not surprising in the least that the knife should break since as anyone knows bronze cannot harm an enchanted being like myself well i was surprised and did not feel the least little bit enchanted also i had not yet learned the secrets of the ancient art i tell you only what happened believe what you like but as vrisas sacrifice knife flashed through the air towards my heart there appeared a hand a cloud hand elac called it the knife struck the palm of this mysterious cloud hand and shattered vrisas wrist was already swelling the force of her blow and the shock of the shattering knife nearly broke her wrist poor girl i call her girl now for i soon learned that she was but a summer or two older than i was at the time yet already chief of her hill folk tribe gernyfhain the wise woman with the flintsharp eyes and puckered face of a nutbrown apple was her grandmother gernyfhain was not slow to recognize so powerful a sign she stepped in raised me to my feet and gazed long into my face the sun was up now and my eyes filled with new morning light she scrutinized me and turned to the others speaking excitedly they stared but vrisa advanced slowly raised a hand to my face pulling down my cheek with her thumb and stared into my eyes the light of recognition broke across her face and she beamed forgetting her painful wrist for the moment she invited the others to see for themselves and i was subjected to a painless ordeal as the entire clan examined the colour of my eyes by turns when they had satisfied themselves that i did indeed possess the golden eyes of a hawk gernyfhain put her hands on my head and offered up a thanksgiving prayer to lughsun for sending me the clan had felt they needed a powerful sacrifice to offset a run of extreme ill fortune they had been having for the last three summers poor grazing and worse lambing two children had died of fever and nolos brother had been killed by a boar their prospects for improved fortune were decidedly bleak when elac returning home from a spoiled hunt heard me shouting on the hilltop in the fog they thought their prayers had been answered elac climbed the hill and verified i was there then hurried to the rath told the others what he had found and after chewing it over among themselves decided to fetch me along and sacrifice me in the morning the shattered knife put a new face on it however and they decided that i must be a present from the gods unfortunately disguised as a subhuman tallfolk youth it is true but a gift nonetheless i do not mean to make them sound like backward children though childlike is a fair description of them in many ways still they were anything but backward on the contrary they were wonderfully intelligent with sharp accurate memories and a vast store of instinctual knowledge that comes to them through their mothers milk but the strength of their faith was such that they lived their lives in unquestioning acceptance of all things trusting their parents the earth goddess and her husband lughsun for rain and sun for deer to hunt for grass to graze their sheep for the things they needed to live thus to them anything was possible at any moment the sky might suddenly turn to stone or rivers to silver and hills to gold dragons might coil in sleep under the hills or giants dream in deep mountain caverns a man might be a man or a god or both at once a hand might appear in their midst and shatter a knife as it slashed towards the heart of their muchneeded sacrifice and this too was to be accepted does this make them backward with faith like this it is little wonder that once they learned the truth they carried it a long long way six i thought that when we returned to the rath i would be set free in this i was mistaken for if i had been desirable as a potential sacrifice as a living gift i was even more valuable they had no intention of letting me leave perhaps when the purpose for which i had been sent to them was fulfilled i might depart but until then it could not even be contemplated this was communicated to me in no uncertain terms when i tried to leave the rath later that day i was sitting beside the door to the rath and when no one was looking i simply got to my feet and started down the hill i escaped but ten steps and nolo called the dogs snarling growling viciously the dogs surrounded me until i retreated to my place at the door of the rath the days crawled by and each passing moment my heart grew heavier my people were in these hills somewhere searching for me worrying over me i had not the skill to see them then but i could feel their anxiety across the separating distance and i knew their misery i wept at night as i lay on my pallet stinging tears for the sorrow i was causing my mother and the hardship my absence meant great light i cried please hear me give them peace to know i am unharmed give them hope to know i will return give them patience to wait and courage to endure the waiting give them strength so that they will not grow weary this prayer was to become a litany of comfort to me for a good long time often spoken with tears it is true the next day after nearly four days of judicious contemplation gernyfhain took me by the arm and sat me down on a rock at her feet and began speaking at me i understood nothing of what she said but paid close attention and soon began to discern the rhythm of their speech i nodded from time to time just to show that i was trying she puckered up her wrinkles and made a gesture which included the rath and everyone and everything in it fhain she said repeating several times until i did the same fhain i said smiling the smiling worked wonders for the hill folk are happy people and smiling indicates to them a soul in harmony with life and they are not far wrong gernyfhain she told me next thumping herself on the chest gernyfhain i repeated then i thumped myself on the chest and said myrddin i used the cymry form of my name thinking that would be closest to their speech myrddin she nodded and repeated the word several times much pleased to have such a willing and able gift she then pointed at each of the other clan members as they went about their various tasks vrisa elac nolo teirn beona rhyllha and others i did my best to keep up with her and managed for a while but when she turned to naming other things earth sky hills clouds river rock i fell behind that ended my first lesson in the hill folk tongue and began a custom that was to continue many months after that beginning my day sitting beside gernyfhain as at blaises feet or dafyds practising my lessons vrisa took it upon herself to civilize me for a start my clothing was taken away and replaced with skins and fur this concerned me until i saw that she carefully placed my things in a special basket lashed to a roofpole in the rath i might not be leaving soon but at least when i did it would be as i came she then led me back outside chattering at me all the while and glancing at me from time to time to smile showing her fine white teeth as much as to say be welcome tallfolkwealth you are fhain now it pleased her when i said her name and taught her mine indeed they roared with delight when i was finally able to tell them that my name meant hawk that confirmed them in their belief that my coming was ordained by their parents they watched my progress hungrily any little thing i did pleased them all enormously they found endless pleasure in recounting my achievements to one another around the supper fire at night at first i considered this was because of my status as gift later i learned that they treated all children that way children were held in specially high regard among them their language proved this in that child and wealth were the same to them eurn this one word served both meanings they viewed children as others might view honoured guests worthies deserving of consideration and respect whose mere presence was cause for joy and a treat to be relished with pleasure and celebrated whenever possible thus even though i was in their reckoning of age very nearly a fullgrown man i lacked the proper upbringing and so i must be considered a child until i learned enough manners to become an adult this made an interesting period of adjustment for in those first months i spent as much time in the company of the young as with their elders the summer passed quickly time sped because i was desperate to learn their speech so that i could communicate my anxiety about my people and learn their reason for keeping me my opportunity came one crisp autumn night not long after lughnasadh we sat as we sometimes did before an outdoor fire on the hilltop under the stars elac and nolo first and second husbands to vrisa and some of the others had been out hunting that day and after supper began describing what had taken place in utter innocence elac turned to me and said we saw tallfblk in the crooked glen yet they are searching for their childwealth yet i asked him you have known of this before f he smiled and nodded nolo nodded with him and said we have all seen them many times why did you not tell me i demanded trying to keep my temper down myrddin is fhain now be you fhainbrother we will leave soon tallfolk will stop searching and go away leave my anger vanished at the thought i turned to vrisa what does elac mean where are we going snow time is coming soon we will go to the crannog fhainbrother when i felt desperation rising in me like a sickness vrisa shrugged soon before the snow it made sense and i should have known the hill folk did not live in one place very long i knew that but somehow failed to consider that they might leave soon for their winter home a crannog in a hollow hill in the north you have to take me to them i told vrisa i must see them vrisa frowned and turned to gernyfhain who shook her head slightly that cannot be she replied tallfolk will borrow childwealth from fhain they had no direct word for stealing borrowing was as close as they came and they were wonderfully resourceful borrowers i was tallfolk before i am fhainbrother i said i must say farewell this puzzled them they had no sense of parting or farewell even death was not a strict separation since the dead one had only gone on a journey much as one might go hunting and could return at any moment in a different body perhaps but essentially the same what means this fayrwell visa asked i know it not i must tell them to stop searching i explained to go back to their lands and leave the crooked glen no need myrddinwealth explained elac happily tallfolk will stop searching soon they will go away soon no i said rising to my feet they are my fhainbrothers my parents never will they stop searching for their childwealth never their concept of time was equally vague the idea of continuous ceaseless activity could not be comprehended vrisa merely shook her head lightly this is a thing i know not you are fhain now you are a gift to hawk people myrddinwealth a gift from parents i agreed but held my ground i am a gift yes but i must thank fhainbrothers for letting me become a hawk person this they understood for who would not care to become a hawk person such a great and impressive honour would naturally engender enormous gratitude which the recipient would be duty bound to express yes it made sense to them that i would wish to thank my former fhainbrothers what is more they took it as a sign of my growing maturity it is a good thing myrddinbrother you will thank parents tomorrow and fhainbrothers i insisted how will you thank them asked vrisa suspiciously sensing potential trickery her dark eyes narrowed and wary my answer must be innocent or she would refuse outright i will give back their tallfolk clothes again this made perfect sense to a people without skill at weaving without looms cloth was scarce and extremely valuable she might be sorry to see the clothwealth leave the fhain but could well understand why i wanted to give it back and why my former tallfolk fhain if they could not have me would at least wish to have my clothes elac she said finally take myrddinwealth to tallfolk fire ring tomorrow i smiled there was no use in pushing the matter further it was all i was likely to get from them for the moment thank you vrisachief thank you fhainkin they all smiled back and began chattering at me benignly and i fell to working out how best to make my escape there were four of them in the crooked glen i could tell even from a distance that they were my people members of the warband that had ridden as escort they were camped by a stream and the glimmering light of their fire reflected in the moving water they were from ah appearances still asleep as the sun had not yet risen above the hills to the east f we were poised on a rock ledge on the hillside waiting i will go down to my fhainbrothers now i told elac we will go with you he indicated nolo and teirn no i will go alone i tried to sound as firm as gernyfhain he regarded me slyly and then shook his head vrisachief says you will not come back indeed that was my plan elac shook his head and stood up beside me putting his hand on my shoulder we will go with you myrddinbrother so tallfolk do not borrow childwealth back i saw jt all very clearly now if a trifle late if we all went down together there would be a fight elphins warriors would never allow the hill folk to leave with me they would try to save me and they would likely die trying pierced with arrows before they could draw their swords one or more of the hill folk might be killed in the skirmish as well no i could not let that happen my freedom was not as important as the lives of men i called my friends now what was i to do no i folded my arms across my chest and sat down i will not go why myrddinwealth mystified elac stared at me you go he sat down beside me nolo frowned and put out his hand to me shechief says husbands must go with you tallfolk cannot be trusted with childwealth myrddinbrother tahfolkbrothers will not understand they will kill fhainkin when they see you thinking to help fhainbrother that got through to elac who nodded glumly he knew just how unappreciative tallfolk could be hawk fhain fear tallfolk not at all boasted nolo well i do not wish fhainbrothers killed that will bring great sadness to myrddinbrother bring sadness to fhain i appealed to elac you go elac take the clothes to tallfolkbrothers i indicated the pile of clothing on the ledge beside me he considered this and agreed i folded my cloak trousers and tunic as neatly as i could frantically thinking how i might send a message that would not be misinterpreted in the end i took off my rawhide belt and tied that around the bundle my people would recognize the clothing of course but i still needed another token to indicate my safety i glanced around teirn i held out my hand i need an arrow i would have preferred a pen and parchment but these were as foreign to the hill folk as pepper and perfume they did not trust writing and in this showed remarkable wisdom teirn withdrew an arrow the missiles of the hill folk are short flinttipped reeds fletched with raven feathers unmistakable and deadly and hill folk accuracy is legendary the tallfolk tribes in the north have learned great respect for the fragilelooking arrows and the unerring hand that draws the bow i bent to the bundle and took the arrow snapping it in the centre and tucking the two ends under the rawhide belt then as an afterthought i removed the silver wolfshead brooch from the cloak and handed the bundle to elac there take this to tallfolk camp he looked at the bundle and at the camp below lughsun is rising i told him do take it now before tallfolkbrothers wake he ducked his head they will see me not with that he scrambled over the ledge and was gone a few moments later we saw him running towards the camp creeping with all the stealth and silence of a shadow elac entered the sleeping camp and in an act of impulsive bravery typical of him carefully placed the bundle beside the head of one of the sleeping warriors he returned to the ledge in no time and we returned to the rath a moment later it took everything in me to keep from looking back i could only hope the fact that my clothes were neatly folded and deposited in their camp would somehow indicate that i was alive and knew my searchers whereabouts but could not come to them myself there was every chance that my message would go awry but i trusted the great god and hoped i had not made things worse something changed inside me that day for in giving up my clothes it was as if i also gave up the idea of rescue curiously i became more content to stay and although i still grew heartsick and moody from time to time perhaps i too began believing my presence with the hawk people had a purpose after that day i no longer contemplated escape and eventually came to accept my capture i did not see the searchers again and soon after the fire of samhain the fhain left for their winter pastures in the north it made no sense to me why they should come south for the summer and travel north to winter but that is what they did at the time i did not know that certain regions of the north country can be as mild as any place in the south but i soon learned that not all the land above the wall is the bleak rockstrewn and windblown wasteland that most people think it is there are corners as lush and comfortable as the best land in all britain it was to one of these corners that we came riding our shaggy ponies and driving our tough little sheep before us a crannog is not much different from a rath save that it is actually hollowed into the heart of the hill it is also larger it had to be for we shared it with our ponies and sheep on the coldest days ideally placed in a secluded glen the crannog appears to tallfolk eyes as just another hill among many there was good grazing for the sheep and ponies and a stream which emptied into a nearby sea estuary the crannog was dark and warm and though the winter wind whined at night as it searched the rocks and crannies for places its cold fingers could reach we lay wrapped in our furs and fleeces around the fire listening to gernyfhain tell of the elder days before the romanmen came with their swords and built their roads and fortresses before the bloodlust came on men to make them war with one another before ever the tallfolk came to the island of the mighty listen she would say i will tell you of the time before time when the world was newmade and the prytani ran free and food was plentiful to find and our parents smiled on all their childwealth when the great snow was shut up in the north and troubled mothers firstborn not at all and she would begin reciting her tale repeating in her tone and cadence and inflection the agesold memory of her people unking them with a past impossibly remote but alive in her words there was no telling how old the story was for the hill folk spoke of all events the same simple immediate way what a gern described might have taken place tenthousand summers ago or it might have happened yesterday indeed it was all the same to them one moon waxed and waned and another and one day just before dusk it began to snow elac and nolo and i went down to the valley with the dogs to herd the livestock back to the crannog we had just begun when i heard nolo shout i turned to see him pointing off down the valley at riders approaching through the swirling snow elac made a flattening motion with his hand and i saw nolo notch an arrow to his bowstring crouch and disappear he simply vanished becoming one more rock or turvey hillock beside the stream i crouched too in the way they had taught me wondering whether i might be as easily mistaken for a stone the dogs barked and elac whistled silencing them instantly three tallfolk riders clopped up on leggy starvedlooking mounts their leader said something elac replied and then they began speaking in a much abused approximation of the hill folk tongue we come to ask hill folk magic the rider explained in his halting broken speech why asked elac placidly our chieftains second wife dies she has the fever and will keep no food he looked at elac doubtfully will your wise woman come i will ask her he shrugged adding but likely she will not find it worthwhile to make healing magic for a tallfolk woman our chief says he will give four bracelets of gold if the gern will come elac frowned disdainfully as if to say such trinkets are horse manure to us although i knew the prytani vafced tallfolk gold and prized it when they could get it i will ask he repeated you go now we will wait no you go now insisted elac he did not want the tallfolk to see which hill our crannog was in it is our chief replied the rider elac shrugged again and turned away making a pretence of going back to his sheep gathering the riders whispered among themselves for a moment and then the leader said when when will you tell her when tallfolk go back to their huts the riders wheeled their horses and rode away elac waited until they were gone and then motioned us forward nolo replaced his arrow in the quiver and we herded the sheep together and drove them back to the crannog the others had already brought the horses in so elac wasted no time in speaking to gern the tallfolk chiefs wife is fevered he told her four gold bracelets if you will heal her she must be very fevered replied gern but i will go to her and she rose and made her way out of the crannog at once nolo elac vrisa and i followed by the time we arrived at the tallfolk settlement on the estuary it was almost dark the chiefs house stood on timber stilts amidst a handful of lesser dwellings built at the very edge of the reeking mudflats vrisa elac and nolo accompanied gern i had come to hold the ponies but once we arrived and gern looked around she indicated that i was to join them in the chiefs house a filthy skin hung over the door at elacs whistle this doorflap was drawn back and the man who had come to us in the valley emerged to motion us in the round timber hut contained a single large room with a fire stone in the centre wind sifted through the poorlythatched roof and the unfilled gaps in the wattle making the room damp and chill the shells of mussels and oysters and fishbones and scales lay trampled on the floor the chieftain sat beside the sooty drieddung fire with two women each clutching a dirty squawling infant to her breast the chief grunted and gestured across the room where a woman lay on a pallet of rushes piled high with furs gern clucked when she saw the woman she was not old but the dubious honour of producing heirs for the chief had aged her beyond her years and now she lay in her bed aflame with fever eyes sunken limbs trembling her skin pale and yellow as the fleece under her head she was dying even i who at the time lacked any knowledge of healing could see that she would not last the night fools gern said under her breath they ask magic too late four bracelets elac reminded her gern sighed and squatted down beside the woman studied her for a long moment and then dipped her fingers into the pouch at her belt and brought out a small pot of ointment which she began applying to the sick womans forehead the woman shivered and opened her eyes i could see the deathlook in them although under gerns touch she seemed to revive somewhat gern spoke to her softly using the soothing words of the healers tongue to ease the fevers grip dipping back into her pouch gern withdrew her hand and extended it to me into my open palm she dropped a small mass of dried matter bark shavings roots leaves grass seeds nodding towards the iron cauldron hanging over the fire by a chain from the roofbeam i understood that she wished me to put the mixture into the cauldron which i did i poured water into the pot and waited until it boiled then gern motioned for me to bring it to her under the foul mutterings of the chief i dipped out a gourd gern lifted the womans head and gave her to drink the woman smiled weakly as she lay back a few moments later she closed her eyes and slept gern then went to the chief and stood before him will the woman live asked the chief he might have been speaking about one of his hounds she lives answered gernyfhain see she does keep warm and drinks the potion the chieftain grunted and removed one of his bracelets he handed the golden object to his man who dropped it gingerly into gerns palm lest he touch her the slight did not go unnoticed elac stiffened nolos hand alreadyjhad an arrow in it but gern looked at the bracelet and hefted it in her hand likely there was much tin in the thing and little enough gold you promised four bracelets four take what you are given and get out he growled in his sorry speech i will not hear your lies the hill folk drew their weapons gern raised a hand in the air elac and nolo froze chief thinks to cheat gernyfhain she spoke softly but the threat was undeniable her hand weaved a strange motion in the air and something fell from her fingers the fire suddenly became a fountain gushing bright sparks the women screamed and threw their hands over their faces the chieftain quickly reconsidered glaring with redeyed anger he muttered and removed three more bracelets throwing them into the flaming embers of the fire at his feet quick as a flick gern reached into the fire and scooped up the bracelets to the astonishment of the tallfolk the gold disappeared into a fold in her clothing and straightbacked she turned and walked from the hut we followed her mounted our ponies and together returned to the crannog in the winter twilight two days later elac and nolo took the sheep back down to the pasture and were there when the tallfolk came upon them three riders as before and the chief with them i was halfway down the hill and saw the riders sweep down on my fhainbrothers scattering the sheep i stopped and hunched myself into a motionless shape blending instantly into the hillscape when the riders halted i hurried forward give back the gold the chief shouted elacs knife appeared in his hand nolos bowstring stretched taut the tallfolk were not unprepared each held a sturdy sword and a small wellmade woodandoxhide shield i wondered about the weapons where had these men come by them trading with the scotti give it back thief elac may not have understood the word but he knew the tone his muscles tensed ready to leap to the fight the only thing that checked him was the horses had the hill folk been astride their own ponies they would have been nigh invincible to the rogues before them but it was four against two and the two were on foot the tallfolk chieftain meant to have his gold back or the heads of those who had it on sharpened stakes outside his house perhaps both as i watched i felt the same quickening in the air around me as i had felt the day the stones danced i knew something would happen but did not know what it might be but the moment i stepped between elac and the chieftain i saw that the tallfolk felt it too why have you come here i asked trying to imitate gernyfhains unassailable authority the tallfolk started as if i had sprung fullgrown from the turf at their feet the chieftain tightened his grip on his sword and grumbled the woman is dead and lies cold in the mud i have come for my gold go back i told him if you think to avenge yourself on those who helped you then you deserve what will happen to you turn back there is nothing for you here a fierce and ugly glee twisted his stupid face i will have the gold and your flapping tongue as well bastard you have been warned i told him then looked at the others you have all been warned they were not as brave as their chief or else they were not as stupid they muttered and made the sign against evil with their hands the chief opened his mouth in a rude laugh i will gut you like a herring and strangle you with your own entrails boy he boasted lowering his sword to my throat elac tensed ready to strike i held up a hand to stay him the chiefs sword the blade black with caked blood came nearer i turned my eyes to the length of jagged iron and imagined the heat that had forged it imagined it red hot from the forge fire the swordtip began to glow duskily at first but brightening rapidly the fireglow spreading along the blade towards the hilt the chief held the weapon as long as he could and burmed his hand badly for his stubbornness his shriek echoed in the valley kill him he shouted the red welt on his palm was already blistering kill him his men made no move for their own weapons had become too hot to hold and indeed the iron in their belt buckles knives and arm rings was growing uncomfortably warm the horses jigged nervously showing the whites of theneyes take yourselves from here and do not trouble us again i said levelly although my heart was beating furiously one of the men turned his horse and made to ride away but his leader was a bullheaded man stay rage and frustration blackened his face you he roared at me i will kill you i will i had never seen a man carried away by such hate and although i have seen it once or twice since at the time i did not know that it could kill the chief gagged and his words stuck like fishbones in his throat and he choked making a hideous sound clawing at his neck eyes bulging he pitched from the saddle he was dead when his body struck the ground the men stared at their fallen leader only for an instant then wheeled their horses and fled back the way they had come leaving their chief where he lay when they had gone elac turned to me and looked long into my eyes he did not speak but the questions were there who are you what are you nolo squatted beside the body this one is dead myrddinwealth he said softly we will put him back on his horse and send him home to his own i told him with some difficulty the three of us lifted the body and slung it across the saddle tying the wrists and ankles together to keep it from sliding off we turned the horse and gave the unhappy beast a slap on the rump and it trotted after the others i breathed a prayer for the man i did not have it in me to despise him we watched the horses out of sight and then returned to the crannog elac and nolo running on ahead in their eagerness to tell what they had seen vrisa and gernyfhain regarded me knowingly as they heard what had happened gernyfhain raised her hands above my head and sang the victory for me vrisa showed her appreciation in another way she put her arms around me and kissed me that night i sat beside her at supper and she fed me from her bowl seven the snow came to the north country through cold grey days of little light and long black nights of howling wind i sat at gernyfhains feet beside the peat fire and she taught me her craft the ancient arts of earth and air fire and water that men in their ignorance call magic i learn quickly but gernyfhain was a good teacher as adept in her own way as dafyd or blaise in theirs it was at this time that i began to see and it started with the peat fire which glows so beautifully all cherry red and gold not all gerns have this ability but gernyfhain could look into the fire and see the shapes of things there and once she awakened the ability in me we would sit there for hours together firegazing afterwards she would ask me what i had seen and i would tell her i soon learned that my vision was more clear than her own as my skill improved i could almost summon the images i chose almost nevertheless one night i saw my mother this occurrence was as pleasant as it was unexpected i was staring into the flames emptying my mind for the images that would come while at the same time reaching out for them an act more difficult to describe than to do gernyfhain likened it to drawing water from a stream or coaxing shy winterborn colts down from the hills as i stared into the fire that cold night i saw the form of a woman flicker before me and i drew it in held it much as a man might cup his hand around a candle flame coaxed it to take shape willed it to remain it was charis and she was sitting in a chamber beside a brazier glowing with charcoal at the moment i apprehended her she raised her head and looked around as if someone had spoken her name perhaps i did i cannot say the image was strong and i could see from her contented expression that she was at peace which could only be i reasoned if my message had been received and understood in the way i had intended at least she was not sick with worry over me as i watched the door behind her opened and she halfturned in her chair the visitor approached and she smiled i could not see who it was but as the other came near she reached out with one hand in hers he put the other on her shoulder and settled himself on the arm of the chair she turned her head to the hand at her shoulder and brushed it with her lips i knew then who it was maelwys this so unnerved me that i lost the image it dissolved back into the flames and was gone i was left with a throbbing head and a question what did it mean it was not the shock of seeing my mother with maelwys that was logical enough indeed it made perfect sense that she should return to winter in maridunum while the search for me went on rather it was seeing her affection for another affection which heretofore had been reserved for me alone this too was logical after all but that did not make it easier to accept it is always a humbling thing to discover your own insignificance in the grand design i puzzled on the meaning of what i had seen for several days before giving it up the important thing was that my mother was cared for and that she was not overwrought for me i saw other things other places more and more often now i recognized what i saw blaise wrapped in his cloak and sitting on a hill staring up at the night sky priest dafyd and my grandfather avallach hunched headtohead over a chessboard elphin stropping a new sword other times i did not know what i saw a narrow rocky glen with a spring bubbling out of a cleft in a hill a girl with ravendark hair lighting a rushlamp with a reed a noisome smokedark hall filled with glowering drunken men and snarling dogs always it ended the same way the image dissolving in the flames fading into red heat and white ash i had no idea whether what i saw was happening had already happened or was yet to happen ah but that would come in time that too would come gernyfhain taught me other things in those dark winter days she was pleased to have someone to tell the things she had stored up over a lifetime and i was happy to mine that rich store she must have known that her work was impermanent that i would leave one day taking all with me still she gave freely perhaps she also knew the value i would one day place on the knowledge i was given when spring came again to the island of the mighty the fhain travelled back to the south they chose a rath in a different place hoping for better grazing than they had had the previous year our summer place was not far from the wall where the mountains enfold hidden valleys and settlements are rare twice that summer when i rode hunting with teirn we saw troops hurrying along the ancient ridge ways crouching beside our ponies we watched them pass and i sensed the upheaval in those troubled spirits like a disturbance in the air i felt the rolling churning chaos as they marched by that was not the only indication i had of the great and terrible events proceeding along their ordained courses in the world of men i also heard the voices this began soon after the second sighting of the troops we were returning to the rath with the days kill and had stopped to allow the ponies to drink from a stream the sun was standing low the sky was aglow with yellow flame i drooped my arms across my ponys neck we were both sweating and tired there was not a breath of wind in the glen and the blackflies were thick and bothersome i was simply resting watching the sunlight dance on the rippling water when the buzz of the flies seemed to form itself into words make them understand nearer now than ever few years perhaps southeast lindum and luguvallium are with us bide constantius it will not be for ever the words were spoken softly a mere whisper on the breeze but there was no breeze the air was dead i looked across at teirn to see if he heard it too but he remained squatting at the waters edge cupping water to his mouth if he heard anything he gave no sign six hundred is all orders my friend orders imperator more in tribute this year than last mithras help us bleed us dry here is the seal take it then it is agreed cannot turn aside ave imperator the words came in gasps and snatches many different voices overlapping one another in a gabble of confusion but they were voices and i had no doubt that somewhere far or near the words had been spoken although there was no sense to what i heard i knew from the tone that a thing of momentous import was taking place i thought about this for a long time that night and after what did it mean what could it mean but that i regret i was not to discover until much later not that i could have done anything about it i was very much a part of hawk fhain now i had altogether stopped thinking about running away having come like gernyfhain to believe that my stay with the hill folk was meant to be perhaps i was not the gift they thought i was indeed they were a gift to me for i was learning much that would stand me in good stead the rest of my life thus it is no simple matter to describe my sojourn among the people of the hawk even for me the words i speak show themselves hollow broken things beside the brimming reality that lives in my heart the colours autumn fern like copper shining from the fire and in the spring whole mountainsides clothed in imperial purple greens as tender and fresh as the dawn of creation rich as gods own idea of green the myriad shifting blues of sea and sky and running water the matchless white of snow newfallen the grey of lowering thundercloud the excellent black of nights soft wing and more sunbright days of infinite light and pleasure starbright nights of deep deep slumber seasons of goodness and right each moment etched in elegant symmetry upon the soul the slow earth moving through its inexorable cycle of birth and rebirth keeping faith with the creator fulfilling its ancient and honourable promise great light i could not have loved you better than i did then for i saw and i understood i saw the order of creation i understood the rhythm of life the hill folk lived close to the order they felt the rhythm in their blood they had no need to understand it they were part of it as it was part of them but through them i learned to feel it through them i became part of it too my kinsmen my brothers the debt that i owe you can never be repaid but know that i have never forgotten you and as long as men hear and remember the old stories as long as words have meaning you will live even as you live in my heart i stayed with the hawk people another year one more winter and spring and summer one more beltane and lughnasadh and then i knew it was time for me to return to my own as the days began to shorten i grew uneasy a light flutter of the stomach when i looked to the south a slight lift of the heart when i thought of home the tingle of expectation that in faroff courts the future substance of my life was being shaped that somewhere someone was waiting for me to appear i endured these various sensations in silence but gernyfhain knew she could tell that my time was short and one night after supper called me outside i took her arm and we walked in silence up the hill to stand in the stone circle she squinted up at the twilight sky and then at me myrddinbrother you are a man now i waited for what she had to say you will leave fhain i nodded soon she smiled a smile so sweet and sad that it pierced my soul with its tenderness go your way wealth of my heart tears rose to my eyes and my throat tightened i cannot leave without your song in my ears gernyfhain that pleased her will sing you home myrddinwealth will be a special song she began composing it that night vrisa came to me the next day she and gernyfhain had been talking and she wanted me to know that she understood you would make good a husband myrddinbrother i am a good wife that was true she would have been a good wife to any man i do thank you vrisasister but i turned my eyes to the southern hills needs must go back to your tallfolk rath she sighed then taking my hand raised it to her lips kissed it and placed it against her breast beneath the warmth of her soft flesh i could feel the beating of her heart we are alive myrddinbrother we are not skyfolk or ancient ones that have no life be we blood and bone and spirit firstborn of mothers childwealth she nodded solemnly covering my hand with both of hers you know this now indeed i never doubted it she was so beautiful yes and so alive so much a part of her world that i was tempted to stay and become her husband quite possibly i would have too but the road stretched out before me and i could already see my self on it i kissed her and she smiled brushing back a lock of black hair i will carry you in my heart always vrisasister i told her three nights later we celebrated samhain night of the peace fire thanking our parents for the blessing of a good year as the moon crested the hills gernyfhain lit the bonfire in the stone circle and i saw other fires on other distant hilltops round about we ate roast lamb and garhc and wild onions and there was much talking and laughing and i sang them a song in my own tongue which they enjoyed even though they understood nothing of it i wanted to leave them with something of my own when i finished gernyfhain rose and paced slowly around the bonfire three times in a sunwise circle she came to stand over me and stretched her hands over my head listen people of the hawk this is the leaving song for myrddinbrother she raised her hands to the moon and began to sing the tune was the old changeless melody of the hills but the words were newly composed in my honour recounting my life with the fhain she sang it all the night i had come to them and my near sacrifice my struggles with their language our firelight lessons together the incident with the tallfolk the herding the lambing the hunting the eating the living when she finished all sat in quiet respect i rose to my feet and embraced her and then one by one the fhain came to say farewell each taking my hands and kissing them in blessing teirn gave me a spear he had made and nolo presented me with a new bow and a quiver of arrows saying do take this myrddinbrother you will need it on your way i do thank you mainbrother nolo i will use it gladly elac was next myrddinbrother as you are big as a mountain in truth i had grown in my time with them and now towered over them all you will be cold in winter do take this cloak he wrapped a handsome wolfskin cloak around my shoulders i do thank thee fhainbrother elac i will wear it with pride vrisa came last she took my hands and kissed them you are a man now myrddinbrother she said softly you will need good gold for a wife she removed two golden bracelets from her arm and placed one on each wrist and then hugged me close if she had asked me to stay i would have done so but the matter was settled she and the other women slipped away among the standing stones and in a little while the men went to them so that their eager love making would ensure another fruitful year i returned to the rath with gernyfhain who offered me a blessing cup of heather beer which i drank and then went to sleep heavyhearted i left my hill folk family the next morning they stood outside the rath and waved me away the dogs and children running alongside my black pony as i made my way down the hill i came to the stream in the valley where the children and dogs stopped for they would not cross the water and i looked back to see that the fhain had vanished all that remained was the hilltop and the grey sunless sky beyond i was in the tallfolk world once again eight i travelled south and east hoping to strike the old roman road that extended north of the wall as far as arderydd or farther for all i knew this would lead me to deva city of legions in the north and the mountains of gwynedd and the place where i had last seen my people i had no better thought than to return to the hills and glens around yr widdfa where i had last seen the men searching for me i never doubted whether there would be anyone there i was certain of it as i was certain of the sun rising in the east they would search until they received word or sign that i was dead without that they would search for ever i had only to cross their path time was growing short however one day soon the weather would break and the searchers would return home for the winter already the days were crisp and the sunlight thin if i did not find them soon i would have to ride all the way to maridunum a most difficult and dangerous journey for one alone by riding from before sunrise until well after sunset i was able to traverse the wide empty land with some speed the main had come far north with the seasons i did not realize how far north until i saw the great celyddon forest raising its black hump before me on the horizon apparently we had skirted the forest to the west a year ago when travelling to winter quarters and though the quickest route to the south lay through the forests dark heart i was loathe to take it but time was no friend to me with winter coming on so with my spear in my hand and my bow ready i turned towards the forest trackhoping to pass through in three or four days the first day and night proved uneventful i rode along pathways aflame with autumn colour burning reds and golds yellows that glowed in the falling light only the swish and crack of my ponys hooves in the dry leaves and the occasional shriek of a bird or natter of a squirrel marked our passing among the great stands of oak and ash their irondark boles hoary and bearded with green moss spreading elm and rowan slender pine and massive yew silence reigned and gave us to know with every step that we were intruders there the second day began with a mist that turned to a weepy sodden rain which soon drenched me to the skin wet and cold i pursued my miserable way until i came to a ferngrown clearing beside a racing stream as i sat deciding where to cross the rain stopped and the cloudcover thinned so that the sun appeared a pale white disk i slid from the ponys back led it through the pungent fern to the waters edge and gave it to drink i suppose the clearing with its patch of sky above seemed a convivial place so i started shrugging off my soaking clothing and spreading it on the rocks along the streambed in anticipation of the sun and i was not disappointed but as the clouds parted i heard a crashing in the wood nearby i dropped instinctively into my invisible posture the noise increased coming directly towards me and of course i recognized the sound a boar in full flight with a hunter right behind a moment later a gigantic old tusker broke through the underbrush not a dozen paces upstream the great beasts hide was crisscrossed with scars marked in white tufts against the bristling black and like the battlechief that it was the fearsome creature did not pause in its heedless headlong flight but plunged straight into the water thrashed across in a frothing spray and disappeared into the wood on the other side right behind came the rider the instant the horse cleared the underbrush and leaped to the bank the sun broke through the swiftscattering cloud and a shaft of light struck like a spear heaved from on high illuminating a most unusual sight a mount the colour of grey morning mist a handsome animal longlegged and graceful by appearances more hart than horse white mane flying nostrils flared to the scent of the boar and a rider slender and fierce eyes wide with the excitement of the chase hair like midnight streaming unbound behind the sun striking the polished facets of a silver breastplate slender arm hefting a long silver boarspear so thin it appeared a frozen moonbeam caught in her hand in an instant i knew this hunter to be the ravenhaired girl i had seen while firegazing a heartbeat later i doubted whether i had seen her at all for the horse gathered its legs and leaped the stream as lightly as a bird taking flight horse and rider landed on the opposite shore and disappeared into the greengrowth on the other side hot on the trail of the boar if not for the sound of the continuing chase i might have dreamed them but as the crackling and thumping of the hunt receded into the wood i snatched up my clothes and threw them on again led my pony across the stream and rode after the trail was not at all difficult to follow still they moved surprisingly fast for i did not catch another glimpse of hunter or game until nearly tumbling over them in a grassy hollow in the dim forest the huge boar lay on its belly legs collapsed under it the slender shaft protruding through the massive hump of its shoulder into its chest where the leafshaped blade had cleft its heart the great tusks were curved and yellow the cunning little eyes glittered bright with bloodlust the girl still sat her mount and the grey horse snorted its triumph and raked the ground with a delicate forehoof she did not turn to me at first although i surely made a fearful din as i burst blindly through the yew hedge her attention was absorbed in the kill it was a prize worthy of a champion and no mistake mind i have seen boars of all sizes and i also have seen experienced spearmen quail at the sight of a charging tusker but i have never seen a boar so big nor a maid so coolly composed was it courage or arrogance the exultant glimmer in her eye the set of her jaw the regal posture there was power in every comely line of her i was in the presence of a woman however young she could not have been above fifteen summers who chanced everything quailed at nothing admitted no defeat only when she had drunk deep of the sight of her kill did she deign to notice me you intrude stranger her speech after the singing hill folk tongue sounded odd in my ears but i understood for it was very like the speech of llyonesse i inclined my head accepting her appraisal forgive me i am indeed a stranger that she pointed out is not your transgression she crooked a leg over her mount and slipped to the ground then walked to the boar and stood gazing at it with pleasure this one fought well i do not wonder by the look of him many have tried to bring him down and failed this pleased her i did not fail she loosed a wild war whoop of sheer pleasure the cry echoed through the wood and faded whereupon she turned to me what do you here her manner implied that the entire forest belonged to her as you see i am a traveller as i see you are a dirty boy in reeking wolfskins she wrinkled her nose imperially you do not look a traveller tome accept that i am i believe you she turned suddenly and placing a booted foot against the boars shoulder hump pulled sharply on the spear and drew it out the silver shaft dripped dark red blood she observed this for a moment and then began wiping the spear on the beasts hide that skin will make a fine trophy i remarked stepping closer she levelled the spear at me so would yours wolf boy is everyone hereabouts as illmannered as you she laughed a light fillip in the air i am admonished her tone denied her words entirely she returned the spear to its holder on her saddle will you stand there like a stump or will you help me carry back my kill truly i did not see how the monster before us could be carried back without a wagon nor heaved into a wagon without the help of halfdozen brawny men certainly neither horse could carry the weight but the girl was not dismayed she removed a hand axe from behind her saddle and directed me to start felling a few of the slender birches from a stand across the hollow from where we stood i did as i was told and together we began hacking the branches from the trees and lashing the clean poles together with rawhide strips to form a crude litter the work went quickly and pleasantly for me for i had the opportunity of observing her graceful body in motion she had removed her silver breastplate while i was cutting the trees and now worked beside me in a light blue riding tunic and checked kilt of the sort that many of the remote hill tribes wore her boots were soft doeskin and at her wrists and throat were narrow silver bands set with blue stones longlimbed and slender her skin smooth and delicate as milk she nevertheless gave herself to her work with a passion i suspected she lavished on all things that happened to capture her interest we spoke little while we worked enjoying the challenge of the task before us and the rhythm of two people working as one once the poles of the litter had been secured then came the difficult part rolling the enormous carcass onto the platform i brought my black hill pony to the boar and we looped a length of rawhide around the boars forelegs and with one of the remaining poles as a lever halfdragged and halfrolled the huge carcass into position grunting sweating heaving at the dead weight with all our strength we nudged the carcass onto the utter where it slipped and rolled sideways onto my leg the girl laughed and leaped to help me as she bent near i drank in the warm womanscent and the light aromatic oils she used as perfume the touch of her hands on my skin was like a dancing flame against the flesh i struggled free of the boar and we continued the laborious task some while later we finished tying down the beast then stood looking at one another for a moment both flushed with pride and exhaustion at our accomplishment and dripping sweat after a hunt she told me amusement glimmering in eyes the colour of cornflowers i am accustomed to swim she paused and looked me up and down you could do with a bath as well but she lifted a palm equivocally it is getting late in truth the prospect of bathing with this beautiful young woman sent a ripple of pleasure through my loins i did not think it so late but she moved away without waiting for my answer mounted her horse and rode a few paces before turning back to me well i suppose you have earned a crust by the fire and a pallet in the stable you had better follow me wolf boy i needed no second invitation and likely would not have received one anyway so took up my reins and followed getting the boar home was far from easy fording the stream was the hardest part but as the sun was touching the western hills we came within sight of a large settlement at least twenty fairsized timber dwellings crouching along the shores of a deep mountain lake on a mound at one end of the lake stood a palace consisting of a great hall stable kitchen granary and temple all of timber we rode down to this settlement through the trees and the people came running to greet us upon seeing the boar they shouted and gave the lady loud acclaim which she accepted with such poise and modesty that i knew her noble born her father ruled here and these were his subjects and his beloved daughter for loved she was i could see it on the faces of those around us she was their treasure as this was so i received a rather cooler reception those who noticed me at all frowned and some pointed at me rudely they did not like seeing a filthy foundling beside her indeed with very little encouragement they would have taken up the stones at their feet and pelted me away did i blame them no i did not i felt decidedly unworthy riding beside her and looking at myself through their eyes well trotting beside their beautiful lady on a shaggy pony was an even shaggier boy dressed in leather and wolfskin looking like something fresh out of the northern wastes which i was foreign and certainly not to be trusted but the girl did not seem to mind and took no notice of my unease i looked this way and that with a growing feeling that it had been a mistake to come that i should have fared better in the forest we rode through the settlement along the shingle beside the lake and up the mound to the palace the villagers did not come up but remained a respectful distance away what is this place i asked as we dismounted servants were hurrying towards us this is my fathers house explained the girl who might your father be you will see soon enough here he comes i turned to where she looked and saw a giant strolling towards me with great groundeating strides he was as tall as any two of the hill folk taller even than avallach and broadly built as well with heavy shoulders a thick chest and limbs like yew stumps he had long brown hair which he wore pulled back tight and bound in a golden ring his soft boots came to his knees and his kilt bore the redandgreen checked design of the north two enormous black wolfhounds bounded at his heels my father said the girl and ran to meet him he caught her up and lifted her off her feet in a fearsome embrace i winced fearing the cracking of her ribs but he set her down lightly and came to where i stood the giant took one glance at the boar his eyes grew round and he opened his mouth and laughed so that the timbers of his house shivered and the sound echoed from the treeclad hills well done lass he clapped hands the size of platters well done my darling girl he kissed her and turned suddenly to me and who might you be lad he helped me with the boar father the girl explained i told him he could have supper and a bed for his trouble it was no trouble i managed to squeak out so that is the way of it the man said neither pleased nor displeased as yet but certainly reserving judgement do you have a name then merlin i replied the word sounded strange in my ears myrddin ap taliesin among my own people you have people do you was he mocking me then why are you not with them i was taken by hill folk and was not able to escape until now i said hoping that answer would save further explaining my people are in the south i am going to them now where in the south in the summerlands and llyonesse the man frowned so you say i do not recall hearing of such places myself if places they are what name do your people go by cymry i told him them i have heard of at least he nodded looking at my silver tore and the gold bracelets vrisa had given me they are your fathers people yes my grandfather is lord elphin ap gwyddno garanhir who was king of gwynedd was he lost his lands in the great conspiracy and moved south the huge man sighed sympathetically a very bad time that aye but still he was lucky many a man lost more his voice was a rumble like wagon wheels going over a wooden bridge your father is a prince then my father died soon after i was born what of your mother you did not mention her this was odd i had never had so much attention paid to my lineage but then i had never before accepted lodging from a kings daughter my mother is chads a princess of llyonesse my grandfather is king avallach of ynys avallach he nodded approvingly but his eyes narrowed he seemed to be weighing me perhaps calculating how far he could throw me into the lake and how big the splash at last he said royalty on both sides then good enough his eyes slid past mine to his daughter and then to the carcass of the boar which his men were gutting on the spot look at this now have you ever seen a finer prize we will feast on it this time tomorrow with that the remarkable man turned and strode back to the great hall the dogs trotting after him my father likes you wolf boy you are welcome here am i i have said so you know all about me and i do not even know your name or that of your father or where i have come or she smiled slyly so inquisitive it is common courtesy where i come from you seem to come from everywhere and nowhere nevertheless bowing her head imperiously she said i am ganieda my father is custennin king of goddeu in celyddon my greetings to the both of you our greetings to you myrddin ap taliesin she replied nicely will you come in i will i inclined my head she laughed the sound liquid silver on the evening air then drawing her arm through mine she pulled me away my heart nearly burst i slept that night on goosedown in a sleeping room next to custennins great hall i shared the room with some of the kings men who treated me politely but accorded me no special favour the next morning they rose and went about their various duties and i got up and went into the great hall now empty but for the servants carrying off last nights food scraps and spreading fresh rushes over the floor no one took notice of me so i drifted out into the yard and sat down on the ledge of the well and dipped out a drink from a leather cannikin the water was ice cold and sweet and as i drank i thought of the journey before me that day and found the prospect a good deal less agreeable than it had been the day before the dipper was still at my lips when i felt cold fingers on my neck i hunched my shoulders and squirmed round ganieda laughed and slipped from my reach you must have been very tired she said to stay so long abed and you a traveller in a hurry you are right ganieda i liked the feel of her name on my tongue she was wearing her blue tunic and kilt of the day before but had donned a long fleecelined cloak against the morning chill the silver at her throat and wrists gleamed and her black hair had been brushed so that it shone i slept well for the first time in many days and as a consequence i have slept too long obviously you are exhausted she volunteered matteroffactly in which case you cannot possibly leave today leave tomorrow when you are better rested that makes much better sense she stepped shyly forward although there was nothing at all shy about her i have been thinking she said seriously not too seriously mind you for solemnity was no great pan of her nature either what lovely eyes your eyes myrddin yes i could feel the colour rising to my cheeks they are gold wolfs eyes hawks eyes i have never seen eyes like this in a human being you flatter me lady i replied stiffly was this what she had been thinking she settled herself on the stone ledge beside me is it far where you are going far enough i nodded slowly how far as far as may be oh she fell silent chin in her hand elbow resting on her knee would it make a difference if it were not so far ganieda shrugged perhaps somehow i laughed ganieda tell me what is in your mind what have you been thinking i tarry with you here while i should be saddling my horse and bidding celyddon farewell the last word caught in my throat ganieda winced you do not know your way through the forest you need someone to show you i found my way thus far without a guide i found you without a guide blind luck she answered gravely my father says that it is dangerous to trust in luck too much i agree good then you will stay as much as i would like to i cannot her face clouded and i swear the sunlight dimmed why not i do have a long way to go i explained winter is fast approaching and the weather will not hold if i do not wish to find my death frozen on a high mountain track somewhere i must move along quickly is it so important your going home she asked glumly it is and i began to tell her how it was that i came to be journey ing through the forest ganieda was fascinated i told her much more than i intended and would have gone on speaking just to have her remain beside me listening but as i was explaining the way the hill folk moved with the seasons a horse came pounding up the slope of the mound towards us ganieda leapt to her feet and ran to meet the rider who swung down from the saddle to kiss her i stood slowly disappointment scooping me hollow like a gourd envy twisting like a knife in my gut the stranger had his hand loosely round her shoulder as they came towards me ganiedas smile was as luminous as the love between them i was sick with jealousy myrddin my friend she said as they came up at least i was acknowledged as a friend which seemed to indicate some slight improvement in my status i want you to greet my i regarded the weasel who had stolen ganiedas affection he was not much to look at a big overgrown youth who gazed out at the world through large unconcerned eyes the colour of hazel wands his long legs terminating in great flat feet taken altogether he was a pleasantenough fellow and not more than four or five years above my age i judged still though he had height weight and reach on me i would have fought him willingly and without hesitation if ganieda had been the prize but the contest was over and he had won her there was nothing i could do but smile stupidly and gnaw my heart with envy these thoughts went through my head as ganieda finished saying my brother gwendolau her brother i could have kissed him what a handsome intelligent fellow o happy world with such men hi it instantly he improved enormously in my estimation and i gripped his arms in the old greeting gwendolau i greet you as brother and friend he grinned sunnily i am your servant myrddin wylt he laughed and flicked the edge of my wolfskin cloak with a finger merlin the wild his joking title made my flesh crawl i heard in it the echo of something sinister and dark the eerie feeling passed like an arrow through a nightdark wood as he clapped me on the back ganieda explained myrddin is travelling south soon his people are there he has been living with the bhean sidhe in the north really gwendolau appraised me curiously that explains the wolfskins at least but how did you manage to survive my god was with me i offered i was treated well gwendolau accepted this with a goodnatured nod then dismissing the subject glanced at his sister is father here he rode out early this morning saying he would return before sunset you are to wait for him ahh he looked distracted then shrugged well it cannot be helped at least i can rest until he returns myrddin i give you good day i am for my bed he returned his horse and led the hardridden animal across the yard to the stable he has ridden far i asked yes there is trouble on the western border of our land gwendolau has been warning the settlements round about what kind of trouble indeed is there more than one kind of trouble it is late in the year for raiding not for the scotti they come across the narrows it takes less than a day and they row their leather boats up the annan right into the very forest besides it makes more sense to raid in autumn when all the harvests have been gathered in her words pulled me back into the world of swords and sharp conflict i shivered at the thought of hot blood on cold iron i looked down to the lake mirroring blue heaven in its depths and there i saw the image of a mighty man wearing a steel war helm and breastplate his throat a black wound i recognized the man and shivered again if you are cold we might go in to the fire no ganieda i am not cold i shook my head to purge the disturbing image if you will walk with me to the stable i will leave now she frowned and at that moment a raindrop splattered her cheek she held out her hand and another drop splashed into her palm it is raining she observed triumphantly you cannot ride in the rain also we will roast the boar tonight and as you helped bring it back you must help eat it in truth there was but a single dark cloud overhead but the thought of the cold wet road ahead appealed little just then i did not want to leave so i allowed myself to be persuaded to stay ganieda tugged me back into the hall to break fast on stewed meat turnips and oatcakes she did not leave my side all day but undertook to engage me in games and music there was a chessboard with carved pieces and she had a lyre and had learned how to play both with skill as if to make me forget my journey the day sped like a hart in flight and when i looked out through the door of the hall the sky was alight in the west the sun through the grey clouds edging the hillline with amber my horse needs a days rest i told myself it is no bad thing to linger here a day but no longer than that i resolved a bit late i admit for it was not until i saw the sun setting that i realized that my indecision had cost me a day a pleasant day it is true but a day nonetheless with the setting sun king custennin returned from his errands he burst into the hall fresh from the saddle his hair and cloak flying ganieda ran to him and he gathered her in his huge arms and spun her round it was clear to see that she was everything to him and why not as there appeared to be no other lady in that house custennins daughter was his sole delight merely seeing her cheered him like a potent draught gwendolau appeared a moment later dressed in a silken tunic of crimson with a wide black belt his trousers were blueandblack checked as was the cloak gathered over his shoulder and held with a great silver spiral brooch his tore was silver in all he looked the prince he was ganieda returned to me as gwendolau and her father went aside to discuss their business they spoke for some time together intense arms folded frowning headtohead in a corner of the hearth where the boar was roasting and sputtering over the cooking flame with the arrival of their lord men began streaming into the hall most of them had been with custennin but word had gone out about the feast and there were many from the settlement invited as well as they came in the king and his son broke off their discussion and the lord went to greet his guests personally embracing them heartily here is a man i thought who knows how to love his friends what passion must he devote to his enemies it is worse than i thought ganieda confided how do you know this i watched the king greeting his guests jesting laughing passing horns of mead from hand to hand the glad monarch welcoming old friends he appeared anything but hard pressed for worry i just know whispered ganieda confidentially he said nothing about his errand and went straight to gwendolau without stopping for his cup even now he avoids drink you see he passes the horn but never takes a sip yes the news is troubling there will be a council tonight it was as ganieda said and as i concentrated my attention on the scene before me i too sensed the underlying current of anxiety coursing through the hall men talked and laughed but too heartily and too loudly what have i come into i wondered why am i here at all and i began to think of those who were waiting for me far far to the south it was wrong for me to linger here but how i had stayed three years with hawk fhain and rarely felt half so much urgency as i felt now it was different now however now i stayed i suspected for a purely selfish reason i stayed because i wanted to be near ganieda without saying it directly ganieda made it clear that she wanted me to stay too ah ganieda i remember it all too well we feasted in lord custennins timber hall aflame with light and laughter the smoky smell of roasting meat bright torches eyes and jewellery gleaming goldrimmed horns circling among the gathered lords of goddeu who drank and drank despite the example of their king who tasted not a drop because of ganiedas warning i watched the proceedings with interest and i was not the only one gwendolau watched too sober and intense from his seat at the high table when the food was finished and the chiefs called for song ganieda took up her lyre and sang i thought it strange not that she should sing for her voice was beautiful to hear but that a man of custennins wealth and influence should not have a bard or two he might easily have kept halfadozen to sing his praises and the valour of his warriors her song finished ganieda came to where i sat and tugged me by the sleeve let us go from here i want to see what is to happen no it does not concern us let us leave she meant of course that it did not concern me please i said just until i know what will happen if there is trouble here in the north men may need to know of it where i am going she nodded and sat down beside me it will not be pleasant her tone was hard as the flagging at our feet almost immediately custennin got to his feet and spread out his arms kinsmen and friends he called you have come here tonight to eat and drink at my table and this is good it is right for a king to give sustenance to his people to share with them in times of peace and succour them in times of trouble some of those near him banged on the board with their cups and knife handles and shouted their approval of the scheme i noticed that gwendolau had disappeared from the high table it is also right for a king to deal harshly with his enemies our fathers defended their lands and people when threatened any man who allows his enemy to run with impudence through his land killing his people destroying his crops and goods that man is not worthy of his name hear him hear him the chiefs cried it is true and any man who turns against his own is as much an enemy as the sea wolf who comes in his war boat at this the hall went silent the fire crackled in the hearth and the rising wind moaned outside the trap was all but sprung but the chiefs did not see it yet loeter the king cried is this not true i searched the hall for the one singled out and found him it was not difficult for as soon as the mans name left the lips of his king those around him drew away my lord it is true replied the man called loeter a narrowfaced hulk with a belly like a sow he glanced about him uneasily and loeter how do we punish those who practise treachery against their own kinsmen all eyes were on loeter now who had begun to sweat we cut them off lord we kill them loeter do we not yes lord custennin nodded gravely and looked to his chiefs you have heard the man speak his punishment out of his own mouth so be it what madness is this demanded loeter on his feet now his hand on the hilt of his knife are you accusing me i do not accuse you loeter you accuse yourself how so i have done nothing custennin glared nothing then tell me whence came the gold on your arm it is mine growled loeter how came you to wear it demanded custennin answer me truly it was a gift to me lord a gift it was oh yes that is true enough a gift from the scotti the same who even now lie encamped within our borders planning another raid there arose an ugly murmur in the hall ganieda tugged at me again let us leave now but it was too late loeter saw the thing going against him and drunk as he was decided to try his hand at escape thinking to call on the aid of his friends urbgen gwys come we will not listen to these lies he turned and stepped down from the table and strode to the door of the hall but he walked alone you bargained with the scotti they gave you gold in exchange for silence your greed has weakened us all loeter you are no longer fit for the company of honourable men i gave them nothing you gave them safe landfall you gave them shelter where there should be no shelter custennin roared babes sleep tonight without their mothers loeter wives weep for their husbands house timbers smoulder and ashes grow cold where once hearth fires burned how many more of our people will die because of you it is not my doing screamed the wretch still edging towards the door whose then loeter answer me i am not to blame he whined i will not have this on my head you sold our kinsmen loeter people under my care lie in deaths dark hall tonight custennin raised his hand and pointed a long dagger at the guilty man i say that you shall join them loeter and join them you will or i am no longer king of goddeu loeter backed nearer the door no they only wanted to hunt i swear it they only wanted to hunt i was going to bring the gold to you enough i will not hear you demean yourself further custennin stepped up onto the table and came towards him the dagger in his hand loeter turned and bolted to the door gwendolau was there with the two wolf hounds and men on either side of him do not kill me loeter screamed he turned to face custennin advancing towards him i beg you my lord do not kill me your death will be more painless than any of those who went before you this day i do not have the stomach to do what the sea wolves do to their captives loeter gave a terrible scream and fell down on his knees before his king weeping pitifully and shamefully all looked on in awful silence i beg you lord spare me spare me send me away custennin seemed to consider this he gazed down at the cringing wretch and then turned back to those looking on what do you say brothers do we spare his sorry life even before the words were out of his mouth loeter was on his feet his knife in his hand as the knife flashed towards the kings back there came a savage snarl and flurry of motion black lightning sped towards him loeter gave one small shriek before the dogs tore out his throat the traitor toppled dead to the floor but the hounds did not cease their attack until gwendolau came and put his hands on their collars and hauled them away blood streaming from their muzzles custennin stared down at the mutilated body this is what your gold has bought you loeter he intoned sadly i ask you now was it worth it he made a gesture with his hand and the men before the door came and dragged the body from the hall i turned to ganieda who sat beside me staring her eyes fierce and hard in the light of the torches he got better than he deserved she said softly then turning to me added it had to be myrddin treachery must be punished there is no other way for a king nine it is a shameful business custennin was saying and not meet for a guest under my roof to see it forgive me lad it could not be helped i understand i told him there is no need to ask forgiveness the huge man clapped me on the shoulder with one of his paws you have the grace of a king yourself indeed your royal blood tells is it true that you lived with the hill folk these last years it is true why he wondered genuinely puzzled a canny lad like yourself must have found many a chance to run away oh escape was there if i wanted it but it was for me to stay you wanted to stay not at first i told him but i came to see that there was a purpose to it what purpose then i had to admit that i did not know even yet perhaps it will come to me one day all i know is that i do not regret the time i lived with them i learned much he shook his head then this was custennin a man who saw things clearly or he did not see them at all who took direct and necessary action as with the trouble concerning his wayward chief loeter who faced matters squarely and settled accounts fairly and on time he was a king ever mindful of the respect of his people and sought to win it daily where do you go now myrddin he asked ganieda tells me you hope to reach dyfed before winter that is where my friends are my own people are further south so you have said it will be difficult i nodded the weather will break any day and winter will catch you up all the more reason to go quickly i replied yet i would ask you to stay winter here with us and take up the road in the spring that was ganiedas doing surely i sensed her hand at work in the matter she would not ask me herself but put her father up to it it would make the time go more quickly for all of us your offer is kind as it is generous and i regret that it cannot be so go then lad as your mind is made up i will not ask you to change it now three years is a long time away from home he walked with me out of the hall to the stable where he ordered my pony to be saddled he frowned as the small horse was made ready no doubt the beast is sturdy but it is not a mount for a prince perhaps you would travel more quickly with one of mine custennin gestured to his horsemaster to bring one of his horses it is true the breed lacks stature i allowed still they are wonderfully strong and suited to long journeys the prytani move quickly by day or night and their ponies carry them with never a misstep long after another horse must be rested i patted the neck of my shaggy little animal i thank you for the offer lord i said but i will keep my horse so be it then agreed custennin i only thought that if you took one of mine you would have reason to come back the sooner i smiled ganieda again your hospitality is reason enough not to mention my daughter he added slyly she is indeed a beautiful woman lord custennin and her manner does her father much credit the lady under discussion appeared just then took one look at the horse saddled before me so you are leaving i am it has been three years said custennin gently he was a boy when they took him ganieda he is near enough a man now let him go she accepted this with good grace though i could see she was disappointed well he must not ride alone send someone with him custennin considered this who would you suggest send gwendolau she said simply as if it were the most natural thing they had been talking as if i was not there at all but then ganieda turned to me you would not begrudge my brother a place at your side indeed i would not i replied but it is not necessary i can find my way and find your death in the snow ganieda said or worse on the end of a sea wolf spear i laughed they would have to catch me first are you so elusive so invincible she arched an eyebrow and folded her arms across her chest had i archimedes lever there was no moving her needless to say i had a later start than planned but also more company for although gwendolau was happy to accompany me he insisted on bringing his man baram with us saying if you find your friends i will need company on the way back i could not argue with him so would have to make the best of it i would go with better protection which was not to be despised but i would go more slowly nevertheless by midday we had a pack horse loaded with the provisions and fodder we would require we left custennins stronghold ganieda standing erect neither waving nor turning away just watching until we were out of sight two days later we reached the old roman road above arderydd aside from the blackthorn and bracken crowding thick along its lancestraight length the stone road showed no sign of ruin or decay the romans built to last they built to outlast time itself once upon the road we made better time despite the rains which settled in earnest by day we rode beneath a heavy iron sky that leaked water over us by night icy winds tossed the trees and set the wolves howling in the hills miserable we were cold and drenched for days on end so that our evening fire did nothing to warm or cheer us gwendolau proved an amiable companion and undertook to keep us all in as good humour as the dreadful weather would allow he sang wonderfully absurd songs and recounted long maddeningly intricate tales of his hunting exploits to hear him talk there was not a beast alive that did not fear his extraordinary skill he also told me all he knew of what had passed in the world of men since i was taken by the hill folk i liked him and was not sorry that he had come with me baram on the other hand was a man to keep his own counsel quietly expert in his ways a sure hand with the horses a keen eye for the trail ahead nothing escaped his notice though one would have to ask him directly to find it out often when i thought he was far away in his own thoughts i would turn to him to see a smile on his broad face as he enjoyed gwendolaus jesting by evening of the fifth day we reached luguvalhum which the men in that region called caer ligualid or more often caer ligal i was for passing through quickly and camping on the road we were so much nearer now it was hard not to begrudge every moments delay but gwendolau would not hear of it myrddin you may be able to ride like the bhean sidhe but i cannot if i do not dry out my bones will turn to mush inside this sodden skin of mine i need a wanning drink inside me and a roof that does not shed water on me all night long in short a lodging house silent baram added his terse assent and i knew i was beaten very well let us do as you suggest but i have never been to caer ligualid you will have to find us a place leave it to me gwendolau said spurring his horse forward and we galloped into the town our appearance drew many stares but we were not unwelcome and soon gwendolau who could coax even the most sceptical mussel to open its shell to him had made half a dozen friends and achieved his purpose in truth travellers were few and becoming fewer in the north and any news a stranger could bring was prized the house was large and old a mansio of the roman style with its large common room smaller sleeping chambers and stable across a cleanswept courtyard visiting dignitaries in the old days did not often travel on horseback as we did both house and stable were clean and dry and the fodder plentiful for the horses in all it was an agreeable place warm and heady with the smell of yeast from bread and beer there was a fire in the grate and meat on the spit baram said not a word but went directly to the hearth and dragged up a stool stretching his long legs before the fire with the garrison empty now the proprietor told us eyeing us curiously we do not see so many new faces in this town his own face was the round ruddy visage of a man who likes his meat and drink too well the garrison empty wondered gwendolau i noticed there was no one on the gate still it cannot be long empty did i say it was och hang me for a pict just last summer it was full to nearly bursting and there were magistrates thick under every bush but now what happened i asked he looked at me and at my clothing and i think he made the sign against evil behind his back but he answered without evasion withdrawn they are isnt that what i am saying they are gone where i asked the innkeeper frowned and his mouth clamped shut but before i could ask again gwendolau interrupted i have heard the wine of caer ligal has special charms on a rainy night or have you poured it all away since the legionaries no longer drink here wine where would i get wine och he rolled his eyes but i have beer to make your tongue forget it ever tasted wine bring it on cried gwendolau the innkeeper hurried away to fetch the beer and when he was gone gwendolau said it does not do to ask a thing too directly up here in the north men like to feel they know you before they say what is in their minds the innkeeper reappeared with three jars of dark foaming liquid and gwendolau raised his and drank deep wiping his mouth with the back of his hand he smacked his lips and said ahh a drink to make gofannon himself choke with envy it is settled we stay here tonight if you will have us the publican beamed who else would have you and as there is no one else beneath this roof tonight my house is yours the beds are not big but they are dry my name is caracatus baram brought his empty jar to the table good beer he said and returned to his place by the fire dry gwendolau exclaimed you hear myrddin wylt we will be dry tonight if a man is long on the road he might forget the comforts of a bed observed the proprietor or so i am told na on the contrary replied gwendolau we have been seven days and nights on the trail and i have thought about nothing else but a hot meal in my belly and a warm place by the fire caracatus winked and confided i keep no women here but perhaps if you were so inclined he made an equivocal gesture and crossed his palm thank you replied gwendolau but tonight i am bone weary and no fit company for women charming though they must be we have been in the saddle since first light this morning the innkeeper sympathized it is late in the year for travelling i myself would not go out unless need were very great need would have to be very great indeed to budge him from his beer cask i thought even then i doubted he would go out at all it is not by choice i answered no doubt the legionaries felt the same way about their leaving this received a sly knowing wink aye that is the truth of it long and short the tears were there tears when the soldiers left i tell you the streets were aflood with tears for the women crying husbands and lovers away a sad thing to leave kith and kin behind observed gwendolau but i imagine they will return soon enough they always come back not this time the innkeeper wagged his head sadly not this time it is the emperors doing gratian has much on his plate what with began gwendolau did i say gratian did i say valentinian scoffed caracatus the only emperor i salute is magnus maximus maximus gwendolau sat up in surprise himself smiled our host pleased with his superior knowledge proclaimed emperor last year at this time he was now we will see our interests looked to by caesar and about time too so that was what my voices had been telling me had i but known with the loyal support of his legionaries maximus had declared himself emperor of the west and had withdrawn the troops from the north there was only one reason for this he must march to gaul and defeat gratian in order to consolidate his claim that was the only way he could be emperor unopposed deep dread crept over me the legions gone they will come back you will see gwendolau repeated the innkeeper sniffed and shrugged i do not care if they return or not as long as the pica leave us alone know you we keep these walls up for a reason barams burring snore from the corner of the hearth brought the conversation to a close i will feed you sirs so you can go to your beds said caracatus hurrying off to prepare the meal food and sleep gwendolau yawned happily nothing better on a rainy night though it looks as if baram has begun without us we ate from a joint of beef and it was good i had not tasted beef for three years and had almost forgotten the savoury warmth of a wellroasted haunch there were turnips as well cheese and bread and more of caracatus heavy dark beer the meal went down well and sleep descended almost at once we were led to our sleeping places where we curled up in our cloaks on clean pallets of straw to sleep without stirring until morning we were awake with the birds and found our horses already saddled our genial host gave us little loaves of black bread and sent us away after receiving our promises to stay with him if ever we returned to caer ligal remember caracatus he called after us best mansio in all britannia remember me for once it was not raining as we started out baram took the lead as we rode out through the gates and i let my horse fall in behind there were other travellers leaving caer ligualid that morning a merchant and his servants so gwendolau rode along beside to exchange news gnawing my bread i had time to think as we rode out from the city well i thought maximus had declared himself emperor or had been so declared by the legions and now had taken his army across to gaul taken our army away to gaul a popular move apparently judging by caracatus reaction certain to please many who felt our taxes illused and our interests subverted to some greater good we never shared popular to be sure but disastrous maximus i remembered the man yes and i remembered the first time i saw him and knew i would not see him again he was a brave man and a solid and fearless general long years of discipline and campaigning had schooled him well nothing rattled him on the field he remained cool kept his temper and his wits his men worshipped him there was no doubt they would follow him all die way to rome and beyond there was the hope of course that imperator maximus could do more for us in gaul than dux maximus could do for us in britanniarum that a peace among the barbarians across the sea would provide a measure of peace for the island of the mighty it was a small hope but a hope nonetheless and not to be despised if anyone could do it maximus was the man to try the weather stayed dry for the while although as the land rose to meet the mountains the high places wore their winter mantles of white we made good use of our time and proceeded south with all speed we shared a camp for several nights with our fellow travellers the merchant and his servants he had spent the year trading along the wall east to west and now that winter threatened was making his late way back to his home in londinium as it turned out he had as merchants will travelled widely and traded with whoever had gold or silver in their hands asking neither whence it came nor how obtained cpnsequently he had dealings with pict scot saecsen and briton alike he was a placid talkative man named obricus edging into his middle years with the grace that wealth can bring he knew his business and his tales bore the ring of truth more often than not he was no braggart and did not speak to hear himself talk what is more having spent the trading year on both sides of the wall he was well informed about the movements of the legions i saw it coming said obricus poking the nights fire with a stick he did not appear at all happy to have seen it gaul is in trouble deep and dire it will not last gratian is not strong and the only thing the angles and saecsens respect is strength strength and the sharp point of a sword and that none too much gwendolau chewed this over for a long moment then asked how many troops went with him he shook his head enough too many all of caer seiont the whole garrison and troops from other garrisons as well eboracum and caer legionis in the south seven thousand or more as i said too many you said you could see it coming i asked how so i have eyes to be sure and ears he shrugged then smiled and i sleep lightly but it was no secret in any case most of the men i dealt with wanted to go could not wait in fact their heads full of the spoils to be won rank for the officers gold for the troops so it was presents for their women trinkets to take with them i have seen enough of them go and its always the same make no mistake the picti knew of it too i do not know how they knew i did not tell them i tell them nothing but they knew what will they do asked gwendolau who can say will it make them bolder they need little enough encouragement obricus stabbed at the fire but i tell you the truth when i say i will not come this far north again which is why i stayed so long no i will not come this way again maximus had gone to gaul gutting the garrisons to do it and the enemy knew it was only the presence of the legions that kept them in check in the best of times and this was not the best of times gwendolau knew it too and he shrank into himself as the realization struck home how can you trade with them he asked angrily snapping a stick with his hands and throwing it into the fire you know what they are like obricus had heard it before he replied mildly they are men they have needs i sell to whoever will buy it is not the merchants place to decide which man is enemy and which is friend half the tribes of this flyblown island are the enemy of the other half most of the time anyway alliances change with the seasons loyalties ebb and flow with the tide it will be your head on a stake and your skin nailed to the gate then you will know who your friends are if they kill me they kill their only source of salt and copper and cloth i am more valuable alive he hefted the leather purse at his side silver is silver and gold is gold i sell to whoever will buy gwendolau remained unconvinced but said no more of it i have been in the north for a while i said and would be grateful for any news of the south obricus pursed his lips and stabbed at the fire well the south is as ever healthy strong there have been raids of course as everywhere else there are always raids he paused remembering then said last year there was a council in londinium a few kings lords and magistrates came together to talk about their problems the governor met with them and also the vicarius although he is senile and from what i hear sleeps most of the time was anything decided obricus barked a laugh and shook his head oh impressive decisions such as it was decided that rome should send more gold to pay the troops that the emperor should come himself to see how terrible and dangerous the situation is here that more men and arms should be made available for our defence that signal stations along the southeast coast should be increased that the garrisons on the wall should be repaired and remanned that warships should be built and crewed in short that the sky should cloud up and rain denarii over us for a year and a day the merchant sighed the days of rome are over look not to the east lad our imperial mother loves her children no more the next day we reached mamucium now little more than a wide place where the road divides one part turning west to deva the other bending away south and east ending eventually in londinium there we parted company with the merchant obricus and continued on into gwynedd the journey should have taken six days it took many times longer what with the rain and icy sleet in the high bleak hills it is a wonder we made it at all but my companions were stalwart men and did not complain of the hardship for that i was grateful although it had been ganiedas idea i still felt responsible for them for their comfort and safety at deva the old caer legionis of the north we asked after my people no one knew anything about a missing boy or anyone looking for one we bought provisions and continued on into the mountains striking south rather than north through diganhwy and caer seiont it was further to yr widdfa but the road was better and we could search the manyfingered glens and valleys along the way nine days out from deva the snow caught us we stayed in a glen near a stream and waited until the sky cleared again but by the time the sun shone once more the snow was up to the horses hocks and gwendolau reckoned that any more searching was useless we cannot find them now myrddin nor anyone else until spring comes besides they will have gone back by now so there is no point i had to agree with him you must have known it would turn out like this why did you come i can still see his quick smile the truth always ganieda wanted it you did this for ganieda and for you but why i am nothing to you a stranger who slept one night inyour fathers house his eyes were merry you must be something more than that to ganieda all else aside i would have done it anyway if my father asked but now that i know you better i can say that i would have it no other way be that as it may i free you from your errand i will continue south alone you may still return home before gwendolau shook his head and slapped me on the back it is too late myrddin my brother we have no choice but to continue i have heard that it does not snow so much in the south and i am determined to prove this for myself very well as i did not greatly relish the prospect of wending my cold way alone i let them come with me later that very day we turned our horses south and did not look back suffice to say that the journey to maridunum was nothing like that of three years before half a lifetime before it seemed to me then it was mean and miserable going there were no roads roman or otherwise through wild cymry and we lost count of time on the trail sometimes taking a whole day to traverse a single snowbound valley or surmount a lonely frostbitten ridge the days grew shorter and we rode more often than not in darkness and in icy fleshnumbing rain gwendolaus good humour carried us on long after baram and i were too cold and exhausted to care whether we took another step and though the high mountain passes were choked with snow we somehow managed to find an alternate route when one was needed and so came at long last into dyfed the land of the demetae i will never forget riding into maridunum the town glistened under a pall of newfallen snow and the stark trees stretched like black skeleton hands against a pewter sky it was late in the afternoon and we could feel the night air settling blue and hard around us but within me a fire burned bright for i had returned three years late it is true nevertheless i had returned i hoped that maelwys was at home i knew we would be welcome anyway but i desperately wanted to see him to ask after my mother and the rest of my people to learn what had happened in my long absence we rode through the empty streets of the town and followed the trail up to the villa we were not surprised to find horses standing in the yard for we had followed their tracks up the hill as we came into the yard two servants with torches came from the hall to tend to the horses there we hailed them as we dismounted we have journeyed far to see lord maelwys i told them is he within they came to meet us holding the torches high and peering into our faces who is it that asks tell him that myrddin is here the two looked at one another do we know you perhaps you do not know me but maelwys does tell him the son of taliesin waits without and would see him myrddin ap taliesin the foremost servants eyes grew round he shoved his companion away go hurry there followed an awkward interval while we waited for the servant to come back he never did for while we waited beneath the torch the door of the hall was heaved open and people came streaming out of the hall into the foreyard maelwys leading them all he stood for a moment gazing at me myrddin we have been waiting for you maelwys held me at arms length and i saw the tears i had expected a warm reception but the king of dyfed crying for my return that exceeded any expectations i might have had and i knew no way to account for it i had met the man only once merlin the press of curious onlookers parted and maelwys stepped away the voice belonged to charis who stood in a halo of light from the doorway tall regal a slim tore of gold around her throat and her hair in a hanging braid after the fashion of highborn demetae women her white silk gown was long and her blue cloak richly embroidered i had never seen her looking more a queen she stepped towards me then opened her arms wide and i flew into her embrace merlin oh my little hawk my son so long i have waited so long her tears were warm on my neck mother there were tears in my throat and eyes as well i had not dared hope to find her here mother i wanted to come sooner i would have come sooner shh not now you are here and safe safe i knew you would come back i knew you would find a way you are here here my merlin she put a hand to my face and kissed me tenderly then took my hand we might have been the only people in the yard come inside warm yourself are you hungry son we have not eaten well for two days maelwys stepped close there is venison inside and bread and mead come in everyone come inside we will drink to the wanderers return tomorrow we will celebrate with a feast we were swept into the hall aglow with torches and a roaring fire on the hearth where the table was laid and the meal already begun another table was hastily prepared and platters of food produced my mother kept my hand clasped tightly in hers and i felt the anxiety i had lived with for the last many months begin to melt in the light and joy of reunion even as the warmth of the hall seeped into my bones gwendolau and baram were not overlooked i had no worry for them they fell in naturally with maelwys men indeed in my joy at being home once more i soon forgot all about them old pendaran maelwys father rose from his thronelike chair to greet me saying i cannot see where your wandering has hurt you at all you look a healthy young man lean and strong keeneyed as your namesake bird lad come to me later and we will discuss certain matters it was not likely that my mother would let me out of her sight for a moment that night nor for many days to come but i assured him that we would talk soon there is much to say merlin said charis i have so much to tell you but now that you are here i can remember none of it we are together nothing else matters now a great platter of meat and bread addressed me and a horn of mead i sipped the warm liquid and began to eat you have grown my son the last time i saw you her voice faltered and she dropped her eyes eat you are hungry i have waited this long i can wait a little longer after a few bites i forgot my hunger and turned to her she was watching me as if she had never seen me before have i changed so much yes and no you are no longer the boy you were true but you are my son and i will always see you the same come what may she squeezed my hand it is so good to have you here with me once more if you knew how often i thought of this moment in the last three years and if you knew how many nights i lay awake thinking of you wondering where you were what you were doing i wept for the worry i caused you i prayed for a way to reach you thats why when elac saw the searchers in the valley i sent my clothes and the broken arrow i meant it as a sign oh i took it as more than a sign as confirmation i knew you were alive and well how in the same way i would have known if you had been hurt or killed a mother i believe can always tell when they brought me your clothes i knew even though the men who found them did not want to show me the bundle they thought it meant that you were dead the bhean sidhe had killed you and were taunting your friends or some such thing i knew otherwise i knew you must have had good reason to do what you had done she paused and sighed what happened merlin we came back for you we searched we found the waterskins found where you had huddled in the fog what happened and so i began to tell her about all that had taken place since that strange night i talked and she listened to every word and the distance between us simply shrank away to nothing so that in the end it seemed almost as if i had never been away at all i must have talked long into the night for when i finished everyone else had gone and the torches in their sconces were guttering out and the fire on the hearth was a heap of red embers i have talked the night away i told her but there is still so much to tell and i will hear it but i have been selfish you are tired from your journey come you must rest now we will talk again tomorrow she leaned forward in her chair and hugged me for a long time when she released me she kissed my cheek and said how many times have i wanted to do that we stood and she led me from the hall to the chamber that had been made ready for me i kissed her once more i love you too mother forgive me for causing you such pain she smiled sleep well merlin my son i love you and i am happy you have come home i went into my room then and slept like the dead ten maelwys was better than his word for the next day there was indeed a feast the servants began preparing the hall as soon as we had broken fast maelwys and chads and i sat before the hearth in our chairs and talked about all that had taken place in my absence until the doors of the hall were opened and some of the serving girls came running in from the snow outside laughing their arms full of holly and green ivy they proceeded to plait the holly and ivy together and then draped it around the hall hanging it above the doors and torch sconces their happy chatter distracted us and when i asked what they were about maelwys laughed and said have you forgotten what day it is well it is not long past midwinters what day is it why it is the day of the christ mass it has become the custom of this house to observe the holy days we celebrate tonight your return and the birth of die saviour god yes agreed charis and there is a surprise in it for you dafyd is coming to perform the mass he will be overjoyed to see you his prayers have not ceased since he learned of your disappearance dafyd coming here i wondered but that is a far distance to come he may not make it at all maelwys answered not so far he has begun building an abbey but a halfdays ride from this very place he will be here is the shrine at ynys avallach empty once more the thought did not cheer me i loved the little round building with its high narrow crossshaped window it was a most holy place my soul always felt at peace there charis shook her head lightly by no means collen is there and two others with him maelwys offered dafyd lands for a chapel here and an abbey nearby if he would come and build them the work is nearly complete announced maelwys proudly the first of his brood will begin arriving with the spring planting a thought passed between maelwys and charis and the king rose from his chair excuse me myrddin i must attend to the preparations for this evenings celebration he paused beaming at me by the light of heaven it is good to see you again it is this much like seeing your father with that he was off on his errands he is a good friend to us merlin observed my mother watching him stride across the hall indeed i never doubted it but her words seemed offered as an excuse that is true i allowed and he loved your father her voice had changed becoming softer almost apologetic true again i watched her face for a clue to the meaning of her words i did not have the heart to hurt him you must understand and i admit that i was lonely you were gone so long missing so long i stayed here the first winter after you were taken it seemed right and maelwys is so happy mother what are you saying i had already guessed maelwys and i were married last year she watched me for my reaction hearing her say the words i felt the uncanny sensation that it had happened before or that i had known it from the first perhaps that night when i had glimpsed her in the flames of gernyfhains fire i knew it i nodded feeling a tightness in my chest i understand i told her he wanted it merlin i could not hurt him because of me he never took a wife hoping that one day are you happy i asked she was silent some moments i am content she said at last he loves me very much i see still there is happiness to be found in contentment she looked away and her voice broke i have never stopped loving taliesin and i never will but i have not betrayed him merlin i want you to understand in my way i have remained true to your father it is not for myself that i do this it is for maelwys you owe me no explanations or apologies it is good to be loved by someone even if you cannot return that love completely i am fond of maelwys but taliesin has my heart always maelwys understands she nodded once to underscore that fact i told you he was a good man i know that you are not angry she turned back searching me with her eyes her hair shone in the soft winter light and her eyes were large and at that moment full of uncertainty it could not have been easy for her to do what she had done but i felt that there was a lightness to it how should i be angry anything that brings such happiness cannot be a bad thing let love increase is that not what dafyd says she smiled sadly you sound like taliesin that is just what he would have said she dropped her eyes and a tear squeezed from beneath her lashes oh merlin sometimes i miss him so much so very much i reached for her hand tell me about the kingdom of summer she looked up please it has been so long since i heard you tell it mother i want to hear you say the words again she nodded and straightened in her chair closed her eyes and waited for a moment in silence for memory to return then began to recite the words i had heard from the time i was a babe in arms there is a land shining with goodness where each man protects his brothers dignity as his own where war and want have ceased and all races live under the same law of love and honour it is a land bright with truth where a mans word is his pledge and falsehood is banished where children sleep safe in their mothers arms and never know fear or pain it is a land where kings extend their hands in justice rather than reach for the sword where mercy kindness and compassion flow like deep water over the land and men revere virtue revere truth revere beauty above comfort pleasure or selfish gain a land where peace reigns in the hearts of men where faith blazes like a beacon from every hill and love like a fire from every hearth where the true god is worshipped and his ways acclaimed by all there is a golden realm of light my son and it is called the kingdom of summer we put on thick woollen cloaks and joined maelwys for a ride into maridunum where he passed among his people visiting their houses giving gifts of gold coins and silver denarii to the widows and those hard pressed by life he gave not as some lords give who expect to buy allegiance or secure future gain with a gift but out of concern for their need and out of his own true nobility and there was not one among them that did not bless him in the name of their god i was born eiddon vawr vrylic he told me as we rode back but your father gave me the name i wear now maelwys it was the greatest gift he could have bestowed i remember it well said my mother we had just come to maridunum he sang as i have never heard man sing if only i could describe it to you myrddin to hear him was to open the heart to heaven to free the spirit within to soar with eagles and run with the stag just to hear his voice in song was to satisfy all the nameless longings of the soul to savour peace and taste joy too sweet for words i wish you could have heard him as i did ah but when he finished that night i went to him to give him a gold chain or some such and in return he gave me a name arise maelwys he said i recognize you i told him that was not my name and he replied eiddon the generous it is today but one day all men will call you maelwys most noble and so it is indeed it is he may have given you the name but you have earned it in your own right i told him i wish you had known him maelwys said had i the power that is the one gift i would most like to give you we rode the rest of the way back to the villa in silence not sorrowfully but simply reflecting on the past and on the events that had led us to where we now stood the short winter day faded quickly in a flare of greygold among empty black branches as we entered the foreyard some of maelwys men returned from hunting in the hills they had been away since dawn and had a red stag slung between two of the horses gwendolau and baram were with them as i might have guessed they would be i realized with a twinge of shame that i had neglected to introduce my friends maelwys charis i began as they came up these men before you are responsible for returning me safely one glance at my mothers face and i stopped cold mother what is it she stared as if transfixed her body rigid breath coming in rapid gasps i touched her arm mother who are you her voice sounded strained unnatural gwendolau smiled reassuringly and began a small movement with his hand but the gesture died in the air forgive me tell me who you are charis demanded the blood had drained from her face maelwys opened his mouth to speak hesitated then looked to me for help we had to know for certain replied gwendolau please my lady we meant no harm what did he mean just tell me replied charis her tone low almost menacing i am gwendolau son of custennin son of meirchion king of skatha skatha she shook her head slowly dazedly how long since i have heard that name skatha from somewhere deep in my brain the memory surfaced one of the nine kingdoms of lost atlantis and i remembered other things avallach had told me in his stories at the time of the great war meirchion had sided with belyn and avallach meirchion had helped belyn steal the ships from seithenin the ships that had eventually landed the remnant of atlantis on the rockbound shores of the island of the mighty how was it that i who had grown up among the fair folk failed to recognize them when i encountered them in goddeu oh i had sensed something just hearing them speak had inspired a vague sensation of homecoming i remembered the feeling and at the same time wondering why i had come there i should have guessed we did not intend to deceive you princess charis explained gwendolau but we had to be certain you see when my father heard that avallach was alive and that he was here well he wanted to be certain it was important to see how things stood meirchion charis whispered i had no idea we never heard nor did we gwendolau said we have been living in the forest these many years we tend our own keep to ourselves my father was born here as i was i know no other life when myrddin came we thought he left the thought unspoken but we had to make sure my mind staggered under the weight of understanding if meirchion had survived with some of his people who else how many others gwendolau continued sadly my grandfather did not survive he died not long after coming here many others died also before him and after in those first years it was the same with us offered charis softening they fell silent then simply gazing at each other as if seeing in one another the ghosts of all those lost you must go to avallach charis said at length this spring as soon as the weather allows he will want to see you i will take you there it would be an honour lady replied gwendolau courteously and one my father would wish to repay in kind maelwys who had held his tongue all this time finally spoke you were welcome in my house before but as you are of my wifes people you are doubly welcome now stay with us friends until we can all travel to ynys avallach together it is a strange thing to meet someone from ones homeland long after becoming resigned to never seeing home again it is a singular experience mingling both pleasure and pain in equal measure grooms came to take the horses and we dismounted and returned to the hall as we walked up the long ramp to the villas entrance i saw how much gwendolau and baram looked like the people of ynys avallach and llyonesse they were of the very appearance of men from avallachs court i wondered how i could have been so blind but reflected that perhaps i had not seen the similarity before because i was not meant to see it perhaps their true appearance had been hidden from me or disguised in some subtle way that was something i thought about for a long time another surprise awaited me in the hall we trooped in to find the hall ablaze with light shining with torches and rushlights by the hundred and old pendaran standing in the centre of the hall with candles in both hands talking to a man in a long dark cloak while servants bustled to and fro on brisk errands a gust of frosty air came in with us and the two turned to meet us dafyd the priest made the sign of the cross and clasped his hands in thanksgiving and then held out his arms to me myrddin oh myrddin let jesu be praised you have come back oh let me look at you lad bless me but you have grown into a man myrddin thank the good lord for your safe return he smiled broadly and pounded me on the back as if to reassure himself that the flesh before him was indeed solid i was just telling him said lord pendaran just this very moment i have returned dafyd my friend look at you lad jesu have mercy but you are easy on the eyes your sojourn has done you no harm he turned my hand and rubbed the palm hard as the slate in the hills and here you come wrapped in wolfskin myrddin where have you been what happened to you when i heard you were missing i felt as if my heart had been carved out what is this pendaran tells me about the hill folk you deserve a full accounting i replied i will tell you all but it must wait for a time yet said dafyd i have a mass to prepare and a feast after put in pendaran rubbing his hands with childish glee we will talk soon i promised he gazed at me with shining eyes it is happiness itself to see you myrddin god is indeed good i do not believe i ever heard a more heartfelt mass spoken than dafyds christ mass that night the love in the man the grace and kindness shone from him as from a hilltop beacon and kindled in his congregation a knowledge of true worship the hall with the holly and the ivy and the glowing rushlights bright like stars light glinting off every surface warmth enfolding us love upholding us joy flowing from each one to every other upon reading from the sacred text dafyd lifted his face and spread his arms to us rejoice he called again i say rejoice for the king of heaven is king over us and his name is love let me tell you of love love is patient and long enduring it is kind never envying never ambitious for itself never putting on airs or displaying itself haughtily it boasts not never vain never arrogant never puffed up with pride love behaves in a seemly manner never rude or unbecoming love seeks not its own reward nor makes demands but gives itself withal love does not persevere to its own benefit it is not fretful or resentful it takes no account of evil done to it and pays no heed to the wrongs it suffers yet it does not rejoice at injustice but rejoices when right and truth prevail love bears all things hopes all things believes the best in all things love never fails and its strength never fades every gift of the giving god will come to an end but love will never end and so three things abide for ever faith hope and love and the greatest of these is love so saying he invited us to the table of christ to receive the cup and bread which was body and blood to us we sang a psalm and dafyd offered a benediction saying my lords and ladies it is written wherever two or more are gathered in his name jesu is there also he is here among us tonight friends do you feel his presence do you feel the love and joy he brings we did feel it there was not a single soul in that glowing glittering company gathered in the hall that did not feel the holy ones presence and because it was so many who heard the mass believed in the saviour god from that night this i thought to myself is the foundation the kingdom of summer is built upon this is the mortar that binds it together the next day dafyd took me to see his new chapel we talked along the way riding out on one of those brilliant winter days when the world gleams like a thing newmade the sky was high and clean and bright shining pale blue like fragile birds eggs eagles wheeled through cloudless sweeps of heaven and quail strutted through elder thickets a blacktipped fox slipped across the trail with a pheasant in its mouth stopping to give us a wary glance before disappearing into a copse of young birches we talked as we rode our breath puffing in great silver clouds in the cold air and i told him about my life among the prytani dafyd was fascinated shaking his head slowly from time to time trying to take it all in in good time we arrived at the chapel a square timber structure set on a raised foundation of stone on top of a wooded rise the steep roof was thatched and the eaves reached almost to the ground behind the chapel a springfed well spilled over to form a small pool two deer at the pool bounded into the brake at our approach here is my first chapel dafyd declared proudly the first of many ah myrddin there is a rich harvest hereabouts the people are eager to hear our lord the christ is claiming this land for his own i know he is so be it i said may light increase we dismounted and went inside the interior had the new building smell woodshavings and straw stone and mortar it was bare of furniture but there was a wooden altar with a slab of black slate for a top and affixed to the wall above it a cross carved from the wood of a walnut tree a single beeswax candle stood upon the slate in a golden holder that surely came from maelwys house before the altar lay a thick woollen pad on which dafyd knelt for his prayers light entered the room from narrow windows along the side walls now covered with oiled skins for winter it was similar to the shrine at ynys avallach but larger for dafyd fully expected his small flock to increase and had built to accommodate them it is a good place dafyd i told him there are far grander chapels in the east he said some with pillars of ivory and roofs of gold i hear perhaps i allowed but do they also have priests who can fill a kings hall with words of peace and joy that win mens hearts he beamed happily i do not envy the gold myrddin never fear spreading his arms and turning slowly about the room he said this is where we begin and it is a good beginning i see a time when there is a chapel on every hill and a church in every town and city inthis land maelwys tells me you are building a monastery as well yes a little distance from here close enough to be a presence but far enough away to be set apart we will begin with six brothers they are coming from gaul in the spring more hands will make the work lighter true enough but what is most important is the school if we are to establish the truth in this land there must be a place of learning there must be books and there must be teachers a glorious dream dafyd i told him not a dream a vision i can see it myrddin it will be we talked a while longer and then he led me out to walk through the unbroken snow to the pool behind the chapel i had some presentiment of what was about to happen for i suddenly had a hollow feeling in the pit of my stomach and a lightness in my head i followed the priest to a little bower beside the pool with its thin skin of ice which the deer had broken to get at the water in the bower formed by three small hazel trees stood an oaken stake with a crosspiece lashed into place with rawhide i stood for a long moment looking down at the hump of earth beneath the snow finally i found my voice hafgan dafyd nodded he died last winter the foundation here had just been laid he chose this spot himself i sank to my knees in the snow and stretched myself fulllength upon the grave mound the earth was cold cold and hard hafgans body lay deep in the frozen ground not for him entombment in cromlech and barrow his bones would rest in ground sacred to a different god the snow melted where my tears fell farewell hafgan my friend may it go well with you on your journey great light shower mercy upon this noble soul and robe him in your loving kindness he served you well with what light he had i got to my feet and brushed snow from my clothes he never told me dafyd remarked but i gather something happened on your journey to gwynedd something unpleasant or distressing to him yes it would have distressed him he had hoped to bring the learned brotherhood into the truth but they refused as archdruid i suppose he saw their refusal as a defiance of his authority as rebellion there was a confrontation and he disbanded the brotherhood i thought it must have been something like that when he returned we had many long talks about dafyd chuckled gently about the most obscurepoints of theology he wanted to know all about divine grace seeing that he is buried on holy ground it would appear he found his answer he said he wanted his burial here not because he thought his bones might rest better in hallowed earth but that he wanted it to be a sign an expression of his allegiance to lord jesu i had thought he should be buried at caer cam with his people but he was adamant look you brother priest he said it is not the ground not the soil earth is earth and rock is rock but if anyone comes looking for me i want them to find me here so here he is it was very like hafgan i could hear him saying that so he had not died in gwynedd as he had planned perhaps after the confrontation with the druids he had simply changed his mind that would be like him as well how did he die dafyd spread his hands in a gesture of bewilderment his death is a mystery to me as to anyone else he was hale and well one day i saw him at maelwys house we talked and drank together the next day but one he was dead in his sleep they said he sang for maelwys after supper and then remarked that he was very tired and went to his room they found him cold in his bed the next morning he went out with a song i murmured which reminds me replied dafyd suddenly he left something for you in my joy at seeing you i had nearly forgotten all about it come with me we returned to the rear of the chapel where dafyd had a little room for when he stayed there a rush pallet piled with fleeces and skins a small table and simple stool beside a fireplace and utensils for eating and cooking were all dafyds possessions in the corner beside the pallet stood an object wrapped in a cloth cover i knew what it was hafgans harp dafyd said retrieving it and holding it out to me he asked me to save it for your return i took the beloved instrument and reverently uncovered it the wood gleamed in the dim light and the strings hummed faintly hafgans harp a treasure how many times had i seen him play it how many times had i played it myself in learning it was almost the first thing i remember about him the long robed frame sitting beside the fire hunched over the harp spinning music into a night suddenly alive with magic or i see him standing upright in a kings hall strumming boldly as he sings of the deeds and desires faults and fame hopes and harrowings of the heroes of our people he knew i would come back oh he never doubted it give this to myrddin when he returns he told me he will need a harp and i always meant him to have this one thank you hafgan if you could see where and when your harp has been used you would be astonished we rode back to the villa then arriving in time to eat our midday meal my mother and gwendolau were deep in conversation oblivious to the activity around them dafyd and i ate with maelwys and baram who were sitting with two of maelwys chiefs from the northern part of his lands sit down with us maelwys invited there is news from gwynedd one of the chieftains a swarthy dark man named tegwr with short black hair and a heavy bronze tore around his neck spoke up i have kinsmen in the north who sent word that a king called cunedda has been established in diganhwy baram leaned closer but said nothing has been established i asked what does that mean the emperor maximus has put him there tegwr answered bluntly to hold the land they say gave it to him outright him and his tribe if they would live there and hold the land very generous of our emperor replied maelwys generous aye and crackbrained tegwr shook his head violently showing what he thought of the idea the land is empty and that is not good someone has to hold it to keep the irish out if for no other reason i pointed out cunedda is irish tegwr exploded the other chief spat and cursed under his breath and he is there that cannot be said baram if it is it cannot be good there was something of familiarity in barams spare tone you know him asked maelwys we know of him and what you know is not good baram nodded darkly but said nothing speak man said tegwr this is no time to clamp jaws and bite tongue we hear he has three wives and a brood of sons brood is right laughed baram mirthlessly vipers brood more like cunedda came to the north many years ago and seized land there since then there has been nothing but trouble yes we know him and have no love for him or his grasping sons why would maximus wish to establish him among us why not one of our own wondered maelwys elphin ap gwyddno perhaps he gestured towards me it was their land first my grandfather would thank you for the thought i replied but he would not go back there is too much pain in the place for my people they would never be happy there again once when i was quite small maximus asked elphin to go back and received his answer then that is no reason to bring in a hound like cunedda sneered tegwr take the irish to keep the other irish out mused maelwys you will have to watch him warned baram he is an old man now some of his sons have sons but he is cunning as an old boar and as mean his sons are little better there are eight of them and tightfisted to a man whether with sword or purse but i will say this they look out for their own if holding the land is what they are to do hold it they will small comfort that is muttered tegwr baram shrugged he had after his fashion spoken a whole months worth and would say no more in my own estimation no matter what tegwr and those like him might think cuneddas coming was no bad thing in itself the land had to be held and worked and protected in the time since elphin had been driven out no one else had claimed gwynedd even those who had overrun it had no lasting interest in it they cared only for the wealth it promised there could be as elphin realized no return to the past better to have a known rascal like cunedda who could be relied upon to look out for his own interests if nothing else than an unknown rascal granting land to cunedda could be a masterstroke of diplomacy and defence maximus might then more easily gut the garrison for his move to gaul having done what he could for the region by bringing in a strong clan to protect it for his part the old boar would be flattered and gratified to be so recognized by the emperor he might even mend his ruthless ways in an effort to win the respect of his neighbours time would tell the others drifted into talk of other concerns so i excused myself and took the harp to my room where i set about tuning it and trying my hand so long had it been since i had last held a harp in fact the last time had been on the night i sang in maelwys hall a beautiful instrument the harp is crafted by bardic artisans using tools and skills guarded honed and improved over a thousand years the finest wood heart of oak or walnut carefully gracefully cut shaped and smoothed by hand polished with a preserving lacquer and strung with brass or gut a wellmade harp sings of itself in the wandering wind it hums but let the hand of a bard touch those bright strings and it leaps into song there is a saying among bards that all songs ever to be made lie sleeping in the heart of the harp and only await the harpers touch to awaken them i have felt this to be true for often the songs themselves seem to teach the fingers to play after a time the feel of my fingers on the strings began to come back to me i tried playing one of the songs i liked best and managed to get through it with only a few hesitations for some reason cradling the harp ganieda came to my mind i had thought about her often since leaving custennins forest stronghold even though it had been in her fathers mind to send gwendolau with me that did not lessen her concern for me did she like her father also guess i shared ancestry with the fair folk was that what attracted her to me and i to her oh yes i was attracted to her smitten with that dark beauty some might say from the moment i saw her plunging recklessly through the wood in pursuit of that monstrous boar first the sound of their chase and the sight of the beast thrashing through the stream and then ganieda suddenly appearing in the light spear in hand eyes bright intense fevered determination shaping her lovely features ganieda of the fair folk was it coincidence had chance alone brought us together or something beyond chance however it was our lives could not go on as before soon or late there would be a decision in my heart of hearts i knew the answer already and hoped i knew it aright the harp brought these things to my mind music i suppose was part of the beauty i associated even then with ganieda already though we scarcely knew each other she was part of me and had a place in my thoughts and in my heart did you know that ganieda did you feel it too eleven pendaran gleddyvrudd king of the demetae and silures in dyfed had grown weedy with the years his muscles like rawhide cords beneath a skin of bleached vellum his eyes were keen and bright serving a mind that was in its way still alert and quick but in his last years he had become simple this he had in common with many whom age strips of guile and pretence a day or two after visiting dafyds chapel i came in from walking with my mother and found him sitting in his customary place by the hearth he had an iron poker in his hand and was jabbing at the spent logs cracking them into embers ah myrddin lad the others have had you to themselves long enough it is my turn now come here mother excused herself and i settled myself into the chair opposite him on the hearth events are galloping eh myrddin but then they always are yes i agreed you have seen a great many things come to pass in your lifetime gleddyvrudd the word meant red sword and i wondered what kind of king he had been to win himself that name more than most men true he winked and stirred the embers with the poker in his hand what do you think about maximus becoming emperor i asked curious to hear what he would say bah he wrinkled his face with distaste upstart you mean what does he want to be emperor for perhaps he thinks he can win peace for us look out for our interests pendaran shook his bald head peace so he takes the legions and marches off to gaul first thing why does he want to do that i ask you he sighed i will tell you shall i vanity lad our emperor maximus is a vain man too easily led by mens good opinion of him he is a great soldier never believe it a real soldier would stay home and protect his own and not go looking for a fight on foreign shores who will he fight over there saecsens ha he will go for gratians throat he gave a derisive laugh oh that is what we need two strutting peacocks pecking each others eyes out while the sea wolves run through us as if we were sheep in a pen if he achieves peace in gaul he will certainly come back with more troops for us and put a stop to it hoo pendaran hooted with glee do not believe it he will carve up that runt gratian and then he will fix his eyes on rome mark me myrddin we have seen the last of maximus have you ever known a man to return from rome once across the water he is gone a pity he took all our best fighting men with him he shook his head sadly as a father might for a wayward son a great pity that a very great pity he continued stupid vanity it will be his death and ours too stupid man old red swords grasp of the situation was surprisingly accurate he had lived long and had learned not to be distracted by appearances and political manoeuvring what is more he showed me that i had placed too much hope in an ambitious mans idealism but you myrddin look at you i wish salach were here he would want to see you where is your youngest son taken the orders he has dafyd arranged for him to become a priest he has gone to gaul to receive the learning he sighed it must take a lot of learning to be a priest he has been gone a long time i had never met salach although i had heard of him he had been there when my father was killed you must be very proud of him it is a fine thing to be a priest proud i am he agreed a priest and a king in the same family we are fortunate he turned his bright eyes on me what about you myrddin what will you become i smiled and shook my head who can say grandfather my use of the word pleased him he smiled and reached out to pat my arm ah well you have time yet to decide plenty of time he stood abruptly i am going to sleep now and off he went i watched him go wondering why his question left me feeling unsettled and it came into my head that i must see blaise very soon events as pendaran said were galloping while i had dreamed away in my hollow hill the world had continued turning and the affairs of men had continued apace more violent incursions by pict and scot and saecsen an emperor proclaimed armies gathered garrisons abandoned people moving on the land now i was in the thick of it and felt that somehow in some way something was required of me but i had no idea what it was perhaps blaise could help me find the answer in any event it had been nearly four years since i had last seen him and i missed him and not blaise only but elphin and rhonwyn cuall and all the others at caer cam this was not the only time i had thought about them since my disappearance but there was an urgency now that i had not experienced before unfortunately i had no choice but to wait until spring opened the land to travel once more one moon passed and then another with gwendolau and others i rode maelwys hunting runs or rambled the hills around maridunum the days were short but left long nights to enjoy one anothers company around the fire playing chess or talking also i began singing again as my skill and confidence with the harp returned needless to say my songs and tales were welcome in the hall where my father had sung so many years before in all it was a good time for resting and gathering strength for the year ahead i tried to rein in my impatience and not begrudge my inactivity but to value this quiet time for its own sake in this i was only partially successful the ferment in my heart and head made it seem as if i were standing rooted in place while the world flew by me in a dizzy race nevertheless the day came at last when we bade pendaran and dafyd farewell and started towards ynys avallach and the summerlands for me it was a journey back to another time all remained precisely as i remembered it nothing had changed or seemed likely to change ever maelwys travelled with us and gwendolau baram and some of maelwys men as escort oh we were a bold company though whether ranged along the road twobytwo as we most often were or encamped in a wooded glade in the first flush of spring the days took whig and one day just after midday i saw it the tor rising from the mistclouded waters of the lake at its feet and on the tor the palace of avallach the fisher king even at a fair distance i was struck by the strangeness of the palace the place i had grown up that the home of my childhood should appear almost alien to me struck me like a physical blow had i been so long in the world of mortal men that i had forgotten the grace and refinement of the fair folk it was inconceivable that such beauty such elegance and symmetry could fade from my mind in that tune seeing the palace in this way was like seeing it for the first time the tall sloping walls with their narrow pinnacled towers the higharched roofs and domes within the massive gateposts with their flowing banners indeed the palace belonged to another world i saw my home much the way any stranger on the road might view it when coming upon it in the mist and i understood how easily one might believe the tales of magical beings and strange enchantments was the palace itself not a thing of enchantment halfhidden in the mists remote on its looming tor and surrounded by reedfringed waters now shining blue now grey slate and troubled ynys avallach seemed an otherworldly place but if the palace appeared strange to my eyes the person of avallach did not at our approach the gates were opened and the king himself met us on the road he shouted to see me and i leaped from my horse and ran to his embrace what a reunion that was avallach had not changed i eventually learned he never would but i think i halfexpected that the home of my childhood would have changed as much as i had everything was just the same as the day i left it avallach greeted the rest of the party with equal enthusiasm but stopped when he beheld gwendolau and baram he turned to charis and she stepped beside him yes father she said softly they are fair folk also they are meirchions people the fisher king raised his hand to his head meirchion my old ally it is long since i heard that name he stared at the strangers then burst into a grin welcome welcome friends i am glad you are here come into my hall there is much i want to hear from you that night gwendolau baram maelwys and i held audience with avallach in his high chamber the fisher kings malady came on him again so he retreated to his chamber where he lay propped up on his red silk pallet face white against the dark curls of his beard he listened to gwendolaus recitation of the events that had brought them to ynys avallach shaking his head slowly his eyes holding the vision of a time and place now lost for ever there were two ships i have been told gwendolau said they were separated at sea one reached this island we never learned what happened to the other ship although it was hoped we would discover one day that is why when my father met myrddin well he thought the others had been found at last gwendolau paused then brightened still finding you is just as good i am only sorry meirchion did not live to see it i too am sorry meirchion is dead there is so much we could say to one another he said sadly did he ever speak about the war i was not yet born when he died replied gwendolau baram knew him tell me said avallach to baram for i would know it was some moments before baram replied he spoke of it seldom he was not proud of his part in it baram paused eloquently but he allowed that without the ships we would never have survived we understand that your brother king belyn was also saved said gwendolau yes with a few of his people they settled in the south in llyonesse my son maildun rules there with him avallach frowned and added there was trouble between us and it has been many years since we have spoken to one another so the lady charis has told us affirmed gwendolau she also spoke of another ship i believe avallach nodded slowly there was another ship kian my oldest son and elaine belyns queen he sighed but it like everything else was lost it had been a long time since i had thought about that lost ship kian and belyn had stolen ships from the enemy fleet and had rescued the survivors of atlantis destruction kian had turned aside to save belyns wife elaine and had never been seen again as a child i had heard of it of course but it belonged with all the other lost things of that lost world but now sitting in the kings chamber with avallach and gwendolau i began wondering anew whether that ship was truly lost might it like meirchions ship have made landfall somewhere might there be like custennins forest stronghold another colony of survivors somewhere gwendolau and barams presence made the possibility seem almost a certainty if another fair folk settlement existed where would it be found my father has instructed me to offer you bonds of friendship by whatever token you esteem he extends the hospitality of his hearth to you and yours now and for all time to come thank you prince gwendolau i am honoured avallach accepted graciously i should like to prove that hospitality for myself but as you see he lifted a hand to indicate his condition travelling is not possible for me still that must not interfere with the bonds of friendship allow me to send an emissary to accept in my stead lord that will not be necessary gwendolau assured him nevertheless it shall be done avallach turned his eyes to me what about you merlin will you serve me in this certainly grandfather i answered indeed i had been wondering how i might find a way back to goddeu and ganieda suddenly it seemed as if i were halfway there but first continued avallach turning back to gwendolau i would have you speak to belyn i know he would be grateful for the information you bring would you consider going to him gwendolau glanced at baram who as usual gave no sign of what he thought or felt i know you are anxious to return home but having come this far do not think of it replied gwendolau my father would approve and in any event it is only a small delay ah but that delay another month or more before i could see ganieda again we have tarried this long gwendolau said a little longer will make no difference and it furthers our purpose admirably oh well there was nothing to be done it was perhaps the first time in my life that i felt the cramp of kingcraft hindering my plans it would not be the last we talked long into the night gwendolau and avallach were still talking when i went to my bed and baram who never had much to say at any time had given up long ago and was snoring softly in the corner as i crept from the room i dreamed of ganieda that night and of a great hound with blazing eyes that kept me from her the next day avallach and i went fishing as we used to do when i was a child sitting in the long boat with him the sun pouring gold on the water the reeds alive with coots and moorhens brought that time back to me once more the day was cool for the sun had not gained its full strength and a fitful spring breeze stirred the waves now and again there was not much fishing done but that was never the point grandfather wanted to know all about what i had seen and done for one who never moved beyond the boundaries of his own realm he knew a surprising amount about the affairs of the larger world of course in elphin he had a constant and reliable source of news and he always welcomed the traders that happened along the way when we returned to the palace collen was waiting for his regular audience with avallach a custom begun during the long winter months when avallach confined to his litter had invited the priest to read to him from the holy text a book of the gospels which dafyd had recently acquired from rome the reading had proven so beneficial to them both they had continued it indeed the brothers occasionally said mass in the great hall for the fisher king and his people after recovering from his surprise collen greeted me warmly and we talked briefly about my ordeal among the hill folk before he excused himself to attend avallach saying you must come to the shrine when you can i will i promised and did so the next afternoon the shrine of the saviour god stands to this day on a little hill above the soft marshy ground of the lowlands in that region in spring flood the tor and shrine hill are virtual islands occasionally the ancient causeway leading from the tor is under water as well but this year the rains had not been so heavy and the causeway remained dry the shrine was much as i remembered it the muddaubed walls were newly washed white with lime and its highpeaked thatched roof only a little darker with age someone had plaited the reed thatch into the shape of a cross at the roofs crown and a fairsized singleroom dwelling for the priests stood well down on the shoulder of the hill away from the shrine but these were the only changes i noticed as i approached i tethered my horse at the bottom of the hill and approached on foot collen came out of the priests dwelling followed by two young brothers who could not have been much older than myself they grinned and shook my hands in the gaulish greeting but besides a murmured welcome said nothing they are shy explained collen they have heard about you he added cryptically from hafgan i could guess that hafgan had told them about the dance of the stones we walked together to the shrine there is a peculiar joy of the flesh that is like no other a joy that is as much longing as gladness it is i think the yearning of bone and blood for the exultation that the spirit knows when approaching its true habitation the body knows it is dust and will return to dust in the end and it grieves for itself the spirit however knows itself to be eternal and glories in this knowledge both strain after the glory they rightfully possess or will possess in time but unlike the spirit the fleshs hope is tenuous therefore in those rare times when it senses the truth that it will be made incorruptible that it will inherit all that the spirit owns that the two shall become one then in those rarest of moments it revels in a joy too sweet for words this is the joy i felt upon entering the shrine here where good men had sanctified a heathen land with their prayers and later with the blood of their veins that special joy could be found here in this holy place i could feel the peace breathed out upon this world from that other higher world above the shrine was cleanswept and smelling of oil candles and incense the altar was a slab of stone on two stone pillars it was very old the silence of the shrine was deep and serene and as i stood in the centre of the single room with the sunlight streaming in through the crossshaped window onto the altar i watched the dust motes descend slanting beams of yellow light like tiny angels drifting earthward on errands of mercy watching this i apprehended minute and subtle shiftings in the light and shadow of the shrine there was movement and flux a discernable ebb and flow to these seemingly static properties could it be that the powers dafyd described the principalities the rulers of darkness in the high places were even now encroaching on this most holy place as if in response to this encroachment the single beam of light narrowed and gathered growing finerand more intense burning into the altar stone the stone blazed where the light struck it and the shadows retreated but even as i looked the circle of whitegold light thickened taking on substance and shape the substance of silvery metal the shape of a wine cup of the sort used in a marriage feast the object was plain and simply made possessing no great value of itself yet the shrine was suddenly filled with a fragrance at once so sweet and fresh that i thought of all the golden summer days i had known and all the meadows of wildflowers ever ridden through and every soft moonlit nightbreeze that ever drifted through my window to look upon the cup was to sense an unutterable peace whole and unassailable the abiding calm of endless enduring authority vigilant and present if unseen and supreme in its strength it came into my mind that to hold the cup would be to possess inpart this peace i stepped nearer to the altar and put out my hand the light of the cup flared and the image faded as my hand closed around it there was nothing left but the sunlight streaming in through the window above the altar and my hand on the cold stone the shadows deepened and drew closer stealing the last of the fading radiance and i felt my own strength flow away like water poured out onto dry ground great light preserve your shrine and clothe its servants with wisdom and might gird them for the struggle ahead footsteps sounded behind me and collen entered the cool dark room he peered carefully at my face there must have been some lingering sign of my vision but said nothing perhaps he knew what it was i had seen indeed this is a holy place i told him for that reason the darkness will try all the harder to destroy it so that my words would not alarm him i said but never fear brother it cannot succeed the lord of this place is stronger than any power on earth the darkness will not prevail then we prayed together i shared the simple meal the brothers had prepared and talked of my travels and their work at the shrine before heading back to the palace i spent the next days rediscovering ynys avallach as i visited once more the places of my childhood the thought came to me that this kingdom this realm of the faery could not endure it was too fragile too dependent on the strength and amity of the world of men when that failed the fair folk would vanish the thought did not cheer me one morning i found my mother in her room kneeling at a wooden chest i had seen the chest countless times before but never open it was i knew a relic of atlantis made of gopher wood inlaid with ivory and carved with the figures of fanciful creatures with the heads and forequarters of bulls and the hindquarters of sea serpents come in merlin she said as i came to stand in the doorway i went to her and sat down in the chair beside the chest she had lifted out several small neatlywrapped bundles a rather long narrow bundle tied with strips of leather among them i am looking for something she said and continued to sift the contents of the chest one of the items on the floor beside her was a book i lifted it gently and opened its brittle pages the first bore a painting of a great island all in green and gold on a sea of stunning blue is this atlantis i asked it is she said taking the book in her hands she stroked the page with her fingertips lightly as if touching the face of a loved one my mothers greatest possession was her library she had many books some you have seen but this one stands above them all because it was her treasure it was the last she received charis turned the pages and peered at the foreign script and sighed looking at me she smiled i do not even know what it is about i never learned i saved it because of the painting it is indeed a treasure i told her my eye fell on the narrow bundle beside her i picked it up and untied the lacing a moment later the gleaming hilt of a sword was revealed to me carefully but with some haste i stripped away the oiled leather and soon held a long shimmering blade light and quick as thought itself the weapon of a dream made for the hand of a god beautiful cold and deadly was this my fathers i asked watching the light slide like water over the exquisite thing she sat back on her heels shaking her head lightly no it is avallachs or was meant to be i had it made for him by the high kings armourers in poseidonis the finest craftsmen in the world the atlantean artisans i was told perfected a method of strengthening the steel a secret they guarded zealously i bought the sword for avallach it was to be a peace offering between us what happened my mother lifted a hand to the sword it was a difficult time he was ill his injury he did not want it he said it mocked him she touched her fingertips to the shining blade but i kept it anyway i suppose i thought i would find a use for it it is very valuable after all lofting high the wonderful weapon stabbing the air with short thrusts i said perhaps its time has not yet come it was just something that came to my head and i said it but charis nodded seriously no doubt that is why i saved it the grip was formed by the intertwined bodies of two crested serpents whose emerald and ruby encrusted heads became the pommel just below the redgold hilt i traced the script engraved there what do these figures mean charis held the sword across her palms it says take me up she replied turning the blade and here cast me aside a curious legend for a kings weapon by what power had she chosen those words did she sense in some way however obscurely the role that her gift would play in the dire and glorious events that birthed our nation what will you do with it now i asked what do you think i should do with it a sword like this could win a kingdom then take it my son and win your kingdom with it kneeling before me she held it out to me i reached for the sword but something prevented me after a moment i said no no it is not for me at least not yet perhaps one day i will need such a weapon charis accepted this without question it will be here for you she said and began wrapping it up again i wanted to stop her to strap that elegant length of cold steel to my hip to feel its splendid weight filling my hand but it was not yet time i knew that and so i let it be twelve so it was that i found myself once more in the saddle this time on the way to llyonesse before starting out however i managed a short stay at caer cam to visit my grandfather elphin to say they were happy to see me would be to tell a lie through gross understatement they were ecstatic rhonwyn still as beautiful as ever i remembered her fussed over me and fed me to bursting when i was not lifting jars with elphin and cuall our talk turned to matters of concern here like everywhere else men were mindful of maximus taking the purple and his departure to gaul with the troops and they had a grim opinion of what that meant cuall summed up their attitude when after the beer jar had gone round four or five times he remarked i love die man i will fight anyone who says different but he leaned forward for emphasis taking almost the whole of the british host is dangerous and foolhardy he is grasping too high is maximus aye but he always was a grasper nothing good can come of it agreed turl cualts son who was now one of elphins battlechiefs there will be much blood spilled over this and for what so maximus can wear a laurel crown he snorted loudly all for a handful of leaves they came through here op the way to the docks at londinium explained elphin the emperor asked me to join him he would have made me a governor elphin smiled wistfully and i saw how much that might have meant to him i could not go you speak no latin hooted cuall i can just see you in one of those ridiculous togas how could you ever abide it no elphin laughed i could not abide it rhonwyn hovered near and refilled the jar from a pitcher my husband is too modest he would make a wonderful governor she bent and kissed his head and an even better emperor at least i would not be tempted to go borrowing trouble beyond these shores whats wrong with an emperor making his capital right here lord elphin spread his hands to the land around him think of it a british emperor holding the whole of the island for his capital now that would be a force to reckon with aye agreed cuall maximus has made a grave mistake then he will pay with his life growled turl bone and blood he was his fathers son and we will pay with ours said elphin that is the shame of it the innocent will pay our children and grandchildren will pay the talk had turned gloomy so rhonwyn sought to lighten it what was it like with the hill folk myrddin do they really eat their children asked turl do not be daft boy cuall reprimanded then added but i heard they can turn iron into gold their goldcraft is remarkable i told him but they value their children more than gold more even than their own lives children are truly the only wealth they know rhonwyn who had never born a living child understood how this could be and agreed readily we had a little gern that used to come to diganhwy in the summer to trade for spun wool she used thin sticks of gold which she broke into pieces for her goods i have not thought of her in all these years but i remember her as if it were yesterday she healed our chieftains wife of fever and cramps with a bit of bark and mud they know many secrets i said still for all that they will not long remain in this world there is no place for them already the tallfolk squeeze them out taking the good grazing land pushing them further and further north and west into the rocky wastes what will happen to them wondered rhonwyn i paused remembering gernyfhains words which i spoke there is a land in the west which mother made and put aside for her firstborn long ago when men began to wander on the earth mothers children were enticed to stray and then forgot the way back to the fortunate land but one day they will remember and they will find their way back i ended by saying the prytani believe that a sign will tell them when it is time to return and one will arise from among them to lead the way they believe that day is soon here the things you say myrddin remarked cuall shaking his grey head slowly it puts me in mind of another young man i used to know he reached out a heavy hand and ruffled my hair cuall was no great thinker but his loyalty once earned was stronger than death itself in older times a great king might boast a warband numbering six hundred warriors but give me just twelve like cuall to ride at my side and i could rule an empire how long can you stay myrddin asked elphin not long i answered and told him of my journey to llyonesse and goddeu for avallach we must leave in a few days time llyonesse muttered turl we have been hearing strange things from that region he rolled his eyes significantly what strange things i asked signs and wonders a great sorceress has taken residence there said turl looking to the others for confirmation when it was not forthcoming he shrugged that is what i hear you believe too much of what you hear his father told him you will stay the night at least said rhonwyn oh tonight and tomorrow night as well if you can find a place for me why have we no stable no cow byre she wrapped her arms around my neck and hugged me of course i will find a place for you myrddin bach the time passed far too quickly and soon i was waving my farewell to caer cam with only one regret aside from not having enough time to spend there and that was that i had missed seeing blaise elphin told me that since hafgans death blaise had been travelling a great deal and was seldom at the caer he said the druid had told him there was strife within the brotherhood and that blaise had his hands full trying to avert bloodshed beyond that elphin knew no more the day after i returned from caer cam we started for llyonesse now i had never been to belyns realm in the southern lowlands and knew little about it other than that it was belyns realm and that maildun charis brother and my uncle lived there with him the llyonesse branch of the fisher kings family was seldom mentioned other than avallachs hint of a longstanding disagreement between them and that i had only recently found out i knew nothing at all about what sort of man his brother belyn might be or what sort of reception we might expect we travelled through country in the first blush of summer green and promising a good harvest hi time to come it was a rough country however and grazing grass was short the hills steeper the soil rocky and thin it did not boast the luxury of the summerlands or of dyfed thrust out like a ringer into the sea llyonesse with its crooked glens and hidden valleys was a wholly different realm from the summerlands or ynys avallach sea mists might rise at any time of the day or night the sun might blaze brightly for a moment only to be veiled and hidden the next the sea tang on the air made the breeze sharp and always always there was the low murmuring drum of the sea a sound distant yet near as the bloodthrob in the veins in all i would say the land breathed sorrow no that is too strong a word melancholy is better this narrow hump of rock and turf was sinking beneath a dolorous weight moody and unhappy the strange hills were sullen and the valleys sombre as we rode along our way i tried to discern what it was that made the region appear so cheerless did the sun not shine as brightly here as elsewhere was the sky hereabouts not as blue the hills less green in the end i decided that places too have their own peculiar natures like men a realm can be marked by the same qualities that characterize the soul amiable sad optimistic despairing perhaps over time the land takes on the traits of its masters so that it comes to reflect these traits as impressions to anyone who journeys there i believe that certain powerful events leave behind their own lingering traces which also colour the land in subtle ways this was llyn llyonis now known and feared by many as llyonesse i could understand the fear llyonesse was not a convivial place and the sense of brooding sorrow increased the closer we came to belyns palace which was perched on the high cliffs of the lands end facing west like ynys avallach it was a strong place highwalled gated and towered it was larger for more of atlantis survivors had stayed with belyn than had gone north with avallach in those early years belyn received us with restrained courtesy he was i think happy to see us but wary as well my first impression of him was of a man given to bitterness and spite one in whom life has grown cold even his embrace was chill like hugging a snake maildun my uncle whom i had never met was no better in appearance he was very like avallach and belyn the family resemblance was strong he had the imperious bearing and was a handsome man but arrogant moody and intemperate and like the land he lived in possessed of a potent melancholy that hung on him like a cloak nevertheless gwendolau and baram did their utmost to ensure there would be no misunderstanding of their motives they gave the gifts avallach had sent with them carefully explained their reason for coming and generally behaved as brothers long lost and lamented they must have sensed the temper of the men with whom they had to deal for they treated them warmly and before our stay was over won belyn as a friend if not maildun as well i suppose there were important matters accomplished but i do not remember them my attention was otherwise engaged from the moment we rode into the foreyard of the palace my spirit felt a heavy suffocating oppression not fear not yet i had not learned to fear it but the stifling cloying closeness of a thing wretched and pathetic i knew that this and no other reason was why i had come and i decided to make it my affair to learn the source of this strange emanation i paid the required respects and then as unobtrusively as possible made myself free in belyns palace my first discovery was a young steward a boy named pelleas i had seen lurking about as he appeared to have no formal duties i made him my ally and befriended him he was eager to help me explore the palace and i was gratified to have such a resourceful guide pelleas also knew quite a little about matters of court and was not shy about revealing what he knew all you see here was built later he told me when i asked there is an older stronghold a little way up the coast not much mind just a tower and an enclosure for cattle for two days we had been searching the extensive grounds and buildings of the palace and had not found what i was looking for time was running short gwendolau and belyn were about to conclude their business take me there i said now why not does not a steward serve a guests every need but well i feel the need to go and see this tower of which you speak we saddled horses and rode out at once though the sun was already well down on its plunge towards the sea the sea cliffs of llyonesse possess a lonely and rugged beauty looming over relentless waves that hurl themselves ceaselessly against black rock roots to break and break again in frothy seafoam on the sea side what trees dare break soil grow as stunted misshapen things thin and with twisted branches for ever swept backward by the constant blowing of the sea wind the trail to the tower hugged the lea of the hills so that the wind off the sea did not buffet us so badly but we felt the rhythmic thrumming of the waves resounding through caves deep underground the sun was touching the sea pooling light like molten brass on the far horizon when we came within sight of the tower despite what pelleas had said it was no mean thing many a british king would have considered himself blessed to own such a stronghold and would have made it all his world it was of the same peculiar white stone as belyns palace which in the dying sunglow became the colour of old bone it was squarebuilt for strength but tapered from its solid foundations to a series of rounded turrets so that as we rode towards the scarp of land on which it stood it looked like a thick neck with a face for each direction this then was where the last of atlantis children made their home on these foreign and forbidding shores it was here the three crippled ships made landfall here that avallach and belyn settled the remnant of their race before moving on to claim other lands surrounding the fortress was a cattle enclosure of stone on top of an earthen bank now ruined in many places heather flowed about the place like a second sea inundating the inner grounds and washing right up to the stone tower itself we tied the horses outside the turf bank and walked in through one of the numerous gaps in the fallen wall into the inner yard the tower gave no signs that anyone lived within but the deepening sense of lethargy of hopeless woe gave me to know that i had found the source of the oppression i sought the tower was inhabited but by what sort of creature i had yet to discover pelleas called out a timid greeting as we came into the yard our shadows leaped across the derelict ground and onto the tinted stone there was no answer to his call but neither did we expect one he pushed open the wooden door and we entered though weak sunlight streamed through the high narrow windows the shadows already grew deep in the place opposite the entrance sat a huge cauldronhung hearth with two chairs nearby but the hearth was filled with ashes and the ashes cold wooden stairs leading to the upper chambers stood at the far end of the room as i started towards the stairs pelleas lay hand on my arm and shook his head there is nothing here let us go all will be well i told him my voice sounded thin and unconvincing in the place the upper level was honeycombed with small rooms one leading on to the next twice i glimpsed the sea through an open window and once i saw the trail we had ridden to reach the tower but one room contained another stairway and this one was stone and led to a single topmost chamber i entered the chamber first pelleas did not care to have anything to do with this search and only followed me because he was not willing to stay behind alone at first i thought the man in the chair by the window must be dead perhaps had died this very day this hour but his head turned as i crossed the threshold and i saw he had been sleeping indeed he had the look of one who had been asleep for many years his white hair hung in wisps thin as spidersilk his hands crossed on his breast were boney and long the untrimmed fingernails thick and yellowed his face was that of one long dead grey and spotted with blotches that faded into his motheaten scalp the eyes that stared from his head were sunken pits rimmed red and weepy in contrast to this wraiths wasted appearance his robe was rich velvet embroidered with fantastic symbols and cunning designs in threadwork of gold and silver still it hung on him like the rags of a corpse he did not seem at all surprised to see me and i knew he was not so he said after a moment just that i felt pelleas tug my sleeve i am merlin i said using the form of my name most common among my mothers people he made no sign of recognition but said why have you come to find you you have found me he lowered his hands to his knees where they lay twitching feebly yes and having found him i did not know what to say to him what will you now merlin he asked after a moment he did not look at me when he spoke kill me kill you i have not come to harm you in any way why not the wretched creature snapped death is all that is left me and i deserve it it is not for me to take your life i told him no of course not you believe in love do you you believe in kindness like that ridiculous jesu of yours eh the mockery in his words was stinging sharp as he spoke i did feel foolish for believing in such things well yes i believe then kill me he shouted suddenly his head snapping round spittle flecked his lips kill me now it would be kindness itself perhaps it would i allowed but i will not take your life he glared at me with those dead eyes of his how not if i told you i was responsible for your fathers death his grisly grin sickened me yes i murdered taliesin i annubi killed him even as he said those hideous words i did not believe him he hated yes but it was not me he hated nor my father if he could have killed i think he would have killed himself instead but he could not this was part of the thing that was poisoning him still he knew oh yes he knew who killed taliesin you are annubi i had heard of him not from my mother but from avallach who in his stories of lost atlantis had told me about his seer the man i had imagined bore no resemblance to the shrunken wretch before me what do you want here nothing then why have you come i lifted a hand helplessly i had to come to find out go away from here boy annubi said turning his dead eyes away from me if she found you here he sighed then added in a whisper but it is too late too late who i demanded you said she who did you mean just go i can do nothing for you who did you mean i saw a flicker of something cross his face the vestige of an emotion other than hate or despair but i did not know what it was need you ask there is only morgian when i said nothing he looked at me the name means nothing to you should it wise merlin intelligent merlin hawk of knowledge ha you do not even know who your enemies are morgian is my enemy a spasm twisted his mouth morgian is every mans enemy boy supreme goddess of the night she has the hunger and the hate her touch can freeze the blood in your veins her look can stop your heart beating death is her delight her sole delight where is she i asked my voice a whisper in the fading light he only wobbled his head if i knew would i stay here pelleas behind me tugged on my arm with the setting sun i felt the doom of the place increasing and wanted suddenly to be away yet if there was something i could do i must do it yes go rasped annubi as if reading my thoughts go and never come back lest you find morgian here when you return do you need anything he was so pathetic in his misery i could not help asking belyn looks after me i nodded and turned away i had to run in order to keep up with pelleas who led the way back through the tower as though morgians breath singed the back of his neck he reached the front door still standing open as we had left it and dashed outside i was right behind him but before leaving that place i knelt on the threshold and prayed a prayer against evil then taking up a handful of white pebbles from the path i marked out the sign of the cross before the door let it be a warning i thought let her know who it was she had chosen to fight our party left llyonesse the next day but the sense of lingering doom stayed with me a very long time riding back through that cheerless land was no great help serving only to reinforce my already doleful mood gwendolau and baram felt it too but less keenly for a time gwendolau tried to keep up his usual travel banter but it became too much and eventually he lapsed into moody silence like the rest of us i did not feel myself until the tor came into view across the marshland by then just seeing the glass isle was enough to make our hearts leap in wild relief in any event my mother was waiting for me at the gate which i wondered about until i realized that she had guessed about morgian and annubi they left here on the night your father was killed she told me her voice soft and low we were sitting in a corner of the hearth and it was very late at night nearly everyone else had gone to their beds charis had waited until we were alone to tell me i never found out where they had gone but you guessed llyonesse of course it was a possibility she made a small empty gesture i should have told you i remained silent i know i should have told it all long before now but i could not bring myself to it and then you were gone so she made that curious gesture again a small warding off movement of her hand against an unseen adversary but then she settled herself straightened her back and squared her shoulders well you must know the truth after my mother was killed in that ghastly ambush she broke off but continued in a moment forgive me merlin i did not know how hard these words would be your mother was killed that is what started the war between avallach and seithenin well in the ninth year avallach was wounded in a battle i knew nothing about it at the time i was bull dancing in the high temple when i returned home my father had taken another wife lile she was a young woman who had a knack for healing and she nursed my father he was grateful to her and married her lile i do not remember her what became of her no you would not remember she disappeared when you were very young disappeared that was an odd way to put it what happened to her charis shook her head slowly but more from puzzlement than sorrow no one knows it was only a few months after taliesin was killed i had come back here to live and although lile and i were not the best of friends we had learned to respect one another there was no trouble between us charis smiled remembering she liked you merlin how is my little hawk today she always asked when she saw you she liked holding you rocking you she shook her head once more i never understood her merlin i never did what happened the last time anyone remembers seeing her was in the orchard lile loved her apple trees many of them she had brought with her from atlantis can you believe it apple trees all that way through so much turmoil and they live they thrive here such a long way from home we all are charis paused and swallowed then continued it was dusk the sun had set one of the grooms saw her riding out earlier she told him she was going to the orchard she spent so much time among her trees but when she did not come back avallach sent men to the orchard they found her horse tethered to a tree the animal was half crazed with fear its haunches were streaked with blood and there were deep scratches across its shoulders as from a wild beast although no one had ever seen anything like them before and lile of lile there was no sign she was not found nor ever seen again from that night and you never spoke of her after that i said no my mother admitted we did not if you ask me why i cannot teil you it did not seem appropriate somehow perhaps she was carried off by a wolf or bear i suggested knowing full well that was not the answer perhaps answered charis as if considering it for the first time perhaps by someone or something else you have not mentioned morgian i reminded her morgian is lile and avallachs daughter when i returned home to meet lile morgian was already three years old she was a beautiful little girl i liked her then i did not see much of her however because preparations for leaving atlantis took absolutely every moment and yet i remember her playing in the gardens and even then with annubi she was always with annubi she is not with him now charis considered this no i suppose not anyway after the cataclysm we came here and she grew up like any other child i did not pay much attention to her she had her interests i had mine but she came to dislike me for some reason and i always felt awkward and illatease with her things were not well between us and i never understood why once after taliesins people had come she tried to steal taliesins affection for herself it was done very clumsily and did not succeed of course but it set her against me charis paused choosing her next words carefully and this is why i believe she caused taliesins death i do not know how it was done or whether she meant me to die instead but i have always known she was behind it i nodded you are right mother annubi told me he was responsible but he was lying annubi there was pain and pity in the word i think he hoped to anger me so that i would kill him he wanted release but i could not do it poor poor annubi even now i do not have it in me to despise or hate him annubi is morgians creature now his misery is complete he was once my friend you know but our world changed and he could not it is sad she raised her eyes from the dying embers on the hearth and smiled weakly now you know it all my son she stood and kissed my cheek resting her hand lightly on my shoulder i am going to my bed do not sit up too long she turned to go mother i called after her thank you for telling me she nodded and moved off saying it was never meant to be a secret hawk thirteen i will say nothing of the journey north to goddeu except that it was opposite in most respects from the journey south the winter before such is the difference in travelling from one season to another avallach sent men with us as did maelwys both men were anxious to secure the friendship with a powerful ally in the north this is not to say that men in the north were not anxious for the same thing the mood in the land had changed with the seasons fear was growing slowly it was creeping across the wide empty hills to touch mens hearts and minds i saw this in the faces of those who watched us pass i heard it in their voices when they spoke i tasted it on the wind which seemed to cry the eagles are gone all hope is lost we are doomed that such a change could take place in so short a time amazed me the legions were greatly diminished true but they were not all gone we were not abandoned and our hope had never rested entirely with rome in any case always from the very first a man trusted the blade in his hand and the courage of his kinsman pax romana well and good but the people looked to their king for protection first and only after to rome the tangible present king protected his people not the vague rumour of an emperor who sat on a golden throne hi some faroff land no one knew had we grown so weak and soft that the shift of a few thousand troops made us faint with fear if we were doomed fear is what doomed us not invasion or threat of invasion by screaming saecsen hordes and their woadwashed picti minions after all there had been invasions and threats of invasions for many years now and the presence of the eagles had not prevented either so now the eagles had flown what of that was britain no longer a foe to be feared could we not look after ourselves i was convinced that we could if elphin and maelwys could raise again their warbands others could do the same and that not the presence or absence of roman legionaries was where our future lay i knew this with a certainty that increased with every roman mile north custennin received us in good spirits he was delighted to see that his investment had borne such a rich return gifts were exchanged again and again even i received a goldhandled dagger from him for my negligible part in bringing everyone together the expansive mood was such that he declared a feast for the third night of our stay in order properly to celebrate the new pledges between all our peoples as feasts go it was an elaborate affair taking fully two days to prepare and yet there was something austere about it it was the same austerity i had noticed on my first visit as in the small matter of the lack of a bard i had remarked on it then but did not know its cause now of course i did custennin despite his british name was of atlantean descent this meant that the wilder more passionate expressions of emotion were not to be indulged it was the same with avallach nevertheless the inclusion of so many britons in custennins court meant that austerity and revel achieved an amiable balance there was food enough and the smokytasting heather beer of the hill folk by the barrel how he had come by that i cannot say unless someone had learned from one of the fhains how to brew it so that the festivities were indeed vivid i seem to remember singing a great deal loudly and not always with my harp although it is doubtful anyone noticed any lapse on my part except ganieda everywhere i turned ganieda watching me her dark eyes shining waiting and watching silent keeping her own counsel in truth since our frosty reunion she had not spoken three words to me in as many days i had expected a warm welcome from her when i returned not a shower of kisses certainly but a smile a welcome cup something instead as i stood awkwardly just inside the doorway of her fathers hall fresh from the trail she merely looked at me neither smiling nor frowning but as one judging the value of a pelt offered for trade the feeling was so strong in me i made a joke of it holding my arms out and turning round slowly what will you give for this handsome hide lady apparently she did not appreciate the jest handsome indeed why on earth would any nobleborn lady be interested in a hide as dirty and smelly as the one i see before me she replied coolly i must admit that my time in the saddle had exacted a price i was not the freshest flower to bloom in the forest a bath in the lake would put matters right i thought but the exchange began our reunion uncomfortably and i thought that perhaps i had been mistaken about how it was between us or that ganieda had second thoughts about me she had after all had plenty of time to change her mind to make matters worse it was late on the fourth day before i finally found another chance to speak to her alone had she been avoiding me and that left only two days before we were due to depart once more i felt the time fleeing away so cornered her in the kitchen behind the great hall if i have said something to offend you i told her directly i am sorry only tell me and i will make it right she appeared pensive her mouth pulled into a pretty pout her brows wrinkled however her voice was cold and clear as ice surely you flatter yourself wolf boy how could you possibly offend me that is for you to say i can think of nothing i have done what you do makes no difference to me she turned and started away ganieda she froze at her name why are you doing this her back was towards me and she did not turn round to answer you seem to imagine that there was something between us it was not all my imagining surely was it not she turned to look at me over her shoulder it was not at the moment i was less certain than i sounded by far then that is your mistake still she turned towards me once more perhaps you are right i conceded are you not the dauntless maid who hunted twrch trwyth lord boar of gelyddon and killed him with a single thrust are you not the lady of this great house is not your name a delight on the tongue and your voice a joy to the ear if not then i am indeed mistaken this made her smile your tongue wags well wolf boy that is no answer very well the answer is yes i am the one of whom you speak then i have made no mistake i stepped towards her what is wrong ganieda why this coldness at our meeting she crossed her arms and turned away again your people are in the south and my place is here it is as simple as that and nothing can change it your logic is unassailable lady i replied that spun her round her eyes snapped angrily do not think to make me out a fool then why are you behaving so foolishly her face contorted in a frown you have said it and you are right it is foolish to want something that you cannot have and know you cannot have and yet go on wanting i could not imagine her lacking anything she wanted not for long anyway what do you want that you cannot have ganieda are you blind as well as stupid she asked the words were harsh but her voice was soft what is it only tell me and i will get it for you if i can i promised you myrddin i could only blink in confusion she lowered her eyes and clasped her hands nervously you asked and now i have told it is you that i want myrddin more than anything i have ever wanted silence grew to the point of breaking i reached out to her but could not touch her and my hand fell away ganieda my voice sounded painfully coarse in my ears ganieda do you not know that you have me already from the moment i saw you astride the grey stallion plunging through the stream in a spray of diamonds and the sun dancing in your hair from that very moment i was yours i thought this would make her happy and indeed she smiled but the smile faded and the sorrowful frown returned your words are kind more they are true she shook her head the light glinted on the slim silver tore at her throat no she sighed i stepped closer and took her hand what is wrong ganieda i have already said your place is in the south and mine is here with my people there is nothing to be done about that already she was thinking further ahead than i perhaps nothing need be done about it for now and later who knows she came into my arms why do i love you she whispered i never wanted to it is possible to search for love and find it more often i think love finds us when we are not even searching i told her wincing a little at the presumption of my words what did i know of such things love has found us ganieda we cannot turn it away with ganieda nestled in my arms the cleanwashed scent of her hair filling my nostrils the living warmth of her against me the softness of her skin under my hand these things made me want to believe what i said and i did with all my heart i believed it we kissed then and with the touching of our lips i knew that she believed it too well ganieda sighed this has solved nothing no nothing i agreed but what did that matter needless to say when the time came for us to return to dyfed i hesitated hoping to hold off the time of leaving indefinitely this i actually managed to do for a few days and they were happy days ganieda and i rode in the forest and walked along the lake we played chess before the fire i sang to her and played my harp we talked late into the night so that dawn found us groggy and yawning but unwilling to pan in short we did all the things lovers do and it did not greatly matter whether we did anything at all as long as we were together i see her now her dark hair braided with silver thread entwined her blue eyes glinting beneath long dark lashes the soft birds egg blue of her tunic the swell of her breasts beneath the thin summer fabric her long strong legs the golden bracelets on her sunbrowned arms she is the essence of female to me bright mystery clothed in beauty sadly i could not hold off the day of leaving for ever i had at last to return to dyfed still i put the best face on this that i could devise so while the others readied the horses ganieda and i walked hand in hand along the pebbled shingle of the lake the clear water lapped at the stones under our feet while out on the lake swallows darted and dived skimming the surface with the tips of their wings when i return it will be for you my soul it will be to take you from your fathers hearth to my own we will be married if i thought this would cheer her i was mistaken let us be married at once then you would not have to leave at all we could stay together always ganieda you know i have no hearth of my own before we can be married i have to make a place for you and to do that i must first make a place for myself she understood this for she was noble through and through she smiled unexpectedly go then wolf boy make yourself a king then come and claim your queen i will be here waiting she leaned close and kissed me that is so that you will remember who it is that waits for you she kissed me again that is to spur you to your task then putting her hands on either side of my head she pressed her lips to mine in a long passionate kiss and that is to hasten your return lady i replied when i could breathe once more if you kiss me again i will not be able to leave away with you then my love go this very instant for i would have you return all the sooner it may take time ganieda i warned her hoping to make our parting easier i pulled the gold band from my arm i held it up this was given me by vrisa my hill folk sister so that if ever i found a wife i could claim her with this i claim you ganieda i slipped the ring of gold onto her wrist and when i return i will make good my claim she smiled encircling my neck with her arms drawing me close i live for that day my love i hugged her tightly to me take me with you she whispered oh yes at once i answered we can live in a wooded bower on walnuts and gooseberries her laughter was full and free i detest gooseberries taking my arm she spun me around and pushed me towards the path leading back up the hill i will not live on nuts and berries in a mud hut with you myrddin wylt so you get on that sorry horse of yours and ride away at once and do not come back until you have won me a kingdom ah ganieda i would have won the world for you if you had asked it was high summer when we rode into maridunum beltane had come and gone while we were on the road we had seen the hilltop fires bright under the stars and had heard the mysterious cries of the hill folk drifting on the midnight wind but there was no midsummer fire for us nor did we think it wise to join in the celebration at one of the nearby settlements more and more christian folk kept away from the old customs as the paths of the new ways and the old diverged of course many of maelwys people had become followers of the christ especially since dafyds coming but there were some with us who observed the old ways so to make up for the missed revel i played the harp and sang and it came to me while i was singing watching the ring of faces around the nights fire their eyes glinting like dark sparks gazing raptly as the song kindled and took light in their souls it came to me that the way to mens souls was through their hearts not simply through their minds as much as a man might be convinced in his mind as long as his heart remained unchanged all persuasion would fail the surest way to the heart is through song and story a single tale of high and noble deeds spoke to men more forcefully than all of blessed dafyds homilies i do not know why this should be but i believe it to be true i have seen the humble folk crowd into the chapel in the wood to receive the mass in all sincerity they kneel before the holy altar mute reverent as they should be but also uncomprehending yet i have seen the eyes of their souls awaken when dafyd reads out listen in a far country there lived a king who had two sons perhaps it is how we are made perhaps words of truth reach us best through the heart and stories and songs are the language of the heart however it is i sang that night and the men listening heard a song they had never heard before a song of that same faroff country dafyd told about i had begun making songs although i did not often sing them before others this night i did and it was welcomed when we finally reached maridunum it was market day and the old stonepaved streets were awash with bleating clucking squealing livestock and their shouting handlers we were wearily pushing our way through the confusion when i heard a voice ring out saying behold you briton men and women behold your king i craned my neck but with the market swirling round the horses flanks i could see nothing i rode on again the voice proclaimed sons of bran and brut listen to your bard i tell you your king passes by hail him in all respect i reined the horse to a halt and turned in the saddle a way parted through the crowd and a bearded druid stepped into view he was tall and gaunt with his blue robe hanging over his shoulder his mantle was bound at his waist with rawhide and a leather pouch dangled from this crude belt he held his staff raised as he came forward and i saw that it was of rowan he approached the others riding with me also stopped to watch who are you bard i asked why do you call after me the way you do for the giving of a name a name is required here among these people i am called myrddin i told him well spoken friend he said myrddin you are but wledig you will be the flesh of my scalp prickled at his words i have given my name i told him i will hear yours unless something prevents you his brown face wrinkled in a smile nothing prevents me but i am not in the habit of giving my name where it is already known he stepped slowly closer the men behind me made the sign against evil with their hands but the druid ignored them his eyes never left my face tell me now that you do not know me blaise i was out of the saddle and into his arms before another word could be spoken i gripped his shoulders hard feeling the solid muscle and bone beneath my hands it really was blaise in front of me though i had to touch him to believe it he was much changed older thinner tough as a pine knot his eyes blazing like pitch torches blaise blaise i shook him and pounded him on the back i did not recognize you forgive me not recognize the teacher of your youth teh myrddin are you going soft in the head let us say that a satirizing voice from the market throng was the last thing i expected blaise shook his head gravely i was not satirizing you my lord myrddin and i am no lord blaise as you well know his talk made me uncomfortable no he threw back his head and laughed oh myrddin your innocence is beyond price look around you lad who is it that mens eyes follow when he rides by who do they speak of behind their hands what tales are winging through the land i shrugged in bewilderment if you are talking about me i am sure you are mistaken no one takes notice of me i said this into virtual silence for the market had grown very quiet as the crowd watched catching every word no one blaise raised a hand to the throng around us in the day of trouble these people will follow you to the grave and beyond and you call them no one and you talk too much and too loudly come with us you disagreeable druid and let me stop your yammering with bread and meat a full belly will make you sensible it is true i have not eaten for many days blaise allowed but what of that i am used to it by now yet i would welcome a drink to wash the dust from my throat and a long talk with my good friend that you shall have and all else besides i climbed into the saddle put down a hand to him and pulled him up behind me and we rode on to maelwys villa together chattering all the way there was the usual ceremony at our arrival the usual greetings and welcomings which i would have found gratifying but for the fact that they kept me from my friend there was so much we had to say to one another and yet now that we were together all the urgency and longing i might have felt in his absence but did not suddenly sprang into being i had to talk to him now be that as it may it was still some time before we could speak together alone indeed i began to think it had been more private in the marketplace tell me blaise where have you been what have you been doing since last i saw you have you travelled i heard there was trouble within the brotherhood what news of that he sipped his watered wine and winked over the rim of his cup if i had remembered that you were this inquisitive i would not have acknowledged you in the square do you blame me how long has it been five years six if a day why did you call out to me in front of everyone like that i wanted your attention and that of every man woman child and beast in maridunum as well apparently he shrugged goodnaturedly i only spoke the truth i care not who hears it blaise laid aside the cup and leaned towards me you have grown well hawk all the promises of childhood are being fulfilled i can see it yes you will do i seem to be growing into my saddle i tell you blaise i have seen more of this island of the mighty than bran the blessed himself in these last years and what have you seen with those golden eyes of yours hawk i have seen the mood of the people change and not for the better i have seen fear spreading through the land like a plague that i have seen as well and i can think of fairer sights to look upon he raised his cup and tossed down the last of the wine and wiped his moustache with his sleeve there is trouble in this land of ours hawk men are turning their backs on the truth they toil at sowing lies the learned brotherhood hafgan god keep his soul was right to dissolve the brotherhood a few came over to us at first but now most of them have gone back they have chosen a new archdruid to lead them a man named hen dallpen you may remember him i remember so the learned continue the councils and observances and hen dallpen leads them his voice became low with dread but hawk they are falling away they are sliding back into the old ways the very thing i have been trying to prevent what do you mean blaise what old ways truth in the heart he said repeating the ageold triad strength in the arm and honesty in the tongue this the druid kind have taught for a hundred lifetimes but it was not always so there was a time when we like all the unenlightened believed that only living blood would satisfy the gods he paused forcing the next words out with an obvious effort just a few days ago in the hills not far from here the chief druid of llewchr nor kindled the midsummer fire with a wicker man no i had heard of human sacrifice of course i had nearly been one myself but this was different darker perverse and wilfully unholy believe it blaise answered gravely there were four victims burned to death in that hideous wicker cage it sickens me hawk but they have persuaded themselves that our present troubles have come upon us because we have abandoned the old gods to follow the christ and the only way to fight powerful magic is with even more powerful magic so they have revived the murderous customs what is to be done wait that is not all myrddin bach there is more they have turned against you me why what did i then it came to me because of the dancing stones partly they believe hafgan was deluded by taliesin and induced to follow jesu therefore they have turned against taliesin but he is dead and beyond their schemes so now they seek to destroy you his heir it is suggested that his soul lives on in you he spread his hands by way of explanation you possess a power none of them ever imagined existed i could only shake my head first morgian now the learned brotherhood i who had never lifted a hand against another in my short life was now the object of hatred by powerful enemies i did not even know blaise felt my distress worry not he said gripping my arm neither fear greater is he that is in you than he that is in them eh why should they want to harm me because they fear you he gripped my arm with a hand of iron i tell you the truth myrddin it is because of who you are who am i blaise he did not answer at once but neither did he look away his intense eyes peered into mine as if he would search me out inside do you not know then he asked at last hafgan talked about a champion he called me emrys there you see i do not see at all well perhaps it is time he released my arm and leaned down to retrieve his staff taking it up he held the smooth length of rowan wood over me and began declaiming myrddin ap taliesin you are the longawaited one whose coming was foretold with wonders in the sky you are the bright light of the britons shining against the gathering gloom you are the emrys immortal bardpriest the keeper of the spirit of our people then he knelt down and laying the staff aside took up the hem of my tunic and kissed it look not with disfavour upon your servant lord emrys have you lost your reason blaise it is only me myrddin my heart beat in my throat i am not not what you said you are and will be hawk he replied but why look so downhearted our enemies are not beating down the door he laughed and the intensity of the moment passed we were once more just two friends talking beside the fire a steward came to refill our cups i lifted mine and said health to you blaise and to our enemies enemies we drank together and the old bond between us grew stronger two friends there are stronger forces on earth perhaps but few as tenacious and enduring as the bond between true friends fourteen that autumn when the weather finally broke towards winter blaise and i returned to my longabandoned lessons i studied with greater intensity now because i had the hunger and because i so wanted to make up for lost time committing the stories and songs of our people to memory sharpening my powers of observation increasing my store of knowledge about the earth and her ways and those of all her creatures practising the harp delving deep into mysteries and secrets of earth and air fire and water but it soon became apparent that in the realm of things men call magic my knowledge outstripped his gernyfhain had taught me well what is more the hill folk possessed many secrets even the learned brotherhood did not know these i possessed as well the winter proceeded one cold leaden day following another until at last the sun began to linger longer in the sky and the land to warm beneath its rays it was then that i reached the end of blaises tutelage there is nothing more i can give you hawk he told me on my life i cannot think of another thing to teach yet there are many you might teach me i stared at him for a moment but there is so much i know so little true he said his lean face lighting in a grin is that not the beginning of true wisdom i am in earnest blaise there must be more and i am in earnest too myrddin bach there is nothing more that i can teach you oh a few of the minor stories of our race perhaps but nothing of import i cannot have learned it all i protested true again there is much more to be learned but i am not the one to teach you whatever else there is you must learn it on your own he shook his head lightly do not look so downcast hawk it is no disgrace for pupil to leave master behind it happens but will you not go with me where you go myrddin emrys i cannot follow blaise he raised a cautionary finger nevertheless see that you do not confuse knowledge with wisdom as so many do well we did continue on together but not as before in fact more and more i found myself the master instructing blaise who professed to marvel at my acuity and said so many flattering things that i became embarrassed to open my mouth in front of him but in all it was a good and profitable winter for me when spring opened the roads to travel once more i rode out with maelwys and seven of his men all of us armed to make the first circuit of his lands that year we spoke with his chiefs and received their accounting of how the people of each district and settlement had fared the winter on occasion maelwys settled disputes and administrated justice in cases that exceeded the chiefs authority or acted in place of the chief to spare hard feelings he also told each chief that he wanted young men for his warband and that from now on the years increase would go to its support no one objected to the plan and in fact most had foreseen it and were only too glad to do their part maelwys showed himself an astute ruler by turns sympathetic indulgent stern unyielding but always fair and just in his dealings and judgements men resent unfairness he told me as we rode between clewdd and caer nead two points along the ring of hillforts that served to protect his lands but they despise injustice it is slow poison and always deadly then you have no fear lord for your judgements are the heart of justice he cocked his head to one side as he regarded me the others rode behind us talking idly among themselves so he spoke what was on his mind charis tells me that you have given your heart to lord custennins daughter that lightning came out of a clear blue sky i did not know my mother surmised so much or so accurately the colour rose to my cheeks but i answered him straight out her name is ganieda and yes i love her maelwys considered this and for a moment all i heard was the soft plod of the horses hooves over the new green turf then the king said have you given a thought to your future myrddin i have lord i said and it is on my heart to make my way as soon as may be so that i may go and take ganieda from her fathers hearth to my own so that is how it is between you that is how it is then perhaps on our return to maridunum we should do some talking that was all he said and indeed it was all he needed to say we arrived shortly at the next and last settlement caer nead a cluster of wattle huts and briarfenced cattle yards within sight of a small hillfort maelwys was anxious to get back to maridunum before nightfall and so we did not tarry in caer nead but conducted our business quickly by midday we were ready and left as soon as decorum allowed there was nd great hurry the distance was not far yet i noticed that the closer to home the more anxious maelwys became i did not say anything and i do not think anyone else would have noticed in any case but i watched his jaw set firm and his mouth turn down in a hard straight line the words he spoke grew more terse and the silence between them longer so i tried to discover what it might be that was troubling him and could come to no conclusion until i saw the smoke we saw it together i gave a shout just as maelwys reined up fire he took one look at the hillline before us maridunum he cried and put leather to his mount we all followed him in his breakneck flight the smoke at first a thin shadowy wisp in the air blackened and thickened into a huge dark column closer we could smell the stench of burning and hear the screams of the townsfolk the raiders had held off until they could be certain of their reception i imagine they thanked their heathen gods with every breath in their bodies upon learning that the king was away and the town virtually unprotected but they were overcautious or perhaps they had lingered too long with their boats before coming inland however it was we caught them in midst of their destruction our horses hurtling down on them without warning we took them on the points of our swords as we charged through their scattering ranks in the old market square though they fought with some courage when cornered they were no match for mounted warriors seeking blood vengeance in a matter of a few moments the corpses of a score of irish raiders lay sprawled in the stoneflagged square we dismounted and began pulling down the burning straw of the roofs so that the fire did not spread then turned to the bodies of the dead raiders to retrieve what they had stolen the town was quiet and except for the crackle of flames and the grating cry of the carrion birds already gathering for thenfeast the air was dead still that should have been a warning i suppose but the fight was over and we were already starting to cool down no one expected an ambush we did not even realize what was happening until the first spears were already whistling through the air someone screamed and two of our party fell with spears in their stomachs the irish were on us instantly we learned later that there were three big warboats in the towy each carrying thirty warriors all of these save the twenty whose blood stained the stones at our feet came on us at once with a tremendous roar seventy against seven the next moments were a terror of confusion as we ran to the horses and leaped to our saddles but the raiders were streaming into the square from all directions and we were too close bound to make a charge in any event the square was soon so crowded we could hardly swing our swords i saw one of our men hauled from the saddle and his brains dashed out beneath his own horses hooves i saw maelwys struggling to rally us to his side his arm rising and falling again and again as he struck out at those surrounding him spears splintered before his blade and more than one man went down screaming i took up the call and drove towards him into my path leaped two spearmen the horse shied and dodged nearly pitching me from his back the animals hooves slipped against the smooth stone and it fell rolling onto its side pinning my leg one spear thrust past my ear anotfier jabbed towards my chest i swung with my sword and knocked it aside kicking myself free of my mount as it thrashed to its feet i rolled up to face two more raiders making four together all with irontipped spears levelled on me one of them gave a shout and they rushed me i saw the enemy move towards me saw their faces dark and grim saw their eyes gleaming hard like sharp iron their hands were tight on the shafts of their spears their knuckles white sweat misted on their faces and the cords tightened on their necks i saw it all and more ah with dreadful heartstopping clarity as the speeding flow of time dwindled to a bare trickle every action slowed as if all around me was suddenly overcome with an impossible lethargy i saw the spearheads edging towards me swinging lazily through the air my own blade came up sharp and smart biting through the wooden shafts slicing the spearpoints from the hafts as easily as striking the heads of thistles from their stems i let the force of the blow spin me away so that as my attackers fell forward behind their blunted spears i was gone i scanned the melee the square churned and writhed with the fight the sound was a booming featureless roar like that of blood racing through the ears our warriors horribly outmanned strove valiantly fighting for their lives maelwys held his own across the square leaning low in the saddle hewing mightily his arm flailed with a fierce and violent rhythm his blade streamed scarlet ribbons he had been identified however and more and more of the enemy lumbered towards him in that strange languid motion brought on by my heightened awareness i put out my hand and caught up the reins of my mount swinging up into the saddle i turned the horses head and urged it forth towards maelwys moving with the easy roll of the horse beneath me i swung the sword in my hand first on the left and then on the right slashing slashing striking again and again my blade a shining circle of light around me men toppled like cordwood in my wake as i forced my way to the kings side my sword sang ringing clear and true as it struck relentless as the sea swell driven before the storm we fought together maelwys and i and soon the stone under our horses hooves was slick with blood but still the enemy swarmed around us in fighting frenzy slashing with the knives in their hands and jabbing with thenspears none dared come within the arc of my blade however for that was certain death instead they tried for my horse stabbing at its legs and belly one howling fool leaped at my bridle strap hoping to drag the horses head down i gave him something to howl about as his ear left his face another lost a hand when he made a clumsy thrust at the animals flanks yet another collapsed in a quivering heap when the flat of my blade came down hard on the crown of his leather war helm as he made to leap for me these things happened leisurely almost laughably so each action deliberate and slow thus i had time not only to react but to plan my next move and my next before the first had been completed once i fell into the uncanny rhythm of this strange way of fighting i found that i could move with impunity among the absurdly lethargic enemy so striking again and again striking and whirling away while my hapless opponents floundered and lurched around me flailing uselessly with sluggish inept movements i joined a bizarre and terrible dance the bards speak with reverence of oran mor the great music elusive source of all melody and song very few have the gift to hear it taliesin had the gift or something more than that but i heard it then my limbs throbbed with it my swinging arm told out its unearthly rhythm my sword sang with its brilliant melody i was part of oran mor and it was part of me there came a rallying cry and maelwys houseguard came clattering into the square they had ridden from the villa where the townspeople had fled and were hurrying to our aid now that it was clear the awaited attack would not come there but a few heartbeats later i knew the battle was broken a rising wave of exultation rose within me and i heard a high keening call a war chant a victory cry and recognized my own voice soaring up from my throat the reaction of the enemy was immediate they turned to meet the source of this unnerving sound and i saw in that extraordinary clarity black despair fall across their features they were undone and they knew it my cry rose into a song of triumph and i leaped to the aid of my sword brothers who were hard pressed sweet exhilaration sweeping through me and out of my mouth in the song no one could stand before me and the irish fled lest they be trampled beneath my horses hooves or carved by my swift blade now i was in one place freeing a man being dragged to his death now in another snatching a weapon from a foe and flinging it to an ally once i saw a man falling and reached out caught him and hauled him back into the saddle all the while my voice rose in joyous celebration i was invincible i saw maelwys clear the path and ride to meet me three of his own behind him i raised my sword in salute as he came up and i saw under the sweat and blood his face white and his eyes staring his sword arm was gashed but he paid it no heed he put a trembling hand out to touch me and i saw his mouth move but the words were slow in coming you can stop now myrddin it is over i grinned and loosed a wild laugh look he said shaking me look around you we have beat them back we have won i peered through the mist that had risen before my eyes the bodies of the dead lay deep upon the square the stench of death clawed at my throat i shuddered as with a sudden chill and began to shake from head to foot the last thing i saw was the sun bright in my eyes and the clouds swirling above me swirling like the wings of circling birds i remember arriving at the villa and the drone of hushed voices around me i remember drinking something very bitter and then vomiting i remember waking cold in fireshot darkness to the sound of steel on steel i remember floating lost in an immense sea as booming water roared around me lastly i remember climbing up a sharp slope to stand on a windbitten rock ledge in a bloodred dawn when i awoke all was well with me once more the battle frenzy that had come on me was gone and i was myself my mother regarded me closely and pressed her hand to my forehead but allowed that whatever ailment had possessed me had vanished we were worried merlin she told me we thought you had been wounded but there is not so much as a bruise on you son how do you feel i am well mother that was all i said there was no explaining what had happened when i did not know myself after breaking fast i heard a commotion outside and walked out into the forecourt where i found maelwys surrounded by his houseguard some of whom had fought with us the day before rarely were all of them at the villa however as he kept them circulating his lands riding the borders keeping watch news of the attack had summoned those who had not been present the day before both warriors and chiefs there were many townspeople there as well swelling the ranks of those gathered in the forecourt maelwys had been speaking to them but when i came out silence descended over the throng thinking only to join them i came to stand beside the king a man pushed his way to me and i saw that it was blaise he raised his staff and lifted his voice in song three thirties of bold warriors have gone down before the thirsty blade the blood of the vanquished is silent black is their mourning the eyes of the enemy feed the birds of death let each mouth make entreaty from the heart of the hero a champion springs great of skill a giant in battle he has hewn the savage with sharp steel terrible were their war cries hail him men of valour exalt him in your midst let his name rise on wings of welcome make homage to the lord of your deliverance who with walls of iron has defended you brave men princes of noble birth make of myrddin a name of praise and honour when he had finished blaise lowered his hands and stooping before me laid his staff at my feet then he backed slowly away for a moment the people stared in silence no one moved then a young warrior the one i had saved from a fall in the battle i think stepped forward he drew his sword from its sheath at his side and without a word laid it beside the druids staff then he knelt down and stretched out his hand to touch my foot one by one each of the warriors there followed their sword brothers example they drew out their blades knelt and put out their hands to cover my feet several of maelwys chiefs caught in the spell added their swords to the pile and knelt to touch my feet as well it was something warriors did when vowing allegiance to a new battlechief but maelwys had not been badly injured let alone killed he was still a skilled and able leader i turned to the king to find he had stepped from beside me i was standing alone before the people what could this mean please lord i whispered this honour is yours no he declared it is yours alone myrddin the warriors have chosen who they will follow but maelwys shook his head let be he replied gently then stepping behind me he raised his hands over my head hear me my people look upon the one you honour you have made him your battlechief he paused and lowered his hands to my shoulders this day i make him my son and heir of all i possess what blaise was there and ready this is an auspicious day lord he said allow me to confirm you in your good intent so saying he unwound the rawhide belt from around his waist and bound our hands together at the wrist to maelwys he said lord and king as your hand is bound is it your wish to bind your life to the son of your wife that is my wish will you honour him with sonship bestowing him with lands and possessions that i will do gladly turning solemnly to me blaise said myrddin ap taliesin will you accept this man to be your guardian and your guide it was happening so fast blaise i answer now as he has accepted me so will i accept him i gripped maelwys hand and he gripped mine blaise drew his knife and nicked our wrists so that our blood mingled so be it he said untied the thong and released us then indicating the pile of swords at my feet he said will you also accept the fealty of these men who have sworn loyalty to you with their lives likewise i accept the honour and fealty of these brave men i give my life as pledge to them a shout went up from the people and the warriors leaped forward and grabbed up their swords and began beating them against their shields making a terrible din myrddin myrddin myrddin they cried my name a chant on their lips then i was lifted up and carried into maelwys hall on the shoulders of my men as i crossed the threshold i saw my mother standing just inside the door charis had seen all that had taken place and her face glowed with love for me she stepped towards me and raised her hands and i saw she held a sword across her palms the fisher kings sword i took up the sword and lifted it high the men around me redoubled their acclaim shouting and cheering and calling my name and i sang with joy until the timbers rang with the sound for this was the day i won my kingdom book two forest lord one black is the hand of heaven blue and black and filled with frozen stars and stars and stars and stars and stars who are you lord what is your name why do you look at me so have you never seen a man disembowelled have you never seen a living corpse black is the day black is the night and black the hand that covers me deep in celyddons black heart i hide in a forest pool i glimpse the face beneath the antlered helm and i stare i stare until the stars stream overhead the red moon screams the birds and wild creatures take flight at my coming the trees taunt me the flowers of the high meadows turn their faces from me the crooked glens echo sharp accusation the racing waters mock me rain and wind blast and blow snow and sun bright fire of the sun silver moon glow silver water from the soul of the mountain sing fair stars of heaven lift your voices children of the living god sharp as spearpoints are your shining songs life and death are they to me ave ave imperator listen to the bleak wind howl through your empty halls listen high one hear the bones of the brave rattle in nameless graves king eagle attend your offspring lift your hand and sustain them with the crumbs of your banquet hall they hunger for justice they weep only the king of eagles can ease their craving rivers flow and waters rise see fast ships fly over the sea away away always away take flight my soul away what is it that remains when life is gone how much of a man endures like a beast among beasts i go naked feeding only on the roots of the field drinking only rain i am a man no more broken rocks bruise my flesh cold winds wrack my sorry bones i am undone i am as one cast out from the hearth of my kinsmen i am as one living in the shadowlands i am as the dead shall i sing the seasons shall i sing the ages of our earth the days of men past and yet to come shall i sing fair broceliande shall i sing drowned llyonesse pwyll bring the heros cup mathonwy bring my harp taliesin wrap your bright cloak around my shoulders lieu gather your people into your bright hall for i shall sing the kingdom of summer mad merlin mad you are mad merlin mad two oh wolf happy wolf monarch of the greenclad hills you are my only friend speak to me now give me the benefit of your wise counsel be my advocate and my protector nothing to say wise friend what is that a story if it pleases you hill lord i take up my harp hear o people of dust hearken well to the tale i shall tell in elder days when the dew of creation was still fresh on the earth great manawyddan ap llyr was lord and king over seven cantrefs of dyfed and this is the way of it now manawyddan was brother to bran the blessed who himself was king of the island of the mighty holding all kings and kinglets beneath him even as he held all lands as his own but bran had journeyed to the otherworld and tarried long so manawyddan took the kingship in his brothers place as was his right to do and there was not a better king in all the world than manawyddan and no better place for a kingdom than the wild hills of dyfed for these were the fairest lands in all the world it came about that pryderi prince of gwynedd came before manawyddan seeking friendship for their two houses manawyddan received him gladly and offered a feast so the two friends feasted and took their ease engaging in pleasant conversation and delighting in the songs of manawyddans skilful bard anuin llaw and the company of manawyddans beautiful queen rhiannon of whom many wondrous tales are told after the first evenings sitting pryderi turned to manawyddan i have heard said pryderi to his host that the hunting runs of dyfed are unmatched by any in the world then you must heartily thank the one who told you for truer words were never spoken perhaps we might hunt together you and i suggested pryderi why cousin we could go hunting tomorrow that is if nothing prevents you replied manawyddan indeed i thought i should grow old in waiting for you to ask said pryderi happily as it happens nothing prevents me let us go tomorrow on that very morrow the two friends set out with a company of bold companions they hunted all the day and at last stopped to rest and water their weary horses while they waited they climbed a nearby mound and lay down to sleep as they slept there came the sound of thunder very loud thunder it was so they awoke and with the thunder came a thick dark mist so thick and so dark that no man could see his companion next to him when the mist finally lifted it was bright everywhere so that they bunked their eyes and put up their hands when they lowered their hands once more however they looked out and saw that everything had changed no more were there trees or rivers or flocks or dwellings no animal no smoke no fire no man nothing save the hills and those were empty too alas lord cried manawyddan what has become of our company and the rest of my kingdom let us go and find them if we can they returned to manawyddans palace and found only briars and thorns in the place where his sparkling hall had been in vain they searched the valleys and glens trying to spot a dwelling or settlement but only a few sickly birds did they see and they both began to feel mournful for their loss manawyddan for his wife rhiannon who was waiting for him in their chamber and all his brave company as well and pryderi for his companions and the fine gifts manawyddan had given him there was nothing to be done so they kindled a fire with the briar thickets and slept that night hungry on the cold hard ground in the morning they heard the sound of dogs barking as dogs will when the scent of game inflames them what can that mean wondered pryderi why stand here wondering when we can find out said manawyddan and leaped up at once to saddle his horse they rode in the direction of the sound and came to a birch copse in a hidden glen at their approach a score of fine hunting hounds came racing from the copse shaking violently with fear their tails low between their haunches unless i miss my guess remarked pryderi upon seeing the dogs some enchantment lies upon this little wood no sooner had he spoken these same words when out of the copse burst a shining white boar the dogs cowered to see it but after much urging took up the trail and ran after it the men followed until they drew near to where the boar stood at bay against the hounds upon seeing the men the white boar broke free and ran off once more again the men gave chase and again found the boar at bay against the hounds and again the boar broke free when they came near well they pursued the boar until they came to a great fortress which neither of them had ever seen before and they marvelled to see it the hounds and the boar ran inside the stronghold and though the two men listened for the dogs barking as long as they stayed they heard not a sound more lord said pryderi if you will i shall enter this fortress and seek what has become of the dogs lieu knows that is not a good idea replied manawyddan neither you nor i have ever seen this fortress before and if you ask my counsel it is this stay far from this strange place it may be that whoever has placed the enchantment on the land has caused this fortress to appear it may be as you say but i am loath to give up those fine hounds so manawyddans good advice notwithstanding pryderi urged his reluctant horse forward and entered the gate of the fortress which was before them once inside however he could see neither man nor beast nor boar nor dogs nor hall nor chamber what he did discover was a great stand of marble stone and hanging above the stand by four golden chains whose ends extended upward so that he could not see any end to them was a huge bowl of the finest gold he had ever seen and pryderi was no stranger to fine gold he approached the marble stand and saw rhiannon manawyddans wife standing still as the stone itself her hand touching the bowl lady said pryderi what do you here as she made no answer and as the bowl was of dazzling beauty pryderi thought no ill and came to where she stood and put his hands on the bowl in the selfsame instant that he touched the bowl his hands stuck to the bowl and his feet stuck to the stand and there he stood as one made of stone awhile and awhile manawyddan waited but pryderi did not return and neither did the dogs well he said to himself there is nothing to be done but go in after him and in he went there he saw as pryderi had seen the magnificent golden bowl hanging by its golden chains he saw his wife rhiannon with her hand to the bowl and pryderi likewise lady wife he said friend pryderi what do you here neither made to answer him but his words provoked a response nonetheless for no sooner had he spoken than the sound of a very great thunder echoed through the mysterious fortress and the mist rose up thick and dark when it cleared rhiannon pryderi the golden bowl and indeed the fortress itself were gone and not to be seen any more woe to me cried manawyddan when he saw what had happened i am all alone now with neither companions nor even dogs for company lieu knows i do not deserve such a fate as this what shall i do there was nothing to be done but go on with his life as best he could he fished the streams and caught wild game and began to till the soil using a few grains of wheat he had in his pocket the wheat flourished and in time he had enough to sow an entire field and then another and another great the wonder of it for the wheat was the finest the world had ever seen manawyddan bided his time and waited out the seasons until at last the wheat was so ripe he could almost taste the bread he would make so looking at his wonderful crop he said to himself i am a fool if i do not reap this tomorrow he returned to his bothy to sharpen his wheat knife the next morning when he came in the grey dawn to harvest his longawaited crop he found only naked stalks standing in the field each stalk had been snapped off where the ear joins to the stem and the grain carried off leaving only stubble behind much distressed manawyddan ran to the next field and saw that all was as it should be he examined the grain which had ripened nicely i am a fool if i do not reap this field tomorrow he said to himself he slept lightly that night and awoke with the break of day to reap his grain upon coming to the field he saw that as before only naked stalks remained the grain had been carried off alas he cried what enemy is doing this to me lieu knows he is completing my downfall if this keeps on i will be destroyed and all the land with me with that manawyddan hastened to his last remaining field and behold it was ripe and ready to be harvested i am a fool if i do not reap this field tomorrow he said to himself more i will be a dead fool for this is my last hope and he sat down right where he was intending to watch through the night and so catch the enemy that was destroying him manawyddan watched and towards midnight what must have been the greatest uproar in the world reached his ears he looked and saw the greatest host of mice ever assembled so large a host he could scarce believe his eyes before he could move the mice had fallen upon the field each one scaling a stalk and nipping off the ear and carrying off the grain in its mouth leaving only a naked stalk behind manawyddan rushed to the rescue of his field but the mice might have been midges for all he could catch them one mouse however was heavier than all the others and could not move so quickly manawyddan pounced upon it and put it in his glove he tied the opening with string and took the mouse prisoner back to his bothy well as i would hang the thief that has ruined me he said to the mouse lieu help me i will hang you the next morning manawyddan went out to the mound where this whole misadventure had begun taking the mouse in the glove and there he set two forked sticks upright in the ground at the highest part of the mound all at once a man appeared riding by the foot of the mound on a thinshanked horse the mans clothes were worse than rags and he appeared a beggar lord good day to you the beggarman called out manawyddan turned to observe him lieu be good to you he replied these past seven years i have seen not one man in all my kingdom save yourself this very moment well i am only passing through these desolate lands the beggar told him if it please you lord what work are you about i am executing a thief what son of thief the creature i see in your hand looks very like a mouse to me it is scarcely fitting for a man of your exalted position to touch an animal like that surely you will let it go between you and me and lieu i will not said manawyddan hotly this mouse and his brothers have brought about my destruction i mean to execute punishment upon it before i starve to death and the judgement is hanging the beggar went on his way and manawyddan set about fixing a stick for the crossbeam between two forks he had done this when a voice hailed him from below the mound good day to you lord lieu smite me if this is not becoming a busy place muttered manawyddan to himself he looked around and saw a fine noblewoman sitting on a grey palfrey at the foot of the mound good day to you lady he called back to her what brings you here i was only riding by when i saw you toiling up here what work are you about she asked full politely i am hanging a thief explained manawyddan if that is anything to you indeed it is nothing to me said the lady but the thief appears to be a mouse still i should say punish it by all means were it not so demeaning to a man of your obvious rank and dignity to hold commerce with such a low creature what would you have me do asked manawyddan suspiciously rather than see you disgrace yourself further i will give you a coin of gold to let it go she smiled winsomely as she said this and manawyddan was almost persuaded you speak well for this sorry mouse but i am determined to end the life of the creature that has ended mine very well lord replied the lady haughtily do as you wish manawyddan returned to his grim task and taking the string from the glove he tied one end around the mouses neck and as he drew the creature up to the crossbeam there came a shout from the foot of the mound not a freckle on a face have i seen in seven years to this day and now i am accosted at every turn he grumbled so saying he turned around to meet an archdruid with a score of ovates as retinue ranged behind him lieu give you good day said the archdruid what sort of work is my lord about if you must know i am hanging a thief which has brought about my destruction replied manawyddan forgive me but you must be a fragile man indeed for that appears to be a mouse in your hand it is a thief and destroyer nonetheless snapped manawyddan not that i should have to explain myself to you i require no explanation the archdruid told him but it grieves me full well to see a man of your obvious renown exacting punishment on a helpless creature helpless is it where were you when this mouse and its myriad companions were devastating my fields and bringing about my demise as you are a reasonable man said the archdruid allow me to redeem the worthless creature i will give you seven gold pieces to let it go manawyddan shook his head firmly that will not do i will not sell the mouse for any amount of gold still it is not seemly for a man of your rank to kill mice in this way countered the archdruid therefore let me give you seventy pieces of gold shame on me if i sell it for twice that amount of gold the archdruid would not be put off nevertheless good lord i will not see you defile yourself by harming that animal i will give you a hundred horses and a hundred men and a hundred fortresses i was lord of thousands replied manawyddan how should i take less than what i had as you will not accept that the archdruid said please name your price that i may meet it well there is a thing which might persuade me name it and it is yours i wish the release of rhiannon and pryderi you shall have that promised the archdruid between me and lieu that is not all what else then i wish the removal of the spell of enchantment from the realm of dyfed and all my holdings you shall have that as well only release the mouse unharmed manawyddan nodded slowly and looked into his hand that i will do only first i will know what this mouse is to you the archdruid sighed very well you have the better of me she is my wife otherwise i would not ransom her your wife cried manawyddan am i to believe such a thing believe it lord for it is true i am the one who laid the enchantment upon your lands who are you that you should seek my destruction i am hen dallpen chief of druids in the island of the mighty replied the archdruid i acted against you out of revenge how so what have i ever done to you for indeed manawyddan could think of nothing he had ever done to anger any man be he priest or druid you took the kingship of bran the blessed and in this you did not obtain the blessing of the learned brotherhood therefore i took it upon myself to enchant your kingdom which i did i will say you did grumbled manawyddan unhappily what of my fields when some of those wlio follow me learned of the wheat they begged me to turn them into mice in order that they might destroy your fields the third night my own wife went with them and she was heavy with child although if she had not been so you would not have caught her but since she was and you did i will give you rhiannon and pryderi and lift the spell from dyfed and all your lands the archdruid finished by saying now i have told you all please release my wife manawyddan glared at the chief druid i am a fool if i let her go now what else do you wish sighed the archdruid tell me and let there be an end to this matter between us i wish that once the enchantment has been removed from the land there will never be another spell cast you have my most solemn promise now will you let the mouse go not yet stated manawyddan firmly the archdruid sighed are we to be at this all day what else do you require one thing else replied manawyddan i require that no revenge be taken because of what has happened here neither on rhiannon or pryderi or my lands or people or possessions or the creatures under my care he looked squarely in the archdruids eyes or upon myself a cunning thought lieu knows for indeed had you not struck on that at last you would have suffered far worse than anything you have suffered until now and all harm would be on your own head manawyddan shrugged a man must protect himself however he can now release my wife that i will not do until i see rhiannon and pryderi coming towards me with glad greetings then look if you will said the archdruid wearily they are coming even now pryderi and rhiannon appeared manawyddan hurried to meet them and they greeted him gladly and began to speak of what had happened to them all i have done all you asked and more than i would have done had you not asked implored the archdruid do the one thing i have asked and release my wife gladly replied manawyddan and he opened his hand and the mouse ran free the archdruid scooped it up and whispered some words in the ancient secret tongue into the mouses ear and instantly the mouse began to change back into a comely woman whose belly swelled with the child she was carrying manawyddan looked around the land and saw that every house and holding was back where it should be complete with herds and flocks and all the people were back where they should be so that the land was inhabited as once before indeed it was as if nothing had changed at all only manawyddan knew differently here ends the mabinogi of manawyddan my friend wolf yes it is a sad story in many of its parts but i think you will agree that its end redeems what is that you say yes there is more to it than fust appears how astute you are o wise wolf of course there is always more than meets the eye or ear this tale conceals a secret at its heart he that has ears to hear let him hear three the ravens croak at me from the treetops they speak rudely no respecters of persons they say why do you not die son of dust why do you cheat us of our meat i am a king how dare you affront me how dare you slander me with insinuations listen wolf friend there is something i must tell you oh but i cannot i cannot forgive me please you must forgive me i cannot tell it well i am in misery the scant trickle of my little spring as it drips from the rock is as my very life my blood hear the bitter wind weeping among the cruel rock crags hear how it moans sometimes soft and low sometimes as if to tear at the roots of the world sometimes a sigh or a thin crooning song from the throat of a toothless hag i wander without sense or purpose as if the aimless movement of my limbs is atonement for sins too loathsome to utter as if in the slow purposeless shuffling of one foot after the other i will find some release ha there is no release death you have claimed all the others why do you not claim me i shout i rave i cry into the depths of darkness and my voice falls into a pit of silence there is no answer it is the unknowing silence of the grave it is the unyielding silence of despair black and eternal i was a king i am a king this rock i squat upon is all that is left to me it is all my realm once better lands were mine away in the wealthy southland i raised my throne and dyfed nourished maelwys and i were kings together after the custom of the proud cymry of old all the world turns back turns back turns again to the old ways the forgotten yet familiar ways in the old ways there is certainty and solace there is the empty form of comfort but there is no peace hear then if you will friend wolf the story of a man there was a feast following that first victory how my sword did shine oh it was a beautiful thing perhaps i valued it too much perhaps i tried too hard attempted too much but tell me my lord jesu whoever has attempted more we burned the irish warboats throwing hi the corpses of the raiders before firing them and setting them adrift on the outrunning tide the red flames danced and the black smoke rose to heaven and our hearts beat for joy maridunum was saved that day suffering little more than a few dwellings lost and a few roofs fired ten of our people were killed six of those were warriors still we had survived and before the summer was out the first of maelwys new warband began arriving we raised eighty that year and sixty the next demetae and silures the dual clans of dyfed produced fierce warriors great light i see them astride their tough ponies oxhide shields slung over their shoulders spearpoints burnished sharp the bold checked cloaks fluttering from their shoulders tores and armbands gleaming their hair braided and bound like their horses tails or freeflying under their war caps their eyes dark and hard as cymry slate under smooth brows and firm the set of their jaws it was joy itself to lead such men we rode the circuit together the ring of hillforts guarding our lands and we erected timber platforms on the coastal hills for beacon fires these were manned from the first summer on until winter made an end of the warring season and yes we were attacked again and yet again the barbarians knew that maximus had gone and the cream of the british troops with hun but we were never taken by surprise this was a good time for maridunum the weather was a boon companion to the land days full of clear skies and sunlight and an evenings rain to quench the thirsting root all things flourished and bore fruit despite constant harrassment of raiders our herds and flocks increased our people thrived and were content that first autumn of my kingship when i was certain my place was established i spoke openly of my love for ganieda to my mother and maelwys it was decided that a messenger should be sent to take word to custennin of my intentions we chose six of our company and sent them north to goddeu with gifts and letters both for the lord and for my bride i would have gone myself but it is not done that way and besides i was needed in maridunum the day the messengers rode out was a crisp golden day in autumn just after samhain the warmth of summer had lapsed and nights could be cold but still the days were fair with the firetint brightening summers greens i stood in the road and watched them out of sight thinking that only the winter a few grey wet months a little space of darkness and cold separated me from my light my ganieda only one winter then i too would ride out to fetch my bride from her fathers hearth and bring her home and it was much like i imagined it to be i spent a restless winter riding with the hunting bands when i could watching clouded skies shift over the land as they brought rain and a little snow now and then i fussed with maelwys hounds bathed in the heated bath played chess with charis losing more often than winning strummed my harp and sang in the hall of an evening and generally haunted the villa like the restless shade i was all the time waiting for the days to shorten and trees to bud be at ease merlin you are as tense as a cat about to pounce charis told me one night it was after midwinter just after the christ mass and we were at the nightly game of chess she always played with either maelwys or me as her partner you cannot make the days fly faster than they will that i know only too well i replied if it had been for hoping spring would have been with us long since you are so eager my soul she looked at me over the chessboard and i caught a hint of sadness in her voice and in her glance what is it mother charis smiled and moved a gamepiece on the board i was only thinking yes these years have themselves flown it seems to me was it so long ago that taliesin came with his harp to my fathers house she lifted a hand to my cheek you are very like him merlin your father would be proud to see he has sired such a noble son she lowered her hand and pushed a gamepiece with a fingertip then sighed my work is nearly finished your work i moved one of the pieces not caring which one or where charis countered the move you will be ganiedas responsibility from now on my hawk you make it sound as if i were going away across the sea i am only moving into the chambers across the courtyard to me it will be as if you have travelled to the end of the earth she said solemnly from the day you are married you and ganieda are one you will give all of yourself to her and she to you you will be a world together and that is as it should be i will have no place in it i knew what she was saying but i made light of it i did not like to think that something that would bring me such happiness would cause someone i loved such pain i wanted everyone to share my joy and so charis did but her joy was bittersweet and could be no other way a little later when we bade each other good night she hugged me more tightly and held me more closely it was the first of many small farewells for us that helped ease the greater the day did finally come when i rode out for goddeu myself taking a score of warriors for company we did not fear attack on the road but the enemy was becoming more bold with each passing season also we had heard of a hard winter north of the wall this would send the hungry picti and scotti out on the war trail all the sooner riding with twenty of my best was only prudent and it would serve to set an edge to winterdulled skills but aside from the usual springswollen rivers and mountain passes that had not yet thawed the journey proved unremarkable indeed it seemed to me as if i had travelled the goddeu road so often that i remembered every rock and bush and ford along the way nor did we lack for travelling companions for despite the rumours of raiders of one sort or another there were many others on the road as well more than normal for early spring it was as if men knew that the days of freeranging trade over longer distances were drawing to a close and were anxious to do what they could before the end came yet there was an air of exuberance of carefree comradeship although that might have been my own mood colouring things for me oh but it was a fine journey and the day i rode into king custennins lakeside stronghold my heart swelled to bursting it was a glorious day all sun bright and adazzle with lights off the lake cleanswept the sky deep and azure blue the woodland flowers full and sweet on the gentle air the trees absolutely piping with birdsong it was a grand day every man should have such a wedding day although the actual ceremony was yet some time away the day i rode into goddeu and saw ganieda standing before the door of the kings great hall dressed in a creamwhite mantle fringed with golden tassels and worked in emerald green thread with white wildflowers plaited in her black hair that day that instant my soul was married to ganiedas we were so happy i do not remember catching her up to sit before me in the saddle although they say i did coming at her on the run and leaning low to sweep her away with me in a wild and joyous ride i only remember her arms around my neck and her lips on mine as we galloped along the sparkling lakeshore the horses hooves striking up showers of diamonds for us how did you know i would come today i asked when we dismounted at last outside custennins palace i did not know my lord ganieda answered with mock solemnity yet you were ready and waiting as i have been ready and waiting each day since the first flowers bloomed she laughed that i should marvel at that i would not have my love find me otherwise i love you ganieda i said with all the heart and soul in me i love you and i have missed you let us never part again she said just then i was hailed from the doorway and gwendolau appeared myrddin wylt is that you but for the wolfskin on your back i would not know you man unhand my sister and let me look at you gwendolau my brother we gripped arms in the old greeting and he beat me happily about the shoulders with his hands you have changed myrddin look at how you have filled out and what is this he raised a hand to my tore gold i thought gold was the sole right of kings it is and well you know it said ganieda i smiled to hear the possessive note in her voice does he not look every inch a king a thousand pardons lady he laughed i need not ask how it has gone with you for i see you have weathered well and you gwendolau the year had wrought its change in him as well he appeared more like custennin than ever a veritable giant among men it is good to see you allow me to see to your men and their horses he said you and ganieda have much to discuss i should guess we will talk later and with a happy slap of my back he walked off at once come ganieda tugged on my hand let us walk awhile yes but first i must pay my respects to the lord of this place that you can do later he is hunting today and will not return until dusk so we walked and our path led us into the woods where we found a leafy bower and sat down on the sun warmed grass i held ganieda in my arms and we kissed and if i could have stopped the world from turning i know i would have just feeling the sweet yielding weight of her in my arms was earth and sky to me great light i cannot bear it four no no listen wolf my mind is calm i will continue custennin was well disposed to the match gwendolau must have given his father a good report of my kinsmen and lineage indeed he could have done nothing else the joining of our houses would be to affirm honourable and longestablished ties something both avallach and maelwys were anxious to do as well the south needed the north and needed it strong the attacks that yearbyyear drove deeper into the heartland invariably originated in the north picti scotti attacoti cruithne these were all northern tribes and the saecsen and irish who were becoming bolder and more belligerent with each passing season when they came they came across the sea and into ynys prydein from the unguarded north but the incessant raiding was driving the few stable and trustworthy britons north of the wall back into the south those that like elphin and his people had not already left long ago so it was becoming more and more difficult to hold the middle ground between the warlusting north and the civilized south without strong northern allies the south became more vulnerable than ever rome had realized this from the beginning of course the eagles built the wall more a symbolic demarcation than an actual defence although it was that as long as the garrisons were manned but the true defence of the south had been had always been the strength of the northern kings this strength was faltering it is no wonder that the southern britons had begun to look fearfully to the north as both the cause of their troubles and their salvation it was to the benefit of both to form strong alliances and there is no stronger tie than blood kinship would do what the administrative might of rome could not or we would all go down together as king this was to be my work i saw perhaps more clearly than others the desperate need for accord between kingdoms the few and feeble attempts at friendship between the north and south good though they were were not enough if we were to survive we would have to find and welcome ways of encouraging the northern kingdoms and supporting them this would mean putting away the petty concerns of rank and wealth the small rivalries of small men for the greater good of all on this the future depended on this we would stand or fall i began thinking of one great kingdom made up of all the smaller kingdoms united yet each independent of the others and all contributing to the general welfare and security not an empire nor a state a nation of tribes and peoples ruled by a council of kings each lord with an equal say this was important for if we were to survive the barbarian onslaught it would have to be as a single united entity presenting one unassailable front not the fractious scattering of divided kingdoms which is what we were i began dreaming of this great kingdom made up of smaller kingdoms this great kingdom would be ruled by a single great king a paramount king or chief king one elected from among the council of kings to rule over all a high king whom the lower kings princes lords and noblemen would serve you might say as others have said that this was foolishness or at best the idle whimsy of a selfimportant young ass better they said to stand tall and demand our rights as citizens of the greatest empire the world has ever known petition rome they cried we are citizens protection is our right is it not send to the emperor with petitions bring the legions back tell him now that maximus wears the purple he will listen he will not let us be burned and bled by savages but maximus did not long wear his imperial robe and laurel circlet when he marched on rome as i knew he would rather as old pendaran gleddyvrudd had predicted theodosius son of theodosius the conqueror captured him and marched him into the senate in chains a few days later magnus maximus was beheaded in the colosseum and it was not only the man that died that day the dream of empire was extinguished in the bloodsoaked sand before those jaded jeering crowds bring the eagles back yes bring the eagles back bring them all back for all the good it will do is everyone blind can no one see never did we shelter beneath the eagles wings we were the eagle when the first romans had laid their roads and forts across the countryside and then turned aside to other more pressing matters elsewhere who took up the standard who buckled on the breastplates who took up the gladius and pike whose sons filled the garrison rosters all those years who took roman names and paid tax in roman coins who raised the cities and built the great villa farms was it rome oh by all means bring the eagles back i would have them see how well the briton wields the tools he has been given for that is what we have always done rome left long long ago but we did not know it instead we flattered ourselves and were likewise flattered to be sure that we were favoured children of mother rome foster children maybe i will not say bastard children for once rome did look kindly on us and from time to time sent her agents to help us look after our affairs for a price always for a price our wonderful mother was always more interested in the corn and beef and wool and tin and lead and silver that we produced and paid to her in tax and tribute than she was interested in our welfare yet that was in the best of times my friends what do you suppose she thinks of us now if she thinks of us at all the truth is a bitter draught but drain the cup and we will find our strength in it we are not weak we are not bereft of hope our hope is where it always was in our own hearts and in the strong steel in our hands yes i began seeing the vision of a free people ruling themselves without let or hindrance from distant emperors whose hearts had grown cold a nation of britons ruling britons for the good of all who sheltered in this fair land high and low alike it was taliesins vision the kingdom of summer five the heavenly starhost wheels through the sky the seasons spin away in the slow dance of years i squat on my rock and the rags of my clothes flap around me summer sun bakes and blisters winter wind slices flesh from bone spring rain soaks to the soul autumn mists chill the heart yet merlin endures destiny waits while merlin squats on his rock above dark celyddon forest lord cernunnos son wild man of the wood myrddin wylt merlin he of the strong enchantment who walked with kings the very same who now grubs among rotting apples for his food and the future must wait how is that wolf the kingmaking have i not then i will tell you dafyd came to maridunum the day of the victory feast and he performed a rite of consecration for me as part of my kingmaking with maelwys and charis and several of the chiefs who had been summoned by news of the raid dafyd and i rode to the chapel where crowded together in the sweet silence round the altar we all knelt and prayed for gods blessing on my reign dafyd then anointed me with holy oil touching my forehead in the sign of the cross and he anointed my sword as well saying behind this wall of steel shall our lords church flourish we all said amen to that he blessed me from the holy text then kissed me with a holy kiss and i him whereupon each of the others in the room knelt and stretched forth their hands to cover my feet as sign of their submission to me all except maelwys of course but he embraced me like a father in this way was i made king of dyfed i began my reign in the usual way i suppose i shared wine with the men who would follow me i distributed gifts among them and accepted their pledges of fealty there was singing blaise came with four of the learned brotherhood who gave us such song as is reserved for well for a kings ears alone and the feasting continued for three more days between the time blaise had handed me my kingship i still think of it as his doing but what of that the druids of old were kingmakers and it was their right and the time of my crowning he had vanished only to reappear again with a golden tore pendaran had said he would give me his tore and also the throne he had occupied for nearly fifty years but as he was still somewhat active in the affairs of the realm that hardly seemed right since there had never been a time when three kings ruled in dyfed at once maelwys ordered a new tore to be made instead blaise must have guessed that this would be the case and he swept into the hall bearing the tore in his hands as if it were the kingship itself that he held at his appearance the hall fell silent men stared at the object he held had they never seen that ring of gold before i admit his entrances and exits could be arresting but i saw nothing unusual about his bearing a tore to me perhaps it was because i saw it in the hand of a friend while others saw it in the hand of the bard and the more significant for that however it was he caused quite a stir he bade me kneel before him while he stood over me with the tore as if with a talisman of power in the eyes of the cymry i suppose it was a charmed thing the church had power most would allow but so did the images and rites of old which had the additional benefit of being hallowed by long tradition it was all well and good to be anointed by the priest in the chapel in the wood better still to receive the tore of kingship from the hand of a druid well i had both is this necessary i hissed under my breath the hall had fallen silent every eye was on me ive already been consecrated is it killing you he whispered as he bent the soft yellow metal in his hands spreading the ends to fit around my neck just be quiet and let me do this he held the tore before me and i saw that it had two bears heads carved at the ends their eyes were tiny sapphires and each wore a collar of equally small rubies i stared in astonishment where on earth did he get it did you steal it i whispered to him as he placed the tore around my neck yes he said now be quiet he gently pushed the two ends of the tore together and lifting his hands to my head made the kingship speech in the old tongue it is doubtful anyone in the hall or even in all of dyfed knew the old briton language any more the dark tongue men called it from before rome came nevertheless they appreciated the significance of it just then blaise jesu bless him was trying his best to help me with all he had he was showing the people gathered there that in the new king all past and future were brought together he was reminding them of the old ways in the same way dafyd had shown the way of the future but the old ways are evil ways i have heard that said by more ignorant clerics than bears thinking about convenient perhaps to a priesthood neither knowledgeable nor tolerant of things belonging to another priesthood and another time much in elder days was evil i admit i am not like one of those pigheaded fools who stare into the embers of a dying fire and think to see the kindling of tomorrows flame but neither do i deny the good where i find it and there was some good i assure you in every age there is some good god is ever present ever eager to be found if men will look i know i searched blaise understood this too he wanted me to enjoy the dual blessings of past and future thinking that the people would follow me more readily he too believed in the kingdom of summer unlike me however he thought the people would need to be coaxed towards it i believed i had only to throw the doors open wide and all would rush in gladly but then i was very young blaise of course knew better which is why he went round telling all those stories about me what men believe hawk he told me once that is what they follow their hearts are willing all men want to believe very few can follow a dream even a true and beautiful dream but they will follow a man with a dream so he smiled deviously i am giving them a man when he put the bears head tore on my neck i tell you i felt a king it was without doubt a kings tore and wherever he had found it i knew a king had worn it perhaps many kings indeed it was a thing of power the tore wolf i wear it still see ganieda liked it too yes she did after that maelwys and i began making plans for repairing the hillforts not that they were in poor repair but none of them were supplied any more nor stocked with grain and water a few lacked strong gates and most had gaps in the walls and mudchoked wells the people were using thorn bushes or briar hedges to close them which worked well enough to keep cattle from wandering but would be no defence at all against saecsen or irish spears no one actually lived in the hillforts any more had not for a long long time but maelwys foresaw the day when fully stocked and gated forts would be required we also began planning the series of coastal beacons the first as i have said were built that summer when the warriors began arriving from the beginning there was much activity around the villa and in maridunum the mood was high in all it was a good summer i did not often have time to stop and reflect upon my good fortune but in those days i prayed as i had never prayed before for my people for strength for wisdom to lead mostly for wisdom it is a lonely thing to be a king even sharing the burden with maelwys it was not easy for me for one thing many of the younger warriors had apparently chosen me for their sovereign they more or less attached themselves to me looking to me to lead them maelwys helped me as he could and charis too but when men hold you as their lord there is not much anyone else can do it is up to you and you alone how best to lead them we spent many long nights maelwys and i talking talking talking rather maelwys talked and i listened carefully to every word he taught me much about the handling of men and in the teaching taught me much about life i also saw a good deal of blaise and of dafyd and in the autumn just before samhain and the end of harvest i travelled to ynys avallach with charis and then went on to caer cam to see grandfather elphin and the others i stayed with them such good people such noble hearts until the last leaves clung to the trees and the winds turned cold off the sea and then went back to the tor where charis was waiting to return to dyfed the isle of apples which is what some called it had not altered in so much as a stone out of place time was frozen there it seemed no one aged nothing changed and nothing dared intrude on the holy serenity of the place it remained remains still an almost spiritual place a place where natural forces like time and seasons and tides and life obey other perhaps older laws avallach now spent most of his time perusing the holy text with collen or one of his brother priests from shrine hill as it had become known i think he had it in his mind to become something of a priest himself the fisher king would have made a very strange albeit compelling cleric that autumn i remember he began showing the first interest in the chalice the cup jesu had used at his last supper and which the arimathean tin merchant joseph had brought with him in the days of the first shrine on shrine hill for some reason i did not mention to him that i had seen an image or vision of the cup i do not know why he would have been keenly interested to hear of it but something held me back as if it was unseemly to say anything about it just yet i remember thinking later i will tell him we must get back to maridunum although we were in no particular hurry at the time it seemed best to let it go that autumn also i sent my messengers to ganieda whereupon i settled downto a drear winter of the most restless waiting i have known but that i have already told six how long wolf how long old friend have i sat here upon my rock and watched the seasons fly up they swirl winging back to the great hand which gave them they fly like the wild geese but never more return what of merlin what of the wild man of the wood eh will he never more return there was a time when never mind wolf it does not matter orions belt cygnus the great bear these things matter these things are important let all else fade and fall only the eternal stars will remain when all else is unthinking dust i watch the winter stars glitter hard in the frozen sky were i not so forlorn i would conjure a fire to warm myself instead i watch the high cold heaven perform its inscrutable work i gaze at the hoar frost on the rocks and see the patterns of a life there i stare at the black water in my bowl and i see the shapes of possibility and inevitability i will tell you about inevitability shall i yes wolf i will tell you and then you will know what i know we were living in dyfed i was ruling my people little by little helping them to see the vision of the summer realm it was in my mind that if i could only show my people the shape and substance of the kingdom i meant to create they would follow me willingly i had no hint then of the forces arrayed against me oh we struggle against a cunning adversary never doubt it we move about on our crust of earth and we imagine we see the world as it is what we see is the world we imagine no man sees the world as it is unless perhaps granted sight by the enemy but i will not talk of him ask dafyd he will tell you he will find it easier for he has never had to stand against him face to face words alone are useless to describe the repugnance the repulsion the utter loathsome abhorrence ah but let ft go let it go merlin linger not upon it i remember when he came to me i remember his young face full of hope and apprehension he little appreciated what he was doing the young fool but he knew how badly he wanted it how much it mattered to him of course i was flattered a little and i saw some benefit in it for both of us or i would not have allowed it as it was what have i not pelleas wolf i am speaking of pelleas my young steward who else along with gwendolau and some of avallachs people i had ridden to llyonesse to hold council with belyn we were hoping to make a treaty among us to uphold one another through the barbarian incursions that had become more than annoying of late we needed the help of those south of mor hafren and along the far southern coasts where the irish had begun making their landfalls in the hidden little bays and inlets once ashore they could strike north or east as they would maelwys and avallach believed that by unking the coastland with a system of watchtowers and beacon fires we could discourage these landings perhaps even end them for if the irish knew they would be met in force at each landing and that their losses would outweigh their gains at every turn they might abandon the war trail for more peaceful pursuits so we took the plan to belyn he was not easy to convince he did not like the irish any more than we did but working with us would force him out of his cherished isolation he much preferred his solitary way but in the end maildun argued for us and won belyns support the night before we were to leave llyonesse pelleas came to me lord merlin he said forgive me for disturbing your rest i had retired early to my chamber haggling always taxes me and after three days of it i was weary come in pelleas come in i was enjoying a small cup of wine before going to sleep will you share one with me he accepted the cup i offered him but he did not drink i could see by the look on his face that it had cost him a great deal already to come here and that he had a matter of some importance on his mind tired as i was i did not rush him but let him come at the thing in his own time i sat down on the edge of my bed and offered him the chair he sat holding the cup in his hands staring into it what is it like in the north he asked oh it is a wilder country to be sure much of it is woodland and there are mountains and moors where nothing grows but the peat moss it can be a lonely place but it is not so bleak and terrible as men make out why do you ask he shrugged i have never been to the north something in his voice made me ask is that where you think i live do you not i laughed no lad dyfed is only across mor hafren not far from ynys avallach it is no great distance he was embarrassed by this so i went on to explain the northland i was talking about is far far north indeed it is many and many days ride above the wall itself he nodded i see i lived in that region for a time you know his head came up at these words yes i did i lived with hawk fhain a clan of hill folk who follow their herds from grazing to grazing all over the region up there but the land goes even further north than that it does oh indeed it does there is pictish land further north now that is a forbidding place where they make their homes do the picti really paint themselves blue for a fact they do in various ways some of them even stain their skins permanently in the most intricate patterns the fiercer warriors do this it must be something to see he said cautiously you should see it sometime i replied sensing this was what he wanted from me pelleas shook his head slowly and sighed i think he had rehearsed it no that is not for me again i made the required response why not i never can go anywhere his voice had risen and the words were a lament i have never even been to ynys avallach here we had come to the thing he wanted to say what is it pelleas i asked gently he started up from his chair so quickly some of the wine splashed over the rim of the cup take me with you i know you are leaving tomorrow i want to go with you i will be your steward you are a king you will need someone to serve you he paused and added desperately please merlin i must get away from here or i will die the way he put it i was not entirely certain that he would not fall down dead immediately upon our departure i thought about this i had no real need of a steward but there might be a place for him in maelwys house well i will ask belyn i offered he threw himself back into the chair in a slump he will never let me go he hates me that i heartily doubt no doubt the king has other things on his mind and things more important than the welfare of his own son his son i looked at him closely what are you saying he took a hasty sip from the cup his secret was out and now he was steeling himself for the fight he sensed would come i am belyns son i must apologize i told him remembering our first meeting and how i treated him as a servant i seem to have mistaken a prince for a steward oh that i am at least i am no prince he sneered make it plain please i am tired he nodded his eyes downcast my mother is a servant in this house i understood perfectly pelleas was belyns bastard and the king would not acknowledge him he felt his only chance to make a life for himself lay as far from llyonesse as he could get for the same reason belyn would not acknowledge him the king was not likely to let the lad go either i told him this would it hurt to try he was so desperate please no it will not hurt to try then you will ask him i will ask him i rose and took the cup from his hand now you are leaving and i am going to sleep he rose but made no move towards the door what if he says no let me sleep on it tonight i will think of something i will come for you in the morning shall i we can ask him together i sighed pelleas leave it to me i have said i will help you if i can that is all i can do at this moment let us leave it there for tonight he agreed apprehensively but i think he was not displeased nevertheless at cocks crow the next morning pelleas was standing at my door ready and eager to see which way his fate would swing as there would be no getting rid of him until the thing was done i agreed to see belyn as soon as may be in fact it was not until we were making ready to depart that i was able to speak to belyn alone thinking my chances were greater without anyone else looking on i had to wait and endure pelleas pleading stares to find my chance a word lord belyn i said seizing my opportunity as we walked from the hall gwendolau and baram and the others had left moments before and we trailed after yes he said stiffly i am interested in one of your servants he stopped and turned towards me if he guessed what i had in mind he did not show it what is your interest my lord merlin as a newmade king i am without servants of my own you want one of mine is that it he smiled frostily and rubbed his chin well name him whoever you fancy and if i can spare the man he is yours you are most generous lord i said which one he asked absently turning to the door once more pelleas belyn swung back to face me his eyes searched mine to determine what i knew i understand he has no formal duties i volunteered hoping to make it easier for him no no formal duties he was working furiously on this weighing implications and possibilities pelleas ah you have spoken to him about this yes briefly i did not wish to say too much until i could consult you that was wise he turned away again and i thought he would leave the matter there instead he said what says pelleas would he go do you think i believe i could persuade him then take him belyn took a step towards the door and hesitated as if to change his mind thank you i said he will be well treated on that you have my word he only nodded and then walked away i think i sensed relief in his mood as he moved off perhaps in this arrangement he saw an answer to an awkward dilemma pelleas of course was overjoyed you had better collect your things and saddle your horse i told him there is not much time i am ready now my horse was saddled before i came to you this morning very certain of yourself were you not i had faith in youmy lord he replied happily and ran off to bring his things if i thought that was the end of it i was mistaken no sooner had pelleas disappeared than i became aware of a presence watching me i turned back to the empty hall to see that it was not empty now a figure swathed head to foot in black stood in the centre of the great room my first instinct was to flee but as if in answer to my thoughts the stranger said no stay i waited as the figure approached the full black cloak was ornately worked in tiny fantastic designs all in black and gold thread the tall boots likewise black gloves covered the hands nearly to the elbow and the head was covered in a hoodlike cap that had a gauzy black material attached to it so that the face was veiled from view this strange apparition came to stand before me and i felt a dizzying sensation as if the stone beneath my feet had lost its solidity stones become fluid mud i put out my hand to the doorpost beside me the blackrobed figure studied me intently for a moment i could see eyes glittering behind the veil have we met asked the stranger in a voice deceptively cordial coming as it was from so forbidding an aspect and it was female we have not lady for i feel certain i would recall it oh but we know one another i think she was right in this for i knew full well who it was that addressed me my own dread had told me if nothing else morgian i said my tongue finding movement of its own how quickly her name leapt to my tongue well met merlin she replied politely at the speaking of my name i felt a delicious thrill sensual and seductive like that a man might feel in succumbing to some forbidden pleasure oh she had many kinds of power and knew their various uses well i actually wanted her at that moment how is my dear sister she asked taking a half step and lifting the gauze from her face at last we stood face to face morgian was beautiful very much like chads the family resemblance was strong but at the moment my mother was the furthest person from my mind i stared into a face of seeming exquisite and compelling beauty i say seeming because i am not at all certain now that it was not enchantment she was of the fair folk of course and had the natural elegance of her race but morgian far exceeded this hers was the dreamlike beauty of a vision heartrending flawless perfect in all its parts her hair gleamed like spun gold pale and shimmering her eyes were large and luminous flecked with the green fire of matched emeralds beneath golden lashes and smooth gentlyarched brows her skin was white as milk contrasting with the deep blood red of her lips her teeth were even and fine as pearls yet and yet around her or behind her like spreading black wings or a living invisible shadow i saw an aura brooding dark and ugly as if made up of all the nameless horrors of nightmare this thing seemed alive with churning writhing torment and it clung to her although whether it was part of her or she part of it i cannot say but it was a real presence as much as fear or hate or cruelty are real you are long in answering merlin she said lifting a hand to my face even through the fine leather of her glove i could feel the cold fire of her touch is something wrong charis is well i said and felt i had betrayed my mother merely by uttering her name oh i am glad to hear it she smiled and i was shocked to feel genuine warmth in her smile immediately i thought i must be mistaken in my estimation of her perhaps she did care after all perhaps the evil i sensed in her was of my own imagining but then she added casually as one might upon suddenly thinking of it and what of taliesin the words were malice itself a poison dagger in the hand of a skilful hateful enemy taliesin is dead these many years i intoned flatly as you well know she appeared taken aback by this news no she gasped shaking her head in mock disbelief he was so alive when last i saw him it was a wicked thing to say i did not think it needed a reply well morgian went on perhaps it could not be helped i imagine charis was devastated by his death the word was precise as a knife prick i reached for a weapon as well indeed but her grief was not without some consolation at least this drew her interest what consolation could there be hope i replied as my father was a believer in the true god he had won eternal life through the grace of lord jesu the christ one day they will be reunited in paradise that is the hope and promise that sustains her it was a clean thrust and i felt the blade go in she smiled again and i felt the power leap up in her as it reached out to me like a hand poised to slap we need not dwell upon such unhappiness morgian said we have other things to discuss do we lady not here not now but come and visit me again she invited you know the way i think or pelleas will show you we might become friends you and i oh i should like that merlin to be your friend those striking green eyes narrowed seductively you would like that too i know you would there is much i could teach you such was the power of the woman that even though words like friend were so unnatural so alien to her i still believed she meant it her charm could beguile and it could confuse and convince it could make the most impossible repulsive suggestions seem logical and attractive i said nothing so she continued oh but you are soon leaving are you not well another time yes we will meet again merlin trust on it the prospect chilled me to the marrow great light spread your protecting wings around me she pulled the veil across her face once more and stepped back abruptly i must not keep you she said and turning away made a small flicking motion with her hands i could move once more and lingered there no longer hurrying from the hall and through the corridor beyond anxious to put as much distance between morgian and myself as possible outside the horses were ready and i vaulted to the saddle without a backward glance gwendolau was waiting with the others and regarded me closely as i swung into the saddle perhaps sensing something amiss one other will be coming i told him pelleas is riding with us is everything well with you merlin you look as if someone has just danced across your grave i forced a laugh there is nothing wrong with me that a good days ride will not cure he climbed into his saddle beside me are you certain yes brother i am certain i gripped his arm i needed the reassurance of flesh just then but i thank you for your concern the big man shrugged amiably i am only thinking of myself my sister would flay me alive if i let any ill befall her husband for the sake of your oversized hide i will try never to let that happen i told him with a laugh and felt morgians influence receding pelleas came alongside a moment later he had a small bag slung on the back of his horse and a great grin on his face i am ready he announced happily then let us ride my friends called gwendolau the day is speeding before us we rode out from the forecourt and through the towerbound gates of belyns palace and no one came to see us away seven they say merlin slew a thousand thousand that the blood of the enemy ran red upon the land that rivers stank with floating corpses from arderydd to caer ligualid that the sky darkened with the wings of feasting birds flocking to the battlefield that the smoke of the cremation fires rolled to the very dome of heaven they say merlin mounted to the sky taking the shape of an avenging hawk to fly away to the mountains yet when the voices of the searchers rang in the wood where did merlin hide in what pit did merlin cower while they cried out to him o wise wolf tell me why was the light of the sun taken from me why was the living heart carved from my breast why do i haunt the desolate wastes hearing only the sound of my own voice in the mournful sigh and moan of the wind on bare rock tell me also fair sister how long has it been how many years have passed me here in celyddons womb what is that you say what of morgian ah yes i have often wondered what of morgian that first time of course was just the brandishing of weapons between foes she wanted to see who it was she would destroy she wanted to savour the exquisite hunger before the kill she was the cat taunting the mouse trying her claws but i do not think she was entirely certain of me then the meeting was necessary because she was not a fool and she would not presume to begin her battle without first assessing the strength of her adversary strange to say but i believe morgians offer of friendship was genuine that is as genuine as anything about her could be she meant it although she could not have had the slightest idea of true friendship because she was not capable of it but she was so hollow so empty of all natural feeling that she could adopt any posture as it occurred to her she used emotion as one might use a cloak changing when it suited her still she believed what she felt amity sincerity even love of a perverse sort until she abandoned it in favour of another more practical weapon thus morgian could make the incredible offer of friendship to me and make it seem genuine because she herself believed it if only for as long as it took her to say it in that sense it was not a trap she no doubt thought it might be advantageous to her in some way to have me as an ally and so spoke sincerely this was part of her treachery she could change as quickly as the wind and put the full force of her being behind the moments intent for morgian there was no higher ideal no greater call to be heard above the deafening shriek of her own allconsuming will there was no core of human pity or compassion to appeal to there was only morgian rarest beauty frozen and fatal mistress of the sweet poison the warm kiss of death though she ultimately meant me harm make no mistake about that i did not morgian had not come to join battle with me that day only as i have said to try her weapons and see what mine might be i have no clear idea of what she discovered about me in that regard although she revealed much about herself but she was vain such vanity is rare in a human soul but then morgian is no ordinary human and possesses no ordinary soul eight ganieda what do you here my soul ohhhh your flesh is so white go back go back i cannot bear it please go back drink a little water hawk you thirst you rave your chalybeate spring will revive you gods of stream and air gods of hills and high places gods of wells and water springs gods of the crossroads forge and hearth all

your prow star let its song be a victory song on your lips let its glory cover you my beautiful son no do not go my father do not leave me alone and forlorn please stay but a little taliesin he is gone wolf but did you see how his face shone when he spoke to me it was not the vision of a fevered brain never that taliesin came to me my father spoke to me he spoke to me and i heard the sound of his voice yes and i heard his stern warning nine if i am crazed if i am mad if i am mad mad i am and there is no help for myrddin but wretched as i am before all the world i was not always the scrag of hair and bone you see shivering on filthy haunches with flies biting his nether parts was myrddin ever king in dyfed wolf aye that he was he was he was and nevermore will be wild man of the wood i am yet while i live the creatures of the forest hearken to me for i am their lord let the forest lord speak forth his prophecy no scribes attend me no servants have i to give account of what i shall say pelleas where are you boy have you even you deserted me pelleas intelligent words are uttered to the winds wise words from the soul of wisdom go unheeded let it go let it go the bards awen will not be chained it moves as it will and no mortal hand may make bold to bid or restrain let it go fool stir up the flames read the glowing embers and tell us something of happiness great light in this bleak place you know we need some kindly cheer what is it that shines up at me from the bed of ashes behold ganieda dressed in fine linen clothed with the purity of newfallen snow bearer of my soul keeper of my heart she walks on a carpet of rose petals a peerless maid chaste before her lord her smile is as the golden sunshower her laughter like a silver rain pray to the god who made us dafyd praise him most eloquently for the gift he has given this day amen so be it my marriage day was all a day of wedding should be i have heard my grandmother speak of her marriage to elphin and the celebration that it was for unlike taliesin and charis who had no celebration and likely needed none elphin and rhonwyn had been wed in fine old celtic style and they wanted to see me wed in like manner consequently the cymry of caer cam bestowed on that gladsome day all the fire and verve of their happiness not that maelwys was to be outdone he would have hosted the celebration but ganieda was custennins daughter and custennins the feast as was his right maelwys had to content himself with housing the celebrants in truth i remember little of the day all is shadow next to the daylight of ganieda bright and shining star she was never more beautiful more graceful and serene she was love embodied for me i swear it and i hope i was for her on that fine day we two stood before dafyd in the chapel and we gave each other the gift of rings after the christian custom and spoke out the eternal promises that would bind our souls as our hearts had already been bound by love and as our bodies would be joined later that night ganiedas black hair was brushed and shining it hung in long braids entwined with silver thread she wore a circlet of spring flowers pink as a maids blush they filled the wooden chapel with their fragrance her mantle was white and white embroidered on each tassel hung a tiny gold bell over one shoulder was draped the marriage cloak she had woven that winter a fine expanse of imperial purple and bright sky blue in the cunning checked pattern of the north country it was held by a great gold brooch there were golden bracelets on her wrists and bands of gold on her arms she wore sandals of white leather on her feet the most beautiful of the fair folk she was a vision i scarcely recall what i wore no one took notice of me beside her i know i took no notice of myself in my hands i carried the slim golden tore that was my wedding gift to her she would after all be a queen and should have a tore like the great queens of old dafyd his dark robes brushed clean his face glowing like the brides beside me held up the holy text for all to see and he pronounced the marriage rite when he finished we laid our joined hands on the pages of the sacred book and repeated vows to one another as dafyd instructed whereupon he made a prayer for us in his great benevolence dafyd allowed blaise to come forward and sing the joining of our souls after the manner of the bards which he did with simple and elegant dignity the harp was deeply appreciated by all gathered in the chapel there is something about a harp and a true bards voice lifted in song that bestows great blessing on all who hear it and i think it was something taliesin would have done himself if he had lived to see his sons wedding day as the last notes of the harp faded we left the chapel emerging to find that the whole of maridunum had come to see us wed thronging the chapel yard as soon as they saw us they gave forth a mighty shout led by the warriors of my war band who acted as if they were the ones taking a queen they were so pleased but then ganieda could have conquered any army with charm alone the young men of my warband were firmly under her spell and they loved her we rode back to the villa surrounded by a noisy sea of wellwishers between the shouted blessings of the townsmen and the singing of the warband the far hills rang and rejoiced with the happy sound custennin had brought his cooks and stewards with him and all the supplies they would need for the feast including six head of fine fat cattle on the hoof a dozen casks of heavy mead and some of his good heather beer the rest pigs lambs fish mountains of turnips and tender spring vegetables he bought in the market at maridunum maelwys kept trying to get him to accept the use of his own stores but other than a few spices the cooks had forgotten to bring custennin would not hear of it ah we feasted well it brings the water to my mouth to recall it although at the time my only appetite was for ganieda it may well have been the longest day of my life would the sun never go down would the twilight never come when i would bear ganieda away to the sleepingplace that had been prepared for us to share our first night together i kept looking at the sky and finding it still light so we sang and the jars and cups went round and the meat was served up and the loaves of hot bread and the steaming vegetables and the sweetmeats we sang some more blaise and his druids provided endless music on their harps and i do not think even taliesin could have filled that hall with a better sound oh but taliesin was there he was there wolf he was there you only had to look at my mothers face to know it taliesins spirit infused the day his presence was a sweet fragrance everywhere charis had rarely appeared more fair more radiant likely she was living her own wedding day in mine mother are you enjoying yourself i asked a needless question for a blind man could have seen it oh merlin my hawk you have made me very happy she drew me to her and kissed me ganieda is a wonderful young woman then you approve how sweet of you to pretend that it mattered but since you ask yes i approve she is what every mother would have for a daughter and as a wife for her son no woman could ask for more charis put a hand to my cheek you have my blessing merlin a thousand times if once it was important for charis to say this to me since her own fathers refusal to bless her marriage is what had driven her and taliesin away even though avallach had become reconciled in the end it had caused them both considerable pain subtle are the workings of gods ways if elphin and his people had not been driven from caer dyvi if the cymry had not come to ynys avallach if charis and taliesin had not been driven from the isle of apples and if they had not come to maridunum and if and if well then i would never have been born and i would not have been taken by the hill folk and i would never have met ganieda and i would not be a king of dyfed now and this would not be my marriage day great light mover of all that is moving and at rest be my journey and my far destination be my want and my fulfilling be my sowing and my reaping be my glad song and my stark silence be my sword and my strong shield be my lantern and my dark night be my everlasting strength and my piteous weakness be my greeting and my parting prayer be my bright vision and my blindness be my joy and my sharp grief be my sad death and my sure resurrection yes charis loved ganieda a circumstance from which i derived unexpected pleasure it was joy itself to see them together fussing over the preparations before the wedding knowing that i was the object of devotion in their warm womanly hearts and the living link between them may such love increase they were both of them faery queens tall of stature and elegant in every detail perfection in movement harmony made flesh beauty embodied to see them together was to catch breath and pray thanks to the gifting god men speak foolishly of the beauty that slays though i believe such a thing may exist but there is also a beauty that heals that restores and revives all who behold it this is the beauty charis and ganieda possessed and it greatly cheered custennin and maelwys to see it those two kings glowed like men aflame with their good fortune i tell you the truth there was never a more joyous company gathered beneath one roof than gathered beneath the roof of maelwys hall that wedding day o wolf it was a fine and happy day and it was a fine and enchanting night my body was made for hers and hers for mine the delight of our lovemaking could have cheered whole nations i believe even now the smell of clean rushes and new fleece of beeswax candles and baking barley cakes makes my blood run bold in my veins we slipped unnoticed from the feast or perhaps by common consent the celebrants chose not to attend to our leaving and flew to the courtyard where pelleas had my horse saddled and ready i took the reins from him and swung myself into the saddle and reached down for ganieda and settled her before me in the saddle and with my arms around her i caught up the bundle pelleas offered and clattered from the courtyard no one gave chase as is the usual custom pretending that the woman has been carried off by a rival clansman and so must be saved and avenged it is a harmless game but such pretence had no place in our wedding there was about our marriage such an air of tightness and honour that merely to suggest otherwise would have made vulgar a sacred thing the moon shone fair among a scattering of silvergilt clouds we rode to a nearby shepherds bothy which had been prepared the day before it was a singleroomed hut of thick wattleandmud walls and a roof of deep thatch little more than a hearth and bed place maelwys serving women had done a good job of turning the rude room into a warm and inviting chamber for a young couples first night it had been swept and swept again the hearthstone scoured the walls washed with lime fresh rushes had been cut and fragrant heather for the bed which was piled high with new fleeces and a coverlet of soft otter fur candles had been set the hearth prepared and bouquets of spring flowers bunched and placed around the room as it was a warm night we lit a small fire in the hearth only enough to cook the barley bannocks which ganieda would serve to me for our ritual first meal together in the glimmering firelight the shepherds bothy could have been a palace and the clay bowl in which ganieda mixed the water and barley meal a chalice of gold ganieda might have been the enchantress of the wood and i the wandering hero entrapped by my love for her i sat crosslegged on the bed and watched her deft movements when the hearthstone was hot enough she shaped the little cakes and placed them on the stone we did not speak all the while it was as if we were no longer ourselves alone no we were all the young people who had ever loved and married joining life to life the latest in a living chain stretching back countless eons to that first hearth that first coupling there were no words for this moment the barley cakes cooked quickly and ganieda placed them gingerly in the gathered hem of her mantle and brought them to me i took one broke it and fed her with half even as i ate half myself she chewed solemnly and then turned to lift the cup she had poured out while the bannocks were baking i held the cup to her lips while she drank then drained the warm sweet wine hi a single gulp then the cup clattered to the floor and her arms were around my neck and her lips were on mine and i was tumbling backwards onto the bed ganiedas body full upon me the scent of her silky skin filling my head and then there was only the night and our passion and after the sweet deep darkness of sleep in one anothers arms i woke once before morning and heard a light whistle on the breeze i crept from the bed and looked out of the door to see outlined in the light of the sinking moon gwendolau astride his horse he rode at a respectful distance keeping watch over us through the night i slipped back beneath the coverlet and into ganiedas embrace and fell asleep once more to the rhythm of my wifes soft breathing in slumber ten deep in the black heart of celyddon with wolves and stags and grunting boars for company does myrddin abide is he alive or is he dead god alone knows o happy wolf look into the fire and tell us what you see ah the steel men yes i see them too all in steel from helm to heel big men fearless men bristling with spears like an ash forest see the knotted muscles of their arms see the quick deadly movements of their strong hands see the fearless thrust of their jaws they know that this days light might be their last but they are not afraid that one see him look at the span of his shoulders wolf see how he sits his saddle as if he was part of the beast he rides a magnificent man cai yes that is his name a name that kindles fear in the heart of the foeman here is another see him wolf a champion among champions he is his cloak is blood red and his shield bears the cross of the christ his is a name the harpers will sing for a thousand years bedwyr bright avenger and those two there oh look have you ever seen such dread purpose such grim grace sons of thunder that one is called gwalchmai hawk of may the other is gwalchaved hawk of summer they are twins one in heart one in mind one in action as alike as two may be and still be two there is no matching the swiftness of their blades each of these men is worthy of the rank of king each is a lord in his own land who is there to lead such men who can be their battle lord where is the man to be king over kings i do not see him wolf i do not see him for a long time yet no these men do not live now and not for many long years their time is not come we have time yet to find a chieftain for them wolf and we will we must the day after taliesins visit a day a year does it matter i saw the hermit as he promised squatting before my miserable cave high up hi the mountain i saw him coming a long way off he was climbing following the trickle of my spring as it wends down into the valley to join one of celyddons myriad streams he came on foot and slowly so that i had time to observe him his cloak was dun his feet were shod in high boots and he wore a widebrimmed hat on his head to keep off the sun a strange hermit i thought to travel in such array as he approached i saw that his steps were purposeful deliberate his was not the aimless gait of a wandering wayfarer he knew his destination it was this very cave and him who lived within he had come to hart fell to find mad merlin find him he did i give you good greeting friend he called when he saw me watching him i waited until he came closer there was no use in shouting at him will you sit there is water if you thirst he stood a moment looking round at last his eyes came to rest on me they were sky blue and just as cold and empty as the heaven above him i would not shun a cup of water the spring is there i told him indicating where the water ran from the rock i said nothing about a cup he smiled and went to the spring bent and sucked in a few mouthfuls of water enough for appearance sake i thought not enough to satisfy real thirst and yet he had no waterskin with him when he sat down again he removed his hat and i saw hair as yellow as flax like that of a saecsen prince but his speech was good briton tell me friend what do you up here i might ask the same of you i grunted by way of answer it is no secret he said laughing i have come to find a man and have you found him yes how fortunate for you he smiled broadly you are the one they call merlin ambrosius myrddin the emrys are you not who would call me that perhaps you are not aware of the things men are saying about you perhaps it does not interest me what men say he laughed again as if the sound should win me but the laughter like the smile did not touch his eyes come now you must be somewhat curious they are saying you are a king of the fair folk that you are divine they say you are a mighty warrior invincible do they say also that i am mad are you mad yes no madman would speak so rationally he assured me perhaps you only feign madness why would any man feign that which is most hateful to him to make himself seem mad i suppose the wanderer answered thoughtfully which would be madness itself would it not the stranger laughed again and instantly i hated the sound speak plainly now i said challenging him what do you want of me he met my challenge with his empty smile just to speak with you a little you have come a long way for nothing then i do not wish to speak to anyone perhaps you would not mind listening he replied picking up a stick he scratched in the dirt for a few moments then looked up at me suddenly and finding my eyes on him said i am not without influence in this world i could do things for you do this for me then if your influence extends so far go away i could do great things for you myrddin emrys tell me what you want anything you desire myrddin i will do it or see that it is done i have told you what i desire he moved closer do you know who i am should i perhaps not but i know who you are i know you myrddin you see i am an emrys too at his words a slow inexorable dread crept over me i felt very old and very weak he reached out to me and his touch was cold as stone i can help you myrddin he went on let me help you i need no ones help this place is a palace i told him lifting my hand to my barren surroundings i have all i need i can give you all you desire i desire peace i snapped can you give me that i can give you forgetting it amounts to the same thing in the end forgetting that would be a blessing the hateful images pursue me they haunt my waking they steal my sleep to forget ah but at what price it seems to me that i might forget the good along with the bad i told him the stranger grinned happily and shrugged good bad what of that it is all the same in the end he leaned still closer i can do more for you i can give you power myrddin authority such as you have never dreamed existed it can be yours i am content with such power as i have why should merlin the wild need more his answer was quick and i wondered how many others he had tempted with his vapid promises oh yes i knew who he was now my time with dafyd was never in vain and though i was no longer certain of the guiding hand i could see no sense in going over to the enemy myrddin he said making my name a mockery on his lips it is such a little thing for me to do i would do it in an instant look he raised his stick and pointed out across celyddons dark folds to the east there is where the sun rises myrddin there is where the heart of the empire beats and i seemed to see glimmering on the far horizon the imperial city with its strong walls and palaces as emperor you would i rule the world you could destroy the hated saecsens once and for all think of all the suffering you could save one wave of your hand myrddin that is all it would take he held out his hand to me come with me myrddin together we could make you the greatest emperor this world has ever seen you would be rich beyond all riches your name would last for ever but myrddin would not i told him you would see to that as well be gone i am tired are you such an honourable man he spat contemptuously are you so righteous words words i claim nothing myrddin look at me why will you not look at me we are friends you and i your lord has left you myrddin it is time to find one more trustworthy come with me his fingers were nearly touching mine now come but we must go at once why is it that when you speak i hear only the vacant howl of the tomb that made him angry his face changed and he was formidable you think you are better than i am i will destroy you myrddin as you destroyed morgian his eyes gleamed maliciously she is beautiful is she not death wears many faces i said but its stench is always the same the heat of his anger leapt up instantly i give you one last chance in fact i give you morgian my finest creation he assumed a soothing aspect as he thought of this new tactic she is yours merlin do what you like with her yes you will be her master take her you can even kill her if you wish destroy her as she destroyed your father black anger swarmed before my eyes like wasps my body began to shake i tasted bile on my tongue i jumped to my feet you destroyed my father i cried hearing my voice echo in the long valley below i stood and put two fingers in my mouth and whistled high and long leave while you can you cannot send me away the creature said i go when and where i will at that moment the shewolf came running up the trail snarling ears flat to her head fangs bared he laughed do not think to frighten me away nothing on earth can harm me no in the name of jesu the christ be gone the wolf closed on him he turned and dodged aside as she leapt jaws slashing for his throat still he had moved and was already fleeing back down the mountainside as wolf gathered herself for a second leap she would have given chase but i called her to my side where still snarling i patted her head until the hackles melted into her back and she was calm once more so my first visitor left me without a farewell i was still trembling when wolf growled once more low in her throat a warning growl i looked down the defile thinking to see the stranger returning and there was someone approaching but even from a fair distance i could tell it was another he was a gaunt stick of a creature rough featured and hairy wearing pelts of at least six different beasts he stumped up the mountainside with the long regular strides of one used to long journeys afoot looking neither right nor left but coming on apace and well he might for a storm had sprung up out of nothing as it can do in the mountains rags of black clouds were flying down the mountainside and i could taste rain on the cooling wind mist rolled over the rocks taking the visitor from my sight i waited comforting the shewolf at my side be still wolf we will hear what this one has come to say perhaps this guest will be more to our liking although that did not appear likely because of taliesins promise i was of a mind to see it through he came in sight again stepping from the mist when he drew near and hailed us in a bold voice hail wild man of the wood i bring you greetings from the world of men sit down friend there is water if you thirst water will serve where wine is scarce he replied i watched him as he scooped water into his hand and slurped it up noisily he did not appear a man overused to holding the guest cup but what of that did i look a king of dyfed it is thirsty work climbing this slate mountain of yours myrddin how do you know my name if it is my name oh i have known you for a very long time should a servant not know his master i stared at him his face was long and horsy his brows black his cheeks red from the sun and wind his hair hung to his shoulders loose like a womans i know i had never seen him before you speak of masters and servants what makes you think i have anything to do with either i asked and then framed a more pertinent question how did you know where to find me the one who sent me told me where to find you that was all he said but his words made my heart leap within me who sent you a friend does this friend have a name everyone has a name as you well know he scooped up more water and then wiped his hands on his skin jerkin my name for instance is annwas adeniawc a most unusual name it meant ancient winged servant i see no wings and you are not as ancient as your name implies and there are indeed many masters in this world and even more servants all mortals serve myrddin immortals also but i have not come to talk about me i have come to talk about you then you have come for no purpose the words were out before i could stop them do not send him away taliesin had said i need not have worried for my visitor took no notice of my rudeness once loosened the tongue wags on does it not this was said with great good humour annwas apparently enjoyed himself he glanced around my screecovered abode and then turned his eyes to the west over the vast rumpled bearskin of celyddon men say the light dies in the west he remarked casually but if i told you it rises there would you believe it would it matter very much what i believed myrddin he shook his head lightly i should have thought that all these years of solitary meditation would have taught you something about the power of belief has it been many years then more than a few why come to me now the narrow bones of his shoulders hunched in a shrug my lord wills it am i to know your lord but you do know him myrddin at least you once did annwas turned to look at me directly i felt sympathy flowing out from him he bent his long frame and settled crosslegged on the bare ground tell me now he said softly tell me about the battle it was then that the rain began eleven the first drops splattered over us but neither one moved the storm grew staining the sky violet and black like a wound from which the rain gushed like blood the battle myrddin i have come to hear you tell it annwas held my gaze in his and made no move despite the rain it was a moment before i could speak what battle would that be i asked dreading the answer darkness swirled around me around the mountain itself in the form of a midnight mist that boiled out of nowhere a rising wind began wailing among the crags driving the rain i think you know said annwas gently and it seems to me you know a great many things no man can possibly know of another i glared at him feeling the wrath seethe in my soul once again the wind screamed my defiance tell me he insisted gently but his insistence was firm as rock it will come easier once you begin leave me i hated him for making me exhume those longdead bones the shewolf leapt to her feet snarling annwas lifted his hand to her and she subsided with a whimper myrddin the voice was soft as a mothers crooning to her babe you will be healed but first we must cut out the disease that poisons your soul i am happy as i am i gasped breath came hard to me the wind howled now and cold rain fell in stinging sheets upon us annwas adeniawc reached out his boney hand and touched my arm no one is happy in hell myrddin you have carried your burden long enough it is time to lay it down burden it may be but it is all i have left i screamed tears of rage and pain mingling with the rain on my face the hermit rose and went into my cave i sat where i was until he called me when i looked there was a fire burning brightly just inside the entrance come in from the rain annwas said i will cook us something to eat while we talk how long has it been since i had warm food in my belly i wondered and found myself going in to join him i do not know where he found the small pot to hold the meaty stew nor where he got the meat nor the grain to make the bread but as i watched him prepare the meal and smelled it cooking the fight went out of me and i began haltingly to tell him and god help me i told him everything ganieda went north that spring to her fathers house in celyddon it seems a woman needs to be near her own when a babe is born i was against it but my wife could be a most persuasive woman and in the end ganieda had her way i arranged the journey taking every precaution seeing to every detail personally for i knew i would not be able to travel with her she sought to reassure me it will be lovely in goddeu in the summer you come when you can my soul elma will be so surprised she kissed me you are right to have a care for the journey but nothing will happen to me it is not an afternoons ride in the woods ganieda no no it is not and you are right to remind me but i am not so far along with child that sitting a horse will be a hardship she stood up straight and smoothed her mantle over her stillflat stomach see i have not even begun to show besides i am a most fearsome hand with a spear am i not love i will be safe jesu i should have gone with her anyway i could not for one moment imagine having a baby without elma to help me she continued elma was midwife to her mother and the nearest thing to a mother ganieda remembered and as i said a woman needs to be with her own when the birth pangs begin you worry for nothing myrddin gwendolau rides to meet us and if i do not leave soon he will be here even before i start out better still i remarked come with me then ah ganieda you know i cannot the towers the horses the warband must be trained she stepped close and put her hands on my shoulders as she settled lightly in my lap where i sat in my chair come with me husband i sighed we had had this discussion before i will follow as soon as i can i told her it was only a few months ganieda had to set out now while she could still make the journey safely and in some comfort i was to follow when my summers work was finished joining her in the autumn the babe would not be born until deep winter so there was plenty of time for us to be together once i arrived in goddeu the crops were well in when she finally set out i sent her with thirty of my warband and she took four of her women for company half as many would have sufficed but i was of a mind to be cautious and maelwys agreed insisting that it was better safe than sorry i would do the same if i stood in your place he told me it was still early in what was coming to be known as the warring season so the actual risk of the travellers running into trouble on the road was notgreat also i had devised a route that kept them well away from the coasts the only likely danger would be when they reached the wall and by then gwendolau would have met them and they would be a force of fifty or more there was no danger so ganieda left maridunum one bright morning with her escort and i watched her go feeling the warmth of her lips on my mouth as she turned her mount and joined the others leaving the yard and striking off along the old road oh it was a jolly band and why not ganieda was going home to have our baby and the world was a wondrous place she waved farewell to me until she was out of sight and i waved too until the flank of the hill took her from view then i said a prayer for her safety not the first nor the last mind you and went about my duties a balmy summer followed close on the heels of spring the thirty returned in due time with the report that all had been well on the road and after they had seen ganieda to her fathers house and stayed there to rest the horses for a few days before turning back custennin was delighted to have his daughter home and sent his regards and the message that all was well with him and his realm it was a quiet summer for them there had been no raids i was relieved at last and turned my attention to finishing my tasks so that i might ride after her as soon as may be maelwys and i worked hard dawn to dusk every day and retired to our beds exhausted more than once pelleas had to wake me from my chair at the table so that i could stumble to my chamber charis had charge of the kings household and servants so that we could collapse each night with food in our bellies without having to think about that too or i fear we might have starved the watchtowers along the coast were mostly finished and the relay towers inland well begun the new men had received their first summers training our horse herd had been increased by twentyeight sturdy colts and a few hides of land cleared for future grazing you see already i was thinking of horses breeding for size strength courage and endurance it was to be a fight won on horseback by a force of mounted fighting men like the old roman ala well we had an early autumn and at last i could leave i chose thirty to go with me rather i took thirty from the three hundred who clamoured to be allowed to ride at my side i have no idea why i took that many it had been in my mind to take only a third of that number but when the time came the choice was not so easily made and i had not the heart to turn them away it took but a day to gather supplies and provisions and we set out for celyddon the days were indeed golden it had been a good summer and bountiful crops were coming under the scythe everywhere the herds appeared healthy and well grown every holding and settlement boasted new dwellings and occasionally even a hall the fear that had grown in the land with the last few years had receded a good deal given even a brief respite from the worrying raids everywhere men were encouraged and hopeful after many days on the trail we came to yr widdfa a bleak and forsaken land when compared to the rich south but even here summer had worked its manifold miracles and the flocks had swelled their numbers and men were content we camped one starfilled night in a high mountain pass and awakened to frost on the mountain heather we saddled our snorting mounts and started down that morning into the stepped lowlands falling away towards the wall the day was dazzling clear and i could see celyddons dark mass spreading on the far horizon a few more days and we would reach its outermost fringe a few days after that and i would sleep once more in ganiedas arms when we reached the forest i sent scouts on ahead to announce our arrival custennin would welcome the news i knew and so would ganieda oh my soul was restlessness itself our long separation had been harder on me than i knew for the thought of holding her again filled me with an exquisite ache my saddle became a prison and time could not pass quickly enough i slept little thoughts of ganieda and our child made me fretful in my desire to be with her i had so much to tell her about all that had happened in her absence i believe i would have ridden through the night if that were possible in tangled celyddon my torment was sweet but it was torment all the same at last however at last the day of arrival dawned and i was awake before anyone else knowing that if we rode hard we could reach custennins palace by midday the scouts would have reached them the night before i reckoned and ganieda would be waiting i meant to make her wait as short as possible the wood awakened around us as we rode through the nightquiet forest along the narrow track we stopped a little after sunrise and broke fast i allowed the men to dismount but only while they ate and then it was back in the saddle and hurrying on at midday we reached the crest of the last hill where the track widened somewhat as it wound down through the forest towards goddeu we could not see custennins stronghold of course but we were close the first warning came a little while later we had stopped at a stream to rest and water the horses before continuing on the last stretch of the journey a few of my men had crossed the stream to give more room to those behind and they had spread out along the bank i heard a shout as i knelt scooping water to my mouth lord myrddin my name echoed in the close wood lord myrddin here i am i answered what is it one of my fourthyear warriors came running to me lord myrddin i have found something you should see what is it balach i read nothing save concern from the look on his face mantracks in the mud lord he raised his arm to point downstream from us just there how many i would not like to say my lord should see for himself show me where they are he led me downstream to the place he had indicated i splashed my way through the water to the other side of the stream and there on the muddy bank i saw the footprints of a score or more men there were no footprints on the opposite bank the group had not crossed the stream they had come out of it saecsens it was something saecsens did when travelling in heavily forested country follow the natural pathway of the stream this is how they traversed difficult country unknown to them and now they had come to celyddon what is more they were ahead of us how far ahead i could only guess the tracks were still fairly fresh not more than a few hours old unfamiliar with the land they would go slowly we might overtake them on horseback great light help us catch them i gave the order to mount up at once and told my warriors to ready their arms and to remain alert to an ambush then we rode our precautions seemed unnecessary we saw no more tracks and if i had not seen them myself i would have thought balach had imagined them although we stopped from time to time simply to listen we heard nothing but the light chatter of squirrels and the scolding of crows we rode on towards goddeu and despite die apparent peace of the wood deep foreboding drew over me a dread to make my heart leaden in my chest fear came at me from out of the sunfilled forest whispers of disquiet of hushed alarm i raced ahead then the horses grew nervous i believe they can smell blood at a fair distance well in front of the warband now i crested a knoll and came into view of goddeu quiet beside the mirrorsmooth lake the sun shone full on the trail ahead and i saw the bodies there i spurred my horse forward to the place and flung myself from my saddle it was a party of women oh good god no ganieda i knelt and turned over the first one a maid with dark braids her throat had been severed the next had been pierced through the heart and the front of her white mantle was stained deepest crimson the body was still warm ganieda my soul where are you i stumbled unseeing to a knot of tumbled corpses what the brutal saecsen axes had done to those oncebeautiful bodies made me weep and gnash my teeth some had been ravaged before being murdered and their clothing had been torn from their limbs for the love of god the ugly wounds between their legs all had died horribly may heaven shut me out for ever i wish that i had died that day there were seven young women in that group but ganieda was not among them oh please loving father my heart grasped that tiny hope as i lurched on behind me the first of the warband were thundering up i do not know what made me turn from the track perhaps the soft shimmer of pale blue among the shadows i walked towards the fallen tree an old stump long dead there on the far side were two more women slumped across the body of a third i lifted them aside gently gently ganiedas women had died protecting their lady with their own bodies but the barbarians had seen ganieda was pregnant oh they had made great sport of killing her great light i cannot bear it oh annwas i see her body before me i feel its fleeting warmth in my hands i taste again her blood on my lips as i kiss her cold cheek i cannot bear it please do not make me tell it but you want to hear you want to hear me say the thing most hateful to me of all i know very well i will tell it all so that all may know my anguish and my shame ganieda had taken many wounds her mantle was sodden with thickening blood and rent in several places as they had tried to strip her naked one lovely breast had been carved from her body and her proud swelling stomach had been run through with the point of a sword loving god please no stabbed not once but again and again and yet again my legs would not hold me i fell across the body of my beloved a great cry of grief tearing from my throat i raised myself and held ganiedas beautiful face in my hands it was not beautiful any more but twisted in horrific agony bespattered with blood her clear eyes cloudy and unseeing beasts barbarians and then i saw it protruding from one of the stomach wounds dearest god reaching for life it would never know was a tiny unborn hand blue and still minutely veined its tiny wrist extending from the wall of the dead womb the hand of my babe my darling child twelve thunder boomed in my head voices like angry hornets buzzed loud in my ears beasts barbarians the ground rolled away on every side like the swelling sea i stumbled fell picked myself up and ran merciful father i ran vomiting bile gagging choking running on behind me came a shout and the ringing scrape of men drawing steel the horn sounded the saecsens had been sighted farewell ganieda my soul i loved you better than my life it was a different merlin who turned to meet the foe that day my sword was in my hand whirling flashing the regal blade of avallach and my horse was careering headlong into a company of saecsen warriors but i have no memory of drawing sword or reining horse to the fight merlin was no longer present i stood off and watched from a very great distance as an unthinking unfeeling body performed the practised actions of war the body was mine but merlin had fled i saw faces rise before me grim faces mouthing strange curses to unknown gods hatefilled faces vanishing beneath flailing hooves hideous faces writhing on severed heads as my sword carried them off the battle frenzy was on me i burned with it and the enemy felt the white heat of my killing rage none could stand against me and as the enemy force was a small one it was easily overcome as the rest of my warband gathered to me some of them wiping blood from their weapons i sat in the saddle staring blankly into the sun my sword resting on my thigh i felt a hand on my arm lord merlin began pelleas what is it his voice was as tender as a mothers with a fevered child what did you see the smoke from custennins stronghold ascended before us and on the wind came the sound of shouting in the distance i lifted the reins in my hands and urged my mount forward lord merlin pelleas asked but i did not answer i could not speak besides what answer could i make the barbarians we had engaged on the road had been returning to watch the ford perhaps to ambush anyone on the trail and prevent them from coming to custennins aid their main party had gone ahead to attack goddeu even as my warband took this in i was away my horse pounding down the slope towards the lake that lay between us and custennins timber halls as before my body moved of its own accord i knew nothing of what i did only that which one man might observe of a stranger i was first to the fight throwing myself into the thick of it if there was a conscious thought at all i believe it was that one of the saecsens hated axes would swiftly find my heart they had fired the first buildings they came to smoke roiled through the air black and thick fair folk dead lay on the ground mostly women overtaken while hastening to the safety of the hall i dropped six enemy before they knew i was among them and five more saecsens died before they could lift blade against me it was a band of forty all told and with my thirty and those of custennins men who were not away on a days hunting with gwendolau we easily outnumbered the enemy and made short work of them in truth it was over almost before it began my men had dismounted and were cleaning their weapons and looking among the dead for the wounded beginning to assess the damage and take account of the losses when we heard horses thundering into the settlement gwendolau and his hunting party had seen the smoke and they had ridden off their horses hooves returning to the defence of their home they came flying in all alather gwendolau at their head with baram at his side he took in me situation before him even as he drew his horse to a halt he looked to his father first who was standing with a hand on the collar of one of his dogs trying to keep the animal from further worrying the throatless corpse before him and then he saw me myrddin you he began the quick smile of relief faded as the implication of what he saw hit him not even custennin had guessed as yet no he cried startling those around him anew ganieda he ran to me seizing the bridle strap myrddin she was going out to greet you she was so happy she he turned horrorfilled eyes to the way we had come thinking i suppose to see her returning safely behind us and knowing he would not he looked to me for an answer but i sat mute before him the brother of my beloved who was no less brother to me custennin came forward whether he also knew what had happened to his daughter i will never know for in the same instant we heard a sound to make the blood run cold a low booming horn like a hunting horn but lower meaner a brutal hateful rasping sound created to inspire terror and despair in those who must face it it was the first time i had heard it though not the last dear god in heaven not the last yet though i had never heard it i knew well enough what it was the great battlehorn of the saecsen warhost we fifty turned as one man to see our doom sweeping down the hill to meet us a massed saecsen battlehost five hundred strong they ran to join battle screaming as they came i swear the ground trembled beneath their pounding feet some of the younger warriors had not encountered saecsens in full battle array before it was still rare enough then and they saw the halfnaked fearless barbarians flying towards us war axes glinting cruelly in the hard light their powerful legs racing racing like death to embrace us their long wheatcoloured braids flying as they came i heard more than one man curse the day of his birth and prepare to die when he beheld that awful sight we were outmanned ten to one it took no scholar to reckon that but we were a mounted warband and a battletrained horse is an incalculable asset in a fight especially against saecsens and their like who fight only on foot the fear all had felt at seeing the enemy was thrust aside as men remounted and readied themselves for the attack gwendolau called my name but i did not respond for i was already spurring my horse forward i intended to meet the whole saecsen host alone there were shouts for me to rein up to halt and wait and then gwendolau took command and organized the charge dividing our small force into two groups to try to split the onrushing wave our only hope lay in penetrating their battle line smashing through once and again again and again wearing at them taking as many as we could out of the fight each time but never allowing them to close on us or surround us we were too few and they were too many we could not survive a pitched battle as for me i had no hope at all i had no plan no volition but to ride and fight and kill to slay as many of my beloveds murderers as possible before being slain myself i tell you i did not care to live i did not care to continue breathing the air of this world if my ganieda was not also alive to breathe it lord death you have taken my heart and soul you must also take me the wind of my passing whistled along the upraised blade in my hand my mounts ironshod hooves dug into the soft ground and flung the turf skyward my cloak flew out behind me like a great wing and i screamed yes i screamed at the devils spawn before me my voice awesome and terrible rending heaven with its cry earth and sky bear witness i am a man see how i die see how my sword breaks forth flashing lightning see how my shield dazzles like the noontide sun see how my arm strikes fierce judgement make ready your graves earth open wide your insatiable maw to swallow the food i give you gather your mists and clouds sky weave your sombre vapours to make a funeral shroud for the dead i bring you hear and obey i myrddin emrys command you i screamed and my scream was terrible to hear i laughed and my laughter was more terrible still alone i flew to meet the saecsen host alone i hurtled towards them bereft of sense and feeling insane the tall horsetail standard which the saecsen carried into battle loomed before me a cross on a pole bearing a wolfs skull on either end of the crosspiece with a human skull in the middle and the three fringed with horsetails of red and black i drove straight towards the thing with the point of my sword i do not know what i thought or what i intended to do but the force of my charge was such that upon reaching the battleline the first enemy i encountered were simply swept beneath my steeds pummelling hooves and i was carried well into their midst as i made for the standard the standardbearer a tall muscled chieftain dodged to the side my blade came level and with the momentum of my charge behind it neatly sliced the solid pole in half as if it had been a dry reed the saecsen battlechief an enormous brute with pale yellow hair hanging in long braids from his temples stood beneath the standard with his house carles around him staring in amazement as the emblem sank like a stone the cry of outrage reached my ears as a mild and distant sound for i had once again entered that uncanny state where the actions of others were as languorous and slow as those of men halfasleep the flying careering warhost became a massive lumbering thing heavyfooted and dull without speed or quickness overcome by a languid torpor once again as in the battle at maridunum i became invincible dealing death with every wellcalculated blow hewing down mighty warriors with effortless strokes my movements perfect in their deadly grace the clash of battle reached my ears like the sound of water washing a faroff shore i moved with elegant precision striking boldly and with vengeance my sword a living thing a streaming crimson dragon spitting doom the enemy fell before me i carved a swathe through their close ranks as if i was the scythe and they the corn standing for harvest i struck and struck and death fell with every stroke like judgement the battle surged around me gwendolaus charge had succeeded in driving through the enemy the first time but the second charge had bogged down there were simply too many saecsens against us and we were too few horsemen even when a man killed with every stroke as my men did two more barbarians leapt up to drag him from the saddle before his blade was clear of the dead weight i did what i could for those closest to me but my charge had carried me into the centre of the saecsen warhost out of reach of most of my warband all around me i saw good men dragged down and hacked to death by those wicked axes there was nothing i could do about it the battlelord a fairhaired giant rose up before me with an enormous hammer in his hand slavering with rage he bellowed his challenge to me and planted his feet swinging diat hammer thicksinewed shoulders and arms bulging with the effort he stood like an oak tree as i urged my horse towards him sunlight glinted in his yellow hair his blue eyes clear and unafraid taunting me the hammer in his hands dripping blood and brains from the skulls he had smashed i spun towards him and waited until he swung the hammer up for the killing blow my first stroke ripped low across his unprotected stomach a lesser man would have fallen but the golden giant stood his ground and swung the hammer down with such force that his wound burst blood and entrails gushed forth and i laughed to see it the hammer swung wide and as his hands came down to grab his belly i plunged the point of my sword through his throat dark blood spewed out over my hand he stood a moment his eyes rolling up in their sockets then collapsed i jerked the blade free laughing laughing roaring with the absurdity of it i had slain the saecsen battlechief he had murdered my wife and unborn child and i had felled that great brute with a childs trick it was simply too absurd for words i wept with laughter until i tasted the tears in my mouth when their war chief went down the barbarians fell into confusion they had lost their leader but not their heart and none of the coldblooded ruthlessness either they still fought with crazy courage if anything losing their leader inspired them to higher more reckless valour now they fought for the honour of accompanying then battlelord into valhalla the great hall of warriors in their wretched otherworld so be it i helped as many as possible earn that privilege but my sword brothers were not so fortunate too many of them were driven down that day i remember turning as the tide of battle receded from me momentarily turning and looking out over the field to see only a small handful of my valiant warband still holding their own against the barbarians so few and they were all that was left i made to ride towards them but the gap closed again and they were lost that was the last i ever saw of them alive a dreadful earnestness stole over me a murderous fury i slashed and struck with all my strength as if my heart would burst i killed and killed again i began to fear that there would not be enough enemy to slake my thirst for blood i gazed about me and there were more dead now than living and i despaired here i am here is merlin take me mine was the only voice on the field the barbarians stared at me with cowstupid eyes mute before my righteous rage the strength going out of their hands come to me i cried you who exult in death come to me i will cover you in glory i will give you the delight of your hearts such a splendid death i will give you come receive the doom you deserve they looked at one another with wide and staring eyes there must have been seventy or more of them left to face me oh the fighting had been cruel but i blazed ann was i blazed with a fierce and righteous fire and the enemy quailed to see it their courage flowed away like water they stood staring and i raised my blade and called upon heaven to witness their destruction then i put spurs to my mount and that spirited animal responded though its head drooped and its nostrils streamed blood it lifted its hooves and bolted straight towards the barbarians the sun itself was dim compared to the brightness of my blade as i hacked and hewed through them seventy men and none could lift an axe against me they fell like toppled oaks going down into deaths dark cavern clutching their wounds and crying blood soaked the soil beneath their feet staining the turf the colour of wine they could not stand up for the blood i chopped with my sword cleaving their unprotected heads from crown to chin they dropped dead to the bloodwet earth the slaughter was appalling in the end the few who still lived threw down their weapons turned and fled but even these did not escape my vengeance i rode them down from behind galloping over their stumbling bodies turning upon them again and again until not one remained in the world of the living then it was over i sat in my saddle and gazed out over a hideous carnage saecsens lay thick on the ground and i screamed at them get up get up you dead take up your arms arise and fight i taunted them i challenged them i screamed at them and cursed them even in death but there was no longer anyone to hear my taunts five hundred saecsens lay dead upon the ground and it was not enough my grief my hate my rage still burned within me ganieda was dead and our child with her and gwendolau custennin baram pelleas balach and all the brave men of my warband all the quick and bright their hearts beating and breath in their lungs alive to love and light now were stiffening corpses my friends my wife my brothers were dead and the blood price i claimed that day mighty though it was could not pay the debt oh annwas winged messenger i myself slaughtered hundreds hundreds do you hear hundreds and it was not enough i looked out on the battlefield shimmering in the heat haze of a midday sun so still so still and silent save for the croak of the circling birds for already the carrion crows were flocking picking at the eyes of the dead in this i knew the stark reality of war all men friend and foe alike are food for the scavenging beasts i saw lord death moving among the tumbled corpses rubbing his fleshless hands and grinning his lipless smile as he gazed upon my wonderful work he greeted me well done myrddin such a handsome harvest i am pleased my son my horror could not be contained dark mist rose up before my eyes the voices of the dead filled my ears with cries of sharp accusation the bloody earth mocked me sky and sun jeered the wind laughed i fled the field seeking refuge in celyddons deep black heart i fled to the nameless hills to the rockbound mountains to this barren outcrop with its cave and spring and here annwas here is all myrddin wylts kingdom here is where i have dwelt and ever shall dwell death you have taken all the others why have you not taken me thirteen i raised my head and looked out across the nightfilled valleys the storm had passed and the stars shone brightly the air was scented with pine and heather and from the forest below came the bark of a hunting wolf a single short cry in the darkness at my feet wolf pricked her ears her golden eyes flicked to mine but she did not move the small fire annwas had made still burned the pot bubbled and the cakes were baked he sat watching me his face sorrowful and serene do you hate me now annwas i asked in the silence of the snapping fire now that you know what i have done do you despise me for it he did not answer but picked up a bowl and ladled stew into it and offered it out to me i can hate no man he replied gently offering me the bowl and this is not a time for judgement he broke one of the little loaves he had made and handed it to me we will eat now and you will feel better we ate together in silence the food was good and i did feel better the fire warmed me and the stew how long had it been since i had meat in my stomach soon made me drowsy i sopped the last of my broth with the bread and stuffed that into my mouth then laid the bowl aside and drew my cloak around me sleep now myrddin annwas told me sleep well it seemed only an instant but when i opened my eyes again the newrisen sun flamed the high peaks and larksong fell golden from the sky annwas had the fire burning brightly and had brought water in the pot for me to drink so you are still here i observed pouring water into my bowl and lifting the bowl to my mouth i am he nodded i am not going back with you i told him bluntly that will be your decision myrddin then you are wasting your time i will not leave this place as you have said but i tell you i have not come to take you away from here what did he want from me then why have you come to save you myrddin do i look in need of saving your work is not finished he replied in the world of men affairs continue apace and darkness covers nigh all it has even reached these shores yes the great darkness men have feared is here it has gained a foothold on the island of the mighty i glared at him for his words disturbed me more than i liked what do you expect me to do about it i tell you merely what is ann was handed me half of the second loaf he had made the night before what you do about it is for you to decide who are you annwas adeniawc why have you come to me like this he smiled gently i have told you myrddin i am your friend then he rose and stepped to the cave entrance come with me now where i demanded suspiciously there is a stream in the glen below yes we must go there that was all he said he turned and started down the trail i watched him go for a moment and decided that i would not go but he stopped turned and beckoned me i rose and followed the stream was not large but it was running with the rain from the night before and there were deep pools round the boulders and it was into one of these pools that annwas led me set aside your cloak myrddin he instructed stepping into the water and your clothing my clothing as he generously called it was little more than a filthcrusted loincloth it fell from me as i shrugged it off i have already been baptized i said i know replied annwas holding out his hand to me i just want to wash you i can wash myself i drew back na na i know i know but come let me do it for you this once i stepped into the cold water my flesh prickled and i began shivering annwas took my hand and brought me to stand facing him he dipped water with the bowl in his hand and poured it over me then he produced a chunk of soap the hard yellow kind such as the old celts used to make in huge blocks for the whole clan from which each household carved off what it needed and he began to wash me he washed my arms and chest then turned me to scrub my back sit he commanded and i sat down on a nearby rock while he washed my legs and my nasty matted hair and beard all this he did quickly and cheerfully as if it were his lifes chief fulfilment i allowed him to do it thinking it strange to be washed like this me a grown man being washed by another grown man but it did not feel strange it felt comforting more it felt appropriate this i imagined was how the emperors of the east came to their thrones oh it was good to be clean clean how long had it been how long he washed my hair and then to my surprise although nothing about annwas should have surprised me by now he brought out scissors and a razor of the greek variety and kneeling before me in the water he set about shaving me first clipping the tangled curls short then scraping the skin smooth with the honed edge when he finished he laved water over me with the bowl and then said arise myrddin and go forth to meet the day i stood water streaming from me feeling the sickness of all the sick years the years of waste and grief and death flow away i stood and that sick skin sloughed from me and i was clean once more clean and in my right mind i stepped from the rock pool and picked up my cloak though loth was i to put on that filthy thing again annwas had foreseen my predicament leave the cloak where it is you will not need it well perhaps he was right the sun was bright and warm still it would not always be so the mountains were cold at night i would need it then i stooped to pick it up again leave it he said and he turned to point down the trail see he said one comes who will dress you in clothes appropriate to your rank i looked where he was pointing and heaven bless me i did see a lone figure toiling up the track leading two saddled horses who is it i turned to annwas who had come to stand beside me someone whose love has carried you further than you will ever know his words seared into my heart but his glance did not condemn me he comes and i must go stay friend i put out my hand to him i have done what i came to do will we meet again he held his head to one side for a moment as if appraising me no i think that will not be necessary stay i insisted please stay myrddin he said gently gripping my hand tightly in his own i have ever been with you one of the horses on the trail below whinnied i turned to see that the man labouring up the trail had approached more closely and his form seemed familiar who could it be i took a step closer farewell myrddin annwas called and when i turned towards him he was gone farewell annwas adeniawc until we meet again i called and then sat down on the rock to wait until my visitor should present himself to me fourteen i did not have long to wait for the man followed the trail up through the scree directly to the stream where i sat upon my rock he did not see me his eyes were raised to the cave still some way above where he meant to find me i should have recognized him but did not he laboured up the trail and when he made to stop at the stream i stood thereby giving him considerable fright meeting a naked man on a mountainside at sunrise was not what he expected greetings friend i said as i stood forgive me for startling you that was not my intention oh he gave a little shout as he jumped back as one might from a viper but instantly his face changed i knew him then but the truth could not be accepted at once and he recognized me my lord merlin he dropped the reins and sank to his knees tears starting into his eyes his hands shook as he reached out to me and he grinned like one demented with delight oh my lord merlin i dared not hope i stepped towards him hesitantly pelleas my lord happy tears streamed down his face he clutched at my hand and clasped it to him his body quivering with excitement pelleas i still could not believe it pelleas are you really here i am here my master pelleas is here i have found you at last i shivered with a chill and he came to himself somewhat although still ecstatic he jumped up and ran to the horses which had wandered a few paces and delving into the bag behind the saddle of the second horse brought out a brightly coloured bundle you are cold he said but these will warm you he unwrapped the bundle and began spreading clothing out on a boulder i drew on the finelywoven yellow tunic and blueandblack checked trousers then sat down and pulled on the soft brown leather boots and tied them at the knee when i stood up again pelleas held out for me a deep blue cloak edged all around with wolf fur it was a cloak made for a king indeed it was my own cloak remade my old hill folk wolfskin newsewn i gathered it over my shoulders and he stepped before me with a brooch in his hands i recognized the ornament two stags facing their antlers entwined ruby eyes gleaming fiercely at one another the brooch had belonged to taliesin it was one of the treasures charis kept in her wooden chest at ynys avallach pelleas saw my wondering look as he fastened the fold of my cloak your mother sends this with her greetings suddenly there were so many things i wanted to know so many questions i needed to ask i asked the first that occurred to me but pelleas how did you know where to find me i did not know my lord he said simply he fastened and stepped away there you are a king once more you mean i stared at him you mean you have been searching for me all this time these many years it has been years has it not of course it has look at you pelleas you are a grown man now i pelleas tell me how long has it been how long have i been away you have been away a fair time lord many years a good many yes lord a good many how many he shrugged not so many that the name of myrddin emrys is not still remembered and revered in the land in fact your fame has increased most wonderfully there is not a corner of the island of the mighty that does not know and fear you he fell to his knees once more oh merlin my master i am so happy to have found you at last how you must have searched have you never stopped searching until this moment never and if i had not found you just now i would have gone on searching i was awed by his devotion to me and shamed by it i turned away from him i am not worthy of your sacrifice pelleas god alone is worthy of such devotion as one cares for another does he not also care for god i heard a certain priest in his words you have been listening to brother dafyd bishop dafyd he said smiling bishop is he now tell me how is he well pelleas replied well and happy he is run off his legs by his monastery but men half his age cannot keep up with him his heart is young still and he is well indeed he is the marvel of the realm and maelwys does he fare as well my lord maelwys has joined his fathers i do not know what answer i expected but i felt maelwys loss sharply then and it came to me what my absence from the world of men had meant and elphin what of elphin likewise lord many years ago and the lady rhonwyn as well fool what did you think lurking up here in your hovel haunting the rock wastes like a wraith what did you think did you not know that men mark their years differently that their spans are less while you squatted up here in your squalid misery nursing your unholy grief your friends and kinsmen grew old and died i see i replied at length much saddened maelwys elphin rhonwyn gone all of them and how many others with them great light i did not know pelleas had gone to the horses and now returned with food are you hungry i have bread and cheese and a little mead it will cheer you let us eat together i said i would welcome nothing more than to break my long fast with a friend while we ate he told me something of his search which carried him to every corner of celyddon i thought you dead i told him when he finished i saw them all dead custennin gwendolau my warband ganieda all dead and you with them i could not face it merciful father forgive me i fled so many dead that day he replied gravely but not all i lived and custennin too i saw you ride away did you know i even called after you but you did not hear me even then his face brightened even then i knew that i would find you one day you must have been very certain certain enough to bring two horses celyddon is great my lord but i never gave up hoping your faith has been rewarded i would reward you too but i have nothing even had i a hundred kingdoms the gift would still be as nothing compared to the gift of your devotion pelleas has a man ever had such a friend he shook his head slowly i have my reward he said in a hushed voice i seek no other than to serve you once more we finished eating in silence and then i rose brushing crumbs from my clothing i breathed the mountain air deep into my lungs and it was the air of a world muchchanged while i had hidden in my cave the darkness had grown strong what i had now to do was to discover where the light still burned and how brightly pelleas bundled up the remaining food and joined me where do you propose to go lord myrddin i hardly know i turned to the spring and cave above us on the mountainside it now appeared a cold and forlorn and alien place does custennin still abide in celyddon yes lord i was with him earlier in the spring and my mother does she stay in dyfed she has returned to ynys avallach i see and what of avallach he is well enough but as ever he is troubled from time to time by his injury i turned and asked sharply if charis is in ynys avallach who rules in dyfed lord tewdrig a nephew of maelwys and in the summerlands a lord named elyvar replied pelleas and added hesitantly as if breaking bad news but there is another over him called vortigern indeed this this man he has set himself as king over all the lords of britain a high king oh vortigern yes i have seen your face in the fire i have seen the shadow of your coming yes and i have heard the thunder of your fall what is it my lord it is nothing pelleas vortigern rules in the summerlands you were saying in gwynedd rheged and lloegres as well he is a most ambitious man lord and most ruthless he stops at nothing to win his way i know about him pelleas but do not worry his days are not long in the land lord it is something i have seen pelleas i turned my eyes to look down into the valley where the dark folds of the trees gathered around the feet of the mountain four riders were making their way towards us along the banks of the stream i should have been surprised especially after all these years alone but part of me expected them i think for upon seeing them i knew who they were and why they had come i knew also who had led them to me the enemy has wasted no time i said remembering my first visitor and his subtle guile well i had not been tricked sick in heart and mind as i was by the good gods grace i was not tricked and now i was insane no longer i was healed and whole again ancient enemy do your worst i myrddin emrys defy you pelleas watched the riders approach for a moment perhaps we should leave now master no i told him you ask where we will go i think these men have come to escort us on our way where to see a wonder in the land the man who has made himself a king higher than any other since kingship began in this island vortigerns men i was not followed lord myrddin i swear it no you were not followed they were sent by another we still have time let us flee why pelleas we have nothing to fear from these men besides i would like to meet this vortigern face to face i have never seen a high king before pelleas made a face he is not much to look at i am told and those who value their lives and land stay as far away from him as possible nevertheless i will go and pay my respects to the man who has held the island in my stead we waited while the riders toiled slowly up the steep slope and it gave me time to observe them closely they were three stout fighting men with bronze armbands and oxhide shields and another darker man who judging by the oak staff behind his saddle was a druid though it was early morning all appeared worn and travel weary their horses drooping with exhaustion their errand was an important one i gathered they had not lingered on the way but had driven themselves hard to find me when they were close enough i greeted them and called them to me hail travellers the forest lord welcomes you they reined up at this and then sat looking at one another for a moment muttering under their breath who are you the foremost rider the druid asked curtly that you already know for i have told you i might well ask who you are but i am not in the habit of asking questions when the answer is known to me you know who we are asked one of the others coming a few cautious steps closer i do i assured him then maybe you also know why we have come he cast a disapproving glance at pelleas beside me as if pelleas had spoiled their secret you have come to take me to meet your lord one called vortigern who makes himself a king they did not like this answer but it was true and they did not challenge my meaning for i spoke civilly enough we have come replied the druid to find one called merlin embries and you have found him i said it is he that addresses you the druid did not appear convinced the man we seek was already old when i was a child you cannot be merlin then indeed you do not know who it is you are searching for he puzzled on that for a moment they say merlin is of the fair folk pointed out the rider beside him that would explain it your horses are tired and you are nearly falling out of your saddles dismount rest yourselves and your animals eat something and regain your strength for our journey back this shocked them more than anything i had said so far they had thought to take me by force the notion that i might go willingly had never occurred to them we mean to take you with us the second rider stubbornly warned me have i not already said that i will go i desire to speak with your lord the druid nodded and signalled the others to dismount he swung himself down from the saddle and came to stand before me do not try to escape i am a druid i have power your tricks will not work on me i laughed i would speak lightly of power friend for i know whence your power comes i tell you the truth i have faced your lord and was not overcome i will not be overcome by you darkness has no power over light and no power on earth can move me if i do not wish to be moved it is by my free choice alone that i go with you he frowned and turned to the others barking orders to unsaddle and water the beasts we will rest here a while he said help them with the horses pelleas i must say my farewells i turned and began walking back up the hill to my cave to find wolf well wolf was not to be left behind so easily at first i feared for the horses but i need not have worried for at the sight of her with me the animals took her for a dog and accepted her as they would any hunting hound the men were not so easily persuaded get that killer away cried one of the riders leaping to his feet his dagger drawn and held out before him although what protection that would have offered i cannot imagine sit down i told him be silent she will not harm you if you do not provoke her and put that knife away if she wanted your life nothing would save you least of all your sorry blade the man stared at the golden eyes of the wolf then at mine he made the sign against evil with his left hand and muttered under his breath i heard what he said and told him you have nothing to fear iddec his fright did not leave him and he clutched the knife even tighter how do you know me he rasped i know a great many things i replied one of the other riders heard what i said and came closer giving the wolf a wide respect then you know what we mean to do he began yes daned i know shut up shouted the druid it is a trick tell him nothing he knows shouted daned we cannot keep it from him he knows nothing unless you tell him he called me by name insisted iddec both of us he knew us both the druid duach flew at the warriors he heard you talking among yourselves youve probably named yourselves to him a hundred times since we first saw him the two glanced at one another unconvinced grumbling they went back to unsaddling their horses duach turned on me leave them alone he said they may be foolish enough to believe your lies nevertheless they will slit your throat right smart if i tell them to wolf beside me growled deep in her throat and the druid stepped back get rid of that animal if you would save its life do not raise your voice or hand against me again duach if you would save yours pelleas had watched all this silently and now came close i do not care for their manner lord perhaps it is a mistake logo with them i put my hand on his shoulder worry not pelleas nothing will happen to me that is not ordained and as i said we go with them not because they want me to but because i choose it he remained sceptical so i added besides it is the quickest way i know to announce to the world that myrddin emrys has returned to the land of the living fifteen vortigern he of the thin red beard and narrow wary eyes had been an able battlelord once upon a time now he sat on his handsome throne a jaded sated old glutton world weary wretched and sick with dread his oncestrong shoulders drooped and his paunch spread beneath his richlywoven mantle the firm muscle of a warrior running to flesh and fat his pouched eyes still maintained the guile and cunning that had brought him to this place however and for all his troubles he still managed the air of a king sitting in his great hall surrounded by his minions and mercenaries my first glimpse of the man who had brought so much ruin upon the island of the mighty did little to alter my opinion of him in truth he was a bane and a curse upon the land but as i watched him struggle with his dignity a battlescarred old badger backed to the wall i understood him better and i determined not to hold against him the things he had done justice would find him soon enough of that i was certain sure and it was not for my hand to hold die balance looking back on it now i see he was a shrewd and calculating man who had survived desperate times if he had acted too much for love of himself first and his people last and he had oh yes he had some of his designs at least stemmed the onrushing saecsen tide because that too had been in his selfish interest true he was reaping the harvest of his folly now but not all of his decisions had been bad he had done what he could with the sorry mess he had found always making the best of a bad bargain indeed he had little enough help from the mewling squabbling lords and chieftains around him and if i in my madness had not forsaken my people and my land who knows perhaps vortigern would not have found the foothold he needed to ascend to the high throne things might have been very different indeed if i had not deserted britain none of that could be helped what had happened had happened and there was no undoing it nevertheless the day of reckoning was dawning for vortigern and he knew it but at least i would not raise my hand against him and i would show him what mercy i could god knows he was a man in need of a friend the four who had sought me the druid and three of vortigerns bodyguard brought me with all haste to where he waited in yr widdfa we had travelled quickly and uneventfully leaving the forest for the open hills two days after starting out i was glad to see the wide empty hillscape once more after the closeness of the forest the open spaces seemed like freedom itself it was not all gladness to me however for in the end i bade farewell to wolf a creature of the forest she stopped at celyddons furthest edge and would go no further farewell faithful friend your long vigil is over you are free to go your way upon reaching the kings camp i was ushered before him without demonstration the high king sat in the sunshine outside his tent surrounded by mounds of stone and building material and scores of labourers vortigern rubbed his grizzled chin and stared at me a curious gleam lighting his hooded eyes in his demise he had gathered to himself a body of druids looking once more to the old ways for his hope no doubt vortigerns druids regarded me with icy contempt they knew me and hated me with the lively enmity of lost men confronting their doom you are the one they call the emrys vortigern asked finally he was not i suppose much impressed by what he saw before him expecting as men do someone of greater stature or more marked appearance i am known by many names i replied emrys is one of them merlin is another among my people i am called myrddin do you know why i have sought you he turned the heavy amber ring on his finger and waited for me to answer work on your stronghold is going badly your druids blame an evil spirit for the failure of your masons to raise a decent wall i shrugged and added in short you require the blood of a virginborn man to secure your foundations this threw the druids into an indignant fluster i think they really believed they could deceive me in the matter but vortigern only smiled at their consternation what did you expect he told them is there any doubt this is the man we require he is an evil spirit himself said vortigerns chief druid a malevolent creature named joram do not listen to him my king or he will confuse you with his lies old vortigern waved the druid silent and said and are you indeed a fatherless child my father was taliesin ap elphin ap gwyddno garanhir i told him names that used to be lauded in this land i know these names vortigern said respectfully they were men of great renown in cymry ah but this taliesin was not mortal declared joram it is well known to the learned brotherhood that he was an otherworld being that will be news to my mother i replied coolly and to anyone who knew him some of those attending vortigern laughed aloud and where are they who knew him the chief druid stepped menacingly towards me with his rowan staff before him it was so sad to see that fool mimicking the learned masters of old hafgan would quake with wrath to see it he would have broken the mans staff over his insufferable head where are they who knew taliesin demanded joram triumphantly as if proving me guilty beyond doubt guilty of what i cannot say dead and in their graves i admitted it has been a long time men grow old and they die but not you eh myrddin emrys i am as you see me i see a young man before me replied vortigern seeking i think to divert joram and save my life one who has not long used a razor surely he cannot be the son of this taliesin who died long before i myself was born lord and king replied joram quickly do not let his appearance dissuade you from your plan he is of the fair folk who live long and do not age as other men hmmrn uttered vortigern i could see he was in a spot he bore me no ill will and was even sorry now that he had seen me to have carried the scheme this far well perhaps if he is the son of taliesin he knows a thing or two how about it myrddin do you know a way out of our difficulty i addressed joram with my answer let joram say before us all why the stones fall each night and lay waste the days work joram puffed out his cheeks but remained silent come now i insisted if you cannot tell us why the work fails how is it you can declare with full certainty that my sacrificed blood will save it he glared at me and turned to his lord in protest but vortigern silenced him well we are waiting joram it is well known already the false druid said each night while the workmen sleep the evil spirit of this place troubles the foundation and overturns the stones no matter how high the wall is built during the day by morning it is rubble he took a deep breath and continued condescendingly therefore the remedy is sure the blood of a man virginborn will bind the stones fast and the evil spirit will trouble it no more the evil is in your mind joram i told him there is no evil spirit at work here and no man virginborn save one only vortigern smiled craftily tell us wise myrddin what is the cause the ground hereabouts appears solid but beneath it lies a pool filled with water for this reason the ground gives way beneath the weight of the stone and the walls cannot hold liar shouted joram it is a trick to save his life the truth of what i say can be easily proven i replied calmly vortigern send your men to dig a ditch and you will see i speak the truth pelleas who had stood by me all this time managed to look both relieved and worried by this turn of events are you certain master he whispered as vortigern called for workmen to carry out my orders i know what i am doing pelleas i told him but watch there is more to come i pointed out to the workmen where to dig and they set about it at once it took some time for the hole to reach the proper depth and with each shovelblade full the druids satisfaction increased for it appeared there would be no water but when the hole reached man height one of the workers with an iron pick swung down and struck a piece of rock the rock broke and he pulled out his pick to swing again and all at once water began bubbling up into the hole in the end the men had to scramble out to keep from being drowned vortigerns court looked on in wonder as the gushing water filled the hole to the very top well done myrddin cried vortigern he turned sharply to joram and demanded what do you have to say to that traitor joram had nothing to say he held his tongue and fumed darkly at me his fellows clustered around him muttered oaths and incantations against me but they had no power and their spells fell like spent arrows at their feet i understood then how very low the art of the bard had fallen and it saddened me taliesin forgive your weaker brothers if you can ignorance spreads to every quarter on the wind and truth is spurned and reviled vortigern asked me then to name my reward and i answered i will not take silver or gold from you vortigern take land then friend he offered nor land i said i wanted nothing from his hand indeed how could i take from him a thing that was not his to give very well let it be as you say but i will have you share meat with me tonight and his eyes gleamed wickedly there will be an entertainment i was given a tent in which to rest and refresh myself before supper pelleas and i retired and i slept waking when a servant brought a basin for me to wash then we were led back to the hall and given seats at the high table next to lord vortigern the druids were still there still furious their faces dark with rage and menace but they were huddled next to the hearth and did not share vortigerns table tonight welcome friend myrddin cried vortigern when he saw me the guest cup was pressed into my hand was hael drink friend and fill your cup again i drank and returned the cup it was filled again but i left it on the board and took my place beside the king the meal was remarkable only for the quantity of food prepared vortigern and his retinue appeared to have endless appetites but easily pleased palates the fare was common black bread roasted meat all cooked well enough but ungarnished and unspiced vortigern gave himself to his meal i see him now hunched over his plate tearing meat from his knife with his teeth poor vortigern there was not a noble sinew in his body how far he had overreached himself he did not speak during the meal but when at last he wiped the grease from his lips with his sleeve he turned to me now for a drink and some diversion eh myrddin pelleas who had served me through the meal so that he could remain by my side did not like the sound of that he gave me a warning look but vortigern had no mischief in mind for me the high king called for his chief bard and joram shuffled forth warily do not think i have forgotten your treachery to me druid said vortigern as the bard came to stand before him if you would find treachery answered joram sullenly you have but to look no further than the one sitting at your right hand enough of your slander the king snapped i will hear no more from you he beckoned the captain of his bodyguard to him and declared before all the court these men who i entrusted with my life have shown themselves false before me they are worse than traitors draw your sword and kill them at once this was vortigern all over efficient if ruthless and eager to secure the friendship of powerful men who could help him the soldiers steel came ringing from its sheath he hoped by this display to win me for he turned to me and said as these blind magicians were so eager for your blood surely they will not mind my asking for theirs there was nothing i could do for them vortigern was determined but i wanted them to know at last who it was they had sought to destroy if you please lord vortigern the reward you offered i would claim it now by whatever god you worship myrddin you shall have it what do you propose a story i replied before they die i would have them contemplate the power of a true bard vortigern had hoped for something more exotic but he smiled graciously and ordered a harp to be brought to me i took my place before the table and tuned the harp as vortigerns company gathered around me i do not think that even then i knew precisely what i would say but as i fingered the strings of the harp searching for a melody the words began forming on my tongue of their own accord and i knew that i had been led to this place and the words would be given in turn the harp nestled against my shoulder i turned to joram and said as you show so little respect for the high bardic arts of old i will tell you a true tale lifting my voice to the hall i said listen well all of you i gathered my cloak around me closed my eyes and began to speak as one would speak to children and this is the tale i told there was an eagle and the father of eagles who lived long protecting his realm with beak and claw one day a shrew came to eagle and squatted beneath the oak where eagle maintained his eyrie and there he stayed until eagle should speak to him what do you want demanded eagle tell me quickly for i shall not suffer the like of you beneath my noble abode it is but a little thing replied shrew only come down closer so that i may speak my matter plainly for i grow dizzy shouting up at you like this eagle being impatient to have an end to the matter did as he was bade and flew down to meet shrew well here i am said eagle what do you want my voice is raw said shrew from all this shouting please come nearer eagle put his head near and all at once shrew leapt upon his neck and bit it with his sharp teeth so that eagle was wounded grievously and died as his blood rushed out thereupon shrew ran away so that no one ever saw him again when the other beasts and birds learned that eagle had been wickedly killed they were aggrieved and angry for the exalted bird had been their king they buried their lord and looked among themselves for a new king who can take eagles place they lamented for none there is the like of our lord but the fox was crafty and cunning seeing his chance up he jumped and said does not our lord leave heirs behind let his oldest son be our lord for a fox you are a foolish one replied the otter the young eagles are only nestlings they cannot even fly but they will soon grow up meanwhile let us elect someone to stand guard over them until the eldest of the three has come of an age to take up the lordship of the forest well said declared the ox who will do this thing which you suggest to speak plainly none of the other creatures were willing to take on the care of nestlings for the oak was high and eaglets are touchy birds and always hungry shame on you all cried fox since none of you will undertake the care of the eaglets i will do it even though i am not the most worthy creature among you so fox set about raising the nestlings and when the eldest of the three had come of age the animals of field and forest came together beneath the noble oak and held council to make eagle their king no sooner had they placed the crown on his head than did fox take him aside and whisper to him do not be deceived the other animals of the forest love you not at all why when you and your brothers were nestlings they would have let you starve you were not esteemed then and i think the matter has not improved these are worrisome tidings replied young eagle were it not for you i would not be alive today true but let us keep our wits about us if you will take my counsel i will guide you together we shall prevail against all comers so young eagle took fox as his chief advisor to do swiftly whatever he deemed best to do for the good of the forest and them in it needless to say fox grew fat on his portion and his red pelt grew sleek and rich by and by there came grumblings from beyond the forest that a great herd of pigs having despoiled their own realm were eager for new lands to seize fox came to young eagle and said lord i like not the things that i am hearing about these pigs nor do i replied eagle you are the canniest of creatures what is to be done well now that you say it i believe a plan has come to me speak it out friend for all we know the pigs may be on their way here now in the marshlands on the edge of the forest dwell a fannumber of rats rats i will have nothing to do with those vile creatures oh they are vile indeed but it seems to me that if we were to take but a few of them into our service they would give us tidings regarding these pigs and we should be well informed of their intentions and so protect ourselves against them that is a bold plan answered eagle and as i have none better so be it so it was a company of rats came into the forest that very day fox saw to it that the rats lived well receiving the best portion from his hand oh he treated them like kings every one in this way he won their confidence so that when one day he came to them with tears in his eyes they all looked about them for the cause of their providers sorrow what ails you friend fox they asked why do you not know the king has ordered me to send you all away you who have been nothing but faithful to him from the first day to this and fox sobbed so that his fur became soggy alas i fear i must do as my king bids for i have no goods or lands of my own and cannot keep you of myself hearing this the rats grew wrathful they murmured against eagle let us kill this mad king and raise fox in his place then we will not lose our living in fact we might increase it so saying up they rose and by stealth killed young eagle while he slept when fox saw that the rats had done what he knew they would he raised the alarm woe woe our king is murdered help the forest creatures rushed to his aid and all saw how fox savagely killed the rats and many were impressed with his proud coat all bespattered with blood fox turned to the others and addressed them i knew no good could come of having rats and now worse has come to worst i have killed the traitors but once again we are without a king still he said sincerely i am prepared to serve you well and wisely if you will have me who else has done so much for us shouted the badgers who else has done so much for himself muttered ox and otter nevertheless fox was made king of the forest and began his ignoble reign that very night the two remaining eaglets took counsel with one another surely with fox reigning over us we are not long for this world let us fly to the mountains for we will neither of us wear the crown now no but at least we will stay alive answered the youngest and they flew from the forest at once the eaglets lived in the mountains biding their time fox made himself free with the ruling of the forest and increased his wealth as much as he liked for no one could gainsay him one day however the pigs he had lied about to young eagle suddenly appeared fox was greatly distressed to see them but sent word that they should come to him which they did the pigs leader was a great meaty boar with the scars of many battles on his hide fox took one look at him and knew he had met his match but he plucked up what little courage he possessed and said my you are a handsome pig and so strong tell me of your errand here and perhaps i can help you the pigs looked long at one another and greatly marvelled for no one had given them such a grand welcome well lord replied boar as you see we are a fruitful breed more quickly abounding than any other of forest or field and try as we might the land cannot long sustain us and we must go out and find new feeding grounds your story moves me replied fox cannily as it happens i have need of a strong companion for although i am king i am not well liked by those i must rule in fact though it grieves me full well to say it they daily seek to destroy me say no more answered boar i am the friend you seek only give us land to call our own and as long as i uve i will protect you and serve you as loyal battlechief land you shall have said fox happily and i would give you more besides but the forest cannot maintain so great a host of pigs i understand that even now pigs other than yourselves are on their way here to thieve and despoil never let that worry you lord answered boar we are fully able to hold our own and keep all others out only do that and you shall not find me a miserly master fox told him for the less i must give to other pigs the more i can give to you ask who you may and they will tell you i always reward those who serve me so the bargain was struck then and there in just that way boar and his pigs settled themselves on the edge of the forest where they could guard the trails and keep any other creatures out this they managed to do exceedingly well for there are not many creatures willing to risk the wrath of a bold battlewise tusker fox lavished gifts upon his army of swine listening to their squeals of pleasure as if to a chorus of bards singing his praises both master and servants flourished far beyond their worth much to the dismay of their fellow creatures of the forest but by and by the day came when the pigs became greedy as pigs will do they looked around and grunted to one another their misgivings we do all the work and it is fox who grows fat boar agreed with his chieftains and declared i have heard you brothers and i agree now i will do something about this as you shall see it so happened that the young eagles had grown up and had become restless in the mountains said one to the other i am not lying when i say i am sick of living like this while pigs overrun our forest with impunity you speak my thoughts exactly brother let us go down to the forest and seek redress it may be that we will win our own back if not we will at least be dead and no longer take notice of what vile creatures are ruling in our place at once they flew off streaking like comets through the clouds towards the forest fox awoke from a happy nap to see a very disturbing sight an army of pigs arrayed against him lead by boar his thick pelt bristling what news friends fox asked it seems to us that you have dealt falsely with us declared boar frankly this state of affairs cannot continue am i to believe what i hear wondered fox how can you say this to me i have given you all i have keeping but little for myself to live on the rest is yours indeed you give us the rest which is little enough for earning the hate of all the other creatures grunted boar now we want the best though they were only swine they were not ignorant they knew that fox had been blaming all the problems of his reign on them thinking quickly fox said there may be something in what you say i must think me how best to right this wrong i have done you boar turned a suspicious bead of an eye on fox but said what will you do i will give you a further half of all i possess which will make you equal with me we will rule the forest together you and i which it seems to me is a far better bargain than your like will find in many long years of looking boar liked what he heard for fox was ever clever at saving his fine red pelt and knew right well the soothing words to say still boar would not be made the fool so he said saying is one thing doing is another give me a token of your troth and i will believe you fox made tears come to his eyes this and after all i have done for you well if there is no other way there is none declared boar confidently then i will do as you require with that he turned and started off through the forest wait cried boar and all the pigs with him shouted too where do you think to go why you are not so stupid as to think i keep my treasures hereabouts where anyone can stumble over them fox replied i must go to my den to fetch the token you require go then sniffed boar we will await you here and fox turned tail and ran away the pigs waited through the day and then through the evening and then through the night but fox did not return and when dawn came rosefingered in the east boar roused himself and said i am thinking that fox is not returning nevertheless we will wait until midday and if our lord has not shown hide or hair we shall surely go after him and he will rue the day he deceived us needless to say fox did not return for by midday he was far far away going to ground in his own lands in the west and in their rage the pigs began uprooting trees and bushes and flinging them into the air with their tusks meanwhile the two eagles flying over the forest looked down and saw the commotion the pigs were making over foxs disappearance well brother said the older eagle if we are to have our revenge and save our lands it appears that we must be the first to find fox or there will be nothing left of him worth finding so on they flew to harry fox in his den and that is where they are flying even now i stood in silence with my cloak wrapped round me my tale is finished he who has ears to hear let him hear the warriors filling vortigerns hall stared at me nervously the chief druid gripped his staff with both hands in a paroxysm of impotent rage he had heard my childrens tale and understood its hidden truth and it angered him that i saw so much so clearly he knew at last he knew in his very soul he was no match for me there joram i said softly now you know the power of a true bard yes and soon the rest of the world would remember as well you kings asleep in your mead halls wake gather your warbands arm your warriors fill their hands with strong steel you warriors sunk in your cups at your lords table arise burnish your weapons sharpen your blades scour your warcaps and paint bright your shields you people of the island of the mighty stand stop your trembling take heart and make ready rich welcome for the soul of britain is stirring again merlin is coming home book three prophet one vortigern had gone to ground in the west in his native lands choosing high yr widdfas bleak hills for his last battleground there he hoped to erect a fortress strong enough to keep the young eagles from stripping the flesh from his brittle bones strong enough to keep the battling boar from uprooting him for it was as i had said in my story fox vortigern had played his last trick and now cowered in the hills awaiting the judgement of those he had wronged and those whose greed he had inflamed the young eagles aurelius and uther younger brothers of cons tans murdered son of the slain constantine first high king of britain gathered warriors in the south hengist the boar awaited the arrival of reinforcements for his saecsen warhost from his homeland it would be a race to see which enemy would reach miserable driven fox vortigern first vortigern knew all this of course and early the next morning as iwas preparing to leave the high king called me to him i would not detain you unduly myrddin for i esteem you highly but if you would tarry with me but a little i would speak with you and i would deem it a service worth high reward i was eager to be away anxious now to seek out my mother in ynys avallach and let her know i was still alive it rankled me to delay even a moment more although i held no ill will towards the high king there was nothing more to say to vortigern i had done what i had come to do and even now word was winging across the land that i had returned i could hear the voices myrddin wylt is come merlin the enchanter has appeared the great emrys is alive again awakened from his long sleep did you see he defeated the druid bards ofthe high king and had them all beheaded heis here i have seen him merlinus ambrosius king ofdyfed has returned for his kingdom did you hear he has foretold vortigerns doom merlin lives again yes the emrys had returned with the doom of the usurper in his hand vortigern for all his sins and vices was no mouse what he had done he had always done boldly with impunity if his doom was to catch him up he was game to hold it off as long as he could by whatever means possible but he wanted to know what shape it would take so to prepare himself to fight or to flee which is why he sent for me now i have nothing more to tell you lord vortigern i said there is nothing else to say perhaps not but i would speak nonetheless the high king replied he lowered himself heavily into his chair a handsome thing carved with imperial eagles on the armrests his bloated face was haggard in the early morning light i did not sleep last night he paused and i waited for fear myrddin for fear of a dream he looked at me cannily they tell me you are one who knows portents and dreams i would have you tell me the meaning of mine for i fear it greatly and believe it betokens much very well vortigern tell me your dream and if i find a meaning in it i will tell you the grizzled red head nodded absently and he was silent for a moment then began abruptly i saw the pit the workmen dug at your bidding and at the bottom they struck a great stone and it broke and the water gushed forth as it did you know and then you ordered the water to be drawn off by means of a ditch this was done and when the pool was carried away a great cavern was discovered and in it two great stones like eggs he paused to swill some wine from a cup and then continued never looking at me with his eyes but staring at the dead embers on his hearth inside the stone eggs were two dragons that came forth to battle one another the first was white as milk and the other the other was red as blood and they fought one another shaking the very ground with then furious fight oh it was terrible to behold their jaws foamed their tails thrashed and with their claws they slashed one another flames flew out from their mouths first the white would be above and then beneath and the same with the red dragon sorely they wounded one another i tell you and when neither could fight any more they dragged themselves back to their eggs and slept only to fight once again when they had rested that is all though it filled me with such terror that i awoke at once vortigern dashed down the last of the wine and sat back fixing his narrow eyes on me at last well what say you myrddin what of these dragons in the pit and their fierce fight i answered him forthrightly for i had seen the meaning in my mind as he spoke yours was a true dream vortigern and here is its meaning the dragons are kings yet to come who will contend with one another for the island of the mighty white for the saecsen horde blood red for the true sons of britain which is fated to win myrddin neither will triumph over the other until the land is united in truth the man has not been born who can bind the tribes of britain together he nodded again slowly what of me myrddin what will happen to vortigern do you really want to know i must know even now aurelius and uther are sailing from armorica so you have said he snorted in that tale of yours they will arrive with fourteen galleys and put ashore tomorrow in the south meanwhile hengist has gathered his war brood and they march to meet you now your enemies are arrayed on every side as you have done much evil much evil will be done to you yet if you would save your life you must flee vortigern is there nothing else i can do i shook my head flee vortigern or stay and face the wrath of those you have wronged make no mistake aurelius and uther seek the blood price for their brother they mean to pluck back their realm and the kings of britain march with them is there no hope for me this was spoken softly but without selfpity vortigern knew what he had done and likely had long ago weighed out the losses against the gains here is your hope lord vortigern and the hope of our people from the events which you have set in motion will arise a king who will hold all britain in his hand a high king who will be the wonder of the world a chief dragon to utterly devour the white dragon of the pit he smiled grimly and stood well if i am to flee i must be about it will you accompany me myrddin i would have you with me for your presence is a balm to me no i told him my road lies another way farewell lord vortigern we will not meet again pelleas and i departed the camp as vortigern called his chieftains to order the march east where he hoped to elude the vengeance of the brothers swooping down on him it would go ill with fox vortigern yet there was nothing for it but to face the justice he had so long denied we were well away from the stronghold riding down between the crease of the hills and out of sight pelleas glancing a last time over his shoulder at the heads of the druids adorning a row of pikes along the ridgeway sighed with relief that is over for vortigern yes i replied but not for us we ride to ynys avallach do we not we do but our stay there will not be long how long he asked dreading my answer a few days i told him that is all i wish it were more believe me but he was remembering his masters temperament and how quickly moods and plans could change but it is not to be i shook my head gently no it is not to be we rode on a pace or so and then i reined up pelleas listen carefully to me now you have found me and brought me back to the world of men and i thank you for that but it is in my mind that you will soon curse the day you begged my service you will wish perhaps that you had never wasted a day in searching for me forgive me my lord but your own heart will prove traitor before i do he swore and i knew he meant it with all that was in him what i have to do will earn no mans thanks i warned him it could be that before i am through i will be despised from one end of this island to the other with every hand raised against me and those who stand with me let others make their choice i have made mine my lord merlin he was in earnest and now that i knew he understood how hard it would be i knew i could trust him with both our lives so be it i said may god reward your faith my friend we rode on then considerably lighter of heart than before for we had spoken the bond between us and our old places had been reclaimed pelleas was content and so was i aurelius and uther sons of constantine by separate mothers and as different as dawn and dusk would end vortigerns reign with swift justice aurelius the elder of the two would be the next high king and would prove an inspired leader his mother was aurelia the last flower of a noble roman family a claim which constantine himself could make somewhat less certainly whose forebears included a governor a vicarius a long line of distinguished magistrates and scores of wellmarried and highlyrevered women but aurelia took fever and died suddenly when aurelius was three years old and constantine fresh from his victories over the harrying pict scot and saecsen had become smitten with the daughter of one of the defeated saecsen leaders in a fit of generosity towards the vanquished he married the fairhaired beauty a girl named onbrawst little uther was born a year later both boys near enough in age were raised together in the old roman manner under the tutelage of a household servant their older brother constans pledged to god from birth was schooled apart living with the priests at the little monastery at venta bulgarum when constantine was murdered by one of his slaves vengeful pict whose clan had been defeated years before old gosselyn archbishop of londinium became afraid for the younger boys lives he took aurelius and uther under his wing when as a result of vortigerns manipulations constans met his sorry end gosselyn wisely removed the boys from harm sending them to an obscure priory in king hoel s lands in armorica near enough to keep an eye on far enough away not to be a threat to vortigerns ambition there they had grown to manhood biding their time until they could return and claim their rightful place in the world this they would do but they would soon need help if they were to advance the high kingship beyond the mark made by vortigern hengist would see to it that they had no rest no opportunity to consolidate their gains and the other kings once hengist was beaten back would grant them no peace either in short they would need my help pelleas and i moved swiftly he led and i followed agog at the changes wrought in the land since i had last been in it especially in the settlements where fear accomplished its bleak work walls were everywhere made of stone and high most of the older more expansive towns were abandoned murderously difficult to defend in favour of smaller halfhidden stonebuilt settlements that were less conspicuous and less inviting to the barbarian eye it seemed as if all dwelling places of men had shrunk in upon themselves streets where there were streets were narrower the houses smaller and tighter everything appeared crowded and huddled together cowering before the darkness that grew and grew this both saddened and outraged me by gods holy name we are the children of the living light we do not cower in our dens like frightened livestock this is the island of the mighty and it is ours by right the foeman challenges that right to his everlasting peril but by the great good light we will not be moved yet wherever i turned my eyes we were being moved in body and in spirit back and back retreating before the armies of the night we fled we were no longer certain of our right or our ability to defend ourselves and our homeland and unless something was done soon this retreat would become a rout i took heart that the land itself was solid as ever not that anyone could change it very much trees grew tall for timber fields when they could be planted in peace and left to harvest flourished cattle and sheep gave good meat leather and wool the old roman mines were still worked and provided tin and lead and more importantly iron for weapons there was strength and consolation in this to be sure still it would take more than healthy agriculture to embolden the hearts of men it would take a swift certain demonstration of leadership success in battle turning back the onrushing barbarian tide for this reason i was anxious to meet aurelius in this young eagle called aurelius i saw great potential perhaps he could become the high king i had seen the one men needed to restore their faith oh i had seen aurelius from afar in the firemists in the black oak water of the seeing bowl and i knew him after a fashion but i needed to meet him to sit down and talk with him and observe what kind of man he was only then could i be certain if britain had a worthy high king purposefully i stayed well away from my old lands in dyfed i was not yet ready to witness what changes had been wrought there and much preferred my memory of the place my sudden appearance would be awkward to say the least for those ruling there now news of my return would hasten to maridunum now called caer myrddin pelleas informed me blithely and that would cause confusion enough besides i was not at all certain what i should do and there would be time to decide that later after i had met with aurelius before that however i had but one desire to return to the only home i knew to see my mother in truth i never stopped to think what commotion my sudden appearance at ynys avallach would provoke in my mind the place was always so serene so remote from the frantic strivings of the larger world i imagined if i had any thought at all that simply setting foot onto the isle of apples i would instantly fall under its peaceful enchantment occupying the same place i had always occupied oh there you are merlin i wondered where you had gone as if i had merely departed no further than the next room and had now returned but a moment a small space of heartbeats later for me at least it was something like that for charis and avallach it was something else entirely after the first flurry of sensation at the announcement of my arrival there was now a gatehouse at the end of the causeway leading to the fisher kings palace the glad cries of welcome and the tears my own and my mothers it still took some time for the place to recover its normal staid dignity i had been missed and sorely my death contemplated and wondered at ten thousand thousand times since my disappearance i had selfishly i suppose vastly underestimated my own value in my mothers life i knew you were still alive charis told me later when the excitement had diminished at least i think i would have known if you had been dead i would have felt it she sat holding my hand in her lap clutching it as if afraid to let it go lest she lose me again so soon she beamed her pleasure the light bright and shining in her eyes and glowing from her face i do not believe i had ever seen her so happy except for this and the fact that she had once again adopted the fashion of the fair folk she was unchanged i am sorry i said how many times had i said that already forgive me i could not help myself i never meant to hurt you i hush she bent her head and kissed my hand it has all been said and forgiven it is past and done at these words and the truth behind them the tears started to my eyes once more could one ever be worthy of such love that night i slept in my old room and the next day went fishing with avallach sitting on the centre bench while he poled the flatbottomed boat along the bank to his favourite place the sun danced on the lake surface and the reeds nodded in the warm breeze a heron stalked the green shallows looking for frogs and nervous moorhens jerked and clucked on the mossy shore and i felt like a child of three once more what was it like merlin avallach asked me he stood poised with the spear to be insane to be alone with god he answered i have often wondered what it would be like to be in his presence to see and hear him to worship at his feet is that who you think i was alone with it shamed me to realize i had not acknowledged it before but through years of contemplation avallach had grown sensitive to the life of the spirit who else the great lord himself he said happily or one of his angels either way a very great honour at that moment a fish flashed beneath the stern of the boat and avallachs spear flashed in the same instant and he drew it back out of the water with a fine pike wriggling on the barbed tines as he carefully removed the fish i sought a reply of course i had been sustained in the wild at the time i had never questioned it considering that my years of living with the hill folk had stood me good stead in surviving in the wilderness but even that surely had been the good gods hand at work preparing me and at last he had appeared to me i knew that and had not dared admit it to myself aloud but avallach had seen it and accepted it with the greatest enthusiasm and just a little pious envy i marvelled at his faith you are fortunate among men merlin most fortunate he bent and took up the pole once more and pushed the boat further along the reedgrown bank i who would dearly love to spend but a moment in my lords presence must content myself with visions of his sacred cup he said this matteroffactly but he was as serious as he was sincere you have seen it too i asked forgetting that i had never told him i had seen it myself ah i thought so grandfather winked at me then you know that it exists yes i believe that it does have you touched it he asked softly reverently i shook my head no like yours mine was a vision ah he sat down in the boat and held the dripping pole across his knees the quiet lapping of the water against the boats hull and the chirking of a frog filled the silence when he spoke again it was as a man sharing a confidence with a brother never before had he spoken to me like this you know he said i have believed until this moment that the lords cup was denied me for the great sin of my life surely grandfather your sins are no greater than any other mans far less i should think than many i could name and you have jesus forgiveness my attempt to ease his mind was a thin one and it is doubtful he even heard me for he continued i gave life to morgian at the sound of the name my heart turned leaden in my chest morgian what had she been up to while i was lost to the world of men something told me her hands had not been idle i saw her as a black spider spinning webs of alluring death around her where is morgian i asked dreading the answer i had to know avallach sighed wearily she is in the orcades a group of small islands in the northern sea a good place for her i think at least she is far from here i had heard of this island realm called ynysoedd erch in the british tongue the islands of fear and now i knew why what does she there the fisher king sighed wearily no one who has not so mourned can know the pain of a parent whose child has gone wrong but he bore his torment like the king he was neither pitying himself nor excusing himself what morgian does only morgian knows but we hear lately that she has married a man a king named loth and has borne him children i know nothing of the man nor his unfortunate spawn but there are tales of great wickedness in the north and terrors that defy description it is morgians handiwork of course but what she intends i cannot guess i could guess well enough what she intended is anything known of these children only that they live but no there is no word no certain word about any of this just travellers tales and dark rumours morgian had learned patience i will give her that she was biding her time well no doubt steeping herself in her craft and the forbidden lore of the ancients gaining strength and black wisdom she could wait knowing perhaps that her best time to strike had not yet come there would be chaos in the land soon and she would have her chance when she struck there would be no mistaking it it was clear to me from that moment that the problems of britain could not be considered wholly apart from morgian the very fact that she had taken a briton king as husband the people of the orcades are briton rather than pict or irish could only mean that her ambitions had blossomed since i had last seen her then she might have been content with a soul or two to torture now she wanted an entire realm great light be the strong shield before your warriors be the very steel in their hands it occurred to me to use the seeing bowl to determine what morgian was about although i shrank inwardly from an encounter with her i could have done it but it seemed best to me not to interfere or draw attention to myself in any way i did not know what powers she possessed very likely she already knew i was back among the living if not she soon would better to let her wait and wonder it never serves to let an enemy know your strength and position listen to me avallach i told him you have no reason to feel guilt for morgian you are not responsible for her evil am i not he frowned as if something foul lay on his tongue i gave her life merlin oh what would i give if if if and if and if do you hear yourself i said hotly if cannot change w he looked at me with mild reproach for my temper no nothing is changed merlin he said sadly we all must bear our failures to the grave we spoke no more about this and went on to talk of happier things still i wondered why his words stirred such a response in me but he does blame himself said charis later when i told her about it he believes himself responsible one man cannot make himself responsible for the actions of another i insisted mother smiled one did once or have you forgotten is there anything to prevent it happening again i had not forgotten but i remembered it now anew and in a slightly different light was charis suggesting that avallach might be contemplating an atoning act on behalf of morgian here was something new to think about you cannot let him do it i said earnestly you must not merlin she said soothingly what is the matter you are troubled son tell me i sighed and shook my head it is nothing it will pass for some reason i thought of maelwys and i asked about him tell me how did maelwys die there was an attack on maridunum charis explained we fought off the invaders having met them on the coast the battle was over and he was returning to the villa with some of his men there was an ambush and the villa was fired as she spoke my mind filled with images of such horror and pain that i trembled to see them my mother broke off her recitation merlin what is wrong it was some moments before i could speak there is great hardship coming i replied at last many will fall in the darkness and many more will be lost to it i regarded her grimly hating what i had seen surely no one alive now has ever endured such calamity i have merlin she said gently answering the note of hopelessness in my voice i have endured and so has avallach and all the rest who came with us mother look around there are few left now fewer every year it was a cruel thing to say i do not know why i said it and the instant the words were out of my mouth i would have given my eyes to have them back charis nodded sadly it is true my hawk there are fewer of us every year maildun my brother died in the winter she lowered her eyes we will not last i used to hope that we might find a way to survive here i thought that with your father through taliesin and i we might survive in that way but it was not to be yes our days upon the land are nearly over and soon we will follow the rest of earths first children into the dust i am sorry mother i should not have spoken so forgive me it is the truth merlin you need never apologize for the truth she raised her head and looked me square in the eye and i saw i was mistaken if i thought her words meant she had given up but there is a greater truth that must not be silenced ever the kingdom of summer as long as i am alive it too is alive and it lives in you merlin and in all who believe and follow the kingdom of summer was it only a dream of paradise or could it be made real here and now could men of flesh and blood inhabit such a place once taliesin had conceived it had sung its shape in the heart there could be no turning away from it to deny the summer realm now would be to acquiesce to defeat and ultimately to evil itself for whenever the vision of a greater good has been proclaimed in the world of men it must be striven for even unto death anything less is denial and denial mocks the great light that inhabits the vision and gives it life turning away from good once it is known is wilfully turning towards evil taliesin had set an enormous burden upon my shoulders for it fell to me to bring the summer kingdom into being would that i had his voice his gifts i might have sung it into existence look i can see him with the harp in his hands the shimmering notes spinning from his fingers his face glowing with the reflected glory of his song and oh such a song words streaming from his throat as through a living doorway from the otherworld his fair hair shining in the torchlight the whole world still and breathless to hear the heartbreaking beauty of his song i see him and i weep father i never knew you i stayed at ynys avallach until the new moon and let the timeless serenity of the place reclaim my soul i would have need of serenity in the turbulent days ahead then on a cool bright morning pelleas and i rode out once more to begin the long impossible task of saving the island of the mighty two i found aurelius and uther on the road returning from the battle with vortigern the old fox had come to a messy end locked in a burning tower deserted by his closest allies even his son pascent had fled to the coast leaving his father to face justice alone thus the fight had been short and sharp and decisive the two brothers were still flushed with exultation when i met them a little north of glevum near where they had finally run vortigern to ground aurelius had been instantly proclaimed high king by those who supported him i saw him and shuddered he was so young you were scarcely his age when you took the tore pelleas whispered to me as we waited to be ushered before him true i suppose but i had hoped for a little more maturity to work with i groaned for the work ahead young aurelius was high king in name only his biggest battle lay before him for he had yet to win the support of the majority of smaller kings most of whom thought themselves eminently qualified to rule the roost now that vortigern was gone winning fealty would be a rough campaign in itself it did not need hengist to make it more bloody than it already promised i knew that many of the lesser lords would not be convinced by anything other than brute force that was bad enough but hengist had yet to be dealt with in short i saw nothing for it but to advise aurelius to make quick work of any who would not uphold him if he would listen to me i had no right to expect that he would pelleas was more optimistic everyone has heard of myrddin emrys he told me of course he will see you he will welcome you like a brother like a disreputable uncle as it turned out but he did agree to meet with me which was something i sat across the board from aurelius in his skin tent and we drank mead together while he watched me and tried to make up his mind about me uther had already made up his mind and fussed and fidgeted in the background trying to be noticed by his older brother so that he could say what he thought which would in no way be complimentary i was sure aurelius had a brooding look accentuated by a head of curly dark hair cut close to his skull in the imperial manner and dark dark eyes set deep under even dark brows he had a high noble forehead and a wellformed unlined face now sunbrowned from his days on the road he also had maximus sword though i had not seen it since meeting the duke of britain that day in elphins stronghold when i was a small boy i recognized it at once the finehoned steel the bronze hilt wrapped with braided silver the great eaglecarved amethyst winking purple in the pommel there is not another like it in all the world how he had come by it i could guess how he had managed to keep it was the real marvel if vortigern or anyone else had known about it he would not have lived to see this day old gosselyn saved the boys and he saved the sword in so doing he preserved more than he knew aurelius looked me over carefully as i came to stand before him the expression of vague disdain tugging at his features gave me to know that he thought little of the intrusion of an unexpected madman into his plans but like it or not we were stuck with each other for neither of us was there anyone else it all came down to us i could accept that but i did not know if aurelius could i am glad to meet the famous merlin at last aurelius said trying out his best diplomacy your fame precedes you as does yours sire i used the newlyadopted epithet to show my support of his claim to the high kingship this pleased him immensely and the light came in his eyes does it indeed he wanted to hear it from my lips how should it not you have vanquished the usurper vortigern and have collected the blood debt owed you these many years and this in most impressive fashion all the world is singing your praises whether or no he was true high king material this little speech of mine would tell he smiled but shook his head slowly not all the world surely i can think of a fair few who are singing their own praises even now and some were men who marched with me but a few days ago so he did not rise to the bait well done aurelius my next probe sought different territory well what of them what does it matter what a few selfimportant grumblers think i only wish that i could dismiss them so easily in truth merlin i need those grumblers every one they are all that stand between me and hengist he flashed a sudden smile between my rump upon the throne and that bloodlusting saecsens i like to think the britons would prefer mine yours is an admirable rump my king i agreed with mock solemnity much to be preferred to any saecsen rump and we both laughed pelleas and uther stared at us as if we were drunk in our cups my lord brother protested uther unable to hold himself back any longer you have only just met this man and already you bespeak confidences to him only just met oh i think not uther i have known the man for a very long time it seems to me and we have been testing one another since he walked into this tent aurelius turned back to me i will trust you merlin ambrosius you will be my counsellor here uther snorted loudly and shook his red locks in sharp disapproval he will be my counsellor uther i need an adviser and we are not exactly neck deep in volunteers uther subsided but aurelius had warmed to the matter on his heart yes another score left this morning left the picket before dawn my lords and chieftains are deserting me merlin i have delivered them from vortigern and now they turn against me how many warriors are left there are two hundred here and five hundred follow a day behind seven hundred is not a man too many to take on hengist growled uther yes admitted aurelius ruefully and half of those are hoels men and they must return to armorica soon it is worse than i thought i told him aurelius dashed down the last of his mead and sat looking glum uther paced dejectedly how quickly the moods of the young can shift though not as bad as it might be i began i have friends in the west and in the north i believe we can count them among your supporters the north aurelius slapped the board with his palms on my life merlin if i had the north behind me the south and midlands would fall in line the west is where the true power lies aurelius it always has the romans never understood that and so never really conquered this island at all the west sneered uther as if it were a disease cattle thieves and corn merchants so the romans thought i replied and where is rome now he glared lethally at me as i continued but go to dyfed and gwynedd and see for yourself the cymry are still there still ruling their clans with dynasties that stretch back five hundred years a thousand and they are as strong as ever stronger perhaps now that rome can no longer bleed them of men and tribute cattle thieves and corn merchants arms alone do not make a king strong it takes cattle and corn as well any king who finally understands that will be high king indeed well said merlin well said aurelius slapped the board again what do you propose shall we ride to the west first or to the north to the west we will go at once today aurelius stood up as if he would dash out and leap upon his horse standing more slowly i shook my head i will go alone but i do think it best if i go alone it has been a long time since i lived there it would be well for me to see how matters sit first before arriving with an army let me win them for you before you have to deal with them what do we do while you play at kingmaking demanded uther the last word was a slap in my face kingmaking is exactly what i am playing at uther my lad i growled make no mistake you won a great victory yes over an old man already exhausted and sore beset he bristled at this glowering murderously at me but i was ruthless neither you nor your brother will last the summer without me and my kingmaking and that is the way of it have we no choice in the matter he whined of course you have a choice you can listen to me and do as i say or you can find yourselves a shallow grave beside the read somewhere and scoop the dirt over your faces or hightail it back to armorica to languish in hoels court the rest of your miserable lives i let them have it between the eyes but they took it like men and did not cringe they did not like it but neither did they yelp like spoiled children if they had i would have ridden from the camp and never returned so it was a start aurelius clear thinking prevailed over others hotblooded impulsiveness and i was firmly installed as the high kings counsellor future high king i should say for we had much work to do before his rump could sit that throne that very afternoon pelleas and i rode for dyfed taking with us only a few golden armbands aurelius sent along for presents to be given as i saw fit these would be welcome of course a polite gesture although the canny cymry would not be won by gifts of gold they would want to know who this upstart high king was and what he was made of eventually they would want to meet him in the flesh that would come in time but i wanted to prepare the way my first glimpse of my onetime homeland caused my throat to tighten and my eyes to mist we had stopped a little way off the old deva road on a hilltop overlooking the broad humps of the western hillscape those high handsome hills with the wind fingering the long grass and ruffling the new heather spoke to me of a happier time a time when a newmade king rode the hills with his proud warband working tirelessly to make safe his realm we looked to the sea in those days now the invaders were firmly planted on our own soil vortigern had given hengist and his brother horsa their own lands along the southeastern coast in exchange for protection while it was true that the fox had no better alternative so contrary were the kings beneath him they would have sided with hengist if vortigern had not done it first the bargain proved disastrous in the end hengist not only nipped the hand that fed him he meant to take it off clean to the shoulder after a little time pelleas urged the horses forward and we started down into the long crooked valley that wound between the hills leading in due course to dyfed we camped that night in a grove beside a quickrunning burn and arrived in maridunum caer myrddin now at sunset the following day in the dying light like fiery embers of a fading fire all crimson and gold and white the town appeared unchanged its walls solid its streets paved its houses square and upright but it was an illusion as we rode slowly through the streets i saw that the walls were breeched in places too numerous to count the streets broken the houses tumbled dogs ran in the ruins and somewhere a baby bawled but we saw no one about pelleas would turn his head neither right nor left but rode straight on without a sideways glance i should have done the same but could not help myself what had happened to the town maridunum had never been anything more than a scruffy scuffling market town even so it had life apparently that life was over and it had become the habitation of homeless dogs and phantom children having passed through maridunum as bad as it was i was in no wise ready for the shock of seeing my old home and birthplace the villa on the hill it was as if i had ridden through the town and back in time a few hundred years for the villa was gone and in its place stood a hillfort with a timber hall and palisade and ringed with steep ditches something common enough in the northern wilderness but unseen in the civilized southland for ten generations or more for all the world it appeared a celtic settlement from before the eagles set foot on the island of the mighty pelleas led us up the path and waited below the gates which were already shut against the night although the sky was still light in the west but the timber gates were opened readily enough following pelleas call and we ambled into a compound crowded with clusters of small logandthatch huts surrounding a great hall of dressed timber impressive in its proportions of the villa that had once stood on this very ground there was no sign in taliesins time this seat of demetae and siluri power had been ruled by pendaran gleddyvrudd who in later years shared the throne with his son maelwys and briefly even with me red sword was long dead of course and alas so was maelwys times and needs change no doubt the hillfort was immensely more practical for its occupants but i missed the villa and found myself wondering whether the little chapel in the woods still stood or whether it like the villa had been replaced by an older temple to an older god pelleas nudged me they are coming master i turned to see men issuing from the great hall a few with torches in their hands their leader was a mature man of goodly stature with greased hair tied at the nape of his neck and a huge golden tore on his neck he looked enough like maelwys that i knew pendarans bloodline to be healthy greetings friend he said with casual friendliness nevertheless eyeing me with keen interest what brings you here i have come i answered to seek a home i once knew it will be dark soon too dark for searching out a settlement stay with us tonight his eyes had strayed to my harp behind the saddle and we will help you find the place you seek in the morning it was tewdrig himself who addressed me he had inherited maelwys generous nature but i replied in truth this is the place i am looking for he stepped closer and putting his hand on the bridle of my horse peered up at me do i know you tell me if i do for i cannot remember ever seeing you within these walls no there is no reason you should know me it is many years since i have been here when this hillfort was a villa still and maelwys was its king he stared in disbelief myrddin a murmur of excitement passed among those gathered round one young man ran back into the hall and a moment later more men and women were streaming out into the yard i am myrddin i said quietly and i have returned tewdrig you are welcome here my lord will you come in and sit at my table that i said climbing down from the saddle we will be most happy to do pelleas and i were conducted into the great hall by the entire throng news of my coming flitted like sparks on the wind among them and the hubbub grew around us although the hall was spacious soon it was filled with a crush of people all buzzing with excitement so that tewdrig had to shout in order to be heard lord your arrival here is unexpected if only you had sent your man ahead to warn us of your coming i could have prepared a feast for you as it is he gestured vaguely round the hall although not bedecked with festive finery it was no shabby place i gathered from a glance that the demetae and silures still possessed much wealth and hence much power as it stands i told him frankly is how i wanted to see it i had not overlooked his use of the word warn for despite his welcome which was genuine it bespoke the worry in his heart i could calm his fears with a word but i decided to let it wait for a moment the better to see how he was made tewdrig ordered food to be brought and beer in the guest cup a huge silver bowl with double handles offered me by a comely girl with long dark braids this is govan my wife tewdrig offered by way of introduction welcome friend govan replied demurely health to you and success to your journey with that i took the cup from govan lifted it by the handles and drank the liquid was pale frothy and cool reviving my appetite admirably it appears the brewers art has reached new heights since last i held such a cup as this i commented this is a draught worthy of any king you shall have a butt of it to take with you when you have concluded your business here lord tewdrig replied he was trying his best to get me to speak of my errand without asking outright which would have been ungracious i could imagine the thoughts spinning in his head if myrddin the former lord and king of this realm had returned it could be for one reason only to reassert his claim to the throne and take back his lands where he wondered did that leave him exactly the fact that i had not arrived with a warband at my command was not lost on him and it made him wonder i thank you most heartily i told him replacing the cup at that moment food was brought from the kitchens and the platters laid on the board we took our places i sat on his left govan with his infant son meurig on his right and we began to eat while we ate i remarked on the changes id noticed in the town and in the caer tewdrig lamented the passing of the town and the necessity that had occasioned the construction of the hillfort the villa could not be saved he said although we have kept what treasures we could he pointed to the floor near the hearth where i saw the old mosaic floor of red white and black tiles that had adorned gleddyvrudds hall so sad to lose something so fine and we were losing so much that would never be replaced was it very bad i asked wondering he nodded his head slowly bad enough the same raid that took maelwys took the town and villa also my father teithfallt saved what he could but there was not much when supper was finished a few of the younger boys who had seen the harp behind my saddle pushed one of the braver of their number forward to beg their lords indulgence they had a request of me tewdrig was on the point of sending the audacious lad away with a stern rebuke for his affrontery but i interceded i would be most happy to sing them a song lord tewdrig the boys eyes grew round for he assumed i had known his request even before he spoke it in truth i had seen the same look on too many young boys faces in the presence of a bard not to know what it meant bring me my harp gelli i told him he stared wondering how i knew his name like so many things since my madness i did not know myself until i had said it but once spoken i knew the thing i said to be true well said tewdrig do not stand there gaping like a fish on the beach fetch the harp lad look you quick i sang from the tale of the daughters of llyr and pleased the whole of caer myrddin they clamoured for more when i finished but i was tired and so laid my harp aside promising i would sing again another time and people began shuffling off to their sleepingplaces queen govan bade us good night and carried the yawning meurig away tewdrig ordered more beer and we withdrew accompanied by pelleas and two of the kings advisers to his private chamber behind a woven wicker partition at the end of the hall it was clear that the lord of caer myrddin meant to have a full explanation of my presence if it took all night i had seen enough that evening to know that tewdrig was an honourable man and no matter how things fell between us he would do what honour required therefore i decided to put a quick end to his anxiety we settled in chairs facing one another a rushlight hung from the beam above casting a ruddy circle of light like a glimmering mantle thrown over us one of his men filled silverrimmed horns with beer and passed them to us pelleas stood behind my chair silent expressionless his tall handsome form like that of a protecting angel which in a way he was tewdrig drew a big draught and wiped the foam from his drooping moustache with a thumb and forefinger eyeing me all the while i noticed that neither of his men drank with him it has been he said slowly amiably an interesting night too long have the songs of the bard been absent from my hearth thank you for filling my hall with joy tonight i would reward you for your song he paused and looked at me squarely but something tells me you would accept nothing but what you came here to receive lord and king i said quickly have no fear for your throne on my account i have not come to claim it although i could make good that claim if that were my intent but it is not he rubbed his chin absently no it is not i have not come to take back my lands tewdrig his eyes went to his men and a secret signal passed between them for instantly the tension in the room subtle but quite present melted away more beer was poured and they all drank a crisis had been averted i tell you the truth myrddin said tewdrig i did not know what i would do with you this is your realm and rightly i avow it before you i would not challenge your right but i have been king here these many years and my father before me there is no need to explain tewdrig i well understand for this reason i deem it best to let my claim lapse too much has happened too many years have passed for me to take back my throne myrddin will not be king again tewdrig nodded sympathetically but offered no response no i continued i will not be king again but in remembrance of a time past when i was a king of dyfed i have come to ask your support for another who desperately needs your help if he is a friend of yours myrddin tewdrig said expansively it was relief talking to be sure we will offer whatever aid you deem best you have but to name it i leaned forward wiser not to promise before the boon is asked nevertheless the need is such that i would hold you to it regardless but no no it cannot be like that for it is no small thing i ask ask it friend high king vortigern is dead vortigern dead how asked one of tewdrigs men when asked the other only a few days ago he was killed by aurelius son of constantine the true high king aurelius has taken his fathers place for now but there are many who consider themselves more worthy to sit the high kings throne even now those who fought at his side turn against him i expect aurelius will not last the summer without support without friends i said i had little love for constantine and less for vortigern they were both arrogant foolish men it is because of vortigern that we suffer the saecsen wrath now tewdrig paused and took a long drink then placed the horn aside if aurelius had come here himself to ask for aid i would have sent him away right quick but you you myrddin you intercede for him why because my lord tewdrig he is all that stands between us and the saecsen horde tewdrig chewed on that for a while is this so if it were not so i would not have come to you like this in truth aurelius is all we have but we have arms insisted one of tewdrigs advisers and we have men and horses to use them we are more than a match for any saecsen warband are you indeed i asked scornfully when was the last time you stood with a naked blade in your hand under the blast of saecsen battlehorns while a host of saecsen berserkers flew towards you over the battleground the man made no reply i tell you that hengist has assembled the greatest war host yet seen in the island of the mighty and before the summer is through he means to have the throne he will have it too for we are too busy squabbling among ourselves to take arms against him there is something in what you say allowed tewdrig there is truth in what i say what would you have us do the king asked two things i said first put aside any notions you might have that you will become high king that cannot happen then gather the warbands of the demetae and silures and ride with me to pledge them to aurelius for how long asked one of the men for as long as he needs them for ever tewdrig pulled on his chin and looked from one to the other of his counsellors this is something that cannot be decided tonight he said at length it is late i will sleep on the matter and give you my decision in the morning it will wait until morning i agreed rising then added a warning but no longer rest well tewdrig three i arose early the next morning for tewdrigs decision but the king could not be found his chamber was empty and no one would say where he went nor when i could but wait for him to return and think the worst while i waited midmorning at pelleas insistence i broke fast on a few little barley cakes and some watered wine then i went outside and walked around the caer trying to see the old place beneath the new one it was what i imagined grandfather elphins caer dyvi in gwynedd must have been like all industry and bustle clustered behind a stout earthen rampart topped by a timber wall and the people were these the same folk i had led in my brief time as king they dressed not as the britons i remember but as the celts of an older time the women in long colourful mantles the men in brightchecked breeches and tunics and all with the distinctive plaid cloaks of the cymry their hair was worn long and bound back to hang in tight braids or loose ponytails wherever i looked gold silver bronze or copper glinted from every throat and wrist and arm and shoulder all worked in the cunning designs of the celtic artisan lowbuilt houses most of notched logs topped with a neat reedthatched roof sheltered one another with but narrow lanes between them filling what had been the square courtyard of the villa tewdrig had a smith whose forge and hut occupied the mound where the old pagan temple had been the forge was of stone no doubt the selfsame stone of the temple very well in the day of strife when men worship steel for their salvation let the temples become ironworks but this morning so bright with summers rich promise the storm clouds seemed far away very far indeed from this realm of peace on such a day i feared that tewdrigs decision would go against me surely his advisers would say there is no need to further the claims of an upstart king what is it to us if he boasts imperial blood if aurelius would be high king let him win the throne by the might of his sword whatever happens it is his business and none of ours we have our own affairs to worry about i could hear them coaxing tewdrig to do what he was already inclined to do anyway and i feared my efforts had been wasted more if i had misjudged the temper of the demetae and silures i had once ruled how could i expect to fare any better with the kings of the north perhaps if i had pressed my claim to the kingship perhaps then but no the seed was sown i would have to wait for the harvest and wait i did like a hound waiting before the badgers hole when would tewdrig return at last anxious exasperated tired of waiting i dozed off for a light sleep before supper and was roused a short time later by pelleas nudge on my shoulder wake up master lord tewdrig has returned i sat up instantly alert when just now i heard the shout when the horses entered the yard i stood and splashed water on my face from the laving bowl on the table dried myself on the linen provided and then straightening the folds of my cloak over my shoulder went out to meet the king if i was taxed by my ordeal of waiting tewdrig appeared exhausted by his eyes redrimmed face grey with dust and fatigue he obviously had not slept and had ridden very much further than planned but a thin smile pulled at the corners of his mouth and seeing that i took hope bring me my cup he shouted as he strode into the hall bring cups for us all i waited for him to come to me and to speak the first word he in turn waited for the cups to be brought and his roadthirst slaked before he would speak he drank deep and long drawing out the moment full length well myrddin emrys he said at last lowering the cup and wiping his moustache with the back of his hand you are looking at king aurelius most formidable ally i wanted to let out a wild whoop of joy but contained myself and simply replied indeed i am glad to hear it but why formidable tewdng shook his head wearily that i must be to have won against my lords and chieftains all of whom put up a great resistance to your scheme using ironcast arguments which i was hardpressed to beat down but you did beat them down aye that i did he eyed his counsellors while they stood grimly their mouths pressed into firm scowls and with no help from anyone here he looked at me once more and raised a hand to knead the back of his neck bless me jesu i wheedled and bargained as if my life depended on it as well it might i told him be that as it may tewdrig continued i have done well by you this day myrddin emrys i have bent my honour no little way for you and do not mind bending it further to tell you that i consider you as deep in my debt as ever any man was so be it it is a debt i will repay gladly for i count it gain to be indebted to so worthy a lord you should have seen me myrddin lleus own tongue flapped in my head this day and lleus logic was on me why lieu himself could not have argued better flushed anew with his victory he bolted down some more beer and continued recklessly when i left here i thought only to give my chieftains a chance to confirm my own thoughts in the matter yes its true i was against it but the more they talked the more they argued the more i hardened my heart to their cries make no mistake i meant to find reason to refuse you myrddin but i heard in their counsel the sounds of selfsatisfied smallminded men and i did not like that noise in truth it frightened me have we become so safe our realm so secure that we no longer need the help of our brother kings are we now invincible or have the saecsens taken wings and fled home over the sea that tewdrig growled triumphantly is what i asked them and they had no answer there it is myrddin i strove against my own chieftains and i prevailed he lifted his cup and i took one up and lifted it to his i drink to the new high king may his spear fly true we drank and giving my cup to pelleas i raised my hands in the bardic declamation saying your loyalty will be rewarded tewdrig and because of the faith you have shown this day you will win a name that will endure for ever in the land this pleased him enormously for he broke into a widetoothed grin my warriors will uphold that loyalty a hundredfold let no one ever say that dyfed did not back its king i remained at caer myrddin another day and then set out with pelleas and one of tewdrigs advisers llawr eilerw one of the two who were always with him and a small force of ten warriors as escort we rode at once to the north for i wanted to present aurelius with as much support as i could gather before returning to him partly out of vanity i suppose ashamed as i am to say it i wished to demonstrate my power to him to gain his confidence it was in my mind that i would need his complete trust and very soon with dyfed in hand i could go to the northern kingdoms without feeling the beggar tewdrig ap teithfallt was well respected in the north and as i have said the ties between the two regions were ancient and honourable i anticipated no trouble and indeed received none along the way llawr told me all that had happened since i had lived and ruled in dyfed most of which had come down to him from his elders since he was in no wise old enough to have remembered it of himself it seems that word of the goddeu massacre eventually reached maridunum maelwys was heartbroken but since my body had not been found there was some hope that i still lived king maelwys held firm to his dying day the notion that you were alive llawr told me as we journeyed through the cool mountain passes of yr widdfa one afternoon all those years and he would never hear a word but that you would return one day i wish it could have been sooner i replied sadly he died in the raid that took the villa i believe that he did and more than many with him llawrs tone betrayed no emotion why should it the events he spoke of had happened before he had been born and the world he described was different from the one he knew the barbarians came at us from the east so the beacons were no use they were on us almost before the alarm could be given we beat them back of course but we lost maelwys and the villa to them that day maelwys to an axeblade the villa to the torch i was silent for a time out of respect for maelwys and all that he had given me of himself great light grant him a place of honour at your feast teithfallt succeeded him i asked a little while later yes a nephew salachs youngest son ah salach i had forgotten about him he went to gaul to become a priest did he not so he did i am told he had returned some years earlier to help bishop dafyd with his church the bishop was getting old and required a younger hand take over certain duties salach had married and fathered two sons the eldest one gwythelyn already dedicated to the church and the other teithfallt he dedicated to dyfed and its people in time teithfallt distinguished himself in the eyes of maelwys lords as a canny battlechief so when the king was killed it was natural they should choose him teithfallt ruled well and wisely and died in his bed tewdrig already shared the throne with his father as war leader and he became king upon teithfallts death so that is the way of it i mused the realm was in good strong hands and that was how it should be i could never be a king again even if i wanted to be aurelius needed me the island of the mighty needed me far more than dyfed ever did or would it was clear to me that my lord jesu had placed my feet on a different path my destiny lay another way if i had any qualms about returning to the north to the scene of my beloved ganiedas hideous death they were swallowed up hi the desire to see at long last her grave since my healing i no longer felt the insane morbidity that had consumed and nearly destroyed me i did feel the fleeting emptiness of a grief that would remain with me for ever but it was not unbearable to me and not without the upwardlooking hope that we would one day be reunited on the other side of deaths manyshadowed door so before coming into custennins old stronghold in celyddon i had pelleas conduct me to my wifes grave he waited outside the little grove with the horses while i went in alone as into a secluded chapel to pray i will not say that the sight of that small mound lying in the wooded glade now much overgrown with woodbine and vetch did not move me i wept to see it and my tears were sweet grief to me a single grey stone stood over the mound where her body lay in its hollowedoak coffin the stone a single slab of slate had been worked its surface smoothed and trimmed and an elaborate cross of christ incised on its face and beneath the cross the simple legend in latin hic tvmvlo iacet ganieda filia constentivs in pax christvs i traced the neatlycarved words with my fingertips and murmured here in this tomb lies ganieda daughter of custennin in the peace of christ there was no mention of the child nor of my heart as there might have been for in truth both were buried with her all in all it was a tranquil place near where she had died and if the gravesite was not much visited any more at least it was hidden from the casual desecrations of unthinking wayfarers i knelt down and prayed a long prayer and when i rose i felt peace reclaim its place in my soul i left the grove content in heart and mind then pelleas and i returned to where our escort waited and we continued to goddeu i should have known what to expect i should have been prepared but i was not too much had happened in too short a time it seemed and the sight of custennin and goddeu unchanged shocked me as much as the change in maridunum had shocked me but there he stood bold and big as the day i first had seen him proud monarch of celyddon fair folk king great battlechief and ruler of a haughty people like avallach and others of their race the years had not touched custennin nor would they he even maintained the same appearance as when i knew him before in everything including the two black wolfhounds crouching at his heels i swung down from the saddle as he approached and went to him without a word he gathered me in his powerful arms and crushed me to him as i had seen him do with ganieda countless times myrddin my son he murmured in his deep voice you have come back from the dead i have indeed i replied he pushed me away and held me at arms length looking at me there were unshed tears in his eyes i never thought to see you again his eyes slid past me to pelleas whom he acknowledged with a nod but pelleas insisted you were still alive and he never stopped searching for you would that i had had his faith i only wish i could have come sooner have you seen ganiedas grave i have just come from there it is a good stone yes i had the priests at caer ligal make it i noticed he said nothing about his son so i asked what of gwendolau he is buried on the field where he died i will take you there if you like but you will remember the place i have never forgotten it nor would i ever we have spoken our respect for the dead and that is good and proper custennin said now let us talk of the living i have another son for i have taken a wife in recent years and she has just given birth to a babe this was good news and i told him so custennin was well pleased for the birth of this child meant a great deal to him what is his name cunomor he told me an old name but a good one may he grow into the stature of his illustrious ancestors i said lightly come inside and rest from your journey we will eat and drink together custennin said pulling me along with him he held me by the arm as if he were afraid that i might disappear again if he relaxed his hold for even an instant and then you will meet my new son we did eat and drink together and i greeted his son who looked precisely like all newborn babes everywhere i sang in custennins hall and fell asleep that night thinking about the first night i had sheltered under his roof an awkward boy dressed in wolfskins halfwild and alone and hopelessly infatuated with the most beautiful girl i had ever seen the next morning i walked out to the place where gwendolau was buried and i prayed for the good gods mercy on his soul it was evening when the reason for my visit arose well myrddin wylt said custennin slapping a dog leash against his leg what news of the wider world beyond this forest we were walking together at the near fringe of the forest a new dog which custennin was training ran on ahead of us there is news at last i replied this was the kings way of saying that he was ready now to talk vortigern is dead good he stared at the trail ahead health to his enemies yes and there were not a few of them who is to be high king in his place need anyone i asked probing his mind on the subject he glanced quickly at me to see if i was serious oh yes i think so despite what vortigern became it is a good thing each year the saecsen grow bolder they take more for each king to defend his own little patch that is becoming too difficult we must help one another if any of us are to survive if a high king can make this happen i support him he broke off abruptly but custennin stopped walking and turned to me but what we need is not another vortigern sitting in his mead hall drunk on ambition and power bloated with goldlust feasting the saecsen and giving them land because he is too much a coward to confront them on the field of battle he spat his venom and then paused when he spoke again he was cooler what we need is a war leader a battlechief over all others leading all the armies as his own a dux britanniarum i said musing duke of britain supreme commander of all armies in the land yes that is what we need not another vortigern he started walking again we would still need a high king i ventured to keep the other kings in their place oh aye agreed custennin and to keep the war host supplied from the coffers of the kings beneath him but on the battleground the supreme commander must wield a power above even the high king in battle there is enough to worry about without having to wonder whether you will offend this lord or that in some obscure way or run out of supplies because someone did not send the aid he promised the way we fight he lamented it is a wonder we are still here at all a plan was taking shape in my mind what if i told you your thoughts could become reality custennin laughed i would say you were an enchanter indeed the chief enchanter of the island of the mighty but would you support the man how could i not i have already said i would he looked at me slyly does such a man exist not yet but he will soon who the man who killed vortigern men rather there were two of them brothers brothers what is more they have already won the support of the kings of dyfed for their claim to the high kingship custennin mulled this over in his mind for a moment who are these remarkable men aurelius and uther sons of constantine i believe that with the cymry kings and the kings of the north on his side aurelius will be high king and the other this uther he could well be the battlelord you speak of custennin began to see what i was seeing he nodded then asked the lords of the west will follow him they will i assured him i have spoken to them as i am speaking to you now on their behalf tewdrig sends his adviser the one who rides with me so that you will know that what i say is true the lords of the west support aurelius custennin slapped the leash sharply across his palm then the lords of the north will support him as well he smiled grimly and by the god you serve myrddin i pray that you are right right or wrong i said this new king and his brother are the only hope we have the next day custennin sent messengers out to his lords and chieftains to gather in goddeu to voice their approval of his plans to support aurelius as high king and uther as his supreme war leader i could guess what custennins lords would think of the idea but i did not know what uther would say that i would soon discover four i cannot say uther was overjoyed to hear what the lords of the north had decided that they would support aurelius if uther would lead the war host uther fancying himself high king material rebelled at the thought considering it somehow beneath him i delivered the ultimatum only moments after our arrival from goddeu custennin like tewdrig had sent advisers with me and aurelius had seen them as we entered camp cold and wet for it had been misting rain all day the king summoned me before i could even change into dry clothing both aurelius and uther had listened to my summary and uther spoke first so the yapping dog is to be thrown a bone to keep him quiet is that it i did not reply so he continued thrusting his fist in my face you put them up to this you merlin the meddler aurelius looked on placidly uther do not take on so how should i not brother dear i am to be made a simple spearbearer and you sit by and say nothing uther sulked i should be a king at least it was custennins idea i told him and it was his lords who added the condition of your leading the war host not me still i think it is no bad thing consider it uther said aurelius seeking to smooth his brothers ruffled feathers of the two of us you are the better warrior true sniffed uther and as i am the older the kingship falls to me aurelius fixed him a stern glance also true uther admitted then what is to prevent you from becoming this supreme commander it is an insult sneered uther i bit back the words that were stinging my tongue like wasps aurelius put a hand on his brothers shoulder since when is it an insult to lead the greatest army in the world uther softened aurelius pressed home his point is it an insult to be the supreme commander of all the britons think of it uther hundreds of thousands of men at your command a thousand thousand all looking to you trusting you for their lives you will win great renown and your name will be remembered for ever shamelessly aurelius preened his brothers vanity and not without the desired effect the greatest army in the empire uther murmured in an older time i put in the war leader was called dux britanniarum it means duke of britain magnus maximus held the title before he became emperor you see not since emperor maximus have we had a dux britanniarum a noble title uther and it is yours yours alone here aurelius broke off he stepped backward a pace and raised his arm in the old roman salute hail uther duke of britain uther could not help himself any longer he burst into a grin answering hail aurelianus high king of the britons they fell laughing into one anothers arms like the overgrown boys they were i let them have their fun and then announced now then tewdrig and custennin await an answer from you both their advisers are gathered in my tent and wish to speak with you before riding back to report to their lords i suggest you do not keep them waiting even a moment longer i do not know where aurelius had come by his tact but it was a wellhoned tool with him and he used it like a craftsman and that was not all he also possessed a high and noble dignity which he could wield when it suited him and this on more than one occasion won the day for him when words alone were not enough to say that he coaxed and flattered the advisers who had come to see him would cheapen his art for he was far more subtle than that he never coaxed but he persuaded he never flattered but he encouraged those around him to think the best of themselves uther of course he had a different way with still he was never devious or dishonest the imperial blood ran true in his veins and it was not in him to disgrace it as i came to know aurelius i came to honour him and to love him he was what our people needed he would be a true high king to unite all kingdoms with his power just as uther would be the battlechief to lead them on the field of battle together they made a most formidable force although there was never any doubt in my mind which one of the two was the wiser and stronger uther simply did not have his brothers character he was not to blame perhaps for this lack men of aurelius stamp are rare it was merely uthers poor luck to have aurelius for a brother and to be forced to live his whole life in his brothers shadow in consequence i undertook never to compare one of them against the other nor ever to praise aurelius in uthers hearing nor out of it without also praising uther a small thing you may think but empires have foundered on less with the kingdoms of the west and the north behind aurelius the stiffnecked lords of lloegres in the south were suddenly faced with an almost insurmountable obstacle to winning the high kingship for themselves or one of their own most seeing the prudence of capitulation if not the wisdom of unity fell in with the powerful west and north in their support of aurelius for others in whom the whitehot fires of ambition burned and blinded it was a challenge that could not be ignored they would fight aurelius for the throne and quench the fire once and for all in blood woefully many a good man lost his life to an ally who on another day might have been fighting jutes and saecsens instead it was a painful purging but necessary aurelius would be king of all or king of none there was no other way i rode with him always by his side upholding him in battle as taliesin had done for elphin in another day i will say that they had need of my help through that long difficult summer aurelius so sure and forthright ordinarily would at times misdoubt himself and grow discouraged nothing can be worth this merlin he would moan and i would embolden him with heartening words uther had no stomach for fighting allies but he was a warrior and had a warriors soul he could dare and do many things other men would shrink from and this earned him a fearsome reputation in the land uther it was soon whispered abroad was aurelius wolfhound a coldhearted killer who would tear throat and heart out of any man at his masters slightest command he was not so much coldhearted as he was loyal and his loyalty to his brother to the high kingship itself knew no bounds in this uther earned my respect his steadfastness was sprung from love a love both genuine and pure there are not many men who love so selflessly as uther loved aurelius this flamehaired firebrand lavished no love on me however he distrusted me with the same unreasoning suspicion many socalled enlightened men adopt in the presence of someone or something they cannot comprehend he tolerated me yes and in time he came to accept me and even to value my counsel for he saw that i meant him no harm and that i shared his love of aurelius well we three were a sight to behold riding here and there with our troops most of whom were unmounted there simply were not enough horses to go round hungry all the time tired and dirty and sore wounded and sick but we were tenacious we had fastened on the high kingship like hounds on the scent of the stag and we would not be put off one by one the warbands of lloegres fell to us one by one we added the fealty of southern lords to aurelius rule dunaut lord of the belligerent brigantes coledac lord of the ancient iceni and catuvellauni morcant lord of the industrious and independent belgae gorlas lord of the contentious cornovii proud arrogantmen each and every one of them but they all bowed the knee to aurelius before it was through then in the last shining days of false summer just before the autumn rain spread its dripping cloak over the land we turned to face hengist at last it was not the best of circumstances we might have waited through the winter nursing our strength healing our wounds biding our time until the next spring we might even have paused to crown aurelius properly but the thought of suffering the saecsen horde even one more season on british soil rankled with aurelius let them crown me later aurelius said if there is anything left to crown besides as uther pointed out it would only give hengist time to amass more men for certainly more ships would come across the narrow sea with the spring floods also there was no telling how long the lords of lloegres would remain loyal they might forget their promises in the long winter months ahead best to strike now and settle the matter once and for all that would have been my counsel in any case hengist had already grown stronger through the long summer he had been joined by his brother horsa with six more shipfuls of warriors they had encamped themselves along the eastern shores called the saecsen shore even by the romans who had built fortresses to keep the warships from raiding the coast now the saecsens owned these fortresses and the land around them lands they had been given by vortigern and other lands and strongholds they had not been given we marched to the east to the saecsen shore to the very doors of the fortresses themselves if need be for we were determined to carry the fight to hengist come what may we need not have worried whether the barbarian would meet us they were eager for blood indeed it had been a thirsty summer for them aurelius raised his standard the imperial eagle and pitched his tent beneath it on a hill overlooking a ford on the river nene somewhere across the river well hidden hengists war host was waiting this will suit our purpose declared aurelius the eagle will not fly from this hill until all the saecsens are driven into the sea with that he plunged his sword into the turf in front of his tent and he went in to rest for men who had existed on a steady diet of war all summer there was a surprising air of excitement in the camp men talked earnestly to one another they laughed readily and loudly they went briskly and happily about their tasks in a mood of high anticipation the reason for this i came to understand was partly that they trusted uther to lead them wisely he had shown himself an inspired leader a natural battlechief quick decisive yet cool in the heat of the clash a consummate horseman and skilled with spear and sword in short more than a match for any who drew blade against him but part of the reason for the high spirits was that at last we were meeting the real enemy tomorrow we would fight saecsens not subdue an ally there would be a true foe arrayed on the field against us not a wouldbe friend and this thought lifted the spirits of the warriors as i was going to my tent uther stopped me on his way to meet with his battlechiefs lord emrys he said the light taunt always in his voice a word yes it would be well to have a song tonight i am thinking the war host would fight the better tomorrow for a song to set the fire in their hearts the men appeared in excellent fettle to me and in any event there were two or three other harpers in the camp for some of the other kings travelled with their bards and these often sang for the men all the same i replied it is a good idea i will ask one of the harpers for you which would you like you myrddin he used the cymric form of my name something he rarely did please why uther i had caught something in his tone i had never heard from him before the men would feel better he said his eyes sliding from mine the men i said and was silent he could endure only so much silence so at last he burst out as if the words had been trapped inside him oh very well it is not for the men only no i would feel better for it he smacked his fist angrily against his thigh as if the words had cost him dearly but he looked at me with something like pain in his eyes or fear please merlin i will do it uther but you must tell me why he stepped close and spoke low well there is no reason you should not know he began and halted searching for words my scouts have returned from across the river and if their count is accurate and i trust with my life that it is we will face an enemy war host larger than any other since fighting began in this island that is not saying very much how large were we five times our own number we still would not match them man for man he spat the words now you know so hengist had been busy all summer and his efforts had born fruit but the men are not to know is that it they will learn it soon enough tell them uther you cannot let them discover it on the field tomorrow would it serve a purpose do you think to have them worry with it through the night he walked off without another word and i went on to my tent and bade pelleas string and tune my harp so that i could sing as uther requested i rested and then after supper when the war host had gathered round the huge firering uther had ordered to be made readied myself it was in my mind that there were many people very many if not most now alive who had never heard a true bard sing certainly the young warriors of our war host had never heard it saddened me to think that more than a few would go to their graves tomorrow never having known nor felt the power of the perfected word in song therefore i was determined to show them i stripped and washed myself and then dressed in my finest clothes i owned a belt made of spiral discs of silver which had been given to me by one of aurelius lords this pelleas polished until it shone and i tied it around my waist i scraped my hair back and bound it with leather i donned my fine cloak of midnight blue and pelleas arranged the folds precisely and fastened them at my shoulder with taliesins great stagshead brooch which charis had given me i took up the harp and stepped out into the night to sing for the massed war bands of the island of the mighty the stars shone like bright spearpoints to the lowrising moons silver shield and i sang straight and tall before them i sang i was a dancing flame against a wall of fire i was a wild tempest in their midst i was a voice falling like bright lightning from an uncertain sky i was a shout of triumph at the gates of death i sang courage in the heart and strength in the arm i sang bravery valour and gallantry i sang honour i sang the power of holy jesu to save their living souls from eternal night and my song became a high and holy prayer awe descended over the warriors as the song came shining from my lips i saw their faces bright and lifted up i saw them changed from mortal men to warrior gods who would gladly die to defend their brothers and their homes i saw a great and terrible spirit descend over the camp deadly clota spirit of justice in battle the dark flame of destiny cupped in her hand here it begins i thought here is where the winning of britain begins now this night five uther awakened the camp early we broke fast and pulled on our battledress in the dark and then moved into position now we sat on horseback on the crest of the hill above the ford awaiting the sunrise across the sleepy nene the saecsen war host assembled ten thousand strong moving inexorably down the opposite slopes like the shadow of a mighty cloud on a sunny day but it was no shadow darkening the land great light there were too many of them hengist had indeed grown strong he must have been building his forces throughout the long summer swelling his war host with saecsens from home and not saecsens only there were angles jutes frisians picti of course and irish scotti as well all had answered hengists summons to the busting in contrast our own troops appeared to have dwindled away since the night before when they had seemed as numerous as the starry host itself uthers scouts had told the truth they were five to our one lieu and zeus swore uther when he saw them where can they have come from never mind i told him it is where they are going that matters well said merlin answered aurelius today we send them to meet their illfamed woden and let them explain to him why they were bested by so few britons aurelius and uther then fell to discussing the battle plan for a moment but as everything was in readiness and all had been said before there was little more to do uther saluted his brother and moved off to take his place at the head of his troops tray to your lord jesu merlin i am certain he will hear you and grant us the victory today uther called after him this was the first interest in jesu that uther had ever exhibited if interest it was i answered him my lord hears your voice uther and stands ready to aid all who call upon him even now so be it came the reply uther snapped the reins and the horse trotted off the britons were to advance slowly to the river and wait for the enemy to come across we did not care to fight with our backs to the water although taking the enemy midway in the stream might offer a slight advantage if we could keep the battle line stretched out the danger in this was that once through the line the barbarian could swarm around our flanks and gain the high ground behind us to keep that from happening uther determined to hold a third of the war host back to reinforce the flanks if the saecsens began to overwhelm them aurelius would lead this rear guard and i as was my custom would ride beside him pelleas rode beside me stalwart and grim together we had determined to protect the high king come what may aurelius commanded the remnant of hoels men who had not returned to their lord with us was gorlas who next to tewdrig possessed the largest mounted warband at uthers command the foremost line started forward horses and men together at the last moment when the two armies closed on one another the horsemen would whip their mounts to speed meeting the first wave of foemen with the lightning of steel and the thunder of pounding hooves our warriors started down the long slope as expected the enemy started forward as well some even reached the riverbank and leapt into the water but hengist had foreseen the folly of this type of attack and corrected it before committing himself to an indefensible position the saecsen line halted on their own side of the river and waited raising a great cry of challenge to us i could hear their taunts from where i sat aurelius jerked the reins back and forth causing his horse to toss its head and snort where did they learn that he wondered aloud then looked at me what will uther do now we did not have to wait long for the answer for speeding towards us came a messenger who reined up with a sharp salute lord uther asks that you join him on the field at once the excitement in his voice made it quiver very well replied aurelius anything else hold the centre said the messenger repeating his commanders words hold the centre that is all the messenger nodded once wheeled his horse and sped back to join his commander aurelius signalled gorlas to follow and we started down the hill to the river at first we did not see what our battlechief intended perhaps hengist would not guess either but as we came up behind uther the whole front rank all horsemen swung out and rode quickly upstream leaving the footmen behind we moved in to fill the gap uther left and to wait hengist greeted this change in the battle array with long blasts on the great saecsen war horns those bloodchilling harbingers of doom the din along the riverbank was deafening the picti danced their defiance and struck out at easy targets with their evil arrows jutes and frisians banged their spears against their hidecovered shields scotti naked hair limed and pulled into spiked crowns their bodies stained with woad wailed their airsplitting battlesongs all the while saecsen berserkers howled and slapped each other until their flesh was red and insensitive to pain everywhere i looked i saw wild gyrating barbarians screaming and gnashing their teeth dashing into the water now and again taunting always taunting some few among the high kings warriors had never seen saecsens before and were as unprepared for the unholy sight as for the horrendous sound beating in their brains this display is calculated to unnerve those who must face it and it accomplishes its aim admirably if not for the steadying influence of the battleseasoned in our ranks i fear many would have broken and run long before the first blow was struck as it was we waited growing impatient and fearful it is never good to keep men waiting to go into battle doubt gnaws holes in even the strongest resolve and courage leaks away but there was no help for it uther needed time to take up his new position so we waited uthers force had disappeared into the brush at the rivers edge to the north this manoeuvre had not gone unnoticed by hengist who had moved a portion of his host upriver to meet them there we stood face to face with the enemy neither one of us wanting to cross the stream and thereby give the other an advantage it occurred to me to wonder how uther would cross the water since there was as far as i knew only the one fording place along this section of the river i leaned close to aurelius but before i had time to put words to this misgiving there came a cry from the opposite shore here they come cried aurelius god in heaven help us hengist having time to assess his position had decided that uthers absence more than made up for the disadvantage of fighting with his back to the water and had signalled the attack though with the hideous din how any of them could have heard the signal i will never know they came in a swarm chaos in motion the sight of the churning mass rolling towards us caused the front rank to draw back involuntarily steady called aurelius to his chieftains his command was repeated along the line the first enemy reached the shallows to be met by the surge of our own troops so determined was the foremost rank that the saecsen should not come ashore that they halted the enemy rush and forced it back upon itself the enemy screamed in rage from the first blow the battle was hot so much pentup fury nursed through the long summer kindled it to white heat instantly men stood in water to their thighs and hewed at one another with axe and sword the world was filled with the shattering sound of steel on steel the nene swirled around the combatants its sluggish greysilted waters blushing crimson only determination kept our smaller force from being overwhelmed outright that and the horses which the barbarians feared and with good reason since a good horse is as much a warrior on the field as his rider and with fearsome weapons of its own nevertheless little by little the superior numbers of the foe began to tell once the first wind of battle passed and the combatants settled into fighting rhythm hengist succeeded in pushing out around our flanks and aurelius was forced to steal men from the centre to keep the enemy from closing behind and surrounding us entirely uther must join us soon or come to bury us the high king said grimly drawing his sword from its sheath we cannot hold the centre much longer without the aid of his horsemen my sword was already in my hand i lofted it saying my king the day is ours let us go and wrest it from that heathen prince and teach him the sting of british wrath aurelius smiled i believe you mean it merlin only a fool jests on a field of battle then let us begin the lesson replied aurelius spurring his mount into the fray as i say the centre had been thinned and was in danger of caving in under the barbarian onslaught so that is where aurelius struck first heedless of his own safety uther would have been furious with him for uther had taken to protecting his brother striving to keep aurelius out of all but the most necessary conflict saying i have fought too many battles to make him high king for him to get himself killed now you see aurelius had no sense of danger he could not weigh one risk against another andthis caused him to do things in battle which counted as courageous in certain situations became foolhardy in others uther knew this about his brother and protected him from it as much as he could but uther was not there and aurelius saw the need and instinctively went to it throwing himself into the breach i have never seen a man so gloriously innocent in battle it was a joy to watch him fight and a terror a terror for it fell to me to protect him and this was no easy task aurelius risked enough for two men and i had my hands full just trying to keep up with him i did not fear for myself that never occurred to me i did fear for aurelius however because as uther had suggested we had endured hardship enough to make aurelius high king and i was not about to have him throw it all away in a foolish act no matter how glorious so we fought side by side my king and i we were like men joined shoulder to shoulder at birth matching bladestroke for bladestroke the enemy fell before us and our own warriors seeing their king wading into the thick of the fight drew courage from the sight and redoubled their efforts even so we could not help giving ground to the barbarian with every push the enemy gained and we lost we were the shore and they were the storm wave battering against us dragging us grain by grain and stone by stone into the foaming maelstrom i felt each successive blast in my bones and i waited for the shock of the fight to send me into the curiously distorted frenzy that had become familiar to me in battle but it did not happen it came to me that i had not entered into this heightened state this battle awen since goddeu i had taken no great part in the battles for aurelius kingship in truth i had not unsheathed my blade until this day there had been no need i needed it now however and now i fought as any other warrior and i found myself wishing for my old sword against which all other blades shattered as if made of glass the great sword of avallach which charis had given me years ago what had happened to it had it like so much else been lost at goddeu fool i had no time to dwell on these things keeping myself and aurelius alive occupied my mind and skill all the more since the high king would take no thought for himself we were now pushed far back from the river it was either give ground or allow hengist to surround us and each blow of the enemy drove us further back the fight had been carried away from the nene although angle jute pict and irish still swarmed across incredibly the main body of hengists host still remained on the other side we would soon be crushed by the weight of their numbers alone where was uther great light i prayed with every breath if you mean to save us today let it be now we fought grimly hacking at the foe before us not a man among us could swing his blade without wounding an enemy yet we were losing ground quickly now as more and more of the barbarians pushed across the river one band and then another and another and still more succeeded in getting round our flanks we were now almost surrounded and were being forced into a circle the death circle warriors call it for once adopted there is only one outcome of this manoeuvre where was uther the saecsen horde seeing us apparently deserted by cmallies screamed their blood lust to their loathsome gods calling on woden and tiw and thunor to maim and slay and destroy eager to make british blood the sacrifice they leapt slavering to the fight i slashed at every bit of exposed barbarian flesh that offered itself i worked as the harvester jabours before the lowering storm i reaped a vast harvest but took no pleasure in my mowing men fell beneath my streaming blade or beneath my mounts brainspattered hooves i saw men contemplating severed limbs i saw brave warriors weeping into their deathwounds i saw faces sunbronzed and fair with eyes the colour of winter ice once whole and handsome now twisted in unreasoning agony or broken and bloody in death but no matter how many i slew more crowded in clutching thrusting grappling hewing with notched and ragged blades one great chieftain loosed an earsplitting scream and leaped onto the neck of my horse he clung there with one arm flailing at me with his war axe i flung myself backward in the saddle his bloodstained blade sliced the air where my head had been and i thrust with the point of my sword catching him just under the line of his ribs he roared and dropped his axe then grabbed the sword with his hands and held it as he fell seeking to pull me from the saddle with him my sword was dragged down by his weight and one of his comrades crazy for the kill lofted his axe to cleave my skull i saw the blade hover in the air then the wrist spouted blood and the axe spun awkwardly away pelleas ever alert to my danger had reached me and it was not the first time his sword had delivered me stay with the king i shouted jerking my sword free at last pelleas turned and darted after aurelius who was charging on ahead bodies toppling behind him the britons strove mightily against the foe never were men more courageous in going to their doom but there was nothing we could do though we slew one four more arose to take the place of the one though we slew a thousand five thousand more remained meanwhile our brave companions were falling beneath the relentless slaughter we were completely surrounded now aurelius sounded the call to circle the troops this is the beginning of the end for any army knowing this hating it we rallied i do not know where the strength came from but with prayers and curses and broken weapons in our hands we forced the screaming berserkers back once more this angered hengist who committed the rest of his vast war host against us all save his house carles his own personal bodyguard made up of the strongest most formidable of all the saecsen warriors aside from these every last warrior was pressed into the fight he intended destroying us utterly across the river they came streaming towards us thenfaces tight with the ecstasy of hatred we were slowly being crushed by the steady advance of the enemy the heads of our countrymen now adorned the long spears of the foemen smoke from burning corpses began to drift into the air so hengist reckoned that he had won already but he reckoned falsely for the battle was not over yet aurelius saw it first uther he cried uther has taken hengist how he saw this busy as we both were i cannot say but i lifted my eyes and scanned the hillside opposite the tide of battle had carried us back up the hill where we had begun and i saw a force of mounted men surrounding hengists horsetail standard and the fight there seemed over the rest of uthers force was galloping across the river to cut off the enemy rushing to their leaders aid i do not know when hengist realized his mistake but it must have struck him like a cold blade between the ribs when he turned defenceless to see uther swooping down on him from behind for our part we sensed the sudden shift in the battle just as the enemy was about to overwhelm us we braced for the final thrust and then inexplicably fell forward as the enemy melted away just like that all at once the weight of the battle fell from us like a wall crumbling inward upon itself after leaning outward for so long aurelius wasted not a moment he wheeled his horse snatching up the royal standard and waving the proud eagle above his head he mounted the attack great light we are saved aurelius retaliated quickly and without mercy instantly the remaining horsemen gathered to him and they rode down the enemy from behind there is no honour in slaughtering a fleeing foe only grim expedience it had to be done caught between the two forces the barbarians found themselves waistdeep in the nene unable to advance or fall back confusion seized them and shook them like a dog shaking a rat chaos closed its fist round them and they gave in to it hengist was securely held those of his bodyguard still alive were bound as he was and disarmed it is a curious thing with the barbarian but capture a war leader and the fight quickly goes out of them let him be killed and they will go on fighting for the honour of accompanying their lord into valhalla let their battlechief fall prisoner and they become confounded and dismayed and are easily overcome it is as if theirs is a single mind a single will that of their leader and without him they fall instantly into panic and despair therefore despite superior numbers despite the awful fact that our main force was well and truly beaten once uther held the blade to hengists throat the briton had prevailed the battle continued only in isolated enclaves mostly pict and irish whose chieftains still lived to lead them these were quickly put down would that the saecsen had behaved that way for now uther was left with the odious task of dealing with the prisoners of course aurelius had not intended that there should be any prisoners but that the fight should have been fought to the death had the saecsen won it would have been though a warrior might kill in the heat of battle slaying time and again without hesitation among civilized men there are not many who can slaughter defenceless human creatures as they stand mute and passive before him i say this because when the fighting was done there remained several thousand saecsen still alive and it was simply not possible to run the spear through them all if we had we should have been worse barbarians than those we fought well i asked uther he was still in the saddle his bloody sword across his thigh what will you do aurelius had sent me ahead to uther while he saw the smaller fights ended and organized aid for our wounded uther scowled darkly as if it were somehow my fault that this decision had fallen to him he sought to put off the question by asking what says aurelius the high king says you are war leader it is your decision he groaned uther was no murderer what do you say exalted ambrosius i agree with aurelius you must decide and quickly if you will not lose the trust and respect of your men i know that but what am i to do if i kill the prisoners i am a butcher and i lose respect let them live and i am softhearted and i lose even more i sympathized in war there is no easy course tell me something i do not already know his words were harsh but his eyes pleaded i will tell you what i would do if it were my decision tell me then o wisdom incarnate what would you do i would do the only thing i could do and still call myself a human being which is let them go i told him there is no other choice every one i release today will come back and he will father sons that will come back every life i spare today will be a life spent later the life of a countryman perhaps i allowed that is the way of it have you nothing else to say mighty prophet he mocked his face twisted with distaste i say only what is uther it is for you to decide kill them all and you may save a future life and prove us more detestable in the sight of god than these poor wretches who do not know him but if you let them go you will prove the true nobility of the british spirit you will truly exalt yourself far above those you have defeated he saw this but he did not like it i could obtain blood oaths and hostages that can be done but i advise against it these men are not to be trusted to keep an oath made to one they despise i have to do something very well i relented but choose the youngest of them for your hostages and i will not spare hengist uther think he is beaten and disgraced if you kill him he will become a leader whose life must be avenged let him go hengist will trouble us no more jesu help me my own heart was not in it perhaps i might have made uther believe if i had believed myself and i say he will not go free from this battle uther had made up his mind hengist was brought forward tightly bound his broad face snarling in silent defiance those of his bodyguard who still lived were brought forth too and made to stand behind him the rest of the saecsen host disarmed the fight gone completely out of them stood a little way away up on the hillside heads lowered in defeat watching in sullen silence gorlas hot from the fight galloped in quickly and threw himself from his horse he ran up and before anyone could stop him seized hengist by the arms and spat in his face the saecsen leader regarded gorlas impassively spittle glistening on his cheeks the prisoners murmured ominously it was a stupid thing to do i wanted to shake gorlas by the shoulders and make him see what he had done stay gorlas the voice was aurelius who now joined us he strode slowly towards the captives stopped and stood regarding hengist casually after a moment he turned and spoke to uther well duke of britain what is it to be death for hengist and his chieftains uther replied evenly the rest will go free he shot a quick glance at me they will be escorted to the coast and put on ships never to return to this land again under pain of death very well said aurelius so be it gorlas hanging back now thrust himself forward if hengist is to be killed lord aurelius let it be by my hand aurelius looked at him shrewdly why lord gorlas should you be his executioner it is a matter of honour between us lord gorlas confessed my brother was murdered in the massacre of the knives when vortigern was king i have made an oath that if ever i were to meet hengist i would kill him i had hoped to meet him in battle aurelius considered this he glanced at uther i have no objections someone must do the deed muttered uther the high king turned to me what say you wise counsellor the taking of life in revenge is hateful to me but if his life is forfeit for the wrong he has done let him be killed quickly and quietly but alone and away from here a strange light glinted in gorlas eyes he threw back his head and laughed hideously kill him quietly he hooted we have just slaughtered ten thousand of these motherless bastards here is the chief bastard himself if any deserve to die he does we killed today because we had no choice i spat we killed to save ourselves and our people but now we have a choice and i tell you that killing for revenge is murder and has no place among civilized men my lord aurelius shouted gorlas angry now let hengist be killed here and now before all his people i would have them see and remember how we punish treachery many others agreed with gorlas and loudly so aurelius gave his assent and gorlas wasted no time about it he picked up a long spear and shoved it into the saecsens belly hengist groaned but did not fall gorlas withdrew the spear and stabbed hengist with it again blood gushed out onto the ground and the barbarian leader crashed to his knees doubled over his wound still he did not cry out gorlas stepped quickly to his victims side drew his sword raised it and struck off hengists head the body pitched forward into the dust gorlas raised his grisly trophy in triumph then seized by the frenzy of his vengeance gorlas turned and fell on the corpse chopping and chopping with his sword he hacked the body into pieces and when he was finished scattered the pieces in the dust all the while the men the men holy father forgive us all cheered him six when the cheering was over an awful silence descended upon the battlefield a silence instantly shattered by a heartrending shriek a youth thrust himself forward from the mass of captives tall thin he had not yet attained his manly growth his fair hair hung in long braids from his temples and beneath the dirt his face now distorted in grief bore the same proud aspect as his father there was no question whose offspring it was the boy threw himself upon the severed head of his father and hugged it to his breast gorlas breathless and sweating from his exertion whirled on the youth and raised his sword to strike gorlas hold uther swung down from the saddle and strode to where they were it is done put your sword away not while the wolfs whelp lives said gorlas thickly let me kill him and make an end do we kill children now gorlas look at him he is only a boy the youth had not so much as glanced at the danger looming over him he continued to wail rocking back and forth piteously cradling the bloody head hi his arms lieu blind me he is hengists son kill him now or he returns to lead another murdering wolf pack when he is grown there has been enough killing for one day replied uther put your sword away gorlas i tell you there is no shame in it muttering dark oaths gorlas sheathed the blade and contented himself with a sharp kick at the boy before him then he stomped off to rejoin his war band uther raised the boy to his feet where he stood sullenly his dirty face streaked with his tears what is your name boy uther asked the youth understood him well enough and answered octa i give you the gift of your life octa if you or your people ever return here again i will take back my gift do you understand the boy said nothing uther took the youths naked arm in his glove turned him and pushed him gently back to his place among the other captives aurelius who had kept himself apart now came forth and placing his hands on his brothers shoulders kissed him and embraced him hail uther duke of britain the victory is yours to you belongs the triumph and the spoil there was little enough spoil and much of it of british origin most of what we collected from the captives and their camp had been stolen earlier in the summer by the saecsens but there were some handsome armbands and bracelets of red gold and jewelled knives all of which uther divided among his battlechiefs keeping nothing for himself when the wounded had been tended and the dead buried or in the case of the enemy heaped onto impromptu pyres and set alight the saecsen captives were escorted to the coast back across fields they had destroyed back through settlements they had decimated on their way to the place of battle at each place the survivors came out to rail against them pelting them with stones and dirt many wanted blood for the blood the saecsens had spilled wives for the husbands they had lost husbands for their dead women and children but uther would not be swayed he did not allow any harm to come to the enemy under his care though his soul writhed within him in this he showed the grace of an angel in truth merlin he told me when it was finished if i had seen what they had done i would never have let a single saecsen escape i would have made them face the justice of those they had wronged and there would not be a barbarian drawing breath in all this land tonight i can tell you he paused and dashed down the rest of his wine and then slammed the cup down on the board it is over and that is something at least aurelius sympathized showing mercy to an enemy is battles most difficult charge but you have acquitted yourself well uther for your deed this day you have covered yourself in honour i drink to you brother hail uther merciful conqueror it was the night of the day following the battle and uther was exhausted to the point of collapse he swayed on his feet wine and fatigue vying to claim him his smile thin and uncertain go to bed uther i said holding out a cloak to him come i will take you to your tent he allowed himself to be led to his tent where he fell face first onto his pallet his steward a westcountry youth named ulfin was there to help him but i loosened his boots and belt and covered him with the cloak douse the light i told ulfin your lord will not need it tonight i left uther asleep in the dark and returned to aurelius tent he was yawning while his steward unbuckled his leather breastplate well he said it looks as if i will be high king after all you will my lord aurelie there is no avoiding it the steward removed the armour and aurelius scratched himself a last drink merlin he asked gesturing towards the pitcher on the board it is late and i am tired another night we will drink together still i will pour one for you if you like no he shook his head and the dark curls bobbed another night it is he looked at me pensively merlin tell me did i do right to let them go was it the best thing you did right my lord was it the best thing no aurelius i fear it was not gorlas was right then they will come back oh yes they will come back trust in it i replied adding but they will return in any case and nothing you can do will prevent that but if i had ordered them put to the sword do not let men like gorlas deceive you aurelius and do not deceive yourself the barbarians were beaten yesterday but not defeated killing the captives would have changed nothing save burdening your soul with everlasting shame he dragged a hand through his hair am i to live with a sword in my hand all my days yes i told him gently you will rule with the sword as long as you live my king for the man has not been born who will hold this land in peace aurelius considered this and true to the spirit in him did not shrink from it well he said slowly will i see him i told him the truth no aurelius you will not this was harsh to him so i sought to soften it but he will know you aurelius and he will revere you and win great honour in your name aurelius smiled and yawned again that as uther says is something at least i went to my tent through the sleeping camp how many fewer we were tonight the men lying on the ground around lowburning campfires might have been dead so soundly did they sleep yes all the realm slept soundly this night thanks to these brave warriors and their comrades who now slept under the gravemounds in my tent i fell on my knees to pray saying my lord jesu great giver redeemer and friend king of heaven beginning and end hear my lament three times three hundred warriors bright was their hope fierce their grip ealife three times three hundred we were but no more for death has claimed the heros portion from the blood of good men three times three hundred light of life shining full and without wavering warm was their breath quick their eyes three times three hundred but no more for tonight our sword brothers lie in silent turfhalls cold and abandoned by their own who cannot follow where they go three times three hundred bold in action keen in battle steadfast companions when the fire of battle raged three times three hundred we were but no more for the raven croaks over the fields where grief has sown her seeds and watered them with womens tears merciful jesu great of might whose name is light and life be light and life to these your fallen servants as you delight in forgiveness forgive them do not count their sins rather consider this their virtue that when the call came to defend their homeland they took no thought for themselves but roused courage and went forth to do battle knowing death awaited them hear me lord jesu gather our friends to your hall seat them in your palace in paradise and you will not want for finer companions the next day the high king struck camp and rode for londinium where his father had been made king and where his own kingmaking would take place pelleas and i rode west to dyfed to find bishop dafyd i had it in mind that dafyd should officiate at aurelius accession if he was as hale as pelleas indicated and agreeable to the journey londinium had a bishop a priest named urbanus who from what i had heard in camp was a devout if slightly ambitious young man i had nothing against urbanus but dafyds attendance would i thought further strengthen aurelius bond with the kings of the west also i had not seen dafyd since my return from my long vigil in celyddon and this weighed heavily on my heart now that i had time to myself once more i desperately wanted to see him pelleas and i rode through a land that seemed to have passed from under the shadow of a preying bird everywhere men breathed more freely we were welcomed in settlements we met traders on the road gates and doors were opened all this and yet word of the saecsen defeat could not have travelled from the battlefield how did the people know i believe people living close to the land know these things instinctively they sense fluctuations in the fortunes of men as they sense minute changes in the weather they see a red sunglow at dusk and know it will rain on the morrow they taste the wind and know that frost will cover the ground when they wake they apprehend the subtle ripples that great events cause in the atmosphere of the spirit thus they knew without having to be told that some great good had come to them and they did not have to be afraid any more they knew and yet they were glad to have news of the battle from us this they would repeat to one another for many days until all toddling child and bentbacked crone alike could repeat it word for word just as it had come from my mouth we did not linger on the way but sped with all haste to llandaff which was what men had begun calling the place where dafyd had built his church a sturdy rectangular structure of timber on a high stone foundation surrounded by the smaller huts of the monks llandaff was a monastery like the others springing up like mushrooms all over the west country not a few of them owing directly to dafyds tireless work as we approached the tiny settlement we could see the good brothers going about their chores the younger men wore homespun robes of undyed wool their elders garments were light brown the women among them for many of the monks were married wore the same simple garb or more traditional clothing all were busy about some task or other toting firewood building thatching tending the fields feeding pigs teaching the children of the nearby settlements and holdings and all with the same jovial zeal the place fairly hummed with earnest contentment we stopped to take this in then dismounted and entered the compound on foot i was greeted courteously and addressed as a king owing to my tore how may we help you lord the priest asked taking us in with frank appraisal i am a friend of the bishop here i wish to see him the monk smiled pleasantly of course as you are his friend you will understand that will be difficult our bishop is very old and he is resting at this time of day as is his custom he spread his hands as if to imply that the matter was beyond his influence as no doubt it was and then there is his sermon thank you i told him i would not think of disturbing him and yet i know he will wish to see me two more monks had come to greet us and stood looking on whispering to one another behind their hands then wait if you will replied the monk and i will see to it that your request receives due consideration i thanked him again and asked whether there was a superior i might speak to while i waited that would be brother gwythelyn i was thinking of salach salach but he searched my face questioningly our dear brother salach died years ago i felt the pang of sorrow i usually feel upon receiving such news in truth i had forgotten how old he must be gwythelyn then tell him that myrddin ap taliesin is here at the sound of my name the two looking on murmured in surprise myrddin is here here they gaped at me and then dashed away to tell the others lord myrddin said the monk inclining his head towards me allow me to lead you to brother gwythelyn gwythelyn was the image of his uncle maelwys as happens in dynasties of strong blood lines the family resemblance was correspondingly strong i hesitated as he turned from the manuscript on his table to greet me is something wrong he asked no nothing it is just that you remind me of someone else my grandfather no doubt you knew pendaran gleddyvrudd he appraised me closely may i know your name the monk who had led us to gwythelyns cell had in his excitement forgotten to give my name yes i knew red sword well i am myrddin ap taliesin i said simply gwythelyns eyes grew round forgive me myrddin he said taking my hands and squeezing them in his own they were hands made to hold a sword and contrary to my expectation they were not soft long days of rough labour had made them strong and hard forgive me i should have known you how so we have never met no but from the day of my birth i have heard about you until this moment i confess i thought i should know you as i knew myself and i confess that when you turned round just now i thought i was seeing maelwys in the flesh once more he smiled enjoying the compliment if i can become half the man he was i will die content his smile broadened but myrddin ap taliesin ap elphin ap gwyddno garanhir you see we all know your illustrious lineage i had always hoped to meet you one day and now you are here it is true you are a marvel to behold but tell me what great event brings you to llandaff will you stay we have room for you your welcome is most heartening gwythelyn worthy of your generous uncle i can stay but a short while a day or two and then i must go on to londinium i went on to tell him about the new high king who would be crowned very soon my brother he interrupted tewdrig is he he is well and will return as soon as the high king has taken the throne and this is why i have come i would like bishop dafyd to officiate gwythelyn considered this and then replied slowly it is true that dafyd has not stepped a dozen paces outside llandaff in as many years but well we will ask him and see what he says i would not disturb his rest i am content to wait until he has awakened very well he is accustomed to taking refreshment after his sleep we will go to him then i know he will wish to see you until then perhaps you would not refuse refreshment yourself we did not have long to wait for no sooner had pelleas and i finished eating than a young man came saying bishop is waking brother gwythelyn i thought you would like to know he addressed his superior but his eyes never left me thank you natyn we will come along at once dafyds room was a cleanswept cubicle bare of all furniture save his bed and one chair i recognized the chair it had once sat in pendarans hall likely maelwys had given it to him there was a tiny window covered with an oiled skin through which light poured like honey thick and golden his bed was a straw pallet on a raised wooden frame and covered with fleeces on this bed sat a man who appeared to have been carved from fine alabaster his white hair ablaze in the light surrounded his head like a nimbus a halo of bright flame on his face so calm and serene lingered still the beauty of his dreams his dark eyes radiated peace to his simple world it was dafyd much changed much aged yet there was no mistaking him he was leaner to be sure but his flesh was firm and his teeth were good despite his advanced age which must have been well past ninety i realized with a shock he looked robust and vital a man in whom the fires of life burned with energy and passion and zeal in short he appeared a man in whom holiness had nearly completed its transforming work as we entered the cell his gaze shifted and he half rose to receive us then he saw me he stopped his mouth opened to speak but his tongue gave no utterance emotions played across his features like cloudshadows chasing over the slopes of a hill tears welled up in his eyes and in mine as well i went to him raised him and clasped him to my breast myrddin myrddin he murmured at last speaking my name as he would one of his holy texts myrddin my soul you are alive to see you after all these years alive and well oh but you have not altered a whit you are the same as my memory of you look at you now his hands patted my shoulders and arms as if he would be reassured that i was indeed flesh and bone before him oh myrddin to see you is joy itself sit can you stay are you hungry gwythelyn this is myrddin of whom i have often spoken he is here he has returned gwythelyn smiled so he has i will leave you to speak to one another until dinner he closed the door silently and left us to our reunion dafyd i wanted to come sooner so many times i thought of you and wanted to come to you shh it is nothing we are together at last my prayer is answered ever i have prayed for you myrddin that i might see you again before i die and now you are here god is good you look well dafyd i had not hoped to see me alive oh aye i am quite alive much to the chagrin of the younger monks i am something of a terror to them he winked slyly at me they believe god keeps me alive just to torment them and they may be right latin a torment surely not he nodded innocently the mother tongue language of scholars a torment but you know what students are they complain incessantly better a heart broken in love than a head broken on latin they say so i tell them fill your heads with latin and let god fill your hearts with love then neither one can be broken was it ever any different no perhaps not he sighed at least you never gave me such trouble i gave you more i laughed dafyd laughed too you did you are right you did oh when i think of the hours we spent tangled in it he fell silent nodding to himself remembering in a moment he shook himself as if waking from a dream ah well we were young then eh myrddin he cupped a hand to my face in a fatherly gesture but you my goldeneyed wonder you are young still look at you a young mans face and frame not a grey hair on your head you are the flower of your race myrddin praise god my son for your long life he has blessed you among men what good is a blessing i cannot share i asked seriously i would share what i have with you dafyd you are far more deserving than i have i not been blessed also i am well content in years myrddin never fear i am satisfied do not be sorry for me and do not denigrate the gift you have been given the lord high god has made you as you are for a purpose be thankful you are knit with such strong stuff i will try you do that he turned and indicated his chair now sit you down and tell me all that has passed with you since last we met i laughed that will take as many years as we have been parted then you had better begin at once he settled himself on the edge of his bed and folded his hands in his lap so i began to tell him about ganiedas death and all that followed from it the hole in my life that hideous waste the years of loss and lament and the square of honied light slipped lightly across the floor and up the opposite wall as i spoke i told him about vortigern much of which he knew already and about aurelius the new high king and uther his brother the war leader he drank in every word like a child ustening to a terrible fascinating story and no doubt he would have gone on sitting in awed attention on the edge of his bed had not gwythelyn come and rapped gently on the door to break dafyds reverie and rouse us to our supper dinner is being laid he informed us i have had a special table set up for you i will hear more later dafyd said rising slowly they will be waiting for me to bless the meal come let us go and eat although my appetite is not what it was tonight i am hungry see just beholding you once more quickens me it cheers me to hear you say that i replied taking his arm but he did not need my assistance for where i expected bone and sagging flesh there was firm muscle beneath my grip he did not shuffle as old men do but walked upright and with vigour he ate with vigour too enjoying his food remarking once and again that my coming was a balm to him clearly he enjoyed himself and enjoyed the attention i was getting you cannot blame them for staring myrddin they have never seen one of the fair folk myrddin but they have all heard of you everyone has heard of the great emrys and son you are the equal of your legend you have the look of greatness on you gwythelyn served us with his own hand so that he could be near to hear what we said i suppose pelleas sat with us but spoke not a word the whole time not wishing to intrude on our conversation when the meal was finished dafyd rose and taking the holy text one of the brothers handed him began to read out the passage the monks still sitting at the board listened with bowed heads praise the lord praise the lord from the high places praise him in the halls of light praise him all his angels praise him all you hosts of heaven praise him sun and moon praise him all you shining stars praise him you in the sky realms and you waters above the skies let them all praise the name of the lord for he spoke forthrightly and they were created he established them in place for ever and ever he uttered a decree that will never pass away praise the lord from the earth you dragons and all sea deeps lightning and hail snow and clouds stormy winds that do his bidding you great mountains and all fair hills fruit trees and cedars wild beasts and all cattle creeping things and flying birds kings of the earth and all nations you chieftains and all rulers on earth young men and maidens old men and children let them all praise the name of the lord for his name alone is exalted his splendour is above the earth and the heavens he has raised up for his people a king the praise of all his saints dafyd paused and turning the pages read again but the father said to his servants hurry bring forth the best robe and put it on him and put a ring on his finger and shoes on his feet and bring the fattened calf and kill it and let us eat and celebrate here he stopped and closed the book reverently gazing at me he finished the text for this my son was dead and now is alive again he was lost and now is found so they began to celebrate he raised the holy book to his lips and kissed it saying may god bless the reading of his word may god bless the hearing of his word among us the monks answered i am happy tonight because my friend long absent from me has returned he turned and placed a hand on my shoulder my son my soul has returned great is my rejoicing great the blessing in my heart he lifted an admonishing hand to those before him tonight before you close your eyes to sleep i would have you contemplate the mystery of human love as a reflection of divine love he blessed them then and sent them to their rest the brothers trooped out of the hall and each wandered off by himself to find a lonely place to pray as was their custom bishop dafyd and i remained in the hall chairs had been placed before the hearth for us for the night had turned chill hot mulled wine in wooden cups was brought as we settled before the fire well myrddin what has brought you dafyd asked when we had sipped from our drinks need it be anything more than a wish to see my friend no it need not with ordinary men but you myrddin emrys are far from ordinary your life is not your own you know you serve the kingdom and its needs are yours he looked at me over his cup eyes shining like a mischievous childs in the firelight do you wonder that i say this to you i will tell you something else you will never rest until this realm is united and at peace that is a hard prophecy i told him for i foresaw the troubled years stretching out ahead of me he smiled well perhaps the lord jesu will bring his peace to this land with all speed he drank again and waited for me to speak i took a last draught and set the cup on the hearth you ask what has brought me two matters both urgent for the first i simply wanted to see you it is true that i serve the island of the mighty and my life is not my own jesu knows i wear that duty like a harness but as soon as i had a moment to myself i came straight here i did not say that for you to chide yourself it was on my heart that is all no doubt it was a word i needed to hear i assured him but it brings me to the second reason for my visit the high king yes the high king is he a worthy man he is and the more i know of him the more i feel that he is sent of god as you were dafyd leaned back in his chair the firelight playing over his features made him appear insubstantial as if he were made of some finer yet more ephemeral material a momentary being i realized he would not long remain in the world of men i must have been staring at him for he said the champion oh yes why do you look at me so hafgan always maintained as much the memory came in a rush hafgan standing beside this trembling boy and calling to the learned brotherhood to bear witness saying before you stands the one whose coming we have long awaited the champion who will lead the war host against the darkness ah hafgan dafyd was saying his name has not passed my lips in many years that man possessed a soul myrddin a very great soul indeed the discussions we had jesu bless him what a reunion it will be the good bishop made it sound as if he were merely going on a days journey to visit his friend perhaps that was how he saw it what do you know of the champion i asked gently what can you tell me what can i tell you about the champion he continued that he will be a man to save the britons that he will come when we most have need of him that his will be a rule of righteousness and justice he paused and eyed me sharply are you suggesting that hafgan was mistaken i sighed and shook my head i cannot say hafgan believed it could be he saw in me what he wanted to see or perhaps he saw through me to another myrddin dafyds voice was soft and comforting as a crooning mothers have you lost your way i pondered this the fire crackled in the hearth as the pine knots popped and scattered sparks at our feet had i lost my way was this the source of my confusion until just now i had never doubted no i answered at length i have not lost my way it is just that so many ways open before me that sometimes i hardly know which way to choose to decide for one is to decide against another i never imagined it would be this hard now you know dafyd said gently the higher a mans call and vision the more choices are given him this is our work in creation to decide and what we decide is woven into the thread of time and being for ever choose wisely then but you must choose great light help me i am blind without you well i have said enough dafyd said settling back once more you were telling me about the high king aurelius yes he is high king although he has yet to take the throne i do not know how vortigern received his kingship but in elder times the chieftain would be blessed by the clans druid and i thought you wish me to consecrate this king as i consecrated you dafyd saw the implications of this at once and the idea delighted him myrddin you are a farthinking man he said approvingly of course i will be your druid although you could do it yourself just as well when will he come here he is going to londinium i replied it is where his father was crowned there is a church in londinium and a bishop urbanus i know him well a zealous servant of our lord he will serve most admirably no doubt i said lamely he read my expression but as aurelius will require the continued support of the western kings it might help to bolster that support with wellplaced pride tewdrig would feel better if his own bishop consecrated this new king and not tewdrig only yes i see that and i agree very well we will go to him and do what we can to give him a proper kingmaking is aurelius a christian he is willing that is half the battle as jesu himself said he who is not against us is for us eh if aurelius is not against us we will go to him and i will enjoy the journey urbanus will not mind my coming he will take account of my years and yield this favour to me thank you dafyd he rose slowly and came to me he placed his hands on my head in my heart i have long carried you most beloved son but the time is soon coming when you must go your way alone be strong myrddin be the hope of our hope the people will look to you they will believe and follow you though i fear the church will not love you for it but remember the church is only men and men can become jealous of anothers favour do not hate them for it he took my hands and raised me from my chair kneel he said and let an old man give you his blessing i knelt before him on the hearth and dafyd bishop of llandaff renewed the blessing he had given me long ago seven londinium had changed much with the years never more than a wide space on the thamesis river a scattering of mud and wattle huts and cattle enclosures it was nevertheless chosen by the romans for their principal city for the simple fact that the river was deep enough to allow their troop ships to come inland yet shallow enough to cross without undue difficulty for generations londiniums greatest glory remained the enormous docks built by the roman engineers and maintained with greater or lesser zeal ever since though the troop ships eventually ceased the city remained the centre of imperial power in the island in time acquiring not only a fortress which was all of londinium in the early years but a governors residence a stadium baths temples markets warehouses public buildings of various types an arena and a theatre in addition to its massive docks in later years a stone wall was put up round the whole but by then the city was a sprawling brawling monstrosity of crowded streets and closebuilt houses inns and tradesmens shops the governors residence became a palace a forum was added and a basilica and the future of londinium was secure henceforth any briton wishing to impress mother rome had first to win londinium in one way or another in short londinium to the britons was rome certainly it was as close to rome as many a celtic citizen ever came and for this reason if for no other londinium despite the filth and noise and squalor basked in the golden sunset that was rome and remained ever glorious to londinium constantine had come as emperor of the west first high king of the britons therefore to londinium aurelius had come to receive the crown of his father identifying himself with his father and through constantine with rome this was wise as it was necessary there were still many men of position and influence who considered allegiance to and membership in the empire essential for the proper ruling of britain that raw circumstance had far outstripped this archaic requisite could never have occurred to these men they were cast of an older mould civilized refined urbane that rome itself had become little more than a provincial backwater its onceproud residences slums its noble colosseum a charnal house its stately senate a gathering place of jackals its imperial palace a brothel all this made not a whisker of a difference as i have said the men who believed this way were powerful men and any high king who would own the title along with the crown had to be recognized by the staunch sophisticates of londinium or for ever be considered a usurper or worse and thus be denied londiniums considerable resources aurelius understood this vortigern never had mores the pity for if vortigern had won londinium he might never have been forced to the awful exigency of embracing hengist and his horde but vortigern was proud he vainly supposed that he could rule without londiniums blessing true londinium considered itself above the petty affairs of britain or put another way the concerns of londinium were the only legitimate concerns of britain flawed as this outlook was vortigern ignored it to his peril and to the ultimate peril of britain fools drowning in their folly raving on about empire and pax romana while the tattered remnants of that empire crumbled around them and peace became a hollow word emptyheaded men playing at politics while the world rushed headlong to its ruin be that as it may aurelius had no intention of repeating vortigerns mistake he would proceed with the formalities he would woo the pridebound citizens of vainglorious londinium in return he would receive its blessing and then he could get on with the work of saving the realm sympathy held with vortigern but intelligence recognized aurelius so it was that dafyd gwythelyn pelleas and i along with a small escort of monks came to londinium our trip was speedy and uneventful which is to say we travelled unmolested through a countryside quickly forgetting terror in its need to gather in the harvest it was a beautiful harvest time sunwarmed days and crisp nights in the morning we awoke to steaming streams and heavy dew at night we sat before crackling fires with the scent of burning leaves in our nostrils dafyd continued in good health though it had been by gwythelyns estimation a good few years since the bishop had sat a horse dafyd gave no indication of discomfort he rode when we rode and rested when we rested and did not complain although i was careful not to overtax him he seemed wholly unaffected by the journey remarking often how he enjoyed viewing the wider landscape once more we sang we talked we discussed and debated and the distance between llandaff and londinium shrank by happy degrees it was nearing midday on a day that had begun overcast with grey clouds of mist that had burned off in time to a bright white haze londinium or caer lundein as some now called it lay squalid before us in its shallow bowl beside the snaking river a pall of turbid smoke hung grey and drab over the vast expanse and even from a distance we could smell the fetid reek of the place too many people too many competing desires my spirit recoiled within me there is a church here dafyd reminded me and many good christians where there is great darkness the need for the light is greater also remember well londinium had need of its church and bishop nevertheless we all took a last deep breath before riding on at the massive iron gate to the city we were challenged for no good reason it seemed to me the dolts manning the gate could see we were not saecsen marauders but it is a mark of the arrogance of the place that it deemed all men suspect who were not already within its walls in the end we were admitted and allowed to proceed about our business the streets were thronged with people and livestock apparently wandering at will through the city the din was horrific tradesmen hawked their wares in a most unbecoming manner cattle bawled dogs barked beggars chanted painted women offered themselves for our pleasure on every hand were men wrangling shouting fighting and contending in any of a thousand different ways in stonepaved streets befouled with garbage and dung if i lived in this place remarked pelleas loudly i should be deaf before winter if you were not dead first gwythelyn added grimly speaking my thoughts also the place was unspeakable but possessed of a perverse energy which did not fail to arouse londinium was a realm unto itself and i began to sense something of its deadly allure weak men would succumb without struggle to its charms and enchantments stronger men would be won by the grand and imposing prospect of power even wary souls might stumble and fall to their ruin not for lack of vigilance perhaps but for lack of fortitude the enemy possessed so many wiles and weapons here that all but the most powerful must eventually be overwhelmed in one way or another as yet i saw no evidence of the light dafyd proclaimed and wondered whether he was mistaken after all even though i know the light is ever found in the most unlikely places dafyd alone did not seem to mind the stink and noise he turned a beatific countenance on one and all passing with the peculiar grace of a saint moving through a shadowbound world that neither recognizes nor comprehends its true masters perhaps it was myself who did not recognize or comprehend i admit i have never loved cities living most of my life as it happens close to sun and wind rock and water leaf and branch earth and sky and sea and hill it was difficult for me to apprehend the subtle expressions of goodness that dafyd seemed to find or maybe i lacked the generosity of forgiveness that he possessed we rode directly to the governors palace an imposing edifice rising above the tallest rooftops of the city in columned splendour albeit a splendour now much faded there we hoped to find aurelius instead we found a mob if the confusion we had thus far encountered was set all on one side it would not equal the chaos that met us as we rode into the inner courtyard of the palace a redtiled square choked with angry men many were dressed in an archaic way affecting roman garb and appearance they were calling for the governor to come out into the courtyard to speak to them about some matter the nature of which we could not discern a balcony overlooked the courtyard and it was to this that the mob addressed itself but the balcony was empty and the door leading to it remained closed aurelius was nowhere to be seen of course nor any trace of his army what shall we do lord asked pelleas i believe there will be a riot here soon my lord i heard pelleas but i could make no answer my limbs stiffened as if with sudden and inexplicable cold the looming violence of the mob held me fast and their cries bound me fast i could not move or speak for a powerful awen had seized me the bawl of the mob rang in the enclosed courtyard and their voices became a single voice a great universal voice sounding a single word arthur arthur arthur i turned my eyes to the sky and saw an enormous purple cloud spreading over the city it seemed to me an imperial cloak rippling in the wind of an oncoming storm a cloak much worn and ragged when i looked again the people were gone and the courtyard was empty dry leaves blew across the weedgrown spaces the roof of the palace had collapsed and its tiles lay broken and scattered on the ground the wind whispered in the forsaken places arthur arthur a woman appeared wearing a long white garment of the kind highborn ladies are often buried in her skin had the pallor of death and her eyes were sunken and redrimmed as if from sickness or mourning but she came purposefully towards me over the cracked pavement the wind whipping her long garment against her legs blowing her black tresses before her face she raised her arms to me and i saw she held something in her hands a magnificent sword broken now sundered by a mighty stroke the ruined weapon dripped blood the ravenhaired woman approached and held the broken blade to me save us merlin she whispered her voice raw with sorrow heal us i reached for the sword but she let it fall from her hands and it clattered on the tiles i saw in its pommel the imperial jewel the eaglecarved amethyst of magnus maximus the awen passed i felt a touch on my arm and found that i could move once more i turned pelleas was staring at me his brow wrinkled in concern lord myrddin i passed a hand before my eyes what is it pelleas are you well i said mat i think there will be a riot here soon nothing we do will prevent that i said glancing quickly around the mob still stood before us and their shouts were growing louder and more angry i think that if we hope to find aurelius we must search elsewhere if not the palace dafyd said then the church let us go there in any case gwythelyn urged the monks with us voiced their approval although they were holy men most were trained warriors and could handle themselves in a fight if it came to that naturally they preferred to avoid confrontation hi any but the most needful circumstance hence they were eager to leave the governors palace for the quiet of the church very well i agreed if he is not there at least we may have some word of him the church was not far from the palace as it turned out but we had to ask several passersby where it was before we found it for no one seemed to know it was not a large structure but large enough to serve and surrounded by a goodlysized plot of ground which was planted with trees plum and apple mostly and a few pear the mudandtimber building was washed white with lime so that it fairly sparkled in the sun an inviting place but much at odds with its surroundings which crowded in as if lusting after its comely green plot the church appeared distinctly out of place as much out of place were the ranks of horses and the warriors lolling beneath the fruit trees they jumped to their feet as we rode up someone sang out as if in warning lord myrddin is here lord emrys clearly our arrival was anticipated several warriors came running up we left the horses in their care and gladly dropped from the saddle dafyd and gwythelyn started at once for the church pelleas and i following the monks staying behind to speak to the soldiers some of whom i gathered were kinsmen the interior of the church was larger than it appeared from outside owing to the fact that its floor had been excavated and lowered we walked down several stone steps to the richly tessellated floor there were candles burning on candle trees all round the large dark room a cool place of refuge from the hot bright day yet it had something of the feel of a tomb we were met by urbanus himself who was obviously expecting us he made a quick bow to dafyd and the two bishops greeted one another with a holy kiss and exchanged brief words about the journey while pelleas and i looked on but as soon as the pleasantries of protocol were finished urbanus turned to me and gripped me by the hands he was a man above medium height with a scholars oblong head highdomed and covered with dark hair growing thin on top his skin was sallow as marks a man who spends his days away from the sun his long fingers were smudged with ink lord merlinus he said affecting the latin form of my name i am indeed happy you have come he did not appear especially happy he appeared relieved aurelianus will be most pleased to see you is the high king here no not at present but he hopes to return soon if you will await him here the churchman faltered yes he has asked me to make you comfortable until he returns where is aurelius what is wrong urbanus glanced at dafyd as if hoping his spiritual superior would answer for him but dafyd only gazed benignly back i hardly know where to begin urbanus sighed obviously he had little experience with trouble merely speaking about it fairly undid him i did not choose to make it easier for him tell us at once i do not understand all of it he admitted to his credit and no doubt the warriors outside can tell you more but evidently some problem has arisen with aurelianus ah coronation he went to the governor you understand and was received with all cordiality i believe he stayed in the palace a day and a night and then rode out of the city once more to make provision for his troops when he returned and his kings with him the governor would not see him aurelius turned away wondered dafyd why echoed gwythelyn urbanus shook his head in bewilderment i cannot say i do not know if aurelianus can say he came here in a rage livid uther was with him they talked to one another in my cell the men with him waited outside when they came out uther asked if he might leave some of their men here of course i had no objection aurelianus told me that should you come while he was away i was to ask you to await him here and that he would return soon as i have told you when did this take place i asked the day before yesterday urbanus replied and added i do not know what has happened but the mood of the city has grown ugly since he arrived we have seen the mob at the governors palace gwythelyn said he went on to describe what we had seen and he and dafyd and urbanus fell to discussing it pelleas turned to me i do not like the sound of this what does it mean between the time aurelius left the city and the time he returned something happened to poison the governors favour against him i do not know what it was but likely that does not matter overmuch aurelius has gone to gather his kings i think and will return with a show of power will there be a fight unless we can prevent it i told him i think it will not serve to have our high king begin his reign with the slaughter of the citizens of londinium eight among the warriors lolling outside we found one who had spoken to uther just before he and aurelius had departed where has lord aurelius gone i asked as i came to stand over him the soldier pointed out by one of his comrades jumped to his feet and removed the blade of grass from between his teeth lord emrys he said quickly i was just i saved him his explanation no matter where is aurelius he has left the city that much is obvious my lord the duke said to wait here for them to return if there was to be trouble he wanted men inside the walls that is what he said we were to wait here and i was rapidly losing patience where was he going he did not say my lord perhaps not but you have an opinion do you not think it is important well he replied slowly it was in my mind that they were riding back to the camp we camped the war host halfaday from londinium as the king did not wish to overwhelm the city yes and he met with the governor what happened nothing that i could tell we stayed in the palace for a day and then returned to camp was all well in camp not as well as may be the soldier allowed several of the lords had gone and taken their warbands with them and in the city what happened on aurelius return the warrior shrugged nothing that i know of nothing and yet the governors temper turned against aurelius it did lord emrys for a fact it did at last i began to understand what had happened aurelius exuberant and fresh from the saving of the realm nevertheless refrains from marching into londinium in triumph adopting a humbler demeanour he arrives in the city and presents himself to the governor in order to determine how he will be received in the city reassured he returns to his lords thinking perhaps to enter in force with the governors blessing however things begin to go wrong he arrives in camp to find that several lords have deserted him thats how he would see it whether they intended a slight or not in the meantime a few of the wealthy and influential of londinium have had time to make up their minds about aurelius and apparently what they have decided is not flattering he calls himself high king but where is his war band where are his lords and battlechiefs he is no king at all something like that they spread this slander about and incite the people who come to the governor with their petition against this impertinent youth and the governor owing no allegiance to aurelius instantly withdraws his support poor aurelius by rights deserving a heros welcome returns to discover himself persona non grata outraged he rides to gather his lords once more and march on the city thinking to take it by force if need be needless to say the citizens fearful of this young warlords anger descend upon the governor demanding safety demanding protection demanding action be taken against this upstart high king well that was the way of it or near enough the warrior still stood before me watching and i realized that i would have no more from him aurelius had confided nothing to him i obtained the location of the camp thanked him and left him to his duty i went to gwythelyn and told him to wait with dafyd warning him that for their own safety they must stay at the church with the warriors there was no telling what the citizens of londinium might do if roused to it then pelleas and i rode out to find aurelius having come by a more northerly route we had not encountered the camp on our way to londinium but the warriors directions proved themselves and we came upon the camp as the sun stretched our shadows long behind us i saw at once the reason for aurelius fury and i did not blame him for of the great warhost he had commanded now only a few bands and their lords remained among them tewdrig to be sure and ceredigawn one of cunneddas sons was still there and custennins band with their lords battlechief i went to tewdrig directly he was not happy with the situation and let me know it at once i tried to stop them he insisted but they had it in their heads to leave as soon as aurelius rode to londinium we fought his war for him they said let him win the city for himself that is what they said and they said theyd had enough of high kings remarked ceredigawn striding up and i am beginning to agree with them are we to wait here like shavelings while the grown men divide the spoils he had seen me ride into camp and came to add his own opinion who voiced these things among you i asked him gorlas of cerniu mostly ceredigawn replied and some others friends of gorlas tewdrig informed me i might have gone myself i am glad you stayed i told him quickly i think you will not be disappointed for your loyalty how so tewdrig asked before answering i bade pelleas bring the other lords and battlechiefs to me and when they had gathered i sat them down and addressed them saying my lords and sword brothers i have just returned from londinium and i have a fair idea what happened there tell us then if you will said one of the chieftains for unless you do i am leaving at once there is a harvest to bring in at home and i have had enough of waiting his ultimatum was greeted with grunts of approval from several of the others i had arrived none too soon they were all on the point of leaving i took a deep breath and began i do not know if what i have to say will make any difference to you but i tell you the truth it appears that to keep from making one blunder our young king has made an even bigger blunder oh aye agreed someone he forgot who his friends are perhaps i allowed but that was never his intention he did not march with you into londinium because he was ashamed shouted one of the battlechiefs of the north we were good enough to fight for him but not to be seen in his great city the man spat in the dirt to add emphasis to his words mithras kill me if i lift a bkde for aurelius again i understood then how it was with them let lord emrys speak shouted tewdrig i would hear him out aurelius declined to march with you into londinium not because he was ashamed never believe that but because he did not wish to appear arrogant in the eyes of the citizens citizens spat the battlechief once more showing what he thought of the word aurelius i continued feared that marching into the city in force would appear arrogant and would turn opinion against him worse it might have been seen as an attack and there would have been bloodshed so he bade you wait for him and he went on alone but deeming him a man of little account londinium turned against him anyway what does he need with londinium demanded ceredigawn they have no king and no war band no but they have wealth and power anyone who will be high king in this land must be recognized by londinium vortigern never was someone called out how quickly they forget yes and look where vortigern has led us i answered that is the mistake aurelius did not wish to make he thought to win londinium with meekness after vortigerns arrogance still they turned against him so be it when next he marches into the city he will want you at his side the gathering remained silent thinking it over finally tewdrig rose from his place and proclaimed i have always wanted to see this wonder of a city and as i am so close i would not be turned back now let us go with aurelius and see that our high king receives proper respect from the stiffnecked rabble of londinium it was what the others needed to hear they all stood up with a shout adding their voices to tewdrigs and an uneasy peace settled over the camp once more so it was that when aurelius returned late that night there was still a camp and men to return to gorlas blast his bones he paced his tent in agitation still sweating from his ride i swear he planned this as revenge on me for letting octa go free calm yourself aurelie said uther i was the one that let octa go free gorlas is difficult and that is the end of it this was his way of making himself important uther had a way of reading men simply and directly he had struck the truth of gorlas listen to your brother i said if you will not listen to me gorlas is not the only one who mistook your reasons for not marching into londinium like a hero i would have received no heros welcome in londinium aurelius growled i turned on my heel and started from the tent aurelius saw this and cried after me so you desert me too eh myrddin go then leave me get out all of you myrddin wait uther came after me please we have been in the saddle since before sunrise and then we did not so much as catch a glimpse of gorlas or any of the others do not be angry with him i am not angry i said turning to meet him in the moonlight but i will not waste my time talking just to hear myself speak let him rest he will be ready to listen in the morning i did not go to my tent but went instead to a nearby alder grove to think i sat down among the slim moonsilvered trunks and listened to the water ripple in the little stream it was peaceful there and i had much need of peace much need of respite from men and their selfimportant schemes all desire and ambition no thought no restraint or compassion no understanding the last few days coming after the benevolent company of dafyd and his monks seemed diabolic in contrast the jealousy the grudging animosity the petty spite my spirit recoiled from it as from a fanged serpent great light deliver me from the enmity of smallminded men or if i may not be delivered give me the strength to overcome or if not to overcome simply to endure i would settle for that then sitting there in the moonlight i felt the confusion of the past days dissolve like hard dirt clods in the rain i breathed deep of the tranquillity of the sleeping world and began to see the way ahead more clearly aurelius must be established as high king and must be recognized by all as supreme king of all britons his claim must remain unchallenged and all lesser kings must be seen to give him fealty this was of foremost importance if it could be accomplished without increasing ill will and contention so much the better by the time the moon dipped below the far horizon a plan had begun to take shape in my mind i went to my bed at last satisfied that i had found a solution it seemed that i had just stretched myself out when pelleas woke me saying lord myrddin the long is asking for you i rose with a yawn dashed water in my face from the basin in pelleas hands and went to see the king he was seated at his board his dark curls wild on his head a loaf of bread in his hands it did not appear that his nights rest had soothed him he halfrose when i came in remembered himself sat again and extended half the loaf to me uther sat at the end of the board looking out of sorts he too had been dragged from his bed well wise counsellor aurelius said give me the benefit of your wisdom am i to be high king or hermit what am i to do you will be high king i reassured him but not yet no his eyebrows rose how long must i wait until the time redeems itself speak plainly prophet how long so i told him my plan and ended by saying thus send the rest of the kings back to their realms tell them to ready their tribute to you and await your summons which will come when you are ready when will that be a sly smile wreathed his lips for he understood the implications of my words at the christ mass yes he rose with a shout well done myrddin uther nodded vaguely it is all very well for the kings to pay tribute to aurelius but why must he wait until the dead of winter to be crowned the throne is his he should take it aurelius was on his feet now excited do you not see it brother londinium will have time to misdoubt its treatment of me the citizens will wait for me to act and they will grow fearful in waiting they will fear my wrath they will fear the worst and then when i come they will seek to soothe me they will throw open the gates they will lavish gifts upon me in short they will welcome me in all meekness glad in their hearts that i did not destroy them as they deserved am i right myrddin that is the meat of it and the other kings by letting them go now i rescue my dignity essentially uther still appeared in a fog i do not see that at all half of the kings have left me aurelius said and the other half wish they had he was overstating it but not by much very well let them all go i will send word to them to attend me at christ mass in londinium they will come and the people will see me attended by the kings of britain in all their finery oh it will be a splendid spectacle they will think you weak if you do not act now no brother it is by choosing not to act that i show my strength he is truly strong who withholds his hand when he could strike it was not as simple as that i knew but if it was what aurelius believed and he did it might amount to the same thing in the end i prayed that it would besides i did not think he would lose anything by waiting and letting the lords think better of their oaths of fealty also the troublesome lords like gorlas and his friends morcant coledac and dunaut would be more easily dealt with singly alone without support of other dissenters they could be brought into compliance uther remained sceptical what do we do while we wait where will we go need i remind you brother we have not so much as a rooftile to call our own it is not so long to wait i said quickly and you have no lack of hearth places where you will be welcome we could return to dyfed or no replied aurelius firmly it must not be at the hospitality of any of my kings it must be somewhere else just where might that be wondered uther not londinium surely leave it to me i said i know a place where you will be received in all luxury and accorded the dignity of your rank uther rose he was happy with the plan or at least happy to let the matter rest until he had properly broken fast he took his leave of us and returned to his tent i got to my feet as well merlin said aurelius he stood and came to place his hands on my shoulders i am stubborn and impatient but you forbear me thank you for your indulgence my friend and thank you for the benefit of your wisdom the high king embraced me like a brother and then went out to tell his lords that they were to return home to their harvests and that he would send word for them to meet him in londinium at the mass of christ when he would take the crown the christ mass wondered ceredigawn when is that at the midwinter solstice answered aurelius and where will you go now my lord asked tewdrig what will you do i am going away with my wise counsellor aurelius answered and with a conspirators smile turned towards me i will hold vigil in prayer and holy instruction until i be made high king this pronouncement caused as much sensation as if aurelius had announced that he would forsake the throne altogether and become a monk the lords turned to one another and remarked that such a thing had never been heard of before aurelius left them floundering in their surprise i will summon you when the season draws near that you may make ready to attend me in all courtesy saying this he returned to his tent leaving his lords staring after him a more kingly act he could not have conceived nine i should have seen more clearly i should have known where events were leading i should have recognized what shape the future would take my vision was clear enough i should have known to protect aurelius above all i should have recognized the hand of morgian working unseen to shape the world to her will so much i should have seen and known should have empty useless words how they cleave bitterly to the tongue to utter them is to taste bile and ashes in the mouth well i am to blame aurelius was so happy so confident and i was so pleased to sojourn a season in avallachs house and to see charis again that i did not think further ahead than the day at hand feeling no threat i let time take its course that was my mistake in truth i feared morgian and that was my failing upon leaving londinium we rode to ynys avallach the mysterious glass isle of old to avallachs palace we stopped along the way and were received with great acclaim word of hengists defeat had permeated the landscape itself and we were everywhere made welcome gwythelyn and the monks parted company with us at aquae sulis but i induced dafyd to continue on with us and to undertake aurelius tutelage not that he needed much coaxing the happy prospect of seeing charis and avallach once more cheered him greatly oh it was a glad reunion they fell into one anothers arms tears of happiness shining on their cheeks i do not think they ever hoped to see one another again so many years had passed but like all good friendships the passage of time did little to alter their love for one another and within the space of a few heartbeats it was as if they had never been apart after the hardships of a season of almost continual fighting it was good to let the tranquillity of the glass isle seep into our battleweary souls false summer faded and autumn progressed apace bringing wind and rain to the summerlands the sea rose to flood the lowlands around the palace and ynys avallach became a true island once again though the days grew shorter and the world colder our hearts remained light and we luxuriated in the warmth of one anothers company dafyd taught in the great hall by day most of avallachs household gathered to hear the wise bishop expound the teachings of gods holy son jesu lord and saviour of men and the hall was filled with love and light and learning aurelius true to his word spent his days in instruction and prayer at dafyds feet i watched him grow in grace and faith and i rejoiced in my heart that britain should have such a high king great is the king who loves the most high god before the first snows of winter fell aurelius consecrated himself to god and took the sign of the saviour son the cross of christ as his emblem pelleas grew restless and one day i found him on the rampart staring southward towards llyonesse do you miss it i asked him i did not think so until now he answered without taking his eyes from the southern hills then why not go back he turned to me pain and hope mingled in his face but he did not answer not to stay but i can spare you yet a while go back to your people how long has it been since you have seen them go to them i do not know if i would be welcome he replied and turned back to stare into the grey distance you will never find out standing here i told him go there is time you could rejoin us in londinium at the christ mass if you think i might i would not have said it if i did not think so besides it would be good to have some word of happenings in llyonesse then i will go he said resolutely he turned and with the air of a man going to his doom strode from the rampart and across the courtyard in a little while i saw him ride along the causeway i watched until he disappeared from sight along the hill track for my part i spent much time with my mother talking playing chess playing my harp and singing for her it was good to sit with her beside the hearth the scent of oak and elm hazy in the air wrapped in our woollen cloaks listening to the icy rain spatter on the courtyard stones and the small ticking of the fire before us charis told me of her life as a bull dancer in atlantis the cataclysm that claimed her homeland their coming to ynys prydein and the difficulties of those first hopeless tragic years all the old stories but i heard them in a way i had never heard them before and i understood hearing with understanding is perhaps the better part of wisdom i learned much in listening to my mother speak about her life and came to see her in a new way one morning i asked about the sword avallachs sword the one she had given me when i became king pelleas had told me that he found it on the battlefield when i fled and that he had carried it back to ynys avallach along with word of my disappearance that first winter when the weather forced him to give up searching for me do you wish to have it back she asked i have kept it for you but when you did not ask for it on your return i thought but of course i will get it for you no please i only ask about it i told you once that sword was not for me i held it for a time but i think it is meant for another hand it is yours give it to whomsoever you wish i would have given much to remain in avallachs house but it was not to be too soon the tune came to leave one day aurelius sent out his messengers to his lords as he had said he would summoning them to his kingmaking then a few days later we started out in the cold heart of a midwinter morning we mounted our horses and began the journey to londinium aurelius was in high spirits and eager to seize his crown he had embraced dafyds instruction and now owned the holy jesu as his lord upon his taking the crown he meant to be baptized as a sign to all his people where his allegiance lay uther distrusted the church i do not know why he would speak of his misgivings to no one he allowed the good in men like dafyd and the good their lives and teaching produced even acknowledged its source but could not bring himself to embrace the truth they proclaimed nor make it his own but as i have said he loved his brother and whatever aurelius chose uther at least tolerated nevertheless uthers sojourn at the glass isle although restful had something of captivity in it so the day of our leavetaking was a day of liberation for uther and he breathed deep of it he was the first into the saddle and he sat jerking the reins back and forth impatiently as the rest of us made our farewells mother pray for me i whispered as i stepped close to embrace her like my love my prayers have never ceased go in gods peace my hawk so wrapping ourselves in our cloaks and furs against the cold we started down the snaking trail to the causeway and across the frozen meres to the snowdusted hills beyond the cold brought colour to our cheeks and keenness to our appetites we travelled with all speed over the hard winter ground making the most of the tooshort daylight hours stopping only when it became too dark to see the road ahead at night we huddled close to the fire of our nights host chieftain or magistrate or village elder and listened to the winterstarved wolves howl nevertheless we rode through a land silent and at rest and arrived in londinium a day sooner than we had planned this time aurelius did not go to the governors palace but went straight to the church urbanus received us cordially and made us comfortable in his quarters the lower floor of a plain but spacious house adjacent to the church while we warmed ourselves over the brazier and sipped hot mulled wine he told us how the church might be prepared for the coronation he declared enthusiasm for the coronation to take place in his church but confessed i still do not understand why you wish to be made king here i am a christian aurelius explained where would you have me go governor melatus is not my superior that i should receive my crown from his hand but jesu is my lord therefore i will take up my kingship in his holy presence and i will receive my crown from the hand of his true servant bishop dafyd it was as i had always intended it to be of course but hearing the confirmation from aurelius own lips thrilled me only such a king would be fit for the kingdom of summer and aurelius had the grace and the strength he had the faith he could rule this worldsrealm island and it would flourish like a meadow in midsummer though the land lay barren in the cold grip of winter i saw summers cloak falling over her like the mantle of a bride and i rejoiced to see it great light let my vision prove false let aurelius live to do his work the next day the first of aurelius kings arrived in londinium coledac and morcant neither of whom had far to travel came into the city with their lords and advisers a small band of warriors each and to my surprise their wives and children dunaut and tewdrig arrived the next day and custennin and ceredigawn the day following and there was a scramble to find places for them all for each had brought a large retinue to attend the ceremony others arrived morganwg of dumnonia with the princes cato and maglos eldof of eboracum ogryvan of dollgellau and his chieftains and druids rhain prince of gwynedd ceredigawns cousin antorius and his brother king regulus of canti in lloegres owen vinddu of rheged hoel of armorica braving the winter seas with his sons ban and bors still others came and not lords and chieftains only but holy men as well samson most reverent priest of goddodin in the north the renowned bishop teilo and abbots ffili and asaph noble churchmen of lloegres and kentigern the much loved priest of mon bishop trimoriun and dubricius both learned and respected priests of the church at caer legionis and of course gwythelyn with all the monks of dafyds monastery at llandaff kings and lords and churchmen from all the realms of the island of the mighty came to uphold aurelius as high king and each had brought gifts objects of gold and silver swords fine horses and hunting hounds good cloth ash bows and steeltipped arrows hides and skins and furs of finest quality silverrimmed drinking horns casks of mead and dark beer and more all brought gifts according to their wealth and rank and i realized that they had been long anticipating this event and awaiting it with eagerness even as i had predicted time had worked its wonder in their hearts magnifying aurelius in their eyes they came to londinium to make a high king and they would see him crowned with all honour and esteem did i say all there was one whose absence fairly shouted gorlas he alone risked the high kings wrath with his defiance with the christ mass but one day away there was still no word or sign from gorlas this weighed more heavily on me and on uther than it did on aurelius who was so busy receiving the gifts and honour of his lords that he did not appear to notice gorlas slight but uther noticed as the days dwindled and preparations for the feast of the mass of christ hurried apace he stormed the upper rooms of urbanus house angry shouting pounding tables and doorposts with his fists give me twenty men and i will bring back gorlas head for the high kings crowntaking by lieu and jesu i would i answered calm yourself uther lieu might approve of your gift but i heartily doubt jesu would find favour in it well am i to stand by and do nothing while that whores whelp thumbs his nose at aurelius tell me merlin what am i to do mind i will not suffer gorlas impudence lightly i say that it is aurelius affair uther not yours if the high king wishes to overlook gorlas insult so be it no doubt your brother will deal with it at a more opportune time uther subsided but he was not appeased he continued to grumble and growl snarling at all who approached him making himself so unpleasant that i finally sent him out to look for pelleas who had not yet arrived for i knew pelleas would have come by now unless prevented and i had begun to be anxious over him i could have studied the fire for some sign of him but i will tell you the truth that since my healing and release from celyddon reading the embers or gazing into the seeing bowl had become distasteful to me perhaps i feared that in walking the paths of the future i might meet morgian that occurred to me and the prospect chilled my heart or perhaps i was restrained by something else in any event i did not care to satisfy my curiosity with the fire or bowl and i would not unless need were great so uther glad to have something to do ordered his horse to be saddled and gathered a small band of companions and rode out from the city at midday i was free to go about my own affairs which included visiting custennin and tewdrig this kept me occupied well into the night for the noblemen came to aurelius one after another without cease drinking his health giving gifts and pledging themselves and their heirs to his service on the eve of the christ mass the high king was awash in a floodtide of fealty and wellwishing i spoke to this one and that gathering information and knowledge learning what i could from the lords about whose realms i was ignorant dawn was but a whisper away when i finally made my way to my bedchamber only to realize that uther had not yet returned notwithstanding my reluctance i was tempted to stir up the embers and see what had befallen him but instead i donned my cloak and went to find my horse the monk whose charge was the stable lay sleeping in his corner on a pallet of fresh straw snoring loth to wake him i saddled my mount and rode out into cold silent streets the gatekeeper was nowhere to be seen but the gate was not locked so i opened the gate myself and hastened out gusts of wind hissed through froststiffened foliage along the road outside the walls the heavens were heavy with unshed snow and shone like molten lead in the rising sun i turned west with the road knowing uther would have ridden that way in search of pelleas i rode letting my horse have his head glad to be out in the countryside once more and free of the tooclose company of men my thoughts turned to pelleas perhaps i had not acted wisely in urging him to return to his home in llyonesse i knew nothing of affairs there king belyn might not have been pleased to see his bastard son pelleas might have come to harm even now i did not think it likely and the thought would not have occurred to me at all if not for the obvious fact of pelleas absence of course he might have had trouble on the road always possible although it was hard to imagine what kind of trouble a seasoned warrior might encounter that could not easily be discharged by the quick stroke of his blade or might it be something else entirely the empty road passed beneath my horses hooves and my danger sense sharpened with each step at every moment i expected to see pelleas cresting the hill ahead but i reached it first and he was not to be seen i rode until midday and then stopped i must turn back if i was to return to londinium in time for the mass and aurelius crowntaking i stopped and waited a moment on a treecrowned hilltop gazing into the distance all around then reluctantly started back i had not ridden far however when i heard a shout merrlinn the call came from some distance away but was distinct in the crisp winter air instantly i halted and whirled in the saddle there a long way off a lone rider galloped towards me pelleas i waited and he reached me a few moments later exhausted out of breath his horse lathered from a hard ride i am sorry my lord he began but i dismissed his apology with a gesture are you well i am well my lord have you seen uther yes pelleas answered with a nod gasping for breath we met him on the road we who was with you gorlas pelleas wheezed i would have come sooner but in the circumstance i thought best no doubt you did right now tell me what has happened one day ago on the road gorlas and his party were attacked he travelled with but a small escort and we were forced to fight for our lives we held them off for a good while nevertheless uther came upon us when it appeared that we would fail our attackers fled the duke gave chase but was eluded pelleas paused gulping air upon his return uther sent me on ahead he rides with gorlas now how far behind pelleas shook his head i cannot say for certain i have been riding all night i scanned the road behind hoping to see some sign of uther and gorlas there was none well there is nothing we can do now we will return to londinium and await them there owing to pelleas fatigue we were late in reaching the city but we hurried to urbanus house and washed ourselves before going to the church by the time we arrived the church was already full the yard was thronged with the lords retinues and curious citizens we forced our way through the press at the doors and made our way among the crowd inside finding places beside a pillar near the front the interior of the great room was a blaze of candlelight shining white gold like the light of heaven after a violent storm bluemisted vapours of incense ascended to the roofbeams in sweetscented clouds to waft above our heads like the prayers of saints the church buzzed with excitement here was a thing that had never happened before a king crowned in a church receiving his kingship from the hand of a holy man we had only just taken our places when the inner doors were thrown wide open and a robed monk swinging a censer came forth down the central aisle behind him came another carrying a carved wooden cross before him urbanus followed wearing a dark robe and a huge cross of gold upon his chest dafyd walked behind him dressed in his robes face shining in the candleglow i stared at him as all the others stared for he was a man transformed splendid in humility radiant in simple holiness dafyd appeared a heavenly messenger come down to bless the proceedings with his presence no one who saw him could have mistaken his kindly smile for anything but the rapture of one close to the living source of all love and light just to see him was to bow the knee to the god he served it was to draw near true majesty with meekness and submission behind dafyd walked aurelius carrying his sword the sword of britain blade across palms dressed in a white tunic and trousers with a wide belt of silver discs his dark hair was oiled and combed back bound at the nape with a thong he walked easily his expression at once serious and joyful gwythelyn came after him bearing a narrow circlet of gold on a cloth of white linen four more monks followed with a cloak of imperial purple each holding a corner in his hand all these made their way to the altar which was raised on a stepped marble dias urbanus and dafyd approached the altar and turned to face aurelius who knelt down before them on the steps no sooner had this taken place than a chorus of monks lining the perimeter of the church began shouting gloria gloria gloria in excelsis deo gloria in excelsis deo glory to god in the high realms they shouted and their shout became a chant others joined in and soon everyone was chanting the church reverberated with it the sound lifting the heart and spiralling up and ever upward through the nightdark sky to the first twinkling stars to the very throne of heaven when the chant had reached its crescendo dafyd stepped forth with arms outspread and the room fell silent at once it is right to pay homage to the great good god he said then he turned to the altar knelt and began to pray aloud great of might high king of heaven we honour you light of sun radiance of moon splendour of fire speed of lightning swiftness of wind depth of sea

to the monk with the cross and lifted the wooden symbol before aurelius aurelianus son of constantine who would be high king over us do you acknowledge the lord jesu as your high king and swear him fealty i do so acknowledge him answered aurelius i swear fealty to no other lord and do you promise to serve him through all things as you would be served even to the last of your strength i do so

dispense mercy and seek truth through all things dealing with my people in compassion and love even as i am dealt with by god all that dafyd asked aurelius answered without hesitation and with a loud voice so that even the crowd outside the doors could hear pelleas leaned near and whispered all gathered in this church this night christian and pagan alike will know what it is to worship the most high god so be it i answered may such knowledge increase urbanus came forward with a vial of holy oil and dipping his fingers anointed aurehus forehead with the sign of the cross then he nodded to the monks holding the cloak the monks lifted the cloak and wrapped it round aurelius shoulders urbanus fastened it with a silver brooch dafyd had turned to gwythelyn holding the circlet he now took up the narrow golden band and held it above aurelius head arise aurelianus he said wear your crown aurehus rose up slowly and at the same time dafyd lowered the circlet upon his brow the holy man kissed aurelius on the cheek and turning him to face his people cried out lords of britain here is your high king i charge you to love him honour him follow him pledge yourselves to him as he has pledged himself to the high king of heaven at this the assembled lords broke out with a mighty cheer one voice of acclaim one spirit of good will one heart of love for their new king aurelius smiled and spread his arms as if he would embrace all the world and i know that in that moment he did as few men ever do when the cheering ended aurelius knelt once more for the bishops blessing both dafyd and urbanus laid their hands upon him and gave him the blessing of the church saying go in peace aurelianus to serve god the realm and your people and to lead them in holiness and righteousness to the end of your strength and life the people knelt as he passed but not one could take his eyes from the king he reached the centre of the church and someone cried out ave ave imperator another answered hail emperor aurelius all at once every man was on his feet again raising the new cry emperor aurelius ave imperator hail aurelius emperor of the west not since maximus had british men raised an emperor him they gave a name macsen weldig to make a briton of him but he marched off to rome with the best of the british troops and never returned aurelius had a roman name but a british heart he knew nothing of rome this emperor was a briton they proclaimed aurelius emperor and doing so though they little understood proclaimed the beginning of a new age for ynys prydein island of the mighty ten aurelius left the church and the throng pushed after him spilling into the yard cheering still torches lit the night and from somewhere above the wild celebration there came a song slowly softly gaining strength as men and women took up the melody the song an old briton battle song became a hymn to the new high king and aurelius stood ringed by his lords in the torchlight his crown gleaming as if with captured stars arms outstretched turning and turning as the song flowed upward spreading in rings like a fountain in a pool they sang rise up bold warriors take steel in your strong hands the foeman stands below loudly shouting sound the horn and iron gather spear and shield the day is bright for battle and glory for the taking mount up brave warband the battlechief is fearless bold leader keen in victory he will win the heros portion and the bards laud his name in songmaking voices echoing down the narrow streets the crowd followed aurelius to the governors palace given time the governor too had changed his mind about aurelius for upon his return aurelius found governor melatus of a muchchanged disposition fearful of offending such a powerful ally melatus had extended every hospitality of the city which was heavily taxed finding places for all the kings and lords attending aurelius so it was to the governors palace that aurelius went now to celebrate the feast of christ mass with his lords the palace glowed beaconbright in the winter night with candletrees and torches and fires in the courtyard large as it was not everyone could be accommodated in the governors hall that night but it made no difference for the doors were opened wide and the celebration filled the courtyard oh it was a gladsome time a feast of love and light for winters ending i was uneasy in one detail only uther and gorlas had not arrived what could be keeping them i wondered they should have reached londinium long ago aurelius seemed not to notice their absence he was too much occupied with drinking the health of his lords and receiving their pledges of fealty but i noticed and as the feasting began and continued uthers and gorlas absence weighed on me telleas are you certain they were coming after you i had pulled pelleas aside to ask him assuredly my lord what can be preventing them pelleas frowned more trouble do you think perhaps what would you have me do lord nothing for now stay here i may leave for a little while to see if i can discover what has become of other so saying i left the hall and made my way through the courtyard the citizens of londinium drawn by the noise and light flocked to the celebration and the courtyard revelry now overflowed into the streets more people were joining all the time i entertained no hope of reaching the stable to get a horse so pulling my cloak around me i pushed through the streaming throng and made my way to the western gates which as i expected were closed and barred for the night also as i expected the gatesmen were nowhere to be found doubtless they had abandoned their duty at first opportunity thinking only to take a look on the other side i climbed the steps to the wall walk and gazed down upon the road to my surprise there was uther sword in hand fuming and furious standing in the dark cursing the gate he had been banging on the wooden door with the pommel of his sword but of course no one had heard him uther i shouted he glanced up but could not see me who is it open this gate at once or by my life i will burn it down it is myrddin i answered merlin he stepped towards me what do you here open the gate where are the others i have sent them to find another way in gorlas waits on the road this is embarrassing merlin let us in gladly if i could the gate is barred and the gatesmen are gone everyone has joined the feast at the governors palace well do something it is cold and we are tired i will see what can be done go and bring gorlas here and one way or another i will see that these gates are opened as uther mounted his horse and rode to fetch gorlas i hurried back down and taking a torch from the wall beside the gatesmans hut i went to the gate the wooden beam was secured by a crosswise iron bar that held it in place the iron could not be withdrawn for it was clamped and the clamp fastened with a lock it began to appear as if uther would have to burn down the gate after all unless now i had scarcely thought of the lore i had learned with the hill folk those many years ago and certainly i had rarely used their art but what is a gate but wood and iron after all there was no one around so i quickly drew my knife and scratched a circle in the wood around the lock then i uttered the words in the old tongue amazed that i had not forgotten at a touch the lock simply fell off and the wooden beam slid easily beneath my hand with a finger i pushed and the huge gate swung open on groaning hinges soon i heard horses on the road ahead i lifted the torch and held it high uther appeared and gorlas with him but there was another riding between them and as they came within the circle of light created by my torch i saw that it was a woman young beautiful wrapped in furs to her chin a silver circlet on her fair brow gorlas queen i did not know gorlas had taken a queen i whispered to uther as lord gorlas and his escort passed through the gate he sat his saddle and watched the lord and lady ride on she is ygerna his daughter uther informed me a rare flower of womanhood is she not i stared up at the man i had never heard uther utter such a sentiment she is fair indeed i allowed but aurelius is waiting what has detained you uther shrugged and replied as if it explained all a woman was with us a woman she was little more than a maid and although she was beautiful she did not appear frail or debilitated in any way indeed the bloom of youth was on her and to my eye she seemed to have endured the rigours of her journey most commendably telleas told me about the attack the attack uther asked then nodded absently oh that it was nothing well aurelius is waiting you have missed the crowning uther accepted this amiably i would have been here if i could is he angry in truth i replied i do not think he has noticed your absence yet if you hurry now he may not we will make haste then said uther placidly but merlin have you ever seen a woman so fair have you ever seen such eyes as hers the last of gorlas men had passed through the gate go on with you i will wait here until your men return i do not know if uther even heard me for without a word he turned his horse and trotted after gorlas as it happened i did not have long to wait one of uthers men approached the gate almost at once i gave him instructions to wait for the others and bar the gates again when all had passed through flying back along the streets i returned to the governors palace where the celebration continued uther was engaged in ordering stablehands to attend the horses gorlas and ygerna stood a little way off looking on at the roister around them the fires leapt high in the courtyard and the governors beer flowed freely to match the high spirits and liberal good will for the new high king her face illumined by the fireglow i had a moment to assess this beauty that had so bewitted uther she was perhaps all of fifteen years tall slender her finelyformed head borne gracefully on an elegant neck she lacked the awkward girlishness of her age and appeared far more mature nor was appearance deceiving gorlas wife had died when the girl was still a babe and she had been raised from childhood to be the lady of the realm this i learned later at the time i saw only a comely girl with softwoven brown hair and large dark eyes in whose pretty smile a man might gladly lose himself will you be announced i asked gorlas are we not expected he answered hotly then turned to me oh it is you merlin my name was spoken like an oath he worked his mouth silently and at last forced out as you think best no gorlas wasted no love on me but he respected me and no doubt feared me a little as any lord fears the man closest to his rulers ear we will go in together then since i began i will see to it uther said shoving between us he turned gorlas by the arm and led him off across the courtyard i watched the three of them walking between the leaping flames of two fires and i saw ygerna step lightly between uther and gorlas everything froze in my sight all sound and motion ceased vision narrowed as in that instant a deathly foreboding awakened within me nothing else existed but the terrible vision before me ygerna between two kings here was the nameless danger i had felt earlier in the day redoubled in force ygernal oh fair daughter in your hands rests the future of the realm tonight you are destinys handmaiden do you realize that no of course she could have no idea there was virtue as well as nobility in her rearing her natural innocence prevented her from using her beauty as a less scrupulous woman would have another year or two older and i might have been seeing the end of the world stepping so lightly between the coronation fires i made my way after them stumbling numb coming into the hall as they approached the high king uther worked to his brothers side aurelius welcomed him clapped him on the back i think that until this moment the high king had not a thought to spare for his brother and thrust a drinking cup into uthers hand uther took the cup drank and passed it to gorlas who proclaimed his loyalty to the high kingship then aurelius eyes fell upon ygerna i saw him smile i saw the change in his nature as he beheld her perhaps it was the giddiness of celebration or the play of light upon her face or youth calling to youth or merely the wine running strong in aurelius veins perhaps it was something more but i saw love kindled in that first brief glance alas i was not the only one to see it uther stiffened had he been a porcupine he would have bristled his grin froze on his face and the light died in his eyes he seemed to grow visibly smaller as he stood in his brothers shadow oblivious aurelius made a gentle remark ygerna lowered her eyes and laughed shaking her head in response gorlas placed his hand on his daughters shoulder and drew her forward a minute gesture imperceptible perhaps to anyone else but i saw it and read well its meaning whether he knew it or not i do not say that he did gorlas was offering his daughter to the high king and aurelius dear blind aurelius unaware of his brother accepted her with the whole of his heart he offered ygerna the cup and his fingers lingered at her hand ygerna glanced meekly at uther that look might have saved much but uther did not see it he stared ahead dumbly a man whose head has been severed from his body in a single stroke and knows for certain that he is dead and now must fall then aurelius bent near and whispered something to ygerna she smiled shyly and aurelius threw back his head and laughed this could not be endured uther turned on his heel and flew from them disappearing into the roister ygerna looked uncertainly after him her hand fluttered out to where he had been but uther was already gone and aurelius was speaking again and gorlas holding his cup high was beaming with delight i felt as if i had been kicked in the stomach by my horse as if the floor had become unsteady beneath my feet as if i had drunk a very powerful draught that confused the senses the room spun and all became sharp noise and sharper light pelleas was suddenly there beside me master what is wrong are you ill take me from here i whispered i cannot breathe a moment later we were standing outside in the crisp cold air my head cleared and sense returned but i was left with the sick feeling of deepest dread what had been lost more to the point what could be saved i marvelled at the speed with which it had happened how could i have foreseen it oh but i should have known i had been warned out on the road my danger sense had been aroused but i had not looked for the cause come to that i had been amply warned in celyddon nevertheless my only thought had been to get the crown securely on aurelius head i had looked no further than that it is strange that when a man spends all his time fighting one enemy he fails to recognize another greater foe i knew him now but it was too late the damage was done the saecsen battles of last summer would dim in mens memory before i finished righting the destruction of this night great light we are not equal to the fight pelleas held me by the arm laid and master are you well the concern hi his voice was like a slap what has happened i drew a deep unsteady breath the world has tilted from its course pelleas he stared not in disbelief but in sympathy what is to be done that i cannot say but we will be long repairing the breach i fear he turned his head and looked back into the feast hall where the high king stood with his lords gorlas and ygerna had moved away to find their places at the board the food was being served now and it would have been sweet delight to have forgotten if only for a moment that what happened had ever taken place but that is not how the world is made once spoken a word cannot be called back once loosed an arrow cannot return to the bow what happens for good or ill happens for ever and that is the way of it the feast proceeded but i had no appetite for it i left pelleas to watch for uther knowing he would not be found and slipped away to my room there was nothing to be done i did not sleep well and rose with a throbbing head and a bitter taste in my mouth the sun was rising on a grey rainswept day londinium lay strangely quiet most of its citizens must have found their rest but late and were still abed from the church nearby i heard the light tolling of a bell the brothers were telling prime and would soon be at prayer i rose threw my cloak over my shoulder and went down slipping through the silent house and across the wet yard to the church i pushed open the door and entered a number of monks were kneeling before the altar and i started towards them merlinus the whisper echoed in the room several of the monks turned round to look at me i stopped and urbanus hurried forward his sandals slapping the stones at his feet i did not think to find you here i was about to send for you i heard the note of strain in his voice i am here what is it it is dafyd he said come with me i will take you to him urbanus led me out across the inner court to the cells monks had gathered outside one of the doors they parted when we came up and urbanus ushered me into the room dafyd lay on a pallet of fresh straw in a room illumined by a candle tree brought from the altar he smiled as i came in and lifted a hand in greeting gwythelyn was with him kneeling beside him praying he turned to me and i understood from his grave expression that dafyd was dying ah myrddin you have come that is good i hoped to see you here i sank down beside gwythelyn my heart a bruise in my chest dafyd i i began and faltered where were the words shhh dafyd hushed me it was in my mind to thank you thank me i shook my head for letting me see the future lad we were once again master and pupil in his mind ending as we had begun i had a dream last night wondrous and terrible i saw aurelius striving mightily against a black and raging storm he was beaten down and his cloak torn in rags from his shoulders but when it seemed that he must be ground into the dust his hand closed upon a sword he grasped it and it was his strength up he rose holding the sword before him oh the lightning flashed and the thunder rent the heavens but aurelius i knew him for i saw his golden tore shining at his throat raised his great sword and would not be moved truly it is a dream of great significance i told him taking his hand oh aye dafyds eyes shone with the wonder of it he bore no pain and rested comfortably but i could feel his life slipping away from him it was a fine kingmaking was it not i would not like to have missed it rest you now urged gwythelyn fingering a small wooden cross son dafyd replied lightly i have rested and soon must begin my journey hence have no fear for me neither grieve for i go to join my lord and take my place in his retinue look here is michael himself come to escort me he pointed towards the door i saw no one but did not doubt him his face shone with the light of his vision tears started into my eyes i raised his hand to my lips and kissed it farewell dafyd most noble friend greet ganieda for me and taliesin that i will do he replied his voice a whisper between his teeth farewell myrddin bach farewell gwythelyn he raised an admonitory hand to us saying grow strong in faith and mighty in love my friends be bold in goodness for the angels stand ready to aid you farewell the smile lingered on his face even as his spirit departed he died as he had lived peacefully gently lovingly my heart split in two and i cried not for grief but because a great soul had gone out of the world and men would know it no more gwythelyn bent his head and prayed quietly then took dafyds hands and folded them upon his still breast i will take him home now he said he wished to be buried beside his church that would be best i replied you bear no blame in this myrddin gwythelyn said unexpectedly i looked up it was his desire to come here he told me last night that crowning aurelius was one of the chief acts of his life he was glad you asked him to do it i gazed at dafyds face which seemed now to have taken on something of its former youthful appearance and i remembered when he had held the crown above my head there were few alive who would remember that except perhaps as a tale told by a grandfather to his grandchildren but remembering i bent and kissed dafyds cheek farewell good friend i murmured then rose abruptly and left not for lack of feeling or respect but because dafyd had gone and i had seen him on his way and now i must be about this worlds affairs if i was to salvage anything from the ruin of last night eleven tell me what i could have done you who see all things so clearly tell me now i invite you give me your infallible counsel you who cover yourselves in everlasting ignorance and display it like a priceless cloak who embrace blindness and count it a virtue whose hearts quail with fear and call it prudence i ask you plainly what would you have done great light deliver me from the venom of smallsouled men the enemy is subtlety itself keen vigilant tireless and infinite in resource ah but evil ever overreaches itself and very great evil overreaches itself greatly and lord jesu high king of heaven bends all purposes to his own labouring through all things to turn all ends to the one that is worth remembering but in the thin grey light of that cheerless morning i despaired the small kings would soon hear of the rift between the brothers there are always those who will seize even the most unlikely weapons and use them most effectively and some of the lords needed little enough encouragement they would use ygerna as a wedge between aurelius and uther to divide them once divided they would rebel against aurelius and advance uther only to throw off uther as soon as aurelius was put down then the kingdom would split once more into a wild scattering of fractious warring selfobsessed clans and kingdoms and the island of the mighty would go down into the dark well aurelius loved ygerna and would have her knowing nothing of uthers love he wooed her with passion gorlas approved indeed he encouraged the match doing all he might to further it to have his daughter treasure that she was married to the high king increased his own status immeasurably in any event gorlas would never have assented to uther and uther too stubborn to utter a word of his desire to his brother and too proud to press his claim endured his agony in bitter silence so recognizing the hopelessness of uthers position i supported aurelius uther resented this but would say nothing directly he loved ygerna but he loved his brother more bound by three strong coils duty honour and blood he was forced to stand by and watch his brother steal the light from his life naturally no one thought to ask ygerna her thoughts on the matter she would obey her father in any event and it was abundantly clear where gorlas sentiments lay once he saw his opportunity he wasted not a moment in arranging the marriage accordingly aurelius and ygerna were betrothed and planned the celebration of their union at the feast of pentecost i will not tell of their wedding you can hear that tale from any of the itinerant harpers wandering the land much embroidered and exalted to be sure but that is how men wish to remember it in truth aurelius very nearly was not married at all he was busy in the months following his crowntaking organizing the kingdoms defences building and rebuilding in londinium and eboracum and elsewhere creating churches where there was need in all binding his lords to his kingship in a hundred different ways to lead the new churches he made new bishops and one to replace dafyd at llandaff he chose gwythelyn for that and rightly the others were dubricius at caer legionis and samson at eboracum good and holy men each one uther brooded and stormed through the wet end of winter and spring brought him no joy he grew gaunt and illtempered like a dog long chained and denied the comfort of his masters hearth he snarled at all who approached him and he drank too much seeking to numb his hearts wound with strong wine which only increased his misery a more doleful disagreeable man would be hard to imagine the attack on gorlas during the previous winter was not forgotten and with spring opening the land other attacks began taking place in the middle kingdoms and in the west it was soon learned that pascent vortigerns last living son was responsible inflamed by the notion of avenging the blood debt of his father he had sought and won the support of one guilomar a minor irish king ever eager to increase his fortunes through plunder evidently gorlas had surprised pascent on the road as the young man was making good his return to the island pascent waiting with his few followers for guilomars warband attacked out of fear lest his war be finished before it was begun aurelius deemed pascent no great threat save that the rebellious lords might find it in their interest to throw in with vortigerns son therefore the high king was anxious that pascent and guilomar be dealt with firmly and finally before anyone else could become involved so it was that spring found aurelius preparing for his wedding and for war the wedding could wait perhaps but the war could not this is where i made the decision which has earned me such scorn and contempt although at the time it was the only wise course in order to help ease uthers pain at his brother wedding the woman he loved i suggested to the high king that uther should lead the warband out to deal with pascent and guilomar aurelius much preoccupied with his various works readily agreed and gave the order saying go with him merlin for i worry after him he has become contrary and keeps to himself i fear these long months away from sword and saddle weigh too heavily on him and uther glad for any excuse to quit londinium where life had grown so distasteful to him became the image of a man afire after hasty preparations we left the city a few days before aurelius and ygernas wedding uther could not have endured that nor was he greatly cheered to have me with him although he was too proud to say as much he blamed me for not taking his part with ygerna forgetting that his lady had a father who would in no wise see his daughter married to him as long as gorlas lived aurelius was the only choice for his daughter men will tell you that the war with pascent was bloody and brief and that uther in his smouldering rage swept all before him i wish it had been like that deeply deeply i wish it in truth the campaign was a maddening chase across most of the kingdom for the simple fact that pascent would not fight instead the coward would strike any undefended holding or settlement farm plunder the stores and valuables and set fire to the buildings killing any brave enough to oppose him in this he was no better than the worst saecsen worse in fact for at least the barbarians do not slaughter their own kinsmen but as soon as uther appeared pascent vanished oh the rogue was shrewd and quite skilful in choosing his targets and evading confrontation time and again we glimpsed the black smudge of smoke on the horizon whipped our horses into a lather in our mad flight only to find the grain burned the blood soaking the ground and pascent long gone when we arrived spring passed and summer settled full on the land and still we chased no nearer to catching pascent than when we left londinium why do you sit there doing nothing the duke demanded of me one evening we had lost pascents trail yet again that day in the hills of gwynedd and uther was in a dangerous mood why do you refuse to help me an empty wineskin lay on the board next to his cup i have never refused you aid uther then where is this famed sight of yours he leapt to his feet and began stalking the tent beating the air with clenched fists where are your visions and voices now when we need them it is not so simple as you think the fire the water they reveal what they will like the bards awen the sight comes as it comes were you a true druid by the raven you would help me he cried i am not a druid nor have ever claimed to be bah not a druid not a bard not a king not this and not that well what are you merlin ambrosius i am a man and i will be treated so if i have been summoned to suffer your insults you must find someone else to abuse i rose to take my leave of him but he was far from finished i will tell you what you are you are whatever you want to be everything and nothing you come to us smooth as a serpent on a sunwarmed rock speaking your subtle words stealing aurelius from me turning him against me uther was shaking now he had worked himself up to it and gave vent to the fury pent inside him blaming me was easier than facing the true source of his misery i turned and walked from the tent but he followed me outside still shouting i tell you merlin i know you for what you are schemer deceiver manipulater false friend it was his anger speaking and i did not listen answer me why do you refuse to answer me he grabbed me roughly by the arm and pulled me round to face him ha you are afraid that is it i have spoken the truth and you are afraid of me now stinking sweat dripped from him and he swayed on his feet some of the warband standing near turned and gawked at us uther have a care i snapped you are embarrassing yourself before your men i am exposing a fool he gloated his grin was grotesque please uther say no more the only fool you have exposed is yourself go back into your tent and go to sleep i made to turn away again but he held me fast i defy you he screamed his face darkening in drunken rage i defy you to prove yourself before us all give me a prophecy i glowered hard at him were he and i alone i might have ignored him or found a way to calm him but not with his men looking on and not his alone for since we were in gwynedd ceredigawn had supplied men too uther had forced the matter too far to abandon it was a matter of honour to him now very well uther i answered loud enough for all to hear i will do as you demand he smiled in stupid triumph i will do it i continued but i will not answer for the consequence for good or ill the responsibility is yours i said this not because i feared what might happen and wished to evade the consequence but because i wanted uther to know that it was not childs play or a trick to impress the ignorant what do you mean he demanded suspicion flattening his tone i answered directly it is not like deciphering scribbles from a book it is a strange and unsettling thing fraught with many dangers and uncertainties i do not control it any more than you control the wind that blows through your hair or the flames of your fire if you are trying to warn me off save your breath some of the men voiced agreement they did not like to see their lord bested in anything what i do will be done in the sight of all so that you all may know the truth i told them you there i pointed to the men close to the fire stir up the flames put on more logs i want live embers not cold ash this was not strictly necessary i suppose but i wanted time to compose myself and allow uthers temper to cool in any event it worked for uther shouted well you heard him do as he says and be quick about it while the men heaped oak branches onto the fire i went to my tent to get my cloak and staff neither were these necessary but it would make a better show i thought and impress those looking on with the seriousness of what i did the art should never appear too easy or people will not respect it pelleas did not like what was happening lord what will you do i will do what uther has asked me to do but lord myrddin he must learn i snapped then softened you are right to be concerned pelleas pray my friend pray that we do not loose on the world a danger greater than we can safely contain a steward came to me a little while later saying that the fire was ready i wrapped myself in my cloak and took up my staff pelleas praying silently rose solemnly to his feet and joined me night was full upon the land when we emerged from the tent we walked to the fire which had burned down to a heap of fireshot coals whitehot with crimson and orange flames as good a bed for birthing the future as any the moon shone pale its light tangled in the branches of trees whose trunks blushed red in the fireglow the warband had assembled and stood round the pit eyes glittering silent now that i was come almost reverent uther had moved his camp chair outside and sat before his tent the image of a homeless long holding court in the wilderness he drew breath to speak when he saw me but thought better of it and closed his mouth again and merely nodded towards the firepit as if to say there it is do your work i had half hoped he might have cooled to the idea and would release me from my promise but having fastened onto a thing uther was not a man to let go easily come what may he would see it through so gathering my cloak about me i began walking in sunwise circles around the fire holding my staff high in the old tongue the secret tongue of the learned brotherhood i uttered the ancient words of power that would part the veil between this world and the otherworld at the same time i prayed lord jesu to give me wisdom to discern aright the things i saw i stopped walking and turned to the fire opening my eyes to search among the glowing coals i saw the heat shimmer the deep hot crimson the images a woman standing on the wall of a fortress on a high promontory her hair flying in auburn streams as the wind lifts her unbound tresses and gulls flying shrieking above her while the sea beats restlessly below a milkwhite horse cantering along a river ford riderless the highbacked heavy saddle empty the reins dangling dangling yellow clouds lowering over a dusky hillside where a warhost lies slaughtered spears bristling like a grove of young ash trees while ravens gorge on the meat of dead men a bride weeping in a shadowed place alone bishops and holy men bound in fetters of iron and marched through the ruins of a desolated city a huge man sitting in a small boat on a reedfringed lake the sun glinting in his golden hair eyes lightly closed his empty hands folded upon his knees a saecsen war axe hacking at the roots of an ancient oak men with torches bearing a burden up a hill to a great burial mound set within an enormous stone circle black hounds baying at a white winter moon starving wolves tearing one of their own to pieces in the snow a man in a monks woollen tunic skulking along a deserted street glancing backward over his shoulder sweating with fear his hands clutching a vial such as priests carry for anointing the cross ofchristus burning above a bloodspattered altar a babe lying in the long grass of a hidden forest glade crying lustily a red serpent coiled about his tiny arm the images spun so fast as to become confused and disjointed i closed my eyes and raised my head i had seen nothing of pascent nor anything that would help uther directly nevertheless when i opened my eyes again i saw a strange thing a newborn star brighter than any of its brothers shining like a heavenly beacon high in the western sky in the same moment my awen descended over me behold uther i cried my voice loud with authority look you to the west and see a marvel a newmade star flares in gods heaven tonight the herald of tidings both dire and wonderful pay heed if you would learn what is to befall this realm men exclaimed around me as they found the star some prayed others cursed and made the sign against evil but i watched only the star gathering brightness growing soon shining as if to rival the sun itself it cast shadows upon the land and its rays stretched forth to the east and the west and it seemed to me that it was the fiery maw of a fierce invincible dragon uther stood up from his chair his face bathed in the unnatural light merlin he shouted what is this what does it mean at his words my body began to tremble and shake i staggered dizzily and leaned on my staff overswept by a sudden onrushing of sorrow which pierced me to the heart for i understood the meaning of the things i had seen great light why i cried aloud why am i born to such sorrow so saying i sank to my knees and wept uther came and knelt beside me he put his hand on my shoulder and whispered softly merlin merlin what has happened what have you seen tell me i will bear it when at last i could speak i raised my head and peered into his anxious face uther are you there uther prepare yourself i sobbed woe and grief to us all your brother is dead this revelation caused a sensation men cried out in disbelief and anguish aurelius dead impossible did you hear what he said what the high king dead how uther stared in astonished disbelief it cannot be do you hear merlin it cannot be he turned his gaze to the star there must be some other meaning look again and tell me i shook my head great is the grief in this land tonight and for many nights to come aurelius has been killed by vortigerns son while we chased pascent throughout the realm he has dealt in treachery sending a kinsman to murder the high king in his own chamber with poison uther groaned and fell forward stretching himself full length upon the ground there he wept without shame like an orphaned child the warband looked on tears shining in more than one pair of eyes for there was not a man among them who would not have gladly traded me for life with his beloved aurelie when at last uther raised himself up i said there is more uther that is betokened you are a warrior without peer in all this land in seven days time you will be made king and great shall be your renown among the people of britain you will reign in all strength and authority uther nodded unhappily not much consoled by these words this also i have seen the star that shines with the fire of a dragon is you uther and the beam cast out from its mouth is a son born of your noble lineage a mighty prince who will be king after you a greater king will never be known in the island of the mighty until the day of judgement therefore arm the warband at once and march boldly with the star to light your path for at sunrise tomorrow in the place where three hills meet you shall put an end to pascent and guilomar then let you return to londinium there to take up the crown of your dead brother finished my awen left me and i slumped back suddenly weak with exhaustion sleep rolled in dark waves over me drowning all senses pelleas lifted me to my feet and guided me to my tent where i fell asleep at once well it was a night for dreams though my body slumbered my mind was filled with restless images that fought in my fevered brain i remember i saw much of blood and fire and men whose lives in this worldsrealm had not yet begun i saw the swarming darkness massing for war and the land trembling under a vast impenetrable shadow i saw children growing up who had never known a days peace i saw women whose wombs were barren from fear and men who knew no craft or trade but battle i saw ships fleeing the shores of britain and others hastening towards the island of the mighty i saw disease and death and kingdoms wasted by war and dread of all dreads i saw morgian she who i most feared to see in the flesh met me in a dream and though it chills the marrow in my bones to tell it she appeared most happy to see me she welcomed me as if i were a traveller come to her door saying ah merlin lord of the fair folk maker of kings i am glad to see you i was beginning to think you had died she was formidable she was beautiful as dawn and deadly as venom morgian was hate in human form but she was not human any more the last of her humanity she had given over to the enemy in exchange for power and she was powerful beyond imagining but even her power did not extend to harming men through their dreams she might frighten she might insinuate she might persuade but she could not destroy why do you not speak my love does fear bind your tongue in my dream i answered forthrightly you are right when you speak of fear morgian for i do fear you full well but i know your weakness and i have learned the strength of the lord i serve i will live to see you destroyed she laughed charmingly and darkness leapt up around her dear nephew what must you think of me have i ever done you harm come you have no reason to speak so to me but as you profess an interest in the future i would speak to you we have nothing to say to one another nevertheless i will speak and you will listen your unreasoning hatred of the old way of your own past cannot continue it will not be tolerated merlin if you persist you will be sacrificed and that would be such sorrow to me who has told you to tell me this i already knew but i wanted her to say fear not him who has the power to destroy the body rather fear him with the power to destroy the soul is that not what poor blind dafyd taught name your lord morgian i challenged her you have had your warning if not for me you would have been killed long ago but i interceded for you see you owe me a debt merlin do you understand when next we meet i will be repaid oh you shall indeed have your reward princess of lies i told her boldly much more boldly than i felt now get you away from me she did not laugh this time but her icy smile could have stopped the warm heart beating in the breast farewell merlin i will wait for you in the otherworld while i slept uther heeded the counsel i had given him he ordered the warband to be armed and when the horses were saddled they made their way to the place i had indicated penmachno a high valley formed by the convergence of three hills well known from ancient times as a gatheringplace they travelled all night the strange star lighting their way and arrived at penmachno as a sullen dawn coloured the sky in the east there just as i had said lay pascent and guilomar encamped at the sight of the elusive foe all fatigue left the warriors and lashing their horses to speed they fell like silent death upon the unsuspecting enemy the battle proved a bloody and brutal affair guilomar naked from his bed led his warriors to the fight and was run through by the very first spear thrust seeing their king fall in the foremost rank the irish voiced a great shout of anguish and determined to avenge their chieftain pascent on the other hand had not the stomach for a fair fight and immediately sought how best to make his escape he pulled an old cloak over himself caught the reins of a horse and galloped from the battlefield uther saw him seeing and gave chase crying stay pascent we have a debt to settle uther caught the coward and struck him with the flat of his sword pascent fell from the saddle and sprawled on his back on the ground squealing with fear and pleading for his life as you would have your fathers portion uther said dismounting his sword lowered come i will give you your desire with that he thrust the sword through pascents mouth so that the point went deep into the earth pascent died writhing like a snake there dwell you now with guilomar your trusted companion and possess the land together leaderless and unmanned the irish made a poor fight as uthers warriors frustrated by the long and futile campaign exacted revenge for their dead countrymen the fight was over by the time pelleas and i reached the battlefield we sat our horses in a yellow dawn on the crest of one of the hills overlooking penmachno and saw what i had foreseen in the embers warriors lying dead upon a hillside thick with spears like an ash grove carrion birds croaked nocking to their morbid feast their gleaming black beaks worrying the flesh from the corpses in bloody strips uther allowed the warband to plunder the irish camp and then remounted them and turned back towards londinium five days later we were met on the road by some of lord morcants chieftains hail uther they called as they joined us we bear grievous tidings from governor melatus the high king is dead of poison by one called appas a kinsman of vortigern uther nodded his mouth tight and glanced at me how was this accomplished by stealth and trickery lord the foremost rider answered bitterly the craven clothed himself after one of urbanus kind and gained aurelius confidence thus he won his way to the high kings chamber and gave him to drink of a draught he had made to celebrate the kings wedding he said the rider paused distaste twisting his mouth the high king drank and slept he awoke in the night screaming with the fever and died before morning what of ygerna asked uther his voice betraying no emotion did she drink as well no lord the queen had returned with her father to tintagel for her dower and was to join the king at uintan caestir uther appeared thoughtful what of this appas he could not be found in the governors palace nor was he to be found in all the city lord yet i say that he will be found uttered uther softly the cold menace in his voice cut like a blade of ice all gods bear witness on the day that he is discovered he shall share in his friends reward which he has won by his own hand then he straightened in his saddle and asked aloud where have they laid my brother by his own wish and by urbanus order the high king has been buried at the place of the hanging stones called the giants ring the rider hesitated then said it was also his wish that you hold the realm after him very well we will turn aside there and pay him honour replied uther simply then let us ride to caer uintan where i will have my kingmaking i tell you the truth londinium has grown abhorrent to me and i will never again enter that odious city while i draw breath that was one vow uther held all his remaining days twelve when the falsehearted lord dunaut heard of aurelius death he called his advisers together and rode to lord gorlas holding in tintagel to discuss how they might best profit by this sudden and unexpected turn of events he also sent word to coledac morcant and ceredigawn to join them it did not take the sight to see what they intended to his credit gorlas although he welcomed dunaut and extended the hospitality of hall and hearth to him refused to participate in any talk of rebellion even later when coledac and morcant arrived gorlas kept faith with aurelius out of respect for the high kingship and for his daughters sake but aurelius is dead dunaut argued your oath returns now to you and until you give it again you are free you yourself might be high king put in coledac believing no such thing then you would not be breaking faith at all i have more honour than that protested gorlas yours is a trick of words and has no substance it makes no sense to me morcant complained you speak of honour and trickery in the same breath as if we had no thought at all for the good of the realm we need a strong king to hold the land aurelius is gone and since from death there is no return we must do what we can to honour him by keeping the peace of this land i will honour him by keeping my oath gorlas would not be moved although he loved aurelius and wished with all his heart to honour him he loved his daughter most dearly and in the end it was his love for ygerna that proved his undoing uther of course could not abide this insult to his kingship and it angered him that he was not unanimously acclaimed as high king all the more since before his death aurelius had ordained that uther should follow him and complete the good works he had begun also he loathed the prospect of having to fight old battles over again battles he had himself won the first time nor was that all that laboured in uthers heart to be sure therefore when ceredigawn whose lands uther had saved by vanquishing pascent and guilomar sent word that the kings were meeting in secret in gorlas rockbound stronghold in the west country uther delayed not a moment but gathered such warriors as he commanded and any who could be summoned at once and off they rode to tintagel it was high summer with days bright as newburnished blades and nights mellow as honeyed mead and our work finished pelleas and i had returned to ynys avallach my pact had been with aurelius not with uther and despite all i had done for him uther made it abundantly clear to me after his crowning that he did not require my services as counsellor so be it in truth i was glad for a rest thus knowledge of the events at tintagel reached me slowly and very late by then the deeds were accomplished and the seeds well and truly sown it is a curious thing i am thinking that i who have so often stood at the centre of worldshaping events i could not prevent should so often be absent from those i could have done something about when i think of the wounds i could have prevented the bloodshed i could have saved well it makes my heart ache great light you do not make it easy on a man yet i sojourned with the fair folk a goodly while and allowed the serenity of avallachs excellent isle to mend my troubled spirit i had nursed such hopes for aurelius he possessed such high promise his death could not be lightly borne still i remembered the prophecy given me which i had spoken to uther that a son of his noble line should be born who would surpass even aurelius in this i took comfort though i little knew or guessed how or when this should come about as i have said the illumining spirit like the wind goes where it will and sheds a light that alltoooften obscures as much as it reveals charis was pleased to have me with her again she had learned to treasure our times together she always did that yes without yearning for them to be something more there is a love which suffocates just as there is a love which quenches the same that gives it light and life these loves are false and charis had long ago learned the difference between false love and true she now spent her days in healing works she had learned much of medicines and their properties and how to cure various wounds and diseases she traded knowledge with the monks of the holy shrine as well as with those of the hill folk she came in rare contact with and practised her art at the nearby monastery where those suffering from illness or hurt came seeking aid we spent many happy days together and i would have remained content on the tor indefinitely if not for uthers urgent summons two riders appeared one evening looking for me at the church below the hill shrine the monks told them where to find me and although the sky still held daylight enough they waited until the next day to come fearing to approach the tor after sunset but when the sun rose again the next morning they crossed the causeway and climbed the tor to avallachs palace we have come searching for the emrys they announced after being admitted to the courtyard and you have found him i answered what do you want with me we are from the high king and bring our lords greetings answered the messenger with rough courtesy he bids you to join him at gorlas stronghold at tintagel we are sworn to take you there what if i choose not to go with you i did not know these men and they obviously did not know me the man did not hesitate then we are instructed to bind you hand and foot and drag you there that was uther rope and knot do you think i laughed that anyone could take me anywhere i did not wish to go this worried them the two men glanced at one another nervously the pendragon says began the first pendragon i mused chief dragon is that what uther calls himself now yes lord ever since the night of the dragon star when he became king the man answered so uther you did heed me after all yes it was fitting for him uther pendragon well and good my difficult friend what else did you learn that night the two were peering round anxiously come break your fast with me i offered and you can tell me more of your errand the messengers eyed me suspiciously you fear for nothing i scolded them be gracious enough to accept hospitality when it is offered you well we are hungry admitted one of the men then come and eat i turned and they followed me reluctantly into the hall fair folk always amaze other races which has its uses why does he seek me i asked as we ate bread and cheese together we do not know lord you must know something of your lords affairs why did he send you we were only told to find you there are many others searching as well the man answered as if this proved the truth of his words i looked at the other rider who had not spoken what do you know of this tell me quickly for i will not go with you unless i have some better reason to do so than i have heard yet speak uther requires your aid with his marriage the man blurted out surprising himself completely it was a secret he had not meant to tell ygerna of course but what was i to do ygerna was free to marry and uther did not need my approval yet uther would not have sent for me if he did not badly need my help of that i could be certain what is the trouble i asked my abashed accomplice go on tell me no harm will come of telling though some may if you withhold it is gorlas and the others dunaut morcant and coledac they are holding vigil at tintagel uther surprised them there and challenged them between them there was only gorlas warband and a few others to fight uther would be to invite slaughter upon themselves so they refused they wait up there in gorlas stronghold put in the other messenger now that the stream had begun to trickle it might as well be a flood uther cannot go in to them and they will not come out i understood uther had indeed surprised the kings he had ridden hard and arrived while they were still plotting their treason since they had not planned on an attack the kings had brought only an escort and were caught without men and weapons enough to oppose uther outright this unwelcome circumstance placed gorlas in an impossible position a man of gorlas stamp would not turn traitor on his friends by helping uther and in any event no force on earth would cause that stubborn west country chieftain to bring dishonour to his own name by withdrawing the hospitality he had extended at the same time however protecting the rebel lords meant defying the high king who owned his oath of fealty i could well imagine gorlas must be writhing with the pain of his predicament and uther growing more furious with each passing moment would hold gorlas to blame yet uther was prevented from storming the gates what held him back ygerna his lady love was also shut up in the caer he could not bring himself to make war on his future brides father and risk losing her affection nor could he withdraw and leave the traitors to go free so in his dilemma not knowing anything else to do he summoned me well uther my headstrong young prince so hottempered they do well to call you chief dragon i suppose i should have felt vindicated somehow knowing that uther could not do without me in truth i just felt tired for it seemed to me that all my work with aurelius had been wasted and that time spent helping uther would come to naught as well uther i had long ago decided was not what i needed in a high king certainly he was not the ruler to help bring the kingdom of summer into existence for that i must look elsewhere be that as it may he was the high king and despite what powermad petty potentates like dunaut and morcant might think if it ever occurred to them to do so uther was neither stupid nor inept he possessed a keen military mind and knew how to command men this britain desperately needed at the very least he should have been accorded the dignity of his rank consequently i foresaw a messy end to this affair i must of course side with uther of that there was never a moments doubt still i would go and see what might be done to save whatever might be saved though i did not think much of my chances pelleas was even more dubious than i why not let uther tear them to little pieces and be done with it he asked as we made our way hastily to tintagel neither was there any doubt in his mind who would emerge victorious it seems dunaut and his friends have brought this on themselves let them pay for their treachery you are forgetting ygerna i replied i am certain that uther is not no uther was not forgetting ygerna indeed he was thinking of very little else by the time we joined him encamped in the narrow cleft of valley below gorlas stronghold uther wore a scowl that would have cowed snarling dogs his advisers and chieftains stood off away from him no one dared come near for fear of a lashing or worse at my appearance a murmur of excitement fluttered among the warriors who bored with the stalemate and fearful of their lords displeasure viewed my arrival with some relief something will be done now the whispers said merlin is here the enchanter is come oh yes it would take strong enchantment to save this situation it would take a miracle i am here uther i announced myself as his steward feared going in to him he sat listlessly in his camp chair in the tent unshaven his red hair wild on his head he raised his eyes it took you long enough he snarled come to gnaw at the carcass i ignored the compliment and poured myself some wine from the jar into the lungs cup what is the trouble what is it not he countered sullenly if you want my help you must tell me now i have ridden far in great haste to be here but i will leave just as quickly if you do not sit up and speak to me as a man my loyal lords he up there he gestured impatiently in the direction of the caer plotting my destruction is that trouble enough for you yes but i would have thought you most able to deal with that kind of trouble uther yet you sit here in the dark moaning and whimpering like a maid who has lost her best bobble oh aye rub salt in the wound get you gone if this is the help you bring he leapt from his chair as if it had suddenly become too hot to sit in any longer by the raven you are no better than that pack of yapping hounds out there go and join them shall i throw you all a bone this is not worthy of you uther i told him flatly you still have not told me what ails you he turned a dogbitten bear finally at bay i cannot attack the caer with ygerna inside at the saying of her name his aspect changed and my purpose was fulfilled no longer surly and unreasoning uther spread his hands and smiled ruefully now you know meddler so tell me what am i to do what can i say to you that your advisers have not already said he rolled his eyes and puffed out his cheeks please your mood has blinded you uther or you would see your way clearly he made no reply but stood with his head down and his hands hanging at his sides oh for the light of lieu i sputtered you are not the first man to love a woman stop behaving like a wounded bear and let us discover what might be done we cannot attack the caer he sighed then added more forcefully eyeing me peculiarly at least not while she is there no i replied shaking my head do not think it rut you merlin you could go up there gorlas would let you in you could see her you could get her out perhaps i could but what then i would clean out that vipers nest once and for all a bold plan uther and do you think she would so easily marry the man who murdered her father murder that is how she would see it but but they are traitors not in her eyes there you see it is hopeless he smashed his fist against the board any way i turn i am undone retreat then anger sprang up in his eyes never i turned and strode from the tent he followed me a few moments later and came to join me where i stood on a rock mound looking up at the black gleaming stone walls of gorlas fortress it was an impressive structure and probably impenetrable for it squatted on a great high jutting headland crag thrust out into the sea the headland was joined to the main by the narrowest causeway which ran through a single easily defended gate the only landward entrance i do not mean run from the field but remove yourself from this place i said softly to what purpose you can do nothing as long as you remain here just as they can do nothing against you i lifted a hand towards the fortress black and immense above us in the game of chess this is called stalemate and no one can win in such a position therefore since they cannot move you must i will not he growled through clenched teeth by all the gods of heaven and earth i will not swear no oaths uther until you have heard all he let aii hiss through his teeth oh do go on then i do not suggest you drag yourself back to caer uintan just behind the line of hills to the east will suffice then wait there while i go and speak to them he considered this and nodded very well now what terms will you offer terms he rubbed his jaw i have given no thought to terms well which do you desire more their lives or their loyalty the high king hesitated then showed what he was made of their loyalty if that is possible after this it is possible if you will allow it allow it i will welcome it then i will see if they will listen to reason by the god you pray to merlin if you can secure their loyalty without undue bloodshed and save ygerna i will give you anything you ask even to the half of my kingdom i shrugged never have i asked anything for myself nor will i as i spoke i saw a vision gorlas lying dead on a hillside his blood blackening the soil and i heard as from the otherworld the cry of a babe amidst the howl of wolves on a cold winters night my heart felt heavy in my chest and i tasted salt and sour sweat on my tongue words came to my tongue unbidden yet my service exacts a price one day soon i will demand my reward and bitter will be the granting let this be your comfort what i shall demand will be for the good of britain remember that in the day of reckoning uther pendragon and refuse me at your peril uther stared but accepted my pronouncement let it be as you say merlin i am content do what you will although it was late in the day orders were given to strike camp and depart i knew this activity would draw the attention of those in the caer so pelleas and i climbed into a coracle and paddled round the headland to see if there was another way into the fortress there was of course as i knew there must be but it could be used only at low tide for only when the water was low could a boat be landed on the hard shingle below the fortress any other time the tunnel mouth was flooded and the waves thrashing around the tumbled rocks were too dangerous to navigate unless i wished to make entrance in the dead of night the mainland causeway remained my best choice i held no great hope that gorlas would welcome me as a brother but he would receive me and bear my presence for at least as long as it took me to say what was in my mind he respected me that much i considered he owed me that much for that day on the battlefield when we had fought hengist together by dusk uther had decamped and withdrawn beyond the hills pelleas and i our survey of the headland completed mounted our ponies and made our way up the narrow slatepaved spine of a causeway to the great dome of rock upon which gorlas had built his caer the sea washed ceaselessly on one side and a freshet tumbled noisily on the other a sheer drop to a sudden and certain death on either hand we waited outside the timber gate while the guards fetched their lord who appeared in a moment as i said they had been watching what do you here emrys gorlas demanded the question was a challenge i have come to speak to you gorlas i have no business with uther perhaps not i allowed but he has business with you or more precisely those who shelter beneath your roof and claim your hospitality what of that the cornovii chieftain sneered i withhold hospitality from no man who asks it those you seek are welcome here as long as they care to stay if that is the way of it i replied easily then i claim the same hospitality for myself and my steward it is getting dark and night is upon us we have nowhere else to go to be trapped with his own words made gorlas furious that it was so easily done did not improve his disposition i began to think he would not let us in after all but honour went deep in gorlas and he relented in spite of himself he unbarred the gate and opened it himself his face frozen in a grimace of mingled rage and humiliation enter my friends he muttered through clenched teeth each word a curse you are welcome here our thanks to you gorlas i replied sincerely leading my pony through the gate you do yourself no wrong that remains to be seen he huffed and impatiently ordered the gate closed lest uther himself appear to claim hospitality from him tintagels rock formed a mighty foundation for a sprawling fortress of timber and stone more stone than timber since the black rock of the region lay ready to hand and the timber must be cut and dragged in from forests a fair distance away this gave the place a cold harsh appearance the solid house of a hard man unused to small comforts strong of will and principle and slow to bend tintagel could be a sanctuary or a prison its gate keeping in as easily as keeping out i wondered if uther understood this the higharched hall rose from the centre of an aimless scattering of smaller buildings cook houses granaries larders and hoardings of various types smaller sleeping quarters and round houses of stone between these buildings a narrow paving of dressed and channelled stone had been put down so that in wet weather which so close to the sea was continual men and beasts need not flounder in fields of mud in all tintagel proved a simple yet impressive fortress a fitting seat of power for the king of the cornovii nor was i the first to think so for the settlement had been occupied for many generations and i had no doubt would continue to serve for many many more supper will be laid soon gorlas came puffing up the track behind us as we dismounted your horses will be cared for he led us into a hall bright with torchlight and a huge fire on the hearth dogs and children played in the corners and a cluster of women occupied the far end of the hall talking quietly heads together i did not see ygerna among them morcant dunaut and coledac and their retinues lolled carelessly at gorlas board heads turned as we entered and laughter ceased then morcant was on his feet look you my friends here is that craven uthers lap dog well merlin embries have you come to sniff after us and run back to your master with the tale the insult is beneath you lord morcant i require no respect from you but at least do not endanger yourself further by speaking ill of the high king high king sneered morcant high coward more like dunaut and coledac laughed loudly at this you call him coward because he ignores your treason and extends his hands in friendship extends his hands in fright snorted coledac who convulsed himself with laughter gorlas embarrassed by his guests rudeness called loudly for the supper to be brought servants scurried at his sharp command and in a few moments baskets and platters of food appeared the three lords had been guzzling gorlas mead and were not inclined to stop no doubt their relief at uthers withdrawal from the field had put them in a celebratory mood and drink had made them bold but it was a fools courage that abetted them there will be trouble pelleas warned as we took our places at the board drink will make them surly and they will pick a fight if it comes to that we will not disappoint them i replied they must learn respect for their king now is as good a time as any for the teaching i believe i could think of a better time pelleas scanned the hall mostly filled now with the lords escorts each with a knife in his belt and a sword on his hip if they begin i do not think even gorlas could stop it the meal proceeded uneventfully the three having turned to their meat promptly forgot about us we ate in peace and were nearly finished when the hide that covered the inner entrance to the hall was pulled aside and ygerna entered with a few of her women she did not look at us in fact kept her eyes averted although she must have known we were there i think she did not wish to notice me for fear that her secret might be betrayed but to me her distraction spoke with some force my heart went out to her such a lovely young woman a bride still really i could not see her as a widow though widow she was she carried her nobility in every line of her slender form how rough gorlas came by a daughter so refined and regal was a mystery the meal concluded and gorlas keen to avoid trouble called for his harper an old man stumbled forward with a wellworn harp and proceeded to sing a long allbutunintelligible song about the change of seasons or some such thing i pitied him more i pitied his listeners who likely had never heard a true bard and never would at his lords bidding the singer began another song and as all attention was on him i made opportunity to speak to ygerna she was abashed that i should approach her but thinking quickly she jumped up and pulled me to a shadowed corner please lord emrys she cautioned if my father he will not see us here i reassured her then asked why do you fear him she bit her lower lip and lowered her head shyly an utterly feminine gesture of uncertainty and innocence i loved her for it remembering another girl long ago no no she began hesitated then said but he watches me so closely please i cannot say more you were a married woman i reminded her you need remain under your fathers roof no longer the high king is dead where would i go she spoke without guile and without sorrow she did not grieve for aurelius nor did she pretend to she had not loved him in truth she hardly knew him she had married him only to please her father there is one i am thinking who might be persuaded to take you in she knew well enough who i meant for she had been thinking of it too often and with great anxiety oh but i dare not she gasped why my father would never allow it now please i must go but she made no move to leave instead she turned her eyes to where her father sat with the other lords listening to the harper drone on if you were to leave here freely would you go to uther i asked it bluntly for i had to know and time grew short she dropped her head once more then looking up shyly murmured if he would have me would and will i replied i know that he would have laid fire to the gates long before now if it were not for you ygerna she said nothing but nodded slightly so you already guessed as much very well i will see what may be done if i come for you will you go with me her eyes went wide but she answered with a steady voice if it must be done that way yes i will go with you good then gather your things and wait pelleas or i will come for you tonight she cast a quick backward glance over the hall as one looking her last upon a place that held only unhappy memories then placing a hand on my sleeve she squeezed my arm and quickly disappeared into the shadows why did i do this why was it so important to bring uther and ygerna together perhaps it was for uthers sake to redress the wrong he had suffered in any event it was clear he could not be king without her perhaps it was for ygerna she looked so unhappy in that cold place perhaps it was the lords spirit working to redeem the time to tell the truth i cannot say but that night i acted as events led me it happens like this sometimes and all the plans all the reasons all desires and possibilities fade to nothing and all that remains is the single unwilled act what have i done i wondered aghast as i crept back unnoticed to my place what has been done through me still even now i wonder thirteen in the time between times when the world awaits the renewing light of day a life is sometimes required for a life this is what the wise men of the oak the druids of another age believed and taught i am not persuaded that they were wrong ygerna led me down through the secret passage to the rock shingle below tintagel on the sea side well she knew the way she had often sought sanctuary on the brittle little beach out of her fathers sight lightning flickered out to sea and thunder grumbled far off the wind blew wild whipping the water and we listened to the hollow drum of the waves breaking against the stone roots of the headland as we descended the narrow steps made treacherous with sea spray one misstep and we would have plummeted to our graves there is a cave in the rock beneath the caer she told me her words torn from her lips by the wind as she spoke them we can wait there until the boat comes it will not be dry i fear we will not have long to wait i reassured her peering into the moaning darkness wind and water everything was slippery wet windflung foam spattered our faces and fouled our cloaks the moon had set and it was the darkest part of the night the few stars that shone through the flying tatters of cloud gave but fitful light and that dim it was a stupid plan and i berated myself for suggesting it however and this you must understand when the unseen hand leads you in its grasp you follow or turn back and live in eternal regret of course there is no certainty in following either that is what makes faith follow or turn back there is no middle way that night i chose to follow it was my decision i chose freely and i bear responsibility for the consequences that is the price of freedom oh but i felt alive that tempesttossed night with the rumble of waves and thunder in my ears the sting of salt in my eyes and the smell of moss and wet rock in my nostrils and that warm trusting girl by my side i was alive and i gloried in the living ygerna showed surprising strength she was borne up by love i do not know precisely what she felt or whether she understood all that her decision meant she was going to meet her lover thats all she knew she trusted me for the rest and i trusted pelleas our lives were in his hands he must reach the place where we had left the boat and then bring it round the headland to the shore where we waited before the tide came in again drowning the shingle and filling the cave so we waited shivering with clammy cold hardly daring to think what we were doing we waited not knowing if pelleas had even found his way free of the caer it was a frail enough ruse to be committing our lives to he was to leave the hall unobserved and tell the gateman that i required an important token from uther which he had been sent to fetch once outside the walls he was to make his way with all haste to the boat and come round in a sour wind and heavy seas to rescue us from the rising water i have thought many and many a time what i might have done had i stayed at tintagel and seen my task through how might things have turned out differently as it happens i do not now believe i could have accomplished what i came there to do although i did believe it then for i considered most men reasonable hi the face of reason this i have learned since is pure folly unreasonable men are ever unreasonable and only become more so when threatened truth always threatens the falsehearted the contrary kings wanted no reconciliation they would have denied their misdeeds and resisted all attempts to forge a lasting peace they would have reviled any offer of clemency they would have despised appeasement as weakness well and there would have been a fight after all many good men would have been killed and that is a fact but perhaps gorlas would still be alive how ironic that the one who above all things tried to remain loyal to the high king should suffer for the disloyalty of others yet gorlas chose his own course as every man must no one pressed the sword into his hand my thoughts i see are as confused as the events of that wild night let me make some order i will say it thus ygerna and i waited on the shingle for pelleas gorlas discovered his daughters absence then mine and enraged alerted his warband and flew out of the caer in pursuit outracing his escort he saw a light on a hill and made for it thinking he had found me he attacked in fact he encountered two of uthers sentries swords crossed gorlas fell before his men could reach him that is what happened there is no glory in it because there is no dignity in killing insane waste as dawn coloured the slatedark sky in the east pelleas appeared and none too soon for the seawater seethed around our shins and we clung to one another shivering ygerna and i clambered into the boat and pelleas praying our forgiveness pulled on the oars and took us out to sea and away from the rocks all of us were too exhausted to speak and too discouraged our plan splendid as a dream in the night showed itself a tawdry contemptible thing in the ragged light of day i was disgusted with myself for my part and yet and yet in the time between times when the world awaits the renewing light of day a life is sometimes required for a life they were still gathered on the hill when we arrived later gorlas escort and uthers men standing mute and shamefaced in dawns light uther himself had only just arrived and was giving the order for the body to be taken back to the fortress he did not see ygerna at first and she did not see him she saw only her fathers corpse lying face up on the heath curiously she gave no appearance of surprise she did not shriek or whimper but simply knelt and put her hand on her fathers head and brushed the hair back from his forehead then she straightened his cloak arranging it to cover the ugly gash in his side the only sound was the sea breeze sighing through the gorse and heather and a lark somewhere high above singing a lonely hymn to the new day nor were there any tears in her eyes when she rose a few moments later and gazing steadily at uther stepped round gorlas body to stand beside him uther put his arm around her shoulders and drew her to him they turned together and walked back down the hill to the high kings camp not a word had been spoken between them uther did not return to caer uintan but occupied the caer and stayed on through the summer at tintagel why not it was a fine stronghold and well situated to keep an eye on his contrary lords shocked into contrition by gorlas death they renounced their treason and in the end accepted uthers terms pledging the king tribute for their misdeeds and making hostages of their best warriors which he immediately placed in his warband no longer needed indeed the high king was embarrassed to have me near him for the rumours that he had plotted gorlas death from the beginning and had sent me to accomplish it i returned to ynys avallach gorlas was buried and uther married on the same day i am told but then men tell many tales about this affair i have even heard it said that ygerna was gorlas wife imagine that and i by deep enchantments transformed uther into gorlas likeness and led him to her bed or that i gave ygerna a draught that made her believe uther to be aurelius her husband come back from the grave or stranger yet that aurelius himself actually returned from the otherworld to lie with her people will believe anything fourteen if it had not been for the babe i would not have seen uther alive again i very nearly did not go anyway pelleas and i had just returned to ynys avallach after visiting some of the humbler places in the realm the smaller settlements and holdings where men speak their minds and misgivings forthrightly upon our return i sent pelleas to llyonesse to discern how matters stood there i was anxious to discover how morgians influence which seemed to be stronger there affected belyns court the last thing i desired was a long ride back to tintagel alone but uther must be stopped from carrying out that hideous scheme of his and there was no one else to do it no one else knew i saw it all in a vision tired from a days fishing and riding with avallach and charis we had eaten a simple supper of stew and bread and i had fallen asleep early in my chair by the fire a sound a dog barking outside i think awakened me i stirred and opened my eyes the fire had burned low on the hearth before me and i saw in the glowing embers a newborn babe a manchild hanging by its heel in the grasp of someone pressing the cold steel of a sword against the soft pink flesh a terrified woman stood in the shadow her white hands over her face i recognized the blade uthers great war weapon the imperial sword of maximus what is it my hawk asked charis she eyed me closely from where she sat across the hearth a bookroll in her lap her healing work had sent her back to the old books for remedies and medicines and she often spent her evenings reading from among the texts she had saved from atlantis you look as if you have seen your death i shook my head slowly sick to my stomach with dread not my death i replied anothers oh merlin i did not mean to no i tried to smile it has not taken place i may yet prevent it then you must try she said oh there was never any question if not for the sake of the babe then for uthers to prevent him from making a most grievous mistake nevertheless it was not without some reluctance that i made my way back to tintagel clothed simply as a wandering harper for i did not wish my journey to attract unnecessary attention my affairs were becoming common knowledge from one end of the island to the other and as there were enough eyes spying out my every move i did not need more speculation about this visit the less known about this sordid matter the better for everyone the island of the mighty in late summer what place on earth can compare to it the hills flame with heather and coppercoloured bracken the valleys shimmer golden with grain all the fruits of the years labours are ripening wealth beneath shining skies so high and clean and blue the days are still warm and the nights soft and full of light it is a time that makes a man glad to be alive it is the time of lugnasadh the day of first fruits when harvest begins a most ancient and sacred celebration to be sure and one that even the church observes for it is a high and holy day of thanksgiving to the gifting god for his largesse great fires flare from every hilltop and every stone ring becomes once again a sacred circle a centre of power where on this night the veil between the othenvorld and this worldsrealm grows thin and allows the initiated a glimpse at what was or will be and now that the old roman towns are falling into ruin and the people are moving back into the countryside i believe there are more lugnasadh celebrations than ever men look to the old ways more often these days seeking what comfort they can find in the beliefs of a simpler time i travelled lightly unhindered by the weather arriving at tintagel a few days after lugnasadh the gateman took one look at my harp and threw the gate open at least my arrival cheered someone even if it did not exactly lift uther to the heights of song he was suspicious and closed from the beginning and i saw that it would be heavy going in the end there was no hope for it but to confront him bluntly we are friends you and i yes he required that reminder and i know you uther there is no use denying that there is a child and that you plan to kill it when it is born i did not expect him to admit it to me but i wanted him to know that lying to me was useless ygerna stood a little way off watching me worrying her mantle into knots her expression mingling relief and apprehension i think in her secret heart she had hoped that something like this would happen and uther would be diverted from his plan do you think me mad he cried defensively it seemed to me the child could be male it could well be my heir we are talking about damned from his own mouth still he did not realize what he had said for if he entertained so much as the merest suspicion that the child was his none of this would be taking place no the seed growing in ygernas womb was aurelius and he knew it uther had typically spoken what lay closest to his heart his heir doubtless the child is your heir i replied whether uthers or aurelius the babe would be recognized as a legitimate heir to the high kingship whether he would be king was another matter entirely you know what i mean meddler uther dismissed my comment with an impatient gesture in all events i am not a murderer despite what they are telling of me this was a reference to the baseless rumours that he had killed gorlas outright so that he could marry ygerna i did not come here to call you murderer i soothed my only concern is for the child at least we agree on something then he said his eyes flicking to ygerna and back to me what do you propose need i propose anything you mean to tell me that you came all this way just to see if i meant to kill an infant he laughed guiltily a less mirthful sound i could not imagine it would not be the first time a king decided to clean up an untidy problem with the sharp edge of his sword but i am glad to hear that my fears were groundless not entirely so i should think he twisted the redgold bracelet on his arm a dragon his emblem from now on there are i am thinking he said slowly speaking low as if he feared someone overhearing him many who would dearly pay to see this child removed ygerna gave a little cry true enough i replied but a king can always protect his own besides it happens so rarely that not as rarely as you think uther insisted are you forgetting what happened to aurelius these are dangerous times we live in he allowed himself a shrewd smile dangerous men abound come to the point what are you getting at it would not be safe for the child to remain here where would be safer you would know merlin you could find a place i will give him his due when pressed to it uther could think on his feet with the best of them ygerna saw where the kings line of reasoning was leading and stepped forward he is right myrddin emrys you could find a place i wondered at this but i suppose it was only natural in a way in her mind if uther did not kill the child someone else would even if that could be avoided the child would surely stand between her and her husband which was worse she was only choosing the best of several alternatives all of them bad better to give the child up to a safe obscurity than keep it near her and live in constant fear for its life and resent it for living and uther was right if aurelius could so easily be murdered how much more easily might a defenceless infant be killed while it was true that the child would be in constant danger from ambitious proud and powermad fools like dunaut and morcant and coledac and there would be others like them always heaven help us that was not all uther was thinking i understood his mind let this child be put aside in favour of my own son i saw merit in the plan too though for a different reason for if something should happen and uther fail to get an heir for one reason or another aurelius son would still be alive to step forward i did not mention this at the time however ygerna stepped close and laid a hand on my arm please myrddin emrys find a good place a safe place for my baby i could not do this if it were not for you she looked at me with those big dark eyes so full of hope and apprehension it would have been a cruelty to refuse her it was for the best in any event i will do what i can my lady but i raised my finger in warning it must be as i say and once agreed there can be no going back think about it there is time you do not have to decide now no she said it must be now i have already decided i will trust you myrddin emrys do what must be done yes i trust you too merlin whatever you say we will do uther could be quite magnanimous when he wished why not he had so he reckoned solved his problem and saved his name all in the same brilliant stroke he was pleased and proud of himself there would be more sons after all and having once made up his mind he would be resolved to the end we talked some more and it was agreed that i would come and receive the babe upon its birth ygerna did not believe she could part with it otherwise and take it to be raised in a place that only i would know fair enough but what seemed a simple matter at the time the fostering of an unwanted child very soon developed into a tangled and thorny affair for all involved for this was no ordinary infant i returned then to ynys avallach to await the birth pelleas had returned from llyonesse with distressing news belyn was deathly ill and would not last the winter a new king would be chosen upon his death of course but as belyn left no legitimate heirs the kingship would pass to avallachs line the sons of charts or morgian and since charis stood hi direct line of inheritance from avallach more than likely the choice would fall to the first of morgians sons the old atlantean custom of inheritance developed and refined over countless ages and bound by tradition was as far removed from the straightforward simple observances of the britons as the isle of the everliving from the island of the mighty but avallach gravely confirmed pelleas assessment that one of morgians offspring would very soon come to power that my brother should die saddens me greatly the fisher king said but that morgian and her spawn should benefit grieves me more he said nothing more about it brooding in silence for two full days before announcing i will go to llyonesse and i will ask the brothers of the shrine to accompany me perhaps if we may not ease his suffering in this life we might at least prevent it in the life to come charis offered to go with him as did i but he replied it is better that i go alone there is much between us that must be spoken no i know you would not intrude but we will speak more freely if we are left alone to do it the monks will attend to all else we require he did not speak the fear central to his thinking that morgian would appear while he was there if so avallach intended to face her and did not want charis or me anywhere near when that happened the fisher king left the tor as soon as arrangements could be made and provisions gathered he took only two stewards as escort and six brothers from the monastery below the shrine although the good brothers were educated in swordthrust and spearthrow as well as latin and the gospels indeed more than a few monks across the land had worn steel before donning the undyed wool and it was not accounted a shameful thing at all the days turned cool pelleas and i hunted for the winter table riding the hills and wooded vales surrounding the tor through days crisp as new apples we watched and waited and sought the signs that would tell us how avallach fared but there were none neither was there any word from uther in the absence of signs we turned to our own affairs finding a place for uthers son to live we were determined to find the safest home possible but one after another our choices were quickly reduced and we were left with three tewdrig in dyfed custennin in goddeu and hoel in armorica i did not seriously entertain the idea of raising the child at ynys avallach although the thought did occur to me the boy would not benefit from an upbringing that did not fit him for the world in which he must live life on the tor pelleas pointed out has more in common with life in the otherworld than it does with life in this worldsrealm it suited me i replied certainly but i do not think it would suit another pelleas thus confirmed my own misgivings so we must look to one of the three i mused two pelleas suggested hoel is willing and though he is getting old he is a strong and able lord yet but he is too far away there is safety in distance i remarked safety from the casual assassin perhaps pelleas agreed but not from the most determined besides anyone murderbent would think of looking there first since hoel fostered aurelius and uther that leaves only tewdrig and custennin i mused tewdrig is strong and loyal enough but dyfed is surrounded by prying eyes morcant and dunaut are near and will certainly discover that the child raised in tewdrigs care is uthers heir while custennins stronghold in the north is far enough away to be free of spies by the same token it is too far to the north to remain as secure as tewdrigs i held my hands palm up level indicating that the balance was even between them which then will you choose pelleas brow furrowed in a thoughtful frown why must we choose between them at all he brightened as the idea took hold inside him why not let the child be reared in both places depending on time and need why not indeed a sound idea that let the child receive the benefit of both hearths let him learn the ways of two very different lords and kings it was inspired that decided i put the matter from me there was nothing more to be done until the birth i did not wish to risk sending a messenger to either king and i could not go myself now lest at some time in the future my visit would be remembered for what it was the high kings counsellor arranging fosterage for his heir for i had no hope that uther would succeed in keeping the birth secret sooner or later word like water in an oaken bucket would leak out and across the land ambitious men would begin searching for the child nevertheless satisfied with my plan i reckoned i need make no further arrangements until the birth of the babe called me forth in the dead of winter so since there was nothing more to be done at the moment i promptly put the matter from my mind and concerned myself with other affairs i will tell you the truth i did not in those days regard the child in any special way despite the hints i had received the warnings one might say he was merely an infant that required protection he was the son of my dead friend true but that was all other matters were more pressing or seemed so i turned to these and promptly forgot all about the child fifteen in the black month the bleak month when cold winds blow snow from the icebound north the month of privation and death in which winter itself dies in the christ mass the babe was born birth from death it is the ancient and holy way of the earth i consulted the oaken bowl and stayed up five nights together to view the winterclean sky in this way i learned that the time was near pelleas and i travelled to tintagel and waited a little way off in the woods of the deep glen for the birth i did not like to go up to the caer itself for my coming would be noticed and discussed for three days we sat wrapped in our cloaks and furs before our small fire of oak twigs and pine cones waiting at midnight of the third night as we sat watching a strange thing happened an enormous black bear came out of the woods padded softly round the fire snuffling at us warily and ambled up the trail leading to the caer let us follow i whispered perhaps that fellow knows something that we should also learn we followed and found the bear standing on its hind legs at the edge of the wood its blackness sharp against the moonbright snow the beasts nose sniffed the seawind and its great head swung towards us as we approached but the creature did not move it remained for some little time standing looking up at uthers fortress and then as if making up its own slow mind lumbered on hunger has driven it from its lair remarked pelleas it goes to find food no pelleas it goes to honour a birth i still remember the look pelleas gave me his face white hi the moonlight come it is time by the time we reached the gates the great bear by some means animal strength perhaps had gained entrance into the caer the gateman no doubt asleep at his watch when the beast appeared had run away to raise the alarm leaving the gate unattended men with torches dashed here and there in confusion while the dogs barked wildly at the ends of their leashes working themselves into a killing frenzy no one saw us slip through the gates and we made our way directly to the hall and through it to the kings chamber ygerna lay in the room above her women and a midwife or two gathered with her but uther remained below alone awaiting the birth the sword of maximus lay unsheathed across his knee uther glanced up as we entered guilt writ large upon his features for all to see i had caught him and he knew it oh merlin you are here i thought you would be he contrived to sound relieved the sound of the chaos outside had entered with us and uther seized on this to aid him by the raven what is that commotion a bear has entered your stronghold uther i told him a bear he appeared to ponder this as if the thing bore deep significance for him then said my wife is not delivered of the child you may as well sit it will likely be some time yet i motioned for pelleas to find us some food and drink and he disappeared behind the hanging hides into the hall i sat down in gorlas big chair uther preferred his camp chair even in chamber and studied die high king as he sat before me i am disappointed uther i told him flatly why have you gone back on your word when did i promise anything he flung back angrily you accuse me falsely tell me i am mistaken then tell me that the sword across your knee is not for the babe tell me you did not intend to kill it uther frowned and turned his face away by god merlin you hound a man well my apology only awaits your denial i have nothing to deny i do not answer to you meddler does ygerna know what you intend what would you have me do he jumped up and threw the sword on the table honour our agreement i told him thinking of many other things i could have said i was trying to make it easy for him still the high king resisted as i say once uther fastened on a thing he was loth to give it up and he had had a long time to work himself up to this he stalked around the room glaring at me i agreed to nothing it was all your idea i never agreed that is untrue uther it was your idea for me to take the child well i have thought better of it then he growled what have you to do with this anyway what is your interest only this that the son of aurelius and a blood descendant of constantine should not suffer death before he has tasted of life uther i said gently he is your kin by all laws of heaven and earth it would be a grievous crime to kill the child the deed is not worthy of you uther you who let octa the son of your enemy live how will you justify killing the son of your brother whom you loved most dearly uther snarled you twist things i say only what is uther give it up if not for the childs sake then for your own do not think to enter gods rest with this black deed on your soul the high king stood unmoved feet apart glaring balefully his mouth a firm line oh he could be difficult what is the use uther where is your gain he had no answer and made none neither did he give in very well i sighed i had hoped to persuade you but you leave me no choice what will you do i claim the promise you gave me uther and i bind you with your honour to grant it what promise he asked warily on the night i brought ygerna out of the fortress you promised me anything i desired even to the half of my kingdom you said if i would deliver her to you i fulfilled my half of the bargain and asked nothing for myself at the time well i make my claim now the child uther was incredulous until this moment he had forgotten that promise he remembered it full well now the child yes i claim the child as my reward uther was beaten and he knew it but he was not about to give up so easily you are a cunning hound he faced me squarely what if i refuse refuse me now and lose all honour and selfrespect your name will become a curse you will never command a man with authority again consider uther and answer is killing a helpless babe worth that all right he fairly burst with exasperation take it take the child and let there be an end to it presently pelleas returned with a jar of mead cups bread and cheese he put these on the table and began pouring the cups i could find no meat he said the kitchens were empty this is enough pelleas thank you i turned to uther and handed him a cup i accept my reward uther i said lightly let us part as friends the high king said nothing but accepted the cup in one hand and a bit of bread in the other we drank and ate together and uther calmed somewhat but as his guilt and anger seeped away he was left with the shame he slumped in his chair and became despondent to shift his attention to something else i said what has become of that bear i wonder perhaps we should go and see we walked back through the empty hall and outside the dogs had stopped barking and i thought by this that the bear must be killed but no it lived the men had it cornered by the fortress wall where surrounded by torches and spears the beast stood reared on its hind legs its forepaws outspread pelt bristling claws extended fangs bared the yard was strangely quiet a magnificent beast its dark eyes glinting in the ruddy torchlight it was cornered but unconquered uther looked upon the bear and his aspect changed he stopped and stared what he saw i cannot say but when he moved again it was as one in a dream walking lightly languidly he made his way to the ring of men stepping among them on his way to the animal lord king no stay back shouted one of his chieftains he threw down his spear and made to lay hold of the high king and pull him back silence i hissed let him go my senses prickled to the presence of the otherworld i saw everything in sharp relief the risen moon the bear the men holding the torches uther the glinting points of the spears the stars pelleas the dark hardness of the wall the stones at my feet the silent dogs it was a dream and more than a dream the dream had become real or reality had become a dream these times are rare who is to say where the truth lies afterwards men shake their heads in wonder and endure the scoffing of those who were not present for it cannot be explained only experienced but this is what happened uther boldly approached the bear and the animal lowered its head and dropped onto its forefeet the high king held out his hand to the beast and the bear like a hound recognizing its master pushed his muzzle into the high kings palm with his other hand uther stroked the bears huge head men stared in astonishment their lord and a wild bear greeting one another as old friends perhaps in some inexplicable way they were i will never know what uther thought he was doing for he could never remember it clearly but the two stood this way for the space of a few heartbeats then uther lowered his hand and turned away one of the dogs growled and lunged forward pulling its leash free from the slack hand of its holder the bear reared as the dog leaped and gave a sideways swipe with its great paw the dog tumbled away howling with pain its back broken the dream ended then in the yelps of a dying dog the other dogs were at the bear in an instant the chieftain grabbed uther by the arm and pulled him back to safety then the warriors loosed their spears the bear snarled and clawed the air breaking spearshafts as if they were reeds but the wounds were made and the blood was already flowing roaring with pain and rage the great beast fell and the dogs tore out its throat take them off shouted uther put the dogs away the dogs were pulled away and all was silent once more the bear was dead its blood pooling black and thick on the stones beneath the immense body this worldsrealm had reasserted itself as it always will in stark unforgiving brutality ah but for a moment if only for the briefest moment those standing in the courtyard knew something of otherworldly grace and peace there are those who say that it was gorlas come to pay homage to the birth of his grandson that night or that the spirit of that great bear poured out onto the stones in sacrifice at the moment of the babes birth found its way into the child that was born that night for it is true that when we reached the door of the hall once more we heard the babe squawling lustily at the top of its lungs a hearty cry at the moment of birth is a good sign uther shook himself like one awakening and turned to me it is he paused a boy a son he had been about to say wait here i will have the babe brought out it is best if ygerna does not see you as you wish uther i signalled to pelleas to go back to the wood and fetch our horses he hurried off down the track to the gate and i waited at the door people roused by the noise in the courtyard passed by on their way to see the bear which the men were already skinning where it lay indeed it was a giant among bears pelleas came with the horses we had planned to take the babe without being seen but the bear had changed that people knew we were there now and would know that we had taken the child there was nothing to be done about that any more we would have to trust the guiding hand and proceed boldly we waited and watched the men work over the bear when the skin was free they quartered the animal and fed the heart and liver to the dogs the rest of the meat would be roasted or made into stew for the feast yes i had forgotten the christ mass i turned and looked to the east and saw that dawn stood not far off already the sky lightened at the horizon grey going to pink and rust i heard footsteps behind me and uther approached carrying a furwrapped bundle his face impassive a woman walked behind him here he said curtly take it then softly possibly the only softness i had ever witnessed in uther pendragon he lifted the edge of the fur and brushed the tiny head with his lips farewell nephew he said then looked up at me i thought he would ask me where i took the child surely it was in his mind but he merely tucked the wrap and said go now he will be well cared for uther never fear ygerna is asleep he said i am going to wait with her he turned saw the woman standing there and remembered i am sending this woman with you she will suckle the child a horse will be made ready for her he made to leave but something held him he hesitated his eyes resting on the bundle in my arms is there anything else you require the men came towards us carrying the skin of the bear into the hall yes uther i answered the bearskin he eyed me curiously but ordered the raw skin to be rolled up and tied behind my saddle while this was being done a stablehand arrived leading a horse for the woman when she had mounted i handed the child to her and taking the reins of her horse into my hand led my horse and hers out through the gate and down the narrow causeway several caerdwellers watched us from outside the walls but nothing was said and no one followed as daylight struggled into the sky staining the eastern clouds and snowcovered hills crimson and gold we rode back through the clefted valley and into the smooth empty hills beyond tintagel and seagulls wheeled above us keening in the cold winter air i did not like the idea of a winter sea voyage but we must reach dyfed as quickly as possible the road is no place for a newborn and in winter even those who make the road thenhome stay inside crossing mor hafren was necessary though the prospect was far from welcome enough men lose their lives in winter seas that most boatmen refuse all commerce in that treacherous season be that as it may there are those who can always be bought a flash of gold and they will go against all natural inclination risking life and limb to an enterprise they would not consider otherwise consequently we had little trouble finding a boat to takc us across still and all we waited four days for calm weather i was uneasy the whole time but if anyone marked our passing we learned nothing of it for we saw no one else on the road nor did the boatman take an interest in us once the price was settled he asked no questions and went about his business with silent efficiency if he thought anything he no doubt supposed the woman to be my wife and pelleas to be my servant i helped this impression as much as possible hovering over the lady and the baby with protective authority seeing to their comfort the woman an unfortunate whose husband had been killed when his horse stumbled on tintagels murderous causeway and whose own babe had taken the wasting fever and died only days before was not as old as i first thought as the journey went on such beauty as she possessed ravaged by grief and care began returning to her she smiled more often when she held the child and thanked pelleas and me for the small kindnesses performed for her the woman enid by name suckled the child readily and cradled it as lovingly as any natural mother would and i surmised that the closeness of the babe its helplessness and dependence had begun healing the wound in her heart the day of crossing came at last it was wet and cold the kind of wet cold that goes to the bones and stays long the wind gusty and daggersharp but the wind did not raise the seas against us so we made good time and landed safely i paid the boatman double his price and was glad to do it upon crossing mor hafren we quickly entered tewdrigs realm sheltering the first night at the little seaside abbey at llanteilo where the renowned bishop teilo had built his church and monastery the next day frosty cold but with a sky clear and high and bright as a flame we rode the remaining distance to caer myrddin the sun sets early that time of year dusk was well upon us and the first winter stars already in the sky by the time we reached tewdrigs stronghold the market town stood a sad reminder of another age abandoned now perhaps for ever we urged our horses through the ruin and turned up the hill trail to the caer silvery smoke from many hearth fires drifted into the still night air and the aroma of roasting meat reached us as we neared our arrival was foreseen of course and we were met at the gates by a young man with a sparse brown beard greetings friends he called to us taking up a place in the centre of the path what business brings you to tewdrigs house this cold winters night greetings meurig i told him for it was tewdrigs eldest son who confronted us others were gathering round watching us with polite but undisguised curiosity you have become a man i see at my use of his name meurig stepped closer i am at your service sir how do you know me how should i not know the son of my friend lord tewdrig he cocked his head to one side i think that my escort a woman with a babe in arms confused him but one of the onlookers recognized me for someone whispered the emrys is come meurig heard the name his head whipped round and laying a hand on my bridle he said forgive me lord emrys i did not know it was you i cut short his apology with a wave of my hand there is nothing to forgive but now if we may go in it is getting dark and the child will be getting cold at once my lord he motioned some of the others forward to take our horses as we dismounted another ran to the hall to announce our arrival so that tewdrig himself met us as we crossed the yard your son has become a fine man i told tewdrig when after our greetings and after enid and the child had been seen to we were settled before the hearth with a steaming bowl of mulled wine in our hands i did not remember him so well grown oh he has grown indeed that one he smiled pleased with the compliment he was married a year ago and will have a babe of his own before spring he laughed suddenly but i did not know you had taken a wife alas i have been too busy that i can easily imagine so tell me what is happening in the island of the mighty that i should know about you will have heard of gorlas death i replied a bad thing that very bad i was sorry to hear of it he was a strong battlechief then you are also aware of the high kings marriage as for the rest you will know more than i i have been at ynys avallach these many months not with the pendragon tewdrig raised his eyebrows at this uther has his own advisers i explained simply perhaps but you are no it is better this way i have uthers ear when i need it and he has mine i am content we sipped our sweet wine for a moment feeling the warming draught thaw the cold places within and tewdrig waited for me to tell him why i had come as it happens i began setting my cup aside i have come on an errand for the high king tewdrig leaned forward so a matter of some importance lord tewdrig your confidence is enjoined whatever can be done that i will do for you myrddin emrys as much as for the high king of that you may be certain thank you my friend but the thing i have come to ask will not be easily granted and i would have you consider it carefully perhaps discuss it with your counsellors before agreeing if that is what you wish although if you deem it a virtue to come to me i can tell you that i will refuse nothing you ask for it is in my mind that if i could not help you would not have come to me had he already guessed why i had come tewdrig was shrewd his next words confirmed my suspicion it is about the child yes i nodded it is whose child is it aurelius and ygernas i told him i thought as much tewdrig mused not uthers flesh yet the same noble blood in his veins so the pendragon did not care to have the poor babe in his house reminding him that his own brats stood no closer to the throne that is the pith of it i agreed yet the babe must be kept safe for tewdrig nodded gravely for he will surely be the next pendragon of britain i assure you i can be as blind as the next man and here is the proof until tewdrig said those words i had never seriously considered that likely nor did i believe it now to me the child was merely that an infant who must be protected from the overweening ambition of others not the future king my blindness was complete the deeds and doings of the present i confess occupied me more than that one little life i saw no further that is the simple truth and there is no pleasure in the telling of it tewdrig continued oh i see the problem let dunaut or morcant or any of that stripe know that aurelius has an heir and the lads life would not be worth a nettle he will be a danger to himself to be sure and perhaps to those around him as well bah let them try to harm that child just let them try and they will soon learn to fear righteous wrath it was not an idle boast for tewdrig was no braggart but i needed more than his loyal indignation i know i need have no fear there tewdrig your strength and wisdom and that of your people will be most important for the child must not only be protected he must be nurtured and taught gwythelyn is nearby at llandaff the boy will be well taught never fear tewdrig sipped his wine and smiled expansively the son of aurelius in my house this is an honour it is an honour that must remain unsung he cannot be aurelius son any more from this day he is merely a child fostered at your hearth i understand your secret is safe with me myrddin emrys it is our secret now tewdrig i reminded him and we will speak of it no more no more agreed tewdrig except to say me what is the name of the child what is he to be called shameful to tell i had not thought to call the infant anything neither uther nor ygerna had bestowed a name and i had been too preoccupied with its safety to give it any consideration but the babe must have a name a word is given when a word is required and at this time like so many others the name came unbidden to my tongue arthur instantly upon uttering the word i heard again the voice of my vision the throng in londinium clamouring arthur arthur hail arthur tewdrig was watching me closely his brows knotted in concern is something amiss no i reassured him the infant let him be called arthur tewdrig tried the name arthur very well an unusual name though what does it mean i believe he will have to make its meaning for himself then we must make certain he lives long enough to do so replied tewdrig he retrieved his cup raised it to arthur health and long life wisdom and strength may he win the heros portion at the feast of his fathers sixteen we stayed a while at caer myrddin and would have been content to remain there longer but when the weather broke pelleas and i made our way back to ynys avallach the journey was uneventful indeed we met no one at all on the road but a day out from dyfed a deep melancholy settled on me a nameless longing sharp and poignant as grief into my mind came all the losses i had known and one by one i saw forms and faces of those who had touched my life and now were gone to dust in the ground ganieda fairest daughter wife and lover her clear gaze and ringing laughter shining hair long and dark her sly

dry tinder of the old way and others elphin rhonwyn maelwys cuall aurelius this heavyheartedness lasted with me into the spring and summer i found myself turning more and more to thoughts of my father wondering what sort of man taliesin had been regretting that i had not known him weeping for the sound of his voice in song the regret at first merely sorrowful festered and grew into black hatred for morgian who caused his death that she lived and breathed the air of this world when taliesin and so many other good people had gone out of it infuriated me it came into my mind to kill her i even planned how this deed might be accomplished and before spring was over i had conceived every aspect of her death indeed i had murdered her many times over in my heart nor did i fear carrying out my plan i believe if left to myself i would have found her and slain her however we are rarely left to ourselves jesu who watches over the affairs of all men is not content that any should fall from his hand or long remain beyond his touch if not for that i am certain i would have joined morgian in the stinking pit of hell what happened was this a woman came to shrine hill suffering from an ailment of her bones which caused them to become brittle as sticks quickly broken and slow to mend in the least the slightest blow would cause a bruise that would swell painfully and last for many days she had suffered long with this affliction always in the sorest agony labouring with her arm in a sling or hobbling on a crutch the small bones in her hands and feet snapped so easily but she prevailed upon some kinsmen to bring her to the shrine for she had heard of the healing work the brothers practised there in truth she had heard of the wonders charis had performed with her healing art so she came with simple faith to be healed charis had marked with alarm i should think my growing bitterness and depression she had spoken to me about it but i was beyond listening so the day she went to minister to the woman she took me with her it was a day of darkness for me and not caring where i was or what i did i accompanied her to the shrine the woman neither old nor young was dressed in a wellpatched green mantle ragged at hem and sleeves but clean as she could make it she smiled as charis came into the room the brothers set aside for treatment of the sick there were others gathered there other sick and a few brothers in their grey robes moving among them the sound of psalmsinging came down to us like sweet rain from the hilltop shrine above what is your name asked charis gently settling on a stool beside the womans pallet uisna she replied her smile tight with pain may i see your hands uisna charis took the womans hands in her own they were delicate with fine long fingers but hideous bluebrown bruises discoloured them and made them ugly the woman winced as charis gently gently probed the bruises and i saw that it hurt her even to have them touched her feet and legs were the same beauty made grotesque by the grossness of the malady one leg had been broken in the past and poorly set it was crooked and misshapen i had to look away can you help me uisna asked softly it was a plea a prayer it hurts me much to my amazement charis answered yes i can help you how could this be if i had not known her better i would have thought my mother callous or unthinking for promising the impossible but she added the god of this place helps all who call upon his name then tell me the name please that i may call upon him looking directly into the womans painfilled eyes charis replied his name is jesus king of love and light great of might lord of heaven he is the son of the good god the everliving no one expected what happened next for no sooner had charis uttered the name the womans head snapped back and a scream of utter torment tore from her throat her body became rigid the cords of her neck and arms standing out against the skin she fell back on the pallet writhing charis jumped to her feet and i dashed forward she extended a hand to keep me away saying no do not come nearer there is an evil spirit in her the body thrashing on the pallet began to laugh a sickening hateful sound you cannot help this bitch whore the woman screamed in a rough raucous voice she is mine i will kill her if you touch her the brothers hurried to charis side and conferred quickly one of them dashed from the room and returned a few moments later with a wooden cross and a vial of anointing oil meanwhile the poor woman thrashed and flung her limbs around so wildly that i feared she would break them off screaming continually with that dreadful demented laughter the monk approached with the cross and oil but charis went to him saying i will do it but i will need help go and tell the brothers at the shrine to uphold us in prayer the man raced away again and charis nodded to several of the other brothers who stood near hold her so that she does no hurt to herself she said the monks knelt beside the pallet and gently but firmly laid hold of the womans nailing limbs charis holding the cross and vial knelt down by the pallet in the name of jesu the christ who is the living son of god i abjure you unclean spirit and demand that you come out of this woman the woman poor wretch was instantly beset with violent tremors convulsions that seized every part of her body flinging her back against the straw bed again and again despite the brothers best efforts at the same time the hideous laughter came forth bubbling up from her throat as from a very great distance jessssuuu she hissed with wicked glee and uttered an unspeakable oath against that sacred name the monks fell back in horror but charis did not so much as cringe she held out the cross in her hand silence she commanded you will not blaspheme the holy name the spirit twisted the womans face in a ghastly grin oh oh please be not angry with me the thing whined please fine lady be not angry with me in the name of jesu i command you to silence charis insisted the woman convulsed her stomach swelled and foul gas broke from her bowels she spat and her spittle ran yellow with puss she laughed and spread her discoloured legs breaking her foul wind abbot elfodd appeared crossed himself and entered the room brother birinus told me to come straight away he whispered coming to stand beside charis what is to be done i have commanded it to silence charis replied but it is a stubborn thing exorcizing it will be difficult i will do it sister elfodd offered no charis smiled and gripped his hand i have begun i will finish she is in my care very well but i will stand with you he nodded to the monks who took up places across the room they knelt and began singing a prayer the woman lay still panting like a winded dog at the sight of the abbot her eyes grew round she shrieked and spat more of the vile poison her hands became claws and she reached for him to scratch him all the while mouthing silent obscenities charis knelt down holding the cross before her i marvelled at her composure she was so calm so selfassured uisna she said softly i am going to help you now she smiled gently a smile of such hope and beauty i believe the smile alone could have healed any malady rejoice it is gods good pleasure to heal you today daughter poor uisnas eyes rolled up into her head and she spewed forth more puss and bile and began choking on it the abbot bent over her and lifted her head her arm whipped up and struck elfodd on the side of the face with such a blow that he was flung back against the wall the monks prayed louder i am unharmed said elfodd rubbing his jaw he returned to his place continue in the name of the most high god lord and creator of all that is seen and unseen and in the name of his holy son jesu beloved friend and saviour of men i renounce you evil one i command you to come out of this woman and trouble her no more charis held the cross before the womans face uisna shrank from it expressions of terror and triumph rippling over her features in the name of the christ be gone charis shouted at once the woman gave out a tortured scream it seemed as if the sunlight dimmed and the room became cold and that a rushing wind filled the room this unseen wind whirled once twice again then lifting the thatch of the roof raced out into the clear blue sky above uisna lay as one dead limp greyfaced no breath left in her body but charis placed the wooden cross on her breast and taking the womans discoloured hands in her own began rubbing them gently abbot elfodd lifted the vial of oil offered a blessing and dipping his finger anointed uisnas head both charis and elfodd prayed over the woman then asking jesu to forgive her sins and heal her body and soul and receive her into the holy kingdom it was simply done and when they finished elfodd said awake dear sister you have been healed uisnas eyes fluttered open she looked up at the two bending over her puzzled am i what has happened you have been saved abbot elfodd replied and you have been healed uisna sat up slowly she raised her hands and her mouth fell open in awe the grotesque bruises had vanished and her flesh was smooth and white she lifted the hem of her mantle her feet and legs were no longer discoloured the flesh was firm and healthy the oncebroken leg straight oh oh uisna cried throwing her arms around charis tears streamed down her face the monks exclaimed in praises to god abbot elfodd embraced the woman and as if it could no longer remain silent the bell at the shrine began ringing out wildly moments later monks began crowding into the room to share in the joy of the miracle you must continue in faith sister warned elfodd gently renounce sin uisna take jesu for your saviour and trust only in him be filled with god and his holy spirit so that the evil spirit cannot return again or it surely will return sevenfold and i suddenly i felt as if the room was closing in around me suffocating me i could not stand to be there any longer with the sound of thanksgiving and praise songs ringing in my ears i fled the place my breath coming in raking gasps charis found me later where i sat among the reeds below the tor with my feet in the water the sun was lowering in the afternoon sky and she came to me and quietly sat down beside me on the bank laying a hand on my shoulder i saw you run from the sickroom she said softly i shook my head sorrowfully i am sorry mother but i could not stay any longer i had to get away from there what is wrong my hawk i turned to peer at her through a mist of tears i have been afraid i sobbed tears running freely now i have been afraid and oh oh mother i have failed i have failed tenderly charis gathered me into her arms she held me for a long time rocking slowly gently tell me my son how have you failed she said at last there was so much i answered finally so much i meant to do and i have done nothing i have betrayed the trust of my birthright i have strayed i have wandered far mother and i have wasted myself in empty pursuits because i was afraid what did you fear i could scarcely bring myself to say the word but squeezing my eyes shut i forced it out morgian charis said nothing for a long time she was quiet so long i turned to look at her and saw that her eyes were closed shedding silent tears beneath her lashes mother she smiled bravely i had thought myself free of her now i know i never will be but her power belongs only to this world i know that at least i was reminded of it today that poor woman uisna is healed merlin god has made her whole are there many like her yes charis sighed gazing across the lake to the tor and more all the time she is the third since winter abbot elfodd tells me that it is the same in other places he has spoken to the bishop about it there is talk of a plague i winced a plague of evil spirits bishop teilo says that it is to be expected for when gods kingdom increases satan is roused to wrath the evil one seeks always to keep us from the knowledge of god for then we are defenceless before him she smiled again but as you have seen today we are far from defenceless i remembered that day on the mountaintop in celyddon and i shuddered a plague of evil spirits a ghastly thought yet it was true our lord was more powerful in his simple goodness than the enemy in all his vast evil that is what i had seen this day at the shrine and i had been admonished indeed i had been rebuked and sternly reminded that i feared for nothing morgian could be faced and morgian could be defeated this truth like so many was bitter to me for it brought me to my knees beneath the weight of all my failings oh yes so many failures so much wasted time and effort the barbarian still threatened the petty kings still strove with one another for power the blessings of civilization were fading from memory the kingdom of summer was no nearer to becoming reality could this be blamed on morgian only in part it was morgian and the lord who ruled her it was my own shortsightedness or lack of faith it amounts to the same thing sometimes time and again i had been given opportunities and i had wasted them time and again i had held back when i might have acted more swiftly more forcefully why why had i done this the heart of a man remains a mystery for ever beyond his reckoning what of that i did not have to continue in my ignorance and disgrace i could change knowing the difference i could choose the higher way what are you thinking merlin charis asked after a while i am thinking that this is my battle i have run from it long enough what will you do i shook my head i cannot say but i will be shown soon enough and while i wait i will make myself ready i will stay here at ynys avallach and i will strengthen myself with prayer and meditation on the holy christ charis hugged me again and kissed my forehead my hawk forgive yourself as you have been forgiven your failings are not unique to you alone that was all she said she left me soon after that but i felt forgiven i prayed great light thank you for waking me from my long selfish sleep lead me my king i am ready to follow the next day but one avallach returned from llyonesse the news he brought was mixed belyn had improved though would not recover and did not expect to see samhain nonetheless he seemed content and welcomed avallachs visit consequently the brothers had effected a reconciliation and avallach had gleaned what he could from belyn regarding morgian there is little enough to tell avallach informed me but that little is disturbing king loth is dead and morgian has left the orcades where she has gone is not known belyn expected her to return to llyonesse in the spring but there has been no sign or word from her loth dead i mused then there are two thrones that will fall to her belyns and loths i was thinking both would see one of morgians offspring made king two realms had fallen to the queen of air and darkness which was what the people of ynysoedd erch the islands of fear had taken to calling morgian two kingdoms one in the north one in the south under her power but morgians influence extended much further than that as i was soon to discover three days later word came to ynys avallach that uther was dead seventeen strange to tell two years had passed me in the fisher kings hall so given to hate and despair was i that i had noticed nothing of the wider world the silent turnings of the seasons the long slow swing of the earth through her measured course now uther was dead i pondered this the imperial line of constantine was never ordained to flourish each of noble constantines sons had been king and each in his turn had been like his father cut down before his time poison again it was said one of gorlas loyal stewards who blamed uther for his masters death and sought to even the blood debt many believed this although there was also vague talk of a mysterious malady it seemed uther had suffered a lingering illness through the winter i gathered my things together and prepared to leave the tor farewell my hawk called chads as she waved me away we will uphold you in your battle she was right of course my battle so long avoided was finally beginning i sent pelleas ahead to londinium and made my way to tintagel in all haste hoping i was not too late but it was not uther i was concerned with now i wanted to see ygerna and to collect uthers sword for word had gone out the kings of britain were gathering in londinium to choose a new high king from among their number i must be there when this took place ygerna received me gladly she had borne her loss bravely but was tired and wanted someone to share her grief indeed uther was not much mourned he was not the high king to inspire the love and sympathy of the people what he had accomplished for britain his fierce battles his brilliant victories these were already forgotten the only thing people remembered was that uther had killed gorlas to marry ygerna that is all they remembered and that little a lie i found the twicewidowed queen standing on the rampart of the wall gazing out at the sea her hair streaming in the sea breeze in the falling light she appeared at once frail and wonderfully strong fragile as sorrow potent as love she turned lightly when i approached smiled and held out her hands to me myrddin you have come welcome dear friend i came as soon as i received word my queen i said taking her hands her fingers were cold although the late afternoon sun was warm on the wall then hesitantly she stepped nearer and embraced me chastely brushing my cheek with cool lips i held her for a long moment very much aware that she was a young woman who needed the comfort of a reassuring touch will you sit with me a while she asked stepping back a queen once more if you wish we walked along the wall to a block of grey stone which jutted out from the rampart she settled herself on it and indicated that i should sit beside her it happened so quickly she said abruptly her voice sad and low he had been out hunting and returned feeling unwell it had been a bad spring for him so i did not remark upon it he went to bed and awoke in the night with a fever he remained in bed the next day which was most unlike him i saw him twice but he complained of nothing i expected him at supper but when he did not come i went to his room she squeezed my hand tightly oh myrddin he was sitting in his chair his flesh was cold and he was dead i am sorry ygerna she seemed not to hear the odd thing was he had his shield beside him and his standard he wore his leather breastplate his sword lay across his lap it was as if he expected to fight an enemy the queen lowered her head and sighed i did not speak to him again i did not tell him i loved him i wanted so much to tell him and then it was too late myrddin why does everything always come too late the wash of the sea around the roots of the headland and the cry of the soaring gulls carried an inexpressible sadness to me i put my arm round ygerna and we sat together in the sun listening to the gulls and the waves feeling the comfort of two hearts grieving the sun went behind a cloud and the day turned suddenly cool where has he been buried i asked as we rose and made our way back inside she did not answer at once when she spoke there was triumph in her voice beside aurelius jesu bless her she had done what she could for uthers memory it was right that they should be buried together in any case but ygerna wanted their names for ever linked in renown and respect she had buried the husband she loved next to the one the people loved as we came near the hall she turned to me and laying a hand on my arm said i carry uthers child does anyone know my serving maid she is sworn to silence see that she keeps it ygerna nodded she understood will there be fighting possibly yes it is likely i see she said absently there was something else on her mind i could tell she was weighing her words carefully i waited for her to come out with it in her own time the sea crashed below us restless as ygernas heart i could sense her unease still i waited myrddin she said at last her voice tight now that uther is dead words failed her she could not make them say what she felt now that the king is gone perhaps it would not be yes she pressed my hand and gazed earnestly at me as if i held power to grant or withhold her hearts desire the child my son please myrddin where is he is he safe may i send for him it cannot be ygerna but surely now now that uther i shook my head gently the danger has not diminished in fact with uthers death it has increased until you have delivered uthers child aurelius son remains the only heir ygerna dropped her head the babe had been much on her mind and in her heart as it would with any mother may i go to him that would not be wise i fear i told her i am sorry i wish it could be otherwise please just to see him very well i relented that may be arranged but it will take time arthur must be arthur she whispered so that is what you named him yes please understand i would have acted differently but uther told me no name to give him i hope you approve it is a good name a strong name i think she smiled wistfully repeating the word to herself you have done well i thank you i have taken your child from you my lady and you thank me indeed you are a remarkable woman ygerna she searched my face with her eyes and apparently found what she was seeking you are good myrddin you above all men have treated me as an equal i will do whatever you tell me to do you need do nothing for the moment later when the high kingship is decided well we will leave tomorrows worries for tomorrow her smile showed the relief she felt we entered the hall and fell to talking of other things we dined most pleasantly and retired early the next morning i asked for the sword and one of the dragon standards uther had devised as the symbol of the high kingship ygerna gave them to me saying dunaut was here and wanted the sword i would not let him have it i told him uther was buried with it she paused and smiled guiltily i am not sorry i lied it was well you did not give him the sword i told her we would have a hard time getting it back from him i think indeed we will have a difficult enough time keeping his hands off it as it is farewell myrddin emrys send word if you think of it i should like to know what happens at the king choosing farewell ygerna i will bring word myself if i can when it is over a few days later i turned aside at the plain above sorviodunum and the giants dance that great and ancient circle of stones the folk of the region call the hanging stones for the way those enormous rock lintels seemed in certain light to float above the ground the circle stood by itself on the crest of a wide smooth hill no one was about nor did i expect otherwise cold immense mysterious men left the ring alone for the most part it reminded them that there were secrets in the earth which they would never know that the wonders of a previous age remained for ever beyond their ken that a superior race had lived where they lived now and that they too would one day vanish as the ringbuilders and the moundbuilders before them had vanished that life in this worldsrealm was furtive and short a small herd of cattle grazed in the area and a few sheep wandered bleating in the ditch around the stones i rode in among the standing stones to the inner ring and dismounted the twin grave mounds one new made the other covered with shortcropped grass lay side by side the wind moaned among the hanging stones and the bleating sheep sounded like the disembodied voices of those buried in the earthen chambers that stood a way off from the great circle above black crows sailed on silent wings in a white empty sky and it did seem as the hill folk believed that the ring marked the place where two worlds touched appropriate then that here where the worlds met were the brother kings united together for ever uther would never have to leave his brothers side and aurelius would never lack his brothers care neither would be separated from the other any more at the sight of the bareearthed mound i sank to my knees and i sang i passed time at dawn i slept in a purple shadow i was a rampart beneath bold emperors a cloak folded on the shoulders of two kings the shining arc of two lusty spears thrown down from heaven in annwfn they will sharpen the battle with golden deeds they will rout the everlasting enemy sevenscore hundred have bowed in death before them sevenscore thousand will uphold them in victory brave kings and true their blood is cold their song is ended oh uther deeply do i regret your death we were wary friends at best but we understood one another i think may it go well with you my king on your journey to the otherworld great of might accept this wayward soul into your company and you will not want for a more loyal companion for i declare to you most solemnly king of heaven uther lived by the light that was in him may all men alive claim as much by the time i reached londinium the chase was already well along which is to say that the crownlusting hounds had the scent of the high kingship in their nostrils and were hot on the trail dunaut of course with his friends morcant and coledac led the pack but there were others close behind them ceredigawn with the support of his kinsman rhain of gwynedd morganwg of dumnonia and his sons antorius and regulus of the south cantii and ogryvan of dollgellau there would have been more in fact there would be more when those whose realms lay farther away arrived as it was the sparring was merely boasting and posturing the swagger of combatants before the contest the actual fight had not yet begun bishop urbanus beside himself with indecision welcomed me distractedly merlinus i am glad you have come i tell you the truth when i say that i am at my wits end keeping peace between the lords the things they say to one another he complained adopting a shocked demeanour and in a church it will get worse before it gets better i warned then i do not know how it will be settled without bloodshed he shook his head gravely still i think it proper to conduct such important matters on consecrated ground urbanus was not as troubled as he pretended in his heart he was pleased to have a hand in the king choosing if only in providing a roof under which it could take place make no mistake that this king choosing should take place in a church was no small thing for it meant that the lords accepted aurelius precedent they felt comfortable with the church and were willing to allow it a place in supporting their affairs although i entertained no illusions that most of those sheltering under urbanus roof would just as well have gathered in a stable or a mud hut if that had been offered their eyes were on the crown not the cross and i do not mind telling you the bishop continued this has happened at a most inopportune time if you have not guessed already we are enlarging the edifice when the masons are finished we will have an apse joined to the basilica and a larger transept and there will be a proper narthex with an arched entrance like the larger churches of gaul i had noticed the building work of course there were piles of rubble stone scattered around the church masons worked on wooden scaffolds and cutters trimmed the huge blocks lying in the yard i guessed the work had been paid for by aurelius for a certainty uther would never have given money for such a venture it was clear urbanus fortunes were rising in the world and he relished the ascent very well allow him his big church there was no harm in it so long as he managed to keep a true heart and humble spirit the kings were not the only ones with an interest in the high kingship governor melatus had summoned some of the more powerful magistrates as well what they thought to do i cannot say no doubt they saw in the gathering of the kings a chance to reclaim some small part of their dwindling power roman government survived only if it survived at all in old mens memories and the latin titles they wore pelleas found us a place to stay the house of a wealthy merchant named gradlon who traded in wine salt and lead among other things and who owned the ships that carried his goods gradlon was a friend of governor melatus and an influential man in the affairs of londinium i suspect that melatus had requested that his friends make free their houses to anyone attending the king choosing so that he could be informed as events took shape gradlon however was a genuine host and made no secret of his allegiances saying a merchant pays tribute to the man who keeps his business healthy if it is a king i bow the knee if an emperor i kiss the hem either way i pay taxes he held a chubby finger in the air for emphasis but i pay them gladly as long as the roads and sea routes remain open the governor and magistrates held council in the governors palace with the intention of drafting an ultimatum to lay at the feet of emperor aetius send the troops or lose britains good will britain in the greatest good will or vilest temper had never been worth the empires sweat in maintaining it well for a few generations the tin and lead and corn the britons paid had been some value to the empire i suppose but this little island had cost rome far more than it ever returned now when the rest of the empire bled under the relentless blows of the barbarian axe the concerns of little britanniarum were no concern of the emperor at all the small agonies of a fleabitten hound in the emperors stable might elicit more sympathy i considered but could expect no more relief i pitied the governor and his magistrates for not realizing this our future was as britain not britanniarum to think otherwise was folly perhaps dangerous folly at that reality can be most severe it has a way of punishing those who ignore it too long the kings on the other hand were not much better they believed apparently that the barbarian threat could be checked by personal aggrandizement the greater the king the more the saecsen trembled i need not tell you what i think of such beliefs well and this is how the council of kings began deadlocked over the question of who was qualified to decide among those who fancied themselves capable of wielding macsen wledigs sword the question of how to settle that question added another stratum of animosity to the proceedings the only voices of reason were those of tewdrig and custennin but by the time they arrived the others were too far withdrawn behind the walls in their indefensible positions to hear reason as i have said does not avail in these situations anyway each day when the kings gathered in the church to begin their debate i went with them biding my time i did not speak and no one asked me i waited thinking i might yet find an opportunity to help certainly i could expect no more than that one chance only i must make it count while i waited i sat in my place and watched all i searched among them noting each one carefully the tone of his voice his command wisdom strength i weighed all and found none the measure of aurelius or uther either for that matter lord help us i would have settled for a vortigern the most able among them was custennin but his kingdom was small and he was a northerner that is to say he lacked the near inexhaustible wealth of the southern kings which he would need if he were to try maintaining two or possibly three courts and field a warband large enough to keep order in the land and then living so far in the north made him dubious in the south northerners it was widely thought were savages and brutes lacking all refinement and civility men would never follow a king they considered little better than the barbarian tewdrig i thought might be more likely he possessed great wealth enough to command the respect of the southern kings but the demetae and silures among the oldest tribes of britons were also the most independent it was doubtful that other kings would hold to tewdrig when already they complained of dyfeds indifference and insularity also i suspected that the high kingship meant little to tewdrig it might mean more to his son meurig but he was still an untried leader of the others ceredigawn showed some promise that his great grandfather was irish might be overcome for he was a forceful and upright ruler but the fact that his family gained their realm by virtue of the unpopular roman practice of planting rulers in troubled regions over the protests of those who must live with them was a lasting embarrassment as a consequence his people had never troubled themselves with forming alliances with other ruling houses and so ceredigawn however able was not well liked as the days dragged on days of insane posturing absurd threats and breathtaking arrogance it became clear to me that there could be no harmony of opinion reached among them lord dunaut of the wealthy brigantes succeeded in thwarting all reasonable discussion with his ludicrous demand that the next high king should support the entire warhost out of his private treasury rather than maintain the warhost of britain from a warchest into which all the lords contributed equally dunaut and his friends insisted that the freedom of britain depended upon the freedom of the high king to rule the warhost without let or hindrance from the petty kings otherwise the small kings would be tempted to influence affairs by withholding tribute needed to support the warhost the high king will only be free dunaut declared if he rules from his own treasury this infuriated men like eldof and ogryvan and ceredigawn able leaders who nevertheless had trouble enough maintaining even their own modest warbands simply because their lands were not so well suited to the growing of grain or the mining of gold and silver while it did appeal to the vanity of men like morganwg of dumnonia also very wealthy and very proud who saw in the proposition the flash of imperial purple it did not sit well with others who might have been persuaded but recognized and resented dunauts vaunting ambition for what it was the thought of dunaut as high king over them free to do as he pleased because he ruled the warhost unopposed could not be stomached let alone seriously supported time and again the debate foundered on this point and until it was settled dunaut and his supporters would allow no other to be raised other voices other issues battered down ignored discouraged in a hundred different ways fell by the way resentment grew hardened animosity spread hostility flourished it began to appear as if bishop urbanus worst fears would come to bloody fruition the next high king of britain would only be chosen by the sharp edge of the sword then something unforeseen happened two unsuspected allies appeared to forestall the rush to bloodshed ygerna and lot of orcady two whose sudden and unannounced emergence fairly startled the assembly preoccupied as it was with thinking itself the centre of all creation lot ap loth of the tiny island fastness of the orcades in the far north with his black braided locks and armbands of enamelled gold the blue woadstained clan marks on his cheeks and his crimsonandblack checked cloak seemed a visitor from the otherworld he arrived with all the frost of a northern winter unconcerned with the stir his coming provoked young highspirited but with such calm command that his glance unsettled kings twice his age the council had just reconciled itself to lots presence when ygerna appeared with an escort of uthers chieftains those who were still with her she strode purposefully into the church looking stern and strong and beautiful arrayed regally and simply ygerna wore a dovegrey cloak over a white mantle edged in silver a slim golden tore encircled her throat every line of her body spoke eloquently of authority and reserve her grace and poise served a rebuke to the fatuous posing of the petty kings that these two should arrive so suddenly and on the heels of one another was perhaps more than coincidence it was certainly uncanny in the effect it had on the council for suddenly the mood of the assembly changed as the lords evaluated the newcomers and calculated how best to make use of these unknown quantities no one i am quite convinced had given a thought to either of them or considered that they might have a part in the proceedings indeed in my own dealings with ygerna i had completely overlooked the fact that as uthers widow she maintained the right of sitting in council and now that she was here i experienced the momentary fear that her presence would cause the gathered kings to remember something else aurelius son but apparently no one knew or remembered for nothing was said perhaps the secret was safe after all as for lot because he lived on the rim of the world everyone else apparently assumed that he would have no interest in the affairs of the rest of the realm so no one had summoned him nevertheless he had heard and he had come i confess that i did not welcome his arrival but for reasons other than the threat of whatever claim he might make to the high kingship no it was his bloodline that concerned me lot was the son of loth of course and loth had been the husband of morgian that morgians son should appear as out of the northisland mist alarmed me more than a little what did it mean was morgian behind it need i even wonder no doubt morgian saw in the king choosing an opportunity for gaining power of a kind different from what she already possessed but why send the boy why not come herself where was lots father these things concerned me in no small measure as i stared at lot across the council ring i tried to discern what kind of man he was but aside from the obvious fact that he like many in the bleak north loved his colour bright and his manner ostentatious i could discover nothing at one point in the proceedings lot caught me watching him his reaction puzzled me he gazed back for a moment then slowly smiled and touched the back of his hand to his forehead in the ancient acknowledgment of lordship then as if dismissing me from his mind he turned his attention back to the assembly when much later that day the council finished i waited for ygerna in the yard outside the church watching the builders the masons were making use of the days last light to move the huge keystone of the great arch the ropes they used were too small for the task and their levers were too short for all their labour and their energetic cursing they could shift the enormous stone but a few paces as soon as ygerna entered the yard she saw me and hurried to me two of her chiefs following at a respectful distance behind do not be angry with me myrddin she began at once i know what you are thinking do you indeed you are thinking that i have no place here that i should have stayed in tintagel that i will only make things worse for my presence i grinned with pleasure she was not so purposeful and selfassured as she seemed ygerna i am glad you have come you have as much right here as any of the others and you could not make matters worse than they already are if that were your sole ambition so you see you have no cause to feel unwelcome she smiled the corners of her mouth bending down well you may not think so when i ask you what i have in my mind to ask ask then but do not think anything you ask will change my mind glancing quickly round a kitchen girl about to speak a guilty secret ygerna said softly i must ask you to return uthers sword to me i considered this for a moment you see the queen remarked sulkily you are angry now please i am not angry but why the sword i have seen what is happening here they treat me well enough but i am ignored if they will not recognize me perhaps they will recognize the sword it is not the first time a womans heart read the matter truly and far more quickly than any man might arrive at the same conclusion after only one day in council she had discerned the crux of the thing without any power of her own she would be ignored politely perhaps but ignored all the same well may i have it back of course my lady but what do you plan to do with it she shook her head that will come to me when it comes i will send kadan to fetch it tonight i will have it ready for him that settled she turned to pleasantries it was a most enjoyable journey not like the last time she paused remembering when she had come with gorlas and uther and yet i shall never forget that journey it was the first time i saw uther the first time for so many things it seems we walked together along the narrow street to a nearby house where she had lodging dine with me tonight myrddin she offered unless you have made better plans i have no other plans i replied and certainly none better i would be honoured to dine with you ygerna and i will bring the sword she smiled winningly in truth you are not angry who am i to be angry with you she shrugged i just thought you might be i returned to gradlons house where pelleas was waiting outside the door he came here with his men there was nothing i could do i observed five thicknecked stoutlegged horses tied to the rings in the side of the wall who has come pelleas lot his brow creased unhappily he said he would speak with you well there was nothing for it but to meet him i entered the house and found it crowded with northcountry strangers lot stood at gradlons hearth back to the door one foot on a firedog his hands wrapped in the iron chain suspended there at my entry the men fell silent lot turned his eyes were the colour of snow shadow greyblue and cold as winter ice i stood in the doorway and he regarded me casually confidently for the space of three heartbeats i paused then stepped into a room bristling with hidden knives and unseen spears eighteen well merlin ambrosius myrddin emrys lot said finally i am honoured lord lot i did not expect you no i suppose not it seems no one expected me in londinium his smile was sudden and sly but i much prefer it that way uneasy silence reclaimed the room i broke it at last saying will you drink with me gradlons wine is excellent i do not drink wine he said coolly that is a luxury we do not allow ourselves in orcady and i have never developed the taste for southern vices mead i offered i am certain our host will oblige beer he said spreading his hands in a gesture of helplessness as you see i am a man of simple pleasures the mocking emphasis he gave the words suggested a wildly voracious appetite and brought to my mind images of unspeakable perversion yet he smiled as if it were a point of honour with him he was his mothers son and no doubt i resisted the impulse to flee the room the only reason i suffered him at all was to discover why he had come i motioned to pelleas standing protectively beside me to bring the beer lot gestured to one of his men who silently followed pelleas from the room i saw no reason to prolong the pointless why have you come i asked the bluntness of my question amused him and the beer not even in the cups he chided goodnaturedly why cousin since you ask i will tell you there is only one reason to venture so far from the balmy borders of my sunfavoured realm surely you can guess the others are here to win the high kingship but i cannot think you hope to gain that for yourself do you think me unworthy i think you unknown your tact is celebrated lot tossed back his head and laughed pelleas shadow looming entered with the cups he offered the guest cup to lot who took it and splashed a few drops over the rim for the god of the hearth he drank deeply and with zeal then handing the cup to the first of his men he wiped his mouth with his fingertips and fixed me with a fierce gaze my mother warned me you would be difficult i wondered if you had lost your will to cross blades you have not answered my question lot he shrugged all my life i have heard of londinium so fancying a seavoyage i said to my chieftains let us go and see this wonder for ourselves if we like it perhaps we will stay imagine our surprise when we discovered a king choosing taking place his whole demeanour was mockery but i detected a thread of truth in his answer he did not know about the king choosing when he set out from orcady he had come for an altogether different reason and had learned of the council somewhere along the way perhaps as he said only upon his arrival still i reflected he had not answered the question i asked i sipped from my cup and then passed it on now that you are here what will you do that unless i am far wrong will very much depend upon how i am treated i find that i am generally treated as well as i treat others oh but it is not so simple for some of us as that dear cousin would that it were he sniffed unhappily ah but you would know little of the adversity lesser mortals must endure was he trying to provoke me i thought it likely though could perceive no reason for it is your life so burdensome to you i asked not expecting any particular reaction but as if i had fingered a very raw and painful wound lot winced his eyes narrowed and his smile grew tight burdensome is not the word i would choose he replied stiffly where is that cup he reached for it and took it from the hand of one of his men tossing back the remaining draught empty so soon then we must leave he said and walked to the door reaching the doorway he paused saying you know myrddin i had hoped our first meeting would be different he turned abruptly and started away i can when i choose to make my command almost irresistible i made it so now do not leave i called after him lot halted he stood for a moment and then turned round slowly as if expecting a swordpoint against his throat the uncertainty of that gesture argued eloquently for him he was an untried boy playing bravely at being a king and i was moved with compassion for him we should not part like this i told him his greyblue eyes searched mine for any hint of deception i think he was a master of discerning it but found none in me how would you have us part his tone was wary testing as friends i have no friends in this place it was an unthinking response nevertheless i know he believed it you can hold to that i replied or accept my friendship and prove yourself wrong i am not often proved wrong emrys farewell his men followed him and in a moment i heard the clatter of hooves in the street and they were gone pelleas closed the door and then turned to me he is a dangerous man my lord myrddin the more so because he is confused i knew pelleas to possess no mean ability in weighing out the character of a man confused there is no doubt but i do not think he intends me harm i am not certain he knows what he intends my companion shook his head slowly the man who does not know his own heart is a man to be feared have nothing to do with him my lord then he spoke my own misgivings who can say how morgian has twisted the youth if my meeting with lot was disconcerting my dinner with ygerna was all delight she had dressed in her finest clothes and in the glimmering golden sheen of light from a hundred candles light that ygerna herself seemed to radiate she appeared more lovely than i had ever seen her she kissed me as i entered the room where a table had been set up and took my hands and led me to a chair myrddin i was afraid you would not come tonight and i would be disappointed how so my lady had you eaten as many suppers cold by the side of the lonely road as i have you would never let pass an opportunity to dine in comfort and were you a man you would never disappoint a lady as beautiful as i see before me my queen she blushed with the innocent pride of a maid dear myrddin she murmured then stopped suddenly you have not brought the sword ygerna looked at my hands as if expecting to see it there i have not forgotten i replied pelleas will bring it later i thought it best not to be seen carrying it with me someone might notice a wise thought sitting me in my chair she turned to the table and poured wine into two silver cups she knelt beside i my chair and offered one to me it was the formal gesture of a servant to a lord i made a movement of protest but she held out the cup saying allow me to serve you tonight please it is small enough repayment for the kindness in all you have done for me i shook my head gently all i have done my lady you honour me too highly i have done nothing to warrant such affection indeed then i will tell you shall i when everyone else thought me a foolish girl you treated me as a woman and the equal of any man you have ever been my true friend myrddin and true friendship for a woman is difficult to find in this world she pressed the cup into my hand with her cool fingers let us drink together in friendship we drank and then she rose and began setting the meal on the board i allowed her ministrations to me and it made her happy it saddens me now to admit that the kindness she referred to had been extended to her not because she was ygerna and therefore worthy of such consideration no it was that she was aurelius bride or uthers wife in truth i had given her no particular consideration as a fellow human being but so barren was her life on that seabound rock that my small courtesies loomed large with her i thought of this and my shame overwhelmed me great light we are blind men all of us slay us and be done with it oh ygerna trusting heart if you only knew that she loved where she should rightly despise was her glory i think i did not taste a single bite of the meal she laid before me but i know i have seldom enjoyed a repast more ygerna fairly shone in her beauty and happiness in this i should have had my warning of what she was planning although it is likely that ygerna herself did not yet know i believe that she acted out of the pureness of her heart and there was no other motive pelleas was mistaken one who did not know what he intended might be turned to the light as easily as the darkness good is always possible and redemption is never more distant than the next breath somehow ygerna reminded me of this all the same when pelleas arrived with uthers sword and i realized how quickly the evening had passed i bade ygerna good night and stepped out into a starfilled night without the slightest suspicion of what would take place on the morrow the next morning the kings assembled in the church once more and once more as at all the other times dunaut and morcant devised to hobble the proceedings with insulting and outrageous demands if they could not realize their ambitions in council at least they might provoke the others to arms and win in that way it was all the same to them but from the beginning that days events took shape differently ygerna and lot were present and the others were forced to take account of them as dunaut was wanning to his long harangue ygerna simply rose from the chair that had been added to the circle for her and stood she stood until dunaut distracted by her quiet presence stopped and acknowledged her my lords he sneered it appears that queen ygerna wishes to speak perhaps she does not understand the proper observances of this assembly oh indeed she replied i have observed much in the short time since i have joined this noble assembly it appears to me that the only way to be heard is to shout at the top of ones lungs while impugning the characters of those present that i think would avail me little so i stand and wait to be recognized lady said dunaut in an exasperated tone i yield to you coolly but politely she dismissed him thank you lord dunaut it must have taken all her strength of will to appear so calm and selfpossessed but there was no trace of fear or hesitancy in her manner indeed anyone would have thought dealing with powermad kings was all her world i am uthers widow she began speaking slowly and forcefully and before that i was aurelius widow no other woman i think has shared meat and bed with two high kings some of the kings laughed nervously but though she smiled ygerna did not allow them to make light of her for she continued no other woman can claim to be twice high queen of britain and no other woman knows what i know that stopped them the lords had not considered that uther and aurelius might have confided their secrets to her they surely considered it now i could almost hear them grunting under the strain of guessing what she might know we are at war here my lords we do battle here among ourselves while the saecsen send out the husting this revelation spoken by one so fair and selfassured sobered them oh yes it is true or did you think that when news of uthers death reached them they would lay down their weapons and weep i tell you they weep for joy to hear it they gather the warhost and soon they will come she paused gathering every eye to herself but this you already know my lords i have not come here to tell you that which you already know blessed girl she had them like fish in a net what would she say next she raised a hand and kadan her adviser came to her holding a clothwrapped bundle he placed the bundle in her hands and then took his stand behind her ygerna stepped to the centre of the floor and held the bundle well up so all could see then she began unwinding the cloth gold and silver flashed beneath the wrappings and all at once the cloth fell away to reveal what i knew to be hidden there the sword of britain this she said lifting the sword was uthers sword as it was aurelius sword but once long ago it belonged to the first high king in the island of the mighty and each high king has held it since save one she meant vortigern of course for this is the sword of maximus the great emperor of britain and gaul she turned slowly so that all could see that it was without doubt the emperors famed blade light from the narrow highcut windows fell in long slanting rays catching the blade and setting fire to the great eaglecarved amethyst oh yes they recognized it the lust glinting sharp in their eyes told all dunauts right hand actually fondled the hilt at his side as he imagined what it must be to wear the imperial weapon as his own other hands twitched too and eyes narrowed to see the play of light along that cold tapering length of polished steel the sanctuary fell silent as ygerna raised the sword in both hands above her head my lords this is the sword of britain and it is shameful to fight over it like hounds over a gristlebone then lowering the sword point first to the floor she folded her hands over the hilt slowly knelt and bowed her head i do not know what she prayed no one does but whatever the words there could have been few more heartfelt prayers uttered in that church before or since i see her still kneeling there in the ring of kings her blue cloak is folded upon her shoulder her tore glints at her slender throat her long fingers are interlaced around the golden hilt the great jewel touches her fair brow the light falling around her enfolds her in a holy embrace if the kings were embarrassed by her words they were mortified by her example heartless indeed was the man among them who could look upon that innocent sight and not feel remorse and shame guilt made them dumb at last her prayer finished she rose and holding the sword before her began walking slowly round the ring lords of britain she called her voice loud and sure this sword belongs to the one who has never sought to advance himself over any other the one in whom the vision of our realm burns most brightly whose wisdom has been valued by high and low alike whose strength as a leader and prowess in battle is sung in timber halls and wattle huts from one end of this worldsrealm to the other ygerna had stopped before me my lords i give it now into his hand let those among you who would take it wrest it from him so saying she put the sword into my hand and held it there with both of hers there she whispered let them try to undo that why my voice was harsh with astonishment you would never have spoken for yourself she turned to the assembly and called who will join me in swearing fealty to our high king ygerna knelt down and stretched her hands forth to touch my feet in the ageold gesture the lords looked on but no one made a move to join her time slid away and it began to appear as if ygernas noble gesture would be reviled standing or seated they stubbornly held their places the silence turned stonehard with defiance poor ygerna made to look a fool by their haughty refusal to acknowledge me i could have wept for the beautiful futility of it but then just as it seemed as if she must withdraw across the floor someone stirred i looked up lot rose slowly to his feet he stood for a moment and then walked to me his eyes on mine as he came i will swear fealty he announced his voice echoing full in the vaulted room he sank to his knees beside ygerna lots example amazed the kings even more than ygernas they stared in disbelief as i did myself however two against all the rest is not enough to make a man high king but custennin had stepped forward too i will swear him fealty he called in a loud voice and the next voice to break silence was tewdrigs both men knelt before me and were joined by their chieftains eldof of eboracum and rhain of gwynedd came next with their advisers and all swore fealty and knelt ceredigawn and his men did likewise had it been another time or another man it might have gone differently though i believe that what happened that bright morning was ordained from the beginning dunaut and morcant and their contentious ilk were strong they would never bring themselves to bend the knee to me and i knew it as it was the kings were divided in their support of me and more were against me than for me i could not be high king and no no i did not desire it nevertheless i had the support of good men now at least i had leave to act lords and kings of britain i said taking up the sword many among you have proclaimed me high king many others have not cried dunaut everyone knows you have not lifted so much as a knifeblade in years i ignored him and though i could persist in furthering my claim i will not this stunned nearly everyone and emboldened dunaut who called i say we must choose one who is not afraid to raise the sword in battle i did not let this go unchallenged do you think me afraid does anyone think myrddin emrys afraid to use this weapon as it was intended if that is what you believe step forth and we will put your faith to the test no one was foolish enough to accept my challenge so it is as i thought i told them you believe otherwise you know it is not for fear that i have refrained from taking up the sword but because i learned the lessons of war long ago that a man can kill only so many enemies so many saecsens so many picti so many irish and then there are more saecsens more picti more irish and i tell you that though rivers run red with the blood of the foeman and skies blacken with the smoke of their burning corpses they cannot all be killed i felt a stirring in my blood words began to burn in my breast this sword is britain i declared lofting it my claim is no less worthy than any other lords and better than some yet i am not the man to hold it he who holds this sword will hold britain and he must hold it in a firm and unfaltering grasp therefore from this day i will put away the sword that i may serve and strengthen him who must wield it but i tell you the truth this sword will not be won by vanity it will not be gained by arrogance or stiffnecked pride and it will not be won by one man advancing himself over the bodies of his friends the imperial sword of britain will be won by the one king among you who will bend his back to lift other men it will be gained by the king who puts off pride and arrogance who puts off vanity and puffedup ambition and takes to himself the humility of the lowest stable hand it will be earned by the man who is master of himself and servant of all these words were not my own the bards awen was on me now and like a fountain pouring forth its gifts unbidden my tongue gave utterance of its own volition i spoke and my voice rang out like sounding iron like a harp struck by an unseen hand bear witness all you kings these are the marks of the man who will make this sword his own he will be a man such as other men will die for he will love justice uphold righteousness do mercy to the haughty he will be bold but tender to the meek and downcast he will be a king such as has never been in this worldsrealm the least man in his camp shall be a lord and his chieftains shall be kings of great renown chief dragon of britain he shall stand head and shoulders above the rulers of this world in kindness no less than in valour in compassion no less than in prowess for he will carry the true light of god in his heart from his eyes will fly fiery embers each finger on his hand will be as a strong steel band and his swordarm judgments lightning all men alive in the island of the mighty will bow the knee to him bards will feast on his deeds become drunk on his virtue and sing out unending praises that the knowledge of his reign will reach all lands as long as earth and sky endure his glory will be in the mouths of men who love honour and peace and goodness as long as this world lasts his name will live and as long as eternity his spirit will endure i myrddin emrys prophesy this for the space of a dozen heartbeats no one dared speak against me but the moment passed the awen moved on a shout snapped the silence empty words cried dunaut i demand a sign coledac and others too joined in how will we know this king there must be a sign i suppose it was only the grasping of drowning men after straws but it angered me i could not abide them even a moment longer seeing nothing knowing nothing but the bloodred cast of rage i fled the church the sword still in my hand they all ran after me their voices bleating in my ears i did not listen and i did not turn back there in the yard before the doorway where the masons were at work on the arch lay the enormous keystone taking the hilt in my fist i raised the sword over my head no screamed dunaut wildly stop him but no one could stop me i thrust the sword of britain down towards that unyielding stone the astonishment on their faces made me look as well the sword had not broken it stood upright quivering buried nearly to the hilt and stuck fast in the stone epilogue some claim a hand appeared to grasp the naked blade and guide it into the stone others say a flash of light blinded them for a moment and that when they looked the sword stood in the stone however it was all agree the sharp stench of burning stone filled the air and stung their eyes you ask for a sign i shouted here it is whosoever raises the sword from this stone shall be the trueborn king of all britain until that day the land will endure such strife as never known in the island of the mighty to this time and britain shall have no king so saying i turned at once and made my way through the shocksilenced crowd no one called after me this time i returned to gradlons house and gathered my things while pelleas saddled the horses but a short time later pelleas and i rode alone through the narrow streets of londinium we reached the gate passed beneath the wall and turned onto the road the day was far gone the sun burned yellowgold in a fading sky we paused on a hilltop to see our shadows stretched long behind us reaching back towards the city but it was not in me to turn back no let them do what they would the future our salvation lay elsewhere so setting my face to the west i rode out in search of arthur
