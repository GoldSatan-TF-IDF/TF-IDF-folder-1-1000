sam barone conflict of empires bce the city of sumer on the great southern sea yavtar guided the sturdy ship through the swirling water of the tigris toward the sumerian dock now less than two hundred paces away that marked the end of the voyage on shore a crowd of idlers followed his approach ready to note the smallest mishap a portly man attended by two guards pushed his way to the forefront as yavtar edged the southern star ever closer he observed the yellow sash tied across the mans bulging stomach that marked him as one of the kings representatives most likely the dockmaster arms folded the man reached the head of the last empty dock and stood there awaiting the ships arrival for this important mission yavtar had traveled day and night racing downriver from akkad to sumer in less than four days now he almost regretted the haste as he had to bring the star ashore at midday the peak of dockside activity since he hadnt made a single stop along the way this would be his first landfall in almost four months a sailing master who spent more time on land than water soon lost his skills so yavtar swallowed his pride and muttered a prayer to the river gods to help him achieve a safe landing the southern star s extra length she stretched almost twentyfive paces from stem to stern made her unwieldy in crosscurrents if he misjudged the current when he turned the star toward land the swiftness of the water could drive him downstream stern first accompanied by laughter and catcalls from shore having to come about and pull upwards against the rivers flow would be a humiliating and slow arrival yavtar gauged the moment then leaned hard on the steering oar forcing it against the current and almost broadside to the flowing water drop the sail he barked a crewman stretched out his arm and jerked hard against the restraining rope the square linen sail slid down with a thud pull you dogs pull the four crewmen grunted against the sweeps their bare feet straining for purchase as the star edged closer to the shore the force of the river churned against the length of the hull the vessel canted over as the pressure increased and through his feet yavtar felt the ship pitch up and down against the conflicting forces of water and oars he caught a glimpse of his five passengers huddled around the ships single mast and clutching at it for support their eyes wide with excitement the southern star began to swing around and now the bow was less than fifty paces from the dock for a moment yavtar thought hed waited too long his hand twitched with tension gripping the steering oar with all his strength as the tigriss powerful current sought to roll the ship over and send the crew and their valuable cargo tumbling beneath the water he forced himself to wait one more moment then planted his feet firmly and pulled the steering oar in the opposite direction in oars spray splashed over the star s bow and yavtar feared she might roll over an instant later the river relented as smooth as a leaf floating on the current the ship glided alongside the dock and slid gently into its berth with the slightest bump against the ropewrapped stanchions yavtar allowed himself a brief smile despite more than two months since his last voyage his eye still hadnt lost the skill acquired in nearly thirty years on the river two crewmen leapt onto the dock to secure the vessel fore and aft the moment the star stopped moving the early summer heat struck down from the cloudless blue sky like a hammer well done shipmaster daro said joining yavtar at the stern i thought we were going for a swim at least you didnt give those hooligans anything to hoot about daro and his four soldiers were the passengers the star carried though that term didnt explain their presence they were there to protect the ships very secret and valuable cargo not bad for a farmer yavtar agreed with a laugh not that anyone thought of him as a farmer especially now that he owned the largest number of ships in akkad his vessels carried cargoes on both the tigris and euphrates as yavtar approached his fortieth season he traveled less and less on the great tigris the river that only a few years ago had carried him into battle with lord eskkar and brought him so much wealth now he preferred to spend more of his days on the large farmstead south of akkad purchased with his victors profits and surrounded by his two wives and a growing brood of energetic children nevertheless yavtar still felt the urge to experience water flowing beneath his feet so he often accompanied more valuable cargoes if for no other reason than to keep a watchful eye on his hired shipmasters this trip despite the worth of its goods had other more urgent reasons for bringing yavtar downriver is this vessel from akkad the dockmasters abrupt words brought yavtar back to the present and he lifted his eyes to the wharf the officious man with the yellow sash had advanced onto the dock his bored guards still in attendance and now stood frowning down into the boat looking up yavtar perceived the mans stomach in all its glory bulging against his tunic from too much food and too little labor im yavtar owner of this boat and do you come from akkad the way the dockmaster uttered the name of the city turned a simple question into an insult yes by the order of king eskkar we carry the only king i know is king eridu of sumeria the man said not bothering to hide the disrespect you will discharge your cargo as soon as possible only you and your sailing master will be permitted to leave the dock or enter the city if any of your crew steps onto shore he jerked his head toward the riverbank theyll end up as slaves the border disputes between akkad and sumer had intensified over the last few months and now affected routine trade yavtar glanced toward the city walls and saw a handful of soldiers standing just outside the gate he counted ten men and their commander and before any cargo is landed king eridu has decreed a fee of three silver coins to be paid yavtar frowned at the outrageous price on his last trip to sumer little more than a year ago the dockmaster had charged only a single silver and that was more of a personal bribe than anything official and what do i receive in return for this large sum you are permitted to use the dock until dusk tomorrow by then you must be on your way or you will be charged another three silvers the man said smiling broadly at yavtars discomfort if you cant afford to pay take your ship and your goods back to your barbarian king behind yavtar the crew and the akkadian soldiers who guarded the cargo began to mutter at the slur the last thing he wanted was trouble then it is my pleasure to make payment yavtar said he climbed onto the wharf reached into his pouch and withdrew four silver coins and perhaps you could dispatch a messenger to fetch merchant gemama meanwhile i would be most grateful if you could order your work crew to carry the cargo off the dock im certain merchant gemama is waiting most anxiously for his goods yavtar dropped the silver coins in the dockmasters open palm the extra one would find its way into the mans private pouch and since i am my own sailing master i will need one of my guards to accompany me in sumer after a quick scrutiny to verify their quality the coins disappeared very well one servant may accompany you into sumer ill send a slave to gemama the dockmaster turned away and negotiated his way through the crowd until he reached the awning and chair that awaited him on the riverbank as the man settled into his seat he gave orders to the overseer of the work gang at the slavemasters command they shuffled wearily toward the akkadian craft yavtar jumped back into the boat where his four crewmen waited hand up the cargo to the slaves and make sure they dont spill anything dont let any of them into the boat or the dockmaster will accuse us of trying to steal them he stepped closer to his crew you heard what he said about staying on the dock you might as well stay on board unless you want to spend the rest of your lives in sumer the transfer of goods began the bulk of the cargo was specialty foods peas sesame seeds exotic dates spices and sacks of the finest wheat for breadmaking all products in short supply in sumer at this time of year once satisfied that his crew could manage the unloading yavtar turned to the leader of the soldiers my crewmen will keep the kings goods under their eyes until gemama arrives with his gold you make sure nothing happens to that pouch the vessels real cargo a doublebound leather pouch with a thick strap now hung from daros shoulder he nodded and fingered the sword at his side well keep it safe yavtar and tell your men not to stare at the guards on the shore were not here to pick a quarrel with the sumerians the crew continued unloading passing the bags sacks and bundles to the slaves on the dock yavtar watched the proceedings with care counting each and every item from habit the master crewman did the same the workgang slaves had to be watched carefully of course a dropped sack a slit cut surreptitiously into the side of a sack and goods would disappear in a blink besides merchant gemama would recount and reexamine each item before he took possession and the numbers would need to agree before payment would be arranged the specialty goods would fetch a very good price but then would come the real haggling over the ships true cargo the leather pouch guarded by daro and the akkadian soldiers contained lapis lazuli the finest to be found anywhere in the land the precious stones had traveled a long and dangerous journey from the distant and almost unknown eastern lands to akkad the profit from that sack alone would more than triple the gains made by the rest of the cargo the bulk of the southern star s cargo soon rested on the dock master gemama arrived only moments later attended by his own porters and three armed guards his bald head shone in the sun and he carried almost as much weight around his stomach as the dockmaster ah yavtar good to see you old friend he shouted as he climbed down into the boat its been a long time since youve landed here a safe journey i hope smooth and fast just the way i like it yavtar smiled at the sumerian merchant who also wore a yellow sash over his linen tunic marking him as a kings man they had known each other for more than twenty years trading arguing and bargaining the whole time yavtar trusted the man as much as anyone could ever trust a sumerian the haggling over the regular cargo went quickly and yavtar negotiated a bit more than he expected no doubt gemamas way of giving thanks for the speedy delivery after the gold exchanged hands gemama lowered his voice and you have something special for me come and see yavtar gestured toward the akkadian soldiers standing beside daro no not here gemama said glancing around well take it to my house afterwards youll join me for dinner yavtar hesitated the gems should be examined here at the dock and the price established and agreed to once on shore anything could happen gemama could even change his mind the sumerian saw the hesitation no nothing like that he lowered his voice ill meet your outrageous price whatever it is but id rather not have everyone in sumer know whats arrived yavtar rubbed his black beard for a few moments the rare gemstones no matter what their worth really mattered little his true goal was to obtain information very well he moved closer to gemama lowered his voice and named his price half on account and half in gold done said gemama without a single protestation ill return with the gold as soon as i get the regular shipment secured before yavtar could change his mind gemama dashed off his guards and porters scurrying behind him everyone keeping a watchful eye on the slaves shuffling under their burdens damn these devious sumerians anyway yavtar muttered is anything wrong daro asked moving to stand beside the trader no nothing you just guard that pouch and dont let anything distract you from it or the gold when it arrives and youll have to stay awake all night thieves sometimes slip onboard from the water snatch what they can then dash away in the current and dont let anything that happens on shore distract you either thats another old trick in the game the gold will be safe noble yavtar daro said yavtar believed him the hawk clan could always be relied upon and daro had proven his worth many times yavtar glanced at the shore the officious dockmaster continued observing every detail so yavtar smiled at him then sat down in the stern to wait he used the time to study the busy dock with its throngs of hurrying people sumer appeared fully as bustling as akkad only under a hotter sun a splash of water from over the side cooled his face and he dangled his hand in the river enjoying the push of the current here only a few miles from the great sea the tigris still had power though much of its strength had diminished as the river divided again and again into evernarrower channels those channels spread into dozens of streams that all emptied themselves into the vast body of water that marked the southern boundary of these lands sumers inhabitants in their pride now called it the sumerian sea as if they alone ruled its vast expanse the sun had time to move a hands width across the sky before gemama breathing heavily and with his pate covered in sweat returned accompanied by his bodyguards ordering his men to wait on the dock gemama stepped cautiously down into the now much lighter boat and walked unsteadily to the stern where yavtar waited daro the leather sack still slung over his shoulder moved to join them gemama reached inside his tunic and withdrew a fat linen sack that jingled as he handed it to yavtar fifty gold coins most of them akkadian so dont blame me if theyre shortweighted the rest are from my own goldsmith newly cast so i can guarantee their purity another fifty coins are marked in my ledger for whatever you wish to buy for your return voyage give gemama the pouch yavtar said accepting the coins and daro from now on dont take your eyes off our gold yavtar handed daro the sumerian merchants sack in return daro slid the leather pouch from his shoulder and offered it to the sumerian good then thats settled gemama said now we can return to my house he slung the pouch over his neck letting it hang down beneath his left armpit and grasped the bottom with his hand a thief would have to rip the pouch from gemamas arm and neck before snatching it gemama climbed cautiously off the boat joined immediately by his guards the largest led the way shouldering the crowd aside with ease yavtar saw that dozens of eyes followed them as they left the dock moved across the open space and entered the city of sumer everyone even the dockmaster would be guessing about the contents of gemamas leather pouch wondering if it held gold silver or precious gemstones yavtar walked at gemamas left and the remaining two guards followed behind everyone alert for any danger the little party moved swiftly through the crowded lanes dodging children dogs and the occasional cart yavtar heard gemamas labored breathing as he kept up the rapid pace the sumerian probably well over fifty was getting on in years and nowadays probably did nothing more strenuous than walking to and from the docks after two futile attempts at conversation yavtar gave up and concentrated on his surroundings gemamas house lay almost half a mile from the docks and that through the oldest part of the city with its narrow and refusefilled lanes that twisted and turned back on themselves inside sumers walls the distasteful odor of too many people and animals living too close together blotted out even the scent of the sea that wafted up from the south yavtar noted the bustle of the crowds and the stalls of the merchants who seemed to occupy every available space all of them calling out the worth of their wares to every passerby in the last few years sumer had grown almost as rapidly as akkad and now it matched the northern city in the numbers of its inhabitants untouched by the barbarian invasion in the north thousands had migrated to sumer and the other villages that nestled in the rivers delta everywhere yavtar gazed new homes and shops were under construction much of it paid for by akkadian gold for overpriced goods needed during the barbarian invasion tallest of all near the center of the city stood the house of king eridu surrounded by walls more than seven or eight paces high not really a house but a large complex of buildings barracks for the kings guards storerooms and dwellings for the servants and slaves who attended their master the walled compound provided security for the king and his followers yavtar saw soldiers pacing along the walls parapets and another half dozen hardeyed men guarded the main entrance the king apparently wanted to make sure he and his family had as little contact as possible with the rest of sumers inhabitants a bare pole rose up from the highest point of the walls when in residence a large yellow banner would hang limp in the moist air announcing king eridus presence lady trella would call this place a palace yavtar decided a compound built to showcase the glory and power of sumers ruler the vast structure sent another and not very subtle message that king eridu didnt care about the rest of sumers people as long as he and his possessions remained protected they reached gemamas house and passed through the interior courtyard where flowers bloomed at the base of the outer walls and a goodsized tree shaded a long table pushed up against the side of the house a fat lamb already turned on the fire pit beside the entrance in sumer most of the cooking and food preparation took place outdoors as the summer heat made any such work indoors too unpleasant gemamas wife and two daughters were presented to yavtar but he scarcely had time to mouth a few words of greeting before the sumerian led the way upstairs and onto the roof a small table beautifully carved sat under a wide white awning a mix of red and yellow flowers floated in a bowl with his guards watching the house and the grounds from below the merchant and his visitor enjoyed their first private moment let me examine the stones first gemama said settling in his chair with a deep breath of relief he took his time unfastening the cord that bound the sack then spread the opening wide carefully he removed its contents each lapis stone wrapped in its own square of linen there are twentyeight stones yavtar offered not all the same size but some are truly magnificent gemama unwrapped each stone lining them up in three rows by approximate size the intense blue color drew the eye and the tiny gold flecks sprinkled within the stones glinted in the fading sun incredible he said ive never seen anything of such excellence before these came from the indus youre certain nothing of this quality is to be found in these lands yavtar said you know nicar the merchant his son lesu traveled to the east and back took four months lesu started with forty porters and guards but lost almost half his men to bandits and thieves only twentytwo returned even then he might not have made it but king eskkar sent soldiers to the edge of the mountains to wait for his return and escort him and his goods back to akkad how many stones did he bring back yavtar shrugged nicar didnt say yes im sure he didnt well as long as the akkadian doesnt flood the market with more gems it doesnt really matter gemama returned his attention to the stones he took his time examining each murmuring an occasional word of praise for every special attribute these gemstones are worth the lives of fifty men he said when he finished his inspection when polished and set into amulets and pendants they will make any woman willing every man a rod anyone who can afford the price will want one even the grindings will be collected and sold used to heal wounds and keep the limbs healthy yavtar knew the lore as well though he had his doubts about the stones effectiveness as an aphrodisiac still what a man believed often became the truth gemama set down the final lapis with a sigh when you quoted your price on the ship i had my doubts but after seeing these one hundred gold coins seems very reasonable i would have expected to pay more much more even after gifting a few of the finest to king eridu ill still earn a handsome profit well i can certainly raise the price if youre concerned gemama ignored the jest and raised his eyes to meet yavtars pulling his chair a bit closer to the table perhaps there is something else you need something i can do in return for akkads and your generosity yavtar nodded well i would like to learn what i can about king eridu and his plans for sumer if i had time to poke around the city myself i would but i see that akkadians are no longer welcome here besides i must leave sumer by sunset tomorrow so i have little time the sumerian lowered his voice king eridus plans are secret no one not even the leading merchants know all that he intends and revealing what little i know could bring trouble down upon my house i understand but a little gossip between old friends and it might be possible to arrange another shipment of lapis lazuli in a few months a more private shipment one that perhaps will not pass through the eyes of the dockmaster gemama took his time thinking over this subtle proposition the dockmaster had certainly noted the wellguarded leather pouch hence the need to gift a few of the lapis lazuli to king eridu a private delivery perhaps concealed within a sack of grain or jar of oil would be even more profitable he weighed the risk against the chance of future profits i suppose old friends could gossip among themselves as long as it remained among themselves i will talk to nicar about another shipment of lapis it will be smaller say a dozen stones but im sure it can be arranged soon and perhaps at a much lower price gemama smacked his lips then took a deep breath you are wise to learn what you can how else can an honest trader prepare for the future but what little i know will not help you or akkad you arrive too late i fear too late too late for what by now everyone knows about the bandits raiding the borderland between akkad and sumeria in the last few months eridu has assembled a strong force of wellarmed horsemen these are the bandits pillaging the lands claimed by akkad yavtar couldnt keep the surprise from his face as far as he knew no word of this had reached akkad is king eridu with them who can say eridu dreams of conquest and loot these days he might want to partake of the glory himself well i expect that any fighting will be over soon yavtar said no doubt king eridu knows by now that lord eskkar has marched south with a large force of archers and horsemen to confront the bandits raiding across the akkadian border ah the border that is in dispute who is to say where the border starts or where it ends and perhaps your king eskkar may find getting rid of the bandits not such an easy task king eridu left the city ten days ago with over a hundred soldiers most armed with spears and shields twice as many more are promised to join him within a few days all recruited and armed from the other cities with these men and his horsemen eridu intends to establish a new border one that places all the fertile cropland to the north under sumers control yavtars eyes widened in surprise a force of three hundred soldiers supported by a large band of horsemen would find eskkar greatly outnumbered if eridu had departed ten days ago the two forces might have already fought a battle if not the battle would be fought soon long before yavtar could return to akkad and dispatch a warning he realized the silence had dragged on it was more than a year ago when akkad established its southern boundary no one in sumeria disputed it then at that time king eridu was busy consolidating his influence over sumer and the other sumerian cities gemama said now that he has their allegiance willing or not the six cities of sumeria now claim they need the rich northern farmlands to feed their growing numbers six large villages made up the heart of sumeria not really villages any more yavtar knew but full sized cities each with at least two or three thousand inhabitants sumer had grown into the largest of them all but larsa uruk isin nippur and lagash all contributed to the wealth of the region he hadnt heard that the other cities had submitted to eridus authority joined together they would form a powerful trading region able to draw on trade from the tigris and euphrates as well as the boats that crept along the coast of the great sea if their fighting forces united if eridu had accomplished such a feat the southern cities would present a formidable threat to akkad hmm do all the other cities accept eridu as their king gemama chuckled well its only happened in the last few months and its not something anyone talks about nor does eridu claim to be their king not yet but as he says he is now the first among equals in truth i think he feels a bit jealous at lord eskkars success too many people have been singing akkads praises for driving off the barbarians and some in the countryside thinking they will better themselves have migrated north to place themselves under akkads protection eridu intends to put a stop to all that so it will be war then yavtar shook his head in dismay and this time the war would begin with eskkar walking into a trap trading will be the first casualty not our trade to the east and west that will continue without interruption it will likely even increase and once king eridu establishes his claims over the disputed lands the regular trade with the north will quickly resume im sure the crops and herds from those lands will then move south not north rulers came and went but the traders and merchants always found a way to exchange goods gemama spoke the truth trade would start up again sooner or later no matter who won the battles and the people of sumer are they as eager for war as their ruler the people do as they are ordered gemama lifted his shoulders and let them drop for the last year eridus followers have blamed every shortage every outbreak of disease every problem on akkad the priests seers and even the merchants repeat the same message by now most of the citys inhabitants accept it as truth eridu has plenty of lackeys in his pay to spread the word and enforce his will all of them eager to partake in any profits that will arise he has already promised much of the northern land to his supporters war i fear has already come it may already be over by now if your king eskkar doesnt retreat to akkad yavtar had much the same thought and you friend gemama what do you think of all this i think that all this fighting is foolish the sumerian said it would be easier and cheaper to trade for crops than wage war to seize the land and then have to hold it one lazy soldier costs more than ten farmers but if king eridu wins a quick victory over lord eskkars forces then eridus reputation will be enhanced and profits will grow for everyone in sumer quick victories are not easy to gain over akkad yavtar said ive seen lord eskkars soldiers fight everyone knows of the skill of akkads archers but with all the resources of the six cities and their thousands of men at his disposal eridu will soon rule most of the land between the rivers perhaps even as far north as akkad in time it may be that your citys new walls cannot withstand so many king eridu is not at akkads gates yet yavtar said with more conviction than he felt those who wage war against king eskkar may find themselves losing more than they could ever hope to gain win or lose i must take care of my trading house and my family like everyone else in sumer i had no choice but to give my full support to king eridu for which privilege i am allowed to continue my trading ventures and permitted to give one tenth of all my profits to him a heavy price what if the fighting continues and he demands more i pray to the gods for a quick end to the fighting though i warn you old friend that eridu and his soldiers seem very confident of victory his second in command razrek knows how to fight apparently theyve been planning this for months gathering men weapons and horses talking in secret with the leaders of the other cities even eridus son shulgi plays a role in all this in fact many of the soldiers trust the son more than the father who is this razrek the name meant nothing to yavtar a former bandit who grew powerful by killing all of eridus enemies on the trade routes over the last few years i was fortunate not to compete with eridu in those days he sighed hopefully the war will not last long he noticed gemama didnt pray for any particular side to win the merchants words conveyed a grim optimism about the war gemama was no fool and he knew the numbers of soldiers sumer and the other cities could field that knowledge must have convinced him that king eridu would emerge victorious yavtar kept the growing sense of uneasiness from his face lord eskkar had departed a few days before yavtar sailed expecting to confront bandits and marauders not a welltrained enemy by now defeat could have struck akkads forces and the king himself might already be dead a war will provide profits for many yes for some gemama agreed especially in the short term but if the war drags on eridu will demand more gold from all of us prices will rise and the people will have less to buy goods im sorry for all this old friend yavtar said should you need anything a few lapis lazuli will keep me in king eridus favor for now at least but in the future who can tell perhaps one day i may wish to move to akkad myself he smiled at yavtar across the table well there is nothing more i can tell you but i think youve learned what you came for at least our business is well concluded now it is time to feast the lamb should be fully cooked by now and there is some fine wine cooling in my cellar my thanks to you gemama you will always be welcome in akkad though i think i will return there with a heavy heart but with a full stomach the sumerian extended his arm across the table and a head swimming in wine yavtar clasped gemamas arm the ageold gesture of friendship then let two old friends celebrate a successful voyage may it not be the last one for either of us that same day the afternoon sun drifted toward the horizon as eskkar ruler of the city of akkad galloped his horse down the gentle slope to rejoin his commanders and their men tall and powerfully built he carried a long sword slung over his shoulder dark brown hair fastened with a strip of leather almost reached his shoulders people seldom noticed the thin scar scarcely visible after so many years that marked one cheek instead their eyes were drawn to the broad face and strong jaw that marked him as a child of the northern steppes his grim countenance and penetrating brown eyes tended to make strangers uneasy in his presence they sensed a remnant of the fierce barbarian that still dwelt beneath the surface eskkars face provided no clue to his thoughts in his long years as an outcast and wandering sword for hire hed learned to keep his emotions from showing but eskkars companion and bodyguard grond who rode beside him had less control over his features frustration showed clearly on his face after leaving akkad it had taken five days of hard traveling to reach the border and take up the pursuit then for three more days eskkar his akkadian archers and a small force of horsemen had searched the low hills and gentle valleys for the bandits who had terrorized and ravaged akkads southern border the soldiers had waded through high grass or rocky ground as they trudged up and down the headlands in pursuit of the band of horsemen who somehow managed to stay just out of reach the chase had wearied everyone the eight days of constant marching at such a fast pace had taken its toll even on their sturdy legs eskkar and grond reached the base of the ridge and rode toward the akkadian soldiers most lay sprawled about on the ground winded from a long climb up yet another in the seemingly endless hills and grateful for every chance to rest only hathor the egyptian remained mounted waiting for eskkars approach hathor commanded the thirty horsemen that comprised eskkars mounted force theyd spent most of the day searching for the bandits or riding patrols to prevent an ambush the rest of the akkadian force consisted of eightyone archers are the scouts back yet eskkar hooked his leg over his horse and slid to the ground handing the halter to one of the camp boys who dashed up to take the kings mount the boys who had no status and received no pay followed the soldiers and helped tend to the horses all for the privilege of helping akkads fighters hathor glanced toward the rear of the column where the last two of his scouts had just crested a hilltop theyre coming in now captain the soldiers who had fought beside eskkar the last three years called him captain from the days when hed been captain of the guard the city dwellers in akkad called him lord eskkar while those in the surrounding villages called him king those who merely disliked his rule called him an uncouth barbarian his enemies used worse language some claimed he was a demon summoned from the deepest subterranean fire pits by his witchwife to carry out her sinister commands whatever men called him all respected his ability to not only lead men but to win battles all these names and titles held some truth to them born a barbarian hed fled his clan in his fourteenth season when his family perished in a blood feud hed killed one of the executioners stabbing the man in the back as he killed eskkars younger brother for more than fifteen years he wandered the lands of his hereditary enemies the dirt eaters he suffered abuse and contempt each day expecting some ignoble death to strike him down but somehow managing to stay alive as he survived each crisis he grew stronger and more skillful until the day came when he feared no one the chaos of a barbarian invasion had changed his fate eskkar rose to captain of the guard and with luck and advice from his new wife united the people of akkad and drove off their attackers with the defeat of the invaders the citys inhabitants pleaded with him to be their leader ruler of the largest city in the land little more than two years had passed since that day but new challenges arose to replace the ones vanquished and each morning brought another struggle for survival by now eskkar had ceased to fear the future or worry about the present each day was a gift from the gods and a chance to defeat one more enemy and a new adversary seemed to arise at every turn whenever men prospered others appeared with a sword in hand always ready to take what they had not earned themselves the two scouts reached the head of the column dismounted and joined eskkar and the others we saw more bandits coming up from the southeast captain alexar commanded the main force of archers now his face showed his concern i saw another dozen following our line of march to the west eskkar said probably more theyre following us on either flank with more at our rear with the forty or fifty weve seen they already outnumber our horsemen hathor said who knows how many more are waiting up ahead i dont like it captain alexar said theyre leading us on staying just out of our reach eskkar too recognized the signs all along the southern border they found dead bodies farm houses and crops burned to the ground and the land ravaged beyond all reason with each grim discovery eskkars anger grew along with the determination to make these raiders pay for their incursion even barbarians didnt wreak such havoc they might kill many men and take their women but they left most of those they ravaged alive so that they could be looted again on some future raid by now eskkar and his commanders realized that the socalled bandits were anything but instead of scattering or fleeing at eskkars approach they yielded ground slowly staying well away from his force of archers and confident in their superior number of horsemen they retreated in only one direction southward with each passing day the situation had worsened as more and more of the enemy showed themselves commanders follow me eskkar ordered he strode a hundred paces away from the men and sank to the ground on a grassy swell a lone tree provided some welcome shade from the late afternoon sun and honey bees buzzed at the nearby flowers one by one his commanders grond alexar hathor mitrac klexor and drakis joined him sitting knee to knee as they completed the circle looking at their faces he saw the same anger and frustration that burned in his own belly he had chosen his commanders well all were hawk clan members and proven in battle the hawk clan formed the elite corps of akkads soldiers after a nearfatal skirmish in the early days of the struggle against the barbarians eskkar and the few survivors of that first contact had sworn a solemn oath of brotherhood to each other and to eskkar who had saved their lives and led them to victory in those days most of his followers had been outcasts themselves men without family kin or clan the creation of the hawk clan changed all that providing each member with a new family eskkars own in akkad everyone recognized the bravest of the brave for only through valor in battle and the acclaim of his fellow warriors could a man become a member of the hawk clan to wear the hawk emblem on his chest was the greatest ambition of each fighter that served in akkad the goal that each soldier sought above all else the binding promise each man swore united them as brothers and pledged their loyalty to eskkars leadership as head of the hawk clan this new force of battletested warriors now joined in bonds of brotherhood turned out to be eskkars single most important contribution to defeating the barbarian horde for what brave man could abandon his brother in time of need or fail his family when danger threatened the clan linked each man to every other and promised a haven of safety when advancing age or wounds meant they could no longer fight against eskkars enemies as they fought together the bond between the hawk clan grew deeper having gained their trust and respect eskkar repaid it by making sure his commanders and even his newest recruit knew not only what he intended but what he was thinking that knowledge made them confident of his leadership and established that same trust in each other eskkars proven ability not only to fight but to lead men into battle enabled him to rely on simple instructions and to avoid complicated strategies even in the chaos of battle with his close commanders he felt certain they had the ability to carry out his orders act independently if necessary and improvise where needed that closeness made them a unique group of warriors who not only thought as a band of brothers but fought as one too almost as important to eskkar none of them would hesitate to speak his mind its time to decide what we face and what were going to do eskkar began weve been chasing these riders for three days and still they elude us whatever city sent them larsa sumer maybe even isin needs to be taught a lesson in these lands and with a force that large ill wager that these bandits are sumerians or at least in their pay the city of larsa had the most to gain from the border lands and their history of raiding akkadian territory went back more than a generation but trella had a sufficient number of spies in that city and eskkar doubted their king naran could organize such a raid without her agents noticing isin farther to the south and west had a king bold enough for such an affair but king naxos hadnt launched any raids on akkads lands since he came to power several years ago that left the city of sumer ruled by king eridu meanwhile were moving further and further south alexar said and in another days march well reach the river sippar that will put us south of our own border and into the lands of sumeria we dont have enough food or supplies to go that far south and if we did we would need to find some way to get across the river if these bandits or sumerians crossed over and took all the boats with them wed be trapped on the wrong side of the river and helpless no we cant go further south eskkar agreed we need to finish these invaders off once and for all he looked at mitrac who commanded twenty of the archers mitrac what do you think eskkar always started with the youngest of his commanders his wife trella had suggested that idea to her husband so that the youngest would not feel the pressure of contradicting their elders our men can keep up the chase for another few days if we can close within bowshot i dont care how many men they have so far the scouts have seen no sign of longbows we just need to get within reach so our bowmen can kill them klexor who commanded half the horsemen under hathor spoke next we cant get close with their scouts watching our every move the archers cant keep up with our horsemen if we try and chase the bandits i think we need to learn more about them how many mounted men they have maybe we should set a trap tonight for one or two of them wed have them by morning wed soon find out what they know even that might not tell us how many men were facing or what their leaders plans are drakis said he commanded twenty archers there could be hundreds of soldiers just waiting for us to come within their reach we move toward them they fall back and somehow increase their strength i agree with drakis there must be a large force of archers or soldiers somewhere nearby alexar commanded all of eskkars archers otherwise the tactics of these men make no sense why else would they linger near our force when they could just ride away eskkar turned to grond his bodyguard and what do you think i think theyre luring us into a trap grond answered without hesitation a large man even broader than eskkar hed been a slave in the western desert before reaching akkad somewhere up ahead where the ground is favorable for them theyll turn on us and attack weve little more than a hundred men if they strike hard enough and with enough men well be overwhelmed you need to find a way to get close to them and soon all eyes went to hathor the last to speak a few years older than eskkars thirtytwo seasons he was the oldest of eskkars leaders while all the commanders recognized hathors ability many of the men and inhabitants of akkad remembered the past the sole survivor of the band of despised egyptians who had seized power in akkad hathor had fought against akkads forces hed escaped death first by chance and then by lady trellas intervention their horsemen hathor said outnumber ours at least two to one theyre wellarmed and mounted on animals as good as our own not what youd expect bandits or raiders to be riding if we have to engage a force twice our size without support from the archers it could get very bloody eskkar started to speak but hathor wasnt finished if we had enough men he said meeting eskkars gaze it wouldnt matter where we fought them but our enemies have counted our soldiers and still they remain close by readying themselves for the battle so they dont fear either our numbers or our weapons if were outnumbered it would be foolish to fight them at a time and place of their choosing that is the one advantage a smaller force cannot yield without a good plan of our own i say we should retreat march north toward akkad for a few days and send for more men and supplies all the other commanders dropped their eyes no one wanted to propose an embarrassing retreat and only someone with hathors experience and proven valor had the strength to make such a suggestion eskkar grunted first lets make it clear that these men are soldiers under good discipline that means theyre probably ready for whatever we do and they wont be afraid to face us in battle if we retreat they wont just let us go theyll nip at our heels all the way back to akkad if we let them attacking us at every opportunity by the time we gather enough men to confront them the countryside will be ravaged beyond repair and a whole growing season lost but hathor is right we must not fight on their terms we must select the time and place of battle and use it to crush them and how will we accomplish that trick grond asked we must do what they dont expect eskkar said theyve made their plans and theyre waiting for us to advance or retreat instead we must devise something different the first thing i want to do is stop moving south our men are tired from eight days of marching they need a rest anyway if they are to fight well so well stay right where we are tonight and all day tomorrow the next day well begin marching back north and at a good pace as if were afraid to remain this far south any longer he turned to hathor if you were in their place what would you do in response id send the horsemen to loop around us get in front of us hathor said without hesitation they could delay our escape until their main force of fighters if there is one closed up behind us with so many horsemen they could easily slow us down i agree eskkar said he let his eyes reach each man and saw that all of them even the dour egyptian had smiles on their faces they knew their commander well enough to know that he had something planned the idea that eskkar had mulled in the back of his head all morning had taken shape the gamble would be great and if his plan failed his entire akkadian force would be at risk nevertheless he couldnt come up with anything better he would put forth his plan his commanders would add their suggestions and improvements and when they were finished their confidence would unite them once again into a deadly fighting force eskkar returned their smiles heres what were going to do the first step is to convince our enemy that their plan is working every head leaned closer eskkar began scratching in the dirt with his knife soon stones and more knives marked the earth each signifying places where forces could be arrayed they talked and argued offered suggestions and criticisms their voices rose and fell with the heat of their emotions by the time the sun sank toward the western horizon the plan had grown complete as eskkar expected his experienced fighting men had expanded and improved his idea from a distance the rest of akkads soldiers watched in silence a few of the veterans had seen such a war council before and knew that a difficult and dangerous plan would soon put them in harms way but those same veterans looked unworried in battle after battle eskkar had always outwitted his enemies at least until now w hen the war council ended the akkadians camped for the night grateful and all the more relaxed after they learned they would not be marching tomorrow eskkar and his commanders huddled about the campfire reviewing and refining their plans when yawning slowed the conversation eskkar told everyone to get some sleep he took one last turn around the camp to make sure every man had prepared himself to fight in case of a surprise attack respectful of his adversaries hed readied his men for the possibility of a night or dawn raid finally satisfied eskkar rolled himself in his horse blanket and for the first time in five days slept as well as any of his men a strong guard kept watch over the camp and its horse herd whatever happened the horses had to be protected a night raid to stampede them would be ruinous in the morning eskkars commanders woke everyone well before dawn when the sun rose without any signs of enemies approaching he let his men break their fast though weapons remained close at hand afterwards eskkar and grond studied the land surrounding them those low hills over there grond said i think i saw movement along the crest eskkar grunted hed studied those same hills and hadnt seen anything i remember when i had eyes as keen as a hawk now i need others to search out any signs of life grond had five less seasons than eskkar though most people thought they were of the same age less than a mile away close enough to keep an eye on our camp and count our numbers swordplay will carry that far eskkar decided maybe you can swing a blade with klexor hes big enough to make plenty of noise grond laughed who gets to win klexors stocky body was the largest in eskkars mounted force hathor stood a bit taller almost as tall as eskkar but lacked the bulk to his body decide for yourself then you wont complain afterwards but lets start with the men and send out scouts to the north and west first that will give you and klexor time to prepare for battle the hilltops that probably contained the closest enemy scouts lay to the south and east and eskkar didnt want to disturb their vigil by sending outriders in that direction not long afterwards a fight broke out in the akkadian camp a dozen men began pushing and shoving fists swung and men staggered to the ground only to rise again and rejoin the fray the commanders quickly broke up the quarrel and the grinning men fell back on the ground trying to look properly subdued eskkar and grond looked on with satisfaction at the performance now you can try your hand with a sword im betting on klexor it would be close grond agreed but well put on a fight that should send the sumerians a message lets hope its the one we want them to hear on the day the akkadians took their rest razrek the leader of the sumerian horse fighters arrived at king eridus camp well after midday barrelchested with thick arms and muscled thighs razreks very appearance struck fear into most men his powerful jaw was halfconcealed by a dark beard and he wore his thick hair in a dozen bristling strands each one tied with a bit of leather that reached past his shoulders for those who heard stories or rumors about his past razreks deeds frightened them even more than his intimidating presence hed fought and killed his way across the length and breadth of sumeria not a rogue in his murderous band dared challenge him to a fight long before eridu proclaimed himself king of sumer razrek had murdered many of eridus enemies and razreks killings aided the ambitious trader in his rise to power two years ago at the height of the battle against the barbarians in the north eridu provided razrek with secret information about a valuable caravan returning from the indus razrek and his band of marauders attacked and robbed the caravan leaving no survivors the loot from that one raid had doubled eridus wealth and soon enabled him to dominate every other powerful merchant in sumer many suspected what had happened though only a handful of men knew the true story and none of them dared say anything today razrek rode into camp bringing with him a dozen veteran riders all heavily armed and wearing leather helmets and vests he guided his horse carefully toward king eridus tent his eyes studying the large force of foot soldiers taking their ease the king had made camp just north of the river sippar but well to the east of the usual crossings though early in the day at least a dozen cooking fires sent smoke trails into the sky and the smell of roasting meat permeated the air that brought a grimace to razreks face if they were his men hed have them working up a sweat training with their weapons instead of worrying about their suppers glancing around razrek saw more than three hundred men most sitting or stretched out on the ground as would be expected those who could still afford to do so occupied themselves by gambling for whatever coins or belongings they possessed a strong force remained on guard ready to repel any surprise attack from the akkadians and razrek grunted in satisfaction at seeing that hed warned eridu often enough to keep his men prepared and to continue at every moment with their training but as the sumerian king extended his sway over the land he tended to bristle at his troop commanders suggestions not that razrek cared what eridu thought of him or his ideas razrek cared only for the gold that eridu paid him with the promise of much more to come after the akkadians were driven back north and the borderlands seized for as much as eridu was paying him razrek could ignore some of the mans pride and foolishness a large tent the only one in the camp sat near the edge of the encampment close to a bubbling stream half a dozen soldiers guarded the tents billowy walls and four horses picketed nearby razrek dismounted and tossed the halter to one of his men i wont be long he strode toward the tent flap where two soldiers stood guard one on each side for a moment razrek thought they might try to stop him but one look at his brutal face and powerful frame convinced them otherwise razrek was after all the second in command he shoved the tent flap aside inside king eridu of sumer rested on a cushion two naked girls kneeling beside him offering him food and wine among other things a pleasant scent lingered in the air some perfume that must have come from the distant eastern lands tall and thin with a prominent nose eridu looked more like the merchant he once was rather than a warrior king his reddish brown tunic edged with an intricate design stitched on the collar was bunched up around his waist one of the girls held eridus rod in both hands brushing her breasts against its tip the second offered up a small platter containing dates and grapes for her masters consideration eridu spit out some grape seeds and glanced up in annoyance at razreks interruption you should not enter my tent without permission were not in sumer my king on the war trail such rules are best left behind we will return to sumer soon enough razrek the veiled threat was plain enough but razrek ignored it if i offend you my king i can take my leave im sure my horsemen and i can find another leader to serve perhaps we could offer our services to king eskkar its said that he too possesses much gold eridu bit his lip razreks horsemen were eridus most efficient force not to mention the threat that had convinced the other cities to cooperate with the king of sumer or have their lands ravaged he took but a moment to swallow his pride leave us eridu commanded shoving the girl away from his penis she snatched up her clothing and ran from the tent the other girl following he pushed his tunic down over his still swollen member what brings you here razrek arent you supposed to be readying your attack on the akkadians or have they turned back already as soon as both girls were gone razrek sat down facing eridu hitching his sword across his lap as he settled himself thats why ive come to tell you whats happening and to make sure youre ready to move against them razrek had sent a rider to eridus camp this morning with word that eskkar and his soldiers had ceased their march south that inactivity continued to bother razrek all morning and he decided to report to eridu himself to make sure that the king of sumer understood the import of eskkars action or lack thereof the akkadians show no intention of breaking camp theyre resting their men and the few scouts they sent out all rode to the north and west that might mean they intend to move out to the northwest this morning a quarrel broke out among the soldiers not long after another fight started with two men hacking at each other with swords the commanders had to break it up my scouts could hear the shouting and clash of swords eridu shrugged they could have been training but all the better for us if they argue amongst themselves he said with satisfaction that will make my victory even easier razrek didnt bother to point out that it was his horsemen that kept eskkars forces from smashing eridus foot soldiers more than half recruited or conscripted in the last few months the sumerian king still didnt fully understand the importance of trained and experienced fighting men in a battle a merchant first and last he believed that numbers were more important than skill and discipline despite all of razreks efforts to convince him otherwise yes my king razrek said trying to be patient but this staying in one place is not what i expected from eskkar hes a barbarian who believes in closing with his enemy or giving way that is the way the steppes horsemen fight they attack when they have the advantage in numbers or retreat when the situation is unfavorable to them when eskkar does neither then i worry eridu selected a plump date from the platter beside him he didnt bother to offer any to his visitor eskkars men are tired perhaps he is just resting them before he decides to retreat we can wait one more day without food he cant stay where he is while we have plenty of supplies and if he comes south he falls into our trap the chosen battleground is but a half days march from here by midday tomorrow ill be there waiting for him once he enters that valley we will destroy him razrek hesitated eridus words made sense but still razrek felt uneasy it may be as you say but i came to warn you to stay vigilant keep your men ready for anything eskkar is cunning and by now he may even know about your presence still if the akkadian doesnt start moving tomorrow morning i will try and engage his horsemen to see if i can lure them away from the archers my men are keeping a close watch to the north ill double the men on watch tonight we wont be surprised razrek you can be certain of that and ive trained them hard enough these last few days while you took your ease with your women razrek thought then my doubts are resolved my king ill send word in the morning as soon as i see which way hes moving good if eskkar continues to come south well meet him at the ambush site if he decides to return to akkad you will have to slow eskkar down until my soldiers can fall on him from behind by then his men will be growing weak from hunger the sooner we finish the barbarian off the quicker i can claim these lands and get back to sumer razrek rose of course my king ill return to my men and leave you to your pleasures he gave eridu a brief bow and swept from the tent outside razrek found his second in command mattaki frowning at eridus guards while he waited for his commander anything new mattaki handed razrek the halter no but at least ive warned him hell start moving north in the morning which should be safe enough hell still be at least a good days march from the akkadians maybe more unless he learns how to drive his men faster eridu should have brought his son with him the men would fight harder for the son than the father isnt shulgi too young for this thats what eridu said shulgi has almost seventeen seasons razrek said he helped recruit and train most of these men and he knows how to swing a sword which is more than eridu can say so why didnt he bring him and risk sharing the glory if eridu beats eskkar he can claim to be a great warrior king with sumer and control of the river under eridus thumb and the border area opened up all the other cities will fall to their knees and accept his leadership thats why eridu wants this victory so bad he can taste it while we do all the work and take all the risks mattaki said spitting on the ground thats what youre getting paid for besides we outnumber eskkars forces almost four to one even if we lose half our force crushing him well still come out with plenty of gold and we can always recruit more men mattaki said he received a share of the gold eridu paid for each new farm boy eager to become a soldier in a moment both men were back on their horses and razrek led the way as they galloped through the camp heedless of eridus soldiers who were forced to leap out of their path nevertheless razrek couldnt shake the feeling that something was wrong hed spoken to anyone and everyone whod ever been to akkad or knew anything about eskkar this inactivity didnt fit the barbarians history attack or retreat it was the only tactic the northern warriors knew and the only ones eskkar had ever used if the barbarian didnt start moving tomorrow razrek would launch an attack on eskkars cavalry force his hand somehow razrek knew how important it was to keep eskkar offguard and his men on edge even if eridu didnt the king had conveniently forgotten that it was razrek who had planned this whole campaign months ago and so far everything had gone as he envisioned the border raids helped train razreks horsemen even as they looted the countryside and razrek grew rich in the process word of the attacks brought eskkar rushing south and the staged retreats drew him ever closer to the ambush site another days march south and the akkadians would be destroyed king eridu would rule all of sumeria and its surrounding lands and razrek would earn all the gold hed been promised nevertheless razrek fretted with so much at stake he didnt dare wait any longer if the barbarian didnt start moving razrek would attack eskkars forces and either drive him south for the quick finish or follow his retreat north for the slow death either way the akkadian force would be destroyed and with a little luck their king would be among the first to die after taking a full day and night of rest the akkadians collected their horses and weapons and prepared to move out scouts galloped off in all directions but stayed close to the main force of archers eskkar didnt want to offer any tempting targets to the enemy horsemen as long as the riders stayed within easy reach of the bowmen they should be safe enough before the akkadians could begin the march pushing and shoving broke out among the ranks instead of restoring order hathor and alexar began arguing their voices rising until they stood face to face shouting at each other hathor struck alexar in the chest with his fist and the two men grappled soldiers shouted encouragement to their respective commanders and a ring of cheering and shouting onlookers formed around them both commanders drew their swords the clash of bronze against bronze once again echoed out over the grassland as the two fighters weaved and shifted eskkar let the performance go on for a dozen strokes before he halted the brawl stepping between the two and shoving them apart raising his voice he rained down abuse on both combatants to the cheers and shouts of the men the noise from the brief swordplay would have alerted any spies watching their camp and eskkars bellows would have carried almost as far the sumerian scouts would report a second day of continued dissension in the akkadian ranks satisfied eskkar ordered his commanders to break camp and get the soldiers moving hathor and klexor split the thirty horsemen between them and moved out ahead screening the archers they headed north back the way they came alexar and the bowmen followed the leaders of ten moving up and down the column of soldiers as they marched reminding them to look weary as if theyd already been beaten in a fight eskkar ordered a steady pace but he rested the men much more often than he had in the last eight days at midmorning they turned off their own tracks and headed westward taking a different path than the one theyd followed when chasing after the bandits with grond at his side eskkar now led the way at the head of the archers the countryside here wasnt entirely unfamiliar his horsemen had scouted the countryside yesterday and some of the archers and riders had lived in these lands before moving to akkad as the first of his scouts reported back eskkar listened to each report and he picked the next part of the march with care the survival of his soldiers might depend on the path he chose through the hills and valleys that led to the west not long after the akkadians turned westward enemy horsemen appeared brazenly on the hills behind them as if tempting the retreating force to turn and give chase eskkar ignored them determined to avoid wasting his mens strength pursuing riders who simply rode away his main worry this morning remained the possibility of an ambush sooner or later the sumerians would get in his path and attempt to halt his force hopefully his change of direction westward would keep them off balance for the rest of today at midday eskkar gave the order to halt beside a small stream and the men sank to the ground while they ate stale bread some removed their sandals and soaked their feet in the water while a few splashed their faces and hands eskkar ordered that every water skin be filled the countryside around them had been stripped bare of food and flocks by the enemy horsemen only a few loaves of stale bread remained to fill the akkadian soldiers stomachs by tomorrow even that would be gone and real hunger would set in nevertheless eskkar no longer worried about food that would soon be the least of his mens needs after a longer than usual break the akkadians abandoned the pleasant little stream and resumed their journey the men trudged through the low hills and sparse grassland the ground grew a little greener with each step nearer to the tigris still a few days march away when dusk approached eskkar gave the order to halt the campsite didnt appear very favorable no stream meandered nearby just a halfmilewide expanse of thick grass surrounded by low hills nevertheless the seemingly haphazard choice had been selected with care it had to serve eskkars purposes as well as his enemies the men still had chores to do before they could rest eskkar made sure they collected plenty of wood and chips and soon crackling fires sent smoke trails skyward warming the men though they had little to put in their cooking pots the scouts had seen no game during the days march eskkars marching orders kept the scouts close to the bowmen and meant they had no opportunity to hunt as on the previous night extra guards were posted and a strong perimeter established the last thing eskkar wanted now was for his enemies to attack in force during the night grond brought over a small loaf of bread that hed soaked in the last stream they crossed eskkar took half and had to force the tasteless mush down for once eskkar didnt bother making the rounds of the camp his commanders knew what needed to be done instead he gathered his blanket and tried to get some rest stretching out on the ground and turning his back to the setting sun though he lay there unmoving his mind raced with thoughts about the coming action as dusk gathered eskkar managed to doze off though he slept fitfully as he always did the night before a fight when grond woke him night had fallen and the stars shone bright overhead the fires already burned low barely kept alive by soldiers tossing a few sticks on them now and again eskkar took the hand grond extended to him is everything ready yes captain the men have already started slipping away theyre waiting for us grond seldom wasted words which might explain why the two had become good friends as eskkar slung his sword over his shoulder hathor slipped up beside him my men are ready captain eskkar looked around the campsite men still moved about and blankets still circled the dying fires grond and hathor had let him rest as long as possible youre sure you have everything you need yes hathor said good luck to you and your men and good hunting to you with a final clasp of his hand on hathors shoulder eskkar disappeared into the darkness following grond hathor klexor and all thirty horsemen would remain in the camp tending the dying fires acting as pickets and trying to make themselves look as if they constituted all of the akkadian forces and praying to the gods that the sumerians didnt decide to attack tonight a hundred paces from the nearest fire eskkar found the rest of his men waiting silently for his arrival the seven horse boys were there as well scattered throughout the archers to make sure they kept silent hed considered leaving them behind but knew what their fate would be in the morning though sitting on the ground the archers had formed a double column each man a long stride apart from his nearest companion and ready for the long night march the chill in the air made more than a few shiver every bowman carried two quivers full of arrows thirty shafts in each every fifth man carried a water skin but that burden would be shared as they marched in a few hours most of it would be gone other than their swords and knives the archers carried nothing else no food no cooking pots nothing theyd already eaten the last of the food morning might herald a long day of hunger and thirst with the grim possibility of a fight to the death eskkar moved to the head of the column lifting his eyes he studied the sky and located the north star he would keep that at his back before long the moon would rise but by then eskkar and his force of archers intended to be well away from their campsite which would remain in place to reassure those watching the akkadians movements with luck he and his men would soon be far from the camp and any spying eyes it wouldnt be a full moon tonight but should shed enough light to help mark the trail at least eskkar hoped it would tell the men to move out grond pass the word to each man with that order eskkar had committed himself and his men to the risky plan he waited until he felt certain the order had time to reach the rear of the column and then started walking south back along the trail theyd followed during the day grond passed the order then disappeared ahead into the darkness he had the most dangerous assignment tonight with two men both experienced hunters grond would scout the way south and make sure eskkar and the rest of the men didnt blunder into any enemy sentries now eskkar had plenty to occupy his thoughts his men would worry about the spirits and demons that prowled the land searching for living bodies to carry back to their caves beneath the earth no one liked to travel at night eskkar however ignored any fears about the hunters of the underworld since childhood he had heard many stories of people taken during the darkness but he had never seen a demon himself if they hadnt bothered any of his enterprises until now he doubted the evil spirits would choose tonight to try and carry off a few of his men instead eskkar worried more about someone tripping and breaking a leg or stumbling over a bush and spraining an ankle any sound or movement could alert the enemy sentries who might still be posted somewhere nearby watching the akkadian camp in the past eskkar would have led the men himself but he knew his eyes had lost some of their keenness in the dark better to let another with sharper sight lead the way than for eskkar to stumble and fall embarrassing himself in front of his men eskkar didnt intend to allow his pride get in the way of his plan waradi one of the youngest archers and raised in the hill country west of akkad had been assigned the lead waradi moved out ahead eskkar right behind the soldiers gathered strength from his presence and from the knowledge that he took the same or greater risks as any of them eskkar ordered every warrior to follow three paces behind the man in front of him that should be close enough to maintain contact with the man ahead yet far enough apart so that if someone tripped he wouldnt take the man ahead or behind down with him the first few hundred paces would be the most dangerous if the enemy saw or heard them and sounded the alarm eskkar would have to call the whole plan off and return to hathor and his horsemen then they would have no choice but to fight their way north alexar drakis grond and the other commanders would have warned the men over and over about the need to keep silent watch where they stepped and keep the proper distance nevertheless eskkar kept glancing behind him finally he realized that the more he fretted about his men the more he stumbled himself swearing under his breath he concentrated on the ground before him that first part of the long night march moved with maddening slowness eskkar worried that the enemy had detected them might even now be gathering strength to attack still as the akkadians moved farther away from the camp their chances of being seen lessened all that mattered now was maintaining his place behind waradi and keeping silent in that way step by step the column crept through the darkness and despite the occasional stumbles no alarm was given waradi moved back beside eskkar i think were safe enough weve traveled at least a mile from the camp no sign of grond no not yet he might be far ahead eskkar who tended to worry over every thing that might go wrong had little concern for gronds safety the man was made of bronze and it would take more than a few men to subdue him if grond encountered any of the enemy the noise would carry over a great distance in the still night air speed up the pace waradi yes captain waradi said risking the familiarity usually reserved for eskkars closest friends and commanders eskkar grunted he turned to the man behind him pass the word were picking up the pace each man whispered the order to the man behind him soon eightyfive men and the horse boys were stretching their legs at a fast walk risking the occasional stumble over a rock or patch of high grass a broken leg or even a sprained ankle would mean a man out of the fight and eskkar needed every archer he had thankfully the moon had risen shedding a bit more light to mark both the hills around them as well as the ground beneath their feet they kept moving covering the dark ground as fast as they could only when eskkars own legs protested did he halt for a brief rest every man sank to the ground glad to be off his feet nevertheless eskkar paused only long enough to let the men catch their breath the archers legs would just have to suffer they resumed the grueling march all too soon the moon rose to its highest point and began its descent eskkar estimated that they needed to cover at least fifteen or sixteen miles to reach the sumerian camp and of course that assumed that a sumerian force existed and that this unseen enemy had moved north to pursue the retreating akkadians if that held true eskkar was still gambling his enemy would camp at the most likely place where the small stream would provide plenty of water still for all eskkar knew they could have marched ten or twenty miles in the opposite direction back toward sumer walking through the blackness eskkar wondered if his march was anything more than a fools errand the plan that had seemed so reasonable yesterday now seemed more like a dangerous gamble that would put the akkadians in harms way if dawn arose without their encountering the enemy he would have wasted more than just a long and dangerous nights march hathor and the horsemen would be miles away possibly in as much danger as eskkars archers and some of his men would gaze at him before looking away wondering about their leaders ability the thought of looking foolish in their eyes always bothered him look into the mind of your enemy trella had often advised him and try to think as he does that single piece of advice from his beautiful wife had accounted for more of eskkars good fortune in battle than anything else so he placed himself in the enemys mind and tried to think like the leader of the sumerian force behind him if the sumerians wanted a fight they would follow his trail chasing after him as fast as they could and counting on their large force of horse fighters to slow the akkadians down until they could be caught from behind now the long string of assumptions seemed tenuous eskkar forced such thoughts out of his head it was too late now to have qualms about appearing foolish more thoughts of trella jumped into his mind he always worried when he left her behind though he knew she was safe enough akkad now had sufficient soldiers to man the extended walls more than enough to repel any attacker and to defend trella and their son sargon from any assault from within with old gatus guarding the city and bantor protecting trella eskkar felt certain he had little to concern himself about in that regard those two were his most trusted and loyal followers and both would defend trella and her son while they had breath in their bodies he shook his head angry at himself for letting his mind wander now was not the time to be wasting thoughts on trella instead eskkar turned his mind toward the coming fight he still didnt know for certain who or how many he would be facing sumer deep in the sumerian south had yielded little information to trellas few informants in the last six months they had gathered some rumors of war and of men training to fight loose talk provided only a rough count of their numbers and eskkar estimated that eridu could have as many as two hundred men under his command if supported by a strong force of horsemen king eridu might be tempted to attack the border whatever enemy eskkar faced in the morning he guessed he would be outnumbered at least two or three to one but that fact didnt trouble him if he could achieve the surprise he intended it wouldnt matter how many men his unknown opponent had but if eskkar didnt come to grips with the enemy if the campsite by the stream lay empty eskkars split forces would be in deadly danger hathor would be lucky to rejoin the bowmen without a fight again and again eskkar forced the everreturning doubts from his mind dawn would answer all these questions as he strode along he remembered another night march from almost ten years ago that time eskkar and a band of fighters led their horses guiding the nervous animals through another long night of darkness luck had favored him then and he closed with his enemy just in time for a daybreak raid through their camp now eskkar had to hope tonights march turned out as fruitful as the one long ago waradi stopped short raising his hand to halt the column behind eskkar the line of men stumbled and muttered at the sudden cessation of movement to eskkars ears the noise sounded loud enough to wake the demons below captain its grond waradis voice carried just enough to be heard a few dozen paces away eskkar breathed a sigh of relief pass the word for the men to halt grond reached eskkars side giving his captain a hug of delight were making good time mitracs hill is just ahead my two scouts are on the far side watching but so far weve seen nothing eskkar digested the news his archers had covered nearly twothirds the distance to the stream best of all they werent lost or marching in the wrong direction good then we can increase our pace again he moved back down the column until he reached mitrac and his group of handpicked archers mitrac were here gather your men the young archer had only nineteen seasons but had more experience killing men than anyone in akkad including his captain his bow had brought down countless numbers of barbarians bandits and invaders and even eskkar stood in awe of mitracs skill with his chosen weapon soon twelve of the archers stood behind mitrac all of them facing eskkar at least you dont have to walk any more eskkar said in a feeble attempt at humor mitrac and his men would be left behind to act as a rearguard and slow down any pursuit good luck to you captain mitrac answered is there anything else you need eskkar wanted to say more but there was nothing more to say everything had been discussed yesterday on the march up no captain mitrac said you should keep moving well catch up to you later in the day good hunting to you then he turned to waradi get the men moving theyve rested long enough with muted groans the column started off once again eskkar had time for a glance behind him at mitrac and his men the young archer had risked his life a dozen times but always at eskkars side now mitrac might have to face an unknown number of enemies and eskkar hoped he hadnt sacrificed one of his most loyal followers still another dozen archers probably wouldnt make much difference in the morning but here if they could slow the enemy horsemen they would strike a hard blow of their own the column of soldiers now reduced to seventynine men and boys pressed on once again grond went on ahead to rejoin his two scouts their station would be at least a quarter mile in advance alert for any signs of the enemy eskkar couldnt be sure but estimated his men had no more than four or five miles to go to reach the camp site he glanced up at the heavens the moon seemed to move faster now across the cloudless sky dotted with uncountable numbers of stars the march continued and the ground grew rougher and more men stumbled or tripped as they tired eskkars legs ached from the strain and he heard the labored breathing of the soldiers behind him they had covered several miles since their last stopping place better to halt now and let the men rest for a few moments waradi well stop and rest pass the word to halt then see if theres anything up ahead alexar moved up from his post at the rear of the column he joined his leader and sat down on the grass with a grunt of pleasure everyone was feeling the strain i left drakis in charge of the rear captain he glanced up at the sky not much longer to sunrise alexar offered eskkars temper flared at the innocent words but he caught himself alexar meant no criticism of his leaders plan well if we cant reach the camp by dawn then all the men can enjoy a good rest i meant i know what you meant alexar eskkar said softening his tone well give it one more push if we dont find anything well build a camp of our own and wait for hathor to join us that was the plan in the event of failure or as much of it as theyd worked out they would need food and water and only the horsemen could bring that and then only if they could avoid the enemy horsemen in fact eskkar and his men would be trapped wherever they were weary and helpless with scarcely any food weve still got time alexar said though i thought wed have reached the stream by now eskkar glanced up at the moon it was fading about to dip below the horizon not long after that dawn would come weve rested long enough lets get the men moving with a long sigh of soft murmurs the column climbed back on its feet and started moving by now eskkar had no idea of how far theyd come or how much farther they had to go captain captain waradi rushed back to the head of the column one of the scouts myandro he came back he says he thinks they saw a glow in the night up ahead that might mean a single campfire but eskkar doubted any scouting party would burn a fire all night long only a large camp full of men would do that to keep some fire available during the night should an emergency arise lead the way waradi eskkar said alexar get back to the rear and keep the men moving tell every one of them not to make a sound or ill cut their tongues out myself in moments and despite his orders whispers of the sighting swept down the length of the column waradi and eskkar pushed the pace even harder the race against dawn continued but now at least the akkadians had some hope it would be crushing to reach the enemy camp and find them awake and preparing for battle the archers moved quicker now covering the next half mile almost at a trot then waradi halted the column myandro one of gronds advance scouts loomed up out of the shadows captain there are campfires up ahead at least three of them myandro said less than a mile from here as soon as we saw that grond sent me to find you he and ishme are waiting there watching the camp a fires light could be seen for miles at night you saw none of their sentries eskkar bit his lip as soon as the words were uttered myandro a hawk clan warrior had proven himself as one of the finest night hunters in akkad if the scout had seen anything of importance he would have spoken no nothing if they have sentries posted theyre staying close to the camp lets keep moving men eskkar said speaking just loud enough to reach the archers now clustering around him their camp is just ahead without waiting for a reply eskkar started jogging south myandro flashed by and raced ahead into the darkness with scarcely a sound coming from the thick grass beneath his sandals while waradi retook the lead position stretching his own legs to keep pace with eskkars longer limbs eskkar didnt stop jogging until he saw the glow of the fires up ahead then he slowed to a fast walk breathing hard a horseman born and bred he hated walking let alone running even after all those years living as an outcast among villagers and farmers eskkar still believed the farthest a warrior should walk was the distance from his tent to his horse villagers who possessed few horses had grown accustomed to walking great distances nor did they need many horses living as they did jammed together in villages with every man and animal within touching distance he glanced up at the sky the moon had faded to a mere speck but there should be just enough time to reach the enemys camp myandros figure again appeared out of the darkness well need to be silent captain he warned every sound carries farther at night were close enough now that they might hear us coming just get us into position before the sun comes up eskkar whispered the akkadians resumed their march moving slower now and exercising caution with every step they all followed myandro who led the way toward the base of a low hill when eskkar and the men started to climb myandro gave the order to halt keep the men here captain he said you come to the top of the hill soon eskkar waradi alexar drakis and myandro lay at the top of the hill facing south grond and ishme were already there waiting for them but one look over the crest told eskkar everything he needed to know the enemy camp lay less than a quarter mile away outlined by the fading glow from three watch fires eskkar could even make out the dozen or so trees that lined the tiny stream at this late hour the guards hadnt bothered to replenish the flames with dawn so near even assuming they had any firewood left the size of the encampment surprised eskkar he could even make out the hulking shadow of a large tent on one side of the camp after one quick look eskkar raised his estimate of the enemy facing him to at least three hundred no wonder the enemy felt confident enough to challenge akkad we wont be able to get a good count until dawn alexar said thinking along the same lines it doesnt matter eskkar said a hundred or a thousand we have to attack if nothing else we need the food and water do you think they have any guards this far from camp alexar had lifted himself up on one elbow to better scan the landscape i havent seen any grond whispered ive been watching but the only sentries i see are those pacing the camps perimeter but theres at least ten of them guarding this approach lets see how close we can get before they spot us eskkar said its the end of a long nightwatch and their sentries will be tired alexar you and grond go back and tell the men what is up ahead i dont want any of them falling down the hill because theyre gawking at the campfires come on grond alexar said excitement in his voice well bring them up a dozen at a time eskkar rose and crested the hill the sentries would be unable to see this far into the blackness and every glance toward the campfires would reduce their night vision he moved across the grass feeling his way until he reached a point about two hundred paces from the camp as close as he dared go without risking detection he stopped and waited until grond crept up with the first group of men spread out along this line eskkar ordered extending his arms he kept his voice low so that he couldnt be heard a dozen paces away well wait here until dawn time seemed to race by and the eastern sky began to lighten little by little the akkadian line extended as each group of men joined them when all of them were in place his line of seventy bowmen stretched more than a hundred paces eskkar walked up and down the rank of men whispering to each one telling them one last time what they were to do and what to expect no one showed the slightest fear at the prospect of attacking an unknown force more than three or four times their size these archers knew their trade and knew what devastation they could wreak on unprepared men with everything ready eskkar found he had time for one more set of orders he gathered the seven horse boys around him boys remember what i told you spread out and stay a dozen paces behind the archers your task is to kill any of the enemy wounded use your knives until you can pick up a sword just stay behind the line and keep silent i dont want the archers to hear you shouting behind them you might frighten them a few giggled softly at the thought the boys ranging in age from twelve to fifteen were nearly wild with excitement and fear yes lord they whispered and just as important i want you to keep an eye on our rear if anything comes up behind us you must let me know at once can you do that yes lord well watch the rear good then good hunting to you if you do well youll have a full share in any loot we capture captain grond approached its almost light eskkar strode back to the center of the line drakis take the right side alexar the left grond and i will take the center keep the men moving forward and keep the line as even as you can he drew his long sword from his sheath and raised it in the air it wouldnt be needed for some time but it would do to mark his place in the line so that every man would know where their captain stood and could look to his position for orders if need be the men had already strung their great war bows each one almost as tall as the archer holding it arrows were loosened in the quivers and swords made ready for welltrained soldiers these preparations took only moments so often had they practiced them then the men had a chance for one final rest most sank to one knee but a few squatted down while they waited for the order to advance the enemy camp was awakening now the sleepy sounds of men knowing that dawn approached the cooks already up the leaders of ten and twenty starting to move about yawning as they shook the sleep from their own eyes the first rays of the sun crossed the hill behind eskkar illuminating the land before him with a soft glow the sun wouldnt be directly behind his men but at least his archers wouldnt be staring into a rising sun the time had come start the men moving eskkar said extending his blade straight toward the enemy camp up and down the line seventytwo men stood nocked an arrow to the string and started walking forward long strides that covered plenty of ground the fatigue from the long night march had vanished the prospect of closing with their enemy gave every man renewed strength from his position at the center eskkar glanced to either side the line remained as even as could be expected rippling in places for a few steps before the men regained their position the archers paced forward in silence still in the deep shadow cast by the hill behind them fifty paces then one hundred someone in the camp gave a shout but eskkar knew it didnt matter now another thirty steps and he gave the order halt shoot seventytwo arrows flew through the air the sentries went down some struck three or four times another volley was already on the way as the archers loosed their shafts as fast as they could at this range less than seventy paces from the edge of the camp it was almost impossible to miss and even when they did fail to hit the intended target the shafts were just as likely to strike some other sumerian stumbling to his feet in the rear confusion swept over the camp men still halfasleep stumbled to their feet to find arrows hissing through their ranks wounded men screamed in pain as the heavy shafts pierced arms and legs everyone seemed to be shouting orders and eskkar knew that would only add to his opponents panic any enemy who picked up a bow was targeted at once the distinctive silhouette easily noticeable even in the halflight of dawn the twang of the bowstrings and the buzzing of the shafts tearing through the air could be heard even above the din coming from the camp eskkar used waradis bow to keep the arrow count as soon as the archer had launched his tenth shaft eskkar gave the order to advance while he kept moving up and down the line encouraging the men to take their time and aim their shafts the line surged forward another thirty paces the archers shooting as they walked before eskkar halted them he wanted the sumerians to fall back but he also wanted to keep them in a close killing range just far enough away so that the akkadians couldnt be rushed by a desperate counterattack another dozen volleys swept into the milling crowd all discipline gone with the arrival of the deadly arrows that struck a man down with savage force at such close range forward another thirty paces he shouted on the run with a shout the men jogged forward the line still fairly straight they reached the dead sentries and crossed into the camp itself the scent of blood and worse already thick in the air akkad akkad the archers shouted their battle cry as they drove the enemy back by now most of the bowmen had emptied their first quiver and began drawing shafts from the second select your targets eskkar bellowed his voice carrying up and down the line dont waste arrows he didnt want the men to run out of shafts until the sumerians broke completely forward another thirty paces forward the line surged again this time his men had to watch their step as the dead and wounded littered the bloodslicked ground behind him eskkar heard the horse boys highpitched voices crying out with glee as they hacked away at any wounded enemy that still moved horses bolted from behind the tent and eskkar saw four men riding away clinging to their mounts damn that would be the leader of the enemy escaping eskkar cursed himself for not telling a few of the archers to target the tents occupants or the tethered horses by now the akkadians had swept through half the camp and the sumerians gave up any attempt at defending themselves screams of the wounded rose up adding to the survivors confusion their leaders had abandoned them and now every man thought only about how to save himself everywhere eskkar looked he saw men throwing weapons to the ground and bolting to the rear he knew broken men when he saw them they would run and run until they fell exhausted to the ground the archers reached the far edge of the camp leaving only dead and wounded behind them they continued shooting their arrows angling the shafts higher into the air until everyone had emptied his quivers on the plain stretching to the south eskkar watched the surviving sumerians run for their lives escape from the deadly akkadian arrows their only thought halt there was nothing else he could do his men were too tired to chase after the fleeing men eskkar turned to face the camp the sun had just cleared the top of the low hills and he realized the entire battle had taken only moments each of his archers had loosed close to sixty arrows and it didnt take long for his akkadian bowmen to launch that many shafts bodies littered the ground most with arrows protruding from them wounded men shrieked out for mercy or water the smell of blood now mixed with the more powerful odor of vomit and human waste stores of food and piles of water skins weapons blankets cooking pots clothing helmets sandals and tunics lay scattered about kicked over and trampled in the confusion even if the enemy managed to regroup the survivors would have nothing to fight with and no food to sustain them drakis joined his captain and grond well done captain we caught them completely by surprise we were lucky eskkar said sliding his sword into its scabbard another battle fought without his needing to use it the few enemy who had offered any resistance had been cut down at once and he doubted if hed ever been in any danger well i for one hope that your luck doesnt run out im sure it will eskkar laughed and clapped drakis on the shoulder but not today at least you survived this fight without a wound in the last battle drakis had fought like a lion taken half a dozen wounds and nearly died he spent months recovering while healers hovered over him alexar arrived at almost the same time a big smile on his face another great victory captain weve only won half the battle he reminded them now lets get busy theres plenty of work to be done have the men collect their arrows first we dont want to be standing here with empty quivers if the sumerian horsemen arrive yes captain myandro put out pickets to guard the camp drakis have some of the men collect the weapons then count and drag off the dead gather the food and anything of value in one place grond come with me eskkar led the way toward the tent picking his steps through the bodies and waving off the already gathering flies he swept aside the opening flap grond ducked in first and eskkar followed big enough to hold seven or eight people and almost high enough for eskkar to stand erect the tent contained cushions a small chest two wineskins and scattered clothing a sword hung from the central post still in its scabbard our enemy travels well grond said kicking a cushion aside all the comforts of home must be some soft merchant who eskkar reached out his arm and pointed to the far corner of the tent something had moved under a pile of blankets grond drew his sword the blade rasping as it came out of the sheath come out now or ill gut you where you hide eskkar saw the top of a head then another he laughed again and let himself relax two women appeared clinging to each other eyes wide with fear young girls with probably less than thirteen seasons one covered her mouth with her hands and both trembled as they stood they looked like terrified children please dont hurt us master one said dropping to her knees while tears streamed down her face the other girl her eyes wide with fright couldnt mouth a word at least they could answer one question who is your master one girl swallowed our master is king eridu of sumer eskkar had to lean forward to hear the words he grunted in disgust at the name of the former trader turned king no wonder it had been such an easy victory get them outside youd better assign someone to guard them if theyd been a few seasons older eskkar would have turned them over to his archers as a reward now hed have to waste time and men to keep two useless pleasure slaves from harm the thought surprised him a few years ago he would have taken both girls himself even now if hed done any fighting the thought of burying himself in a womans flesh would have tempted him now he regarded them as just another problem to be dealt with living with trella more than satisfied his urges maybe theyll tell us something useful grond said when he returned yes im sure theyll know plenty about eridus rod and what wines he favors eskkar said i doubt if they have the wits to remember what he dined on last night remembering trellas advice he took a deep breath women even ones as young as these still heard everything their master said but youre right they may be helpful well get back to them later now theres work to do i want to be ready if the sumerian horsemen arrive in the morning razrek was up before the dawn inspecting his men and making sure they were ready for battle he too had doubled his guards for the night spreading them out around his forces and making sure his horses were protected the akkadians knew he was close by and razrek didnt intend to be surprised by a night attack especially after warning eridu to beware the same possibility the first rays of the sun had just lifted above the horizon when mattaki galloped up his horse snorting and throwing clods of dirt in the air as its rider pulled it to a halt razrek theyre gone all of them the akkadians have broken camp a feeling of dread washed over razrek the akkadians might be flanking him they could attack at any moment which way did they go south damn them mattaki said i said theyre gone i watched the last of them ride off at first light traveling fast and the archers gone as well i rode to the top of the hill but saw no sign of them they must have left well before dawn razrek clenched the hilt of his sword until his hand began to hurt what were our sentries doing sleeping again you were supposed to keep no i checked the guards twice last night and watched the akkadians myself they settled in for the night damn the gods they were all sleeping when the camp fires burned out then they cant be far ahead razrek took a deep breath no sense appearing worried in front of his men he hadnt survived so many years by panicking at the unexpected and his wits told him to think the situation through eskkar was a cunning bastard who always had a trick or two ready to spring on his opponents razrek realized it didnt make much sense for the foot soldiers to leave an hour or two earlier the akkadian cavalry would overtake them soon enough so what was to be gained by such a maneuver unless unless the archers had left long before the dawn could they have slipped away without his men seeing them go demons below razrek said theyre going back to attack eridus men he thinks hes pursuing the akkadians instead hell be walking into a trap impossible mattaki said the sumerians are at least twenty maybe twentyfive miles behind not any more if eridu marched north yesterday even his ragged band of cutthroats would have covered at least ten miles if eskkars men can cover twelve or fifteen miles during the night they can meet eridu at daybreak mattaki looked dubious could foot soldiers travel that far in the dark there wasnt much of a moon last night razrek wanted to believe they couldnt he knew eridus men couldnt manage such a thing but eskkars soldiers marduks bones these akkadians might razrek spat on the ground in anger eridu had better hope to the gods eskkars men cant reach his sumerians before dawn if he doesnt have a strong guard posted the fool might wake up with an arrow in his belly eridus men outnumber the akkadians by at least three to one more if their cavalry wont be there numbers wont matter to eskkar even if he cant destroy eridus soldiers hell maul them so bad theyll be ready to run home razrek looked up at the sky by now eskkars archers might be closing on eridus men get the men mounted all of them call in the scouts well have to ride hard to save whatevers left of eridus soldiers i just hope they can hold out until we arrive which route will we take to the east or west the shortest which means well have to follow the path the akkadians took were going to chase them are you mad theyll expect us to follow theyll set up an ambush for sure we should swing around them take a different route no time well have to take the chance razrek shook his head in anger besides its the sumerians eskkar wants to smash not us by now hes figured out who his real enemy is if eskkar leaves a strong enough force behind to ambush us he wont have enough to break eridus forces we only have to get to eridu before hes overrun and that means well need to take the shortest path youre going to get us all killed no at the first sign of an ambush well just pull back swing around them if their cavalry tries to follow well finish them off now get moving mattaki took only moments to get the men ready to ride razrek waited frowning at every delay he felt his own doubts rising suddenly he was dependent on eridus men holding their ground and he felt certain eskkar wouldnt gamble his forces like this if he werent confident of winning or would he king eskkar believed in luck that much was certain still even the akkadian might not be able to cover all that distance during the night he might be counting on engaging whatever force he encountered before razrek could arrive damn all the demons to the fires razrek swung onto his horse lets ride m itrac figured he had more than enough time to prepare his position even if the sumerian horsemen began their pursuit at first light the sun would be nearly halfway to its zenith before they reached this valley in fact they might not even come at all if they took another route to reach the enemys camp ground that would be the best solution mitrac knew because it would delay the horsemen even more and he wouldnt have to risk his men nevertheless he hoped the enemy would take the most direct route if the sumerian horsemen followed hathors trail then they would have to ride past mitrac and his archers eskkar and mitrac had marked this position yesterday on the march north theyd been searching for a place where a few archers might hold off eridus cavalry this gentle valley seemed a perfect place for the archers the dales walls were not particularly high or steep but the slope was long and would be tiring for any horse and rider at the valleys center the walls pinched in and a small hill jutted up a few dozen paces from the floor leaving only one narrow path that circled the base of the hill mitrac knew his archers could sweep the approach and then follow the horsemen as they rode past the hilltop might not be that imposing but it would slow down any horsemen foolish enough to try attacking uphill and overrunning the archers position unless mitrac corrected himself the enemy was willing to risk taking plenty of casualties best of all if the horsemen decided to avoid the killing zone and bypass mitracs archers the enemy would have to turn around and ride back more than a mile then find another trail south that would waste even more time his mission wasnt to defeat or even stop the sumerian horsemen only to slow them down and give eskkar enough time to finish off the foot soldiers if the enemy didnt take this route then mitrac would have to find a way to join up with eskkars archers mitrac and his band would be needed too especially if eskkar arrived too late to take eridus men by surprise all that mattered little now mitrac decided lets get to work he posted two guards on the top of the hill and the others descended to the base and started digging the akkadians had brought one bronzetipped shovel with them on the march south and mitrac had requested it he wanted to dig as many small holes as possible to help block the expanse between the foot of the hill and the other side of the valley wall the holes didnt need to be deep or wide half a swordlength deep would be more than enough to break a horses leg the men took turns with the shovel mitrac didnt want any of them getting their hands blistered and impairing their archery after eskkar and the commanders had worked out the plan mitrac had picked his own men hed selected those who could draw and loose a shaft as fast as humanly possible soon they were all sweating with the effort of digging at least theyd gotten some rest waiting for dawn to arrive mitrac took his turn like any of the men they passed the shovel from man to man while others dug with sticks or anything else they could lay their hands on soon the ground beside the hill was pockmarked with dozens of irregular holes scattered about his men had just a few more paces of open ground to dig when one of the guards gave a shout riders coming everyone scrambled back up the hill gathered their bows and strung them the quivers had already been laid out so that the shafts would draw easily by now mitrac could feel the earth shaking as the horsemen appeared at the far end of the valley as soon as the riders saw the hill they halted a few moments later one of them waved his arms its hathor mitrac shouted he gestured them to ride in guide them past hathors tall and lean figure was almost as recognizable at a distance as eskkars the egyptian and his men cantered toward mitracs position stopping when they reached the base of the hill mitrac and his men formed a line that forced hathor to funnel his men close to the valley wall in order to avoid the holes hathor waited until his men had passed through they wont be far behind me mitrac weve just another dozen holes to dig and well be ready if we get a chance ill send men back to guide you in not likely mitrac thought hed recognized the same look in eskkars eyes both men thought there was a good chance mitrac and his men would all be dead by noon good hunting hathor the egyptian nodded respectfully then kicked his horse and galloped off riding hard to catch up with his men mitrac knew that the akkadian horsemen had as dangerous an assignment as his own they needed to ride south at top speed to link up with eskkars archers at the sumerian camp hathors warriors would be the final blow on the sumerians the stroke that eskkar hoped would finish them as a fighting force with luck they might even get ahead of the sumerians otherwise they would follow their trail and try to hunt them down hathor would be facing plenty of danger of his own today if anything went wrong theyd be caught on tired horses in open ground the archers completed digging the last of the holes then on their hands and knees they spread grass over and around them trying to erase all signs of their work when mitrac felt satisfied that any oncoming riders wouldnt see the deadly holes until they were right on top of them he gathered his men atop the hill they formed a rough halfcircle that encompassed the hilltop swords were withdrawn from their sheaths and stuck into the earth mitrac gazed at each of his archers they looked nervous excited a few of the untested even looked scared but all them appeared ready to gamble their skill against those of the sumerians thirteen men would try to stop between seventy or eighty horsemen on open ground mitrac knew it couldnt be done not against a determined enemy and these sumerian horse fighters clearly knew their trade but the little hilltop might provide the archers with enough of an edge and all of his bowmen could loose four aimed shafts in the time it took a man to count to ten when the horsemen arrived they would have to decide their course of action either attack at once and in full force or turn aside and take the longer route south the waiting began mitrac realized he should have kept the men busy even if it meant digging more holes than needed the longer they waited the more time they had to worry and the more tense they got he tried to talk to them but quickly realized he was only making them more nervous with a shake of his head mitrac suddenly understood why eskkar always remained so grim and silent right before a battle better to say nothing he decided and just try to look confident this time they all heard the horsemen coming and the ground shook even harder than from hathors passage mitrac no longer cared and without realizing it he let out a sigh of relief two advance riders came into view they halted at the same place where hathor stopped as soon as they saw mitracs archers getting to their feet and readying their weapons in moments the main force joined the scouts and the troop halted at the top of the valley just out of range a heated discussion soon began as evidenced by the gestures of the riders mitrac smiled at their hesitation they didnt know how many men might be hiding just behind the hill for all they could tell all of eskkars archers could be here just waiting for the chance to slaughter their enemies that risk was too great to take the two scouts turned their horses and began climbing up the valley wall scrambling their way to the valley rim halfway up the horses stopped refusing to go any further and the men dismounted and made their way up the last hundred paces on foot from there they trotted along the valley rim until they could see behind the hill theyre afraid of our bows mitrac said as much to reassure his men as himself the two scouts continued along the crest until they could see well up into the valley beyond they were within range now and mitrac considered loosing a few arrows at them but decided not to waste shafts at such a long distance the two men turned suddenly and retraced their steps at a run soon they were slipping and sliding down the slope to where their horses waited mitrac possessed very good eyes and he used them to watch the two men report they spoke to a rider on a large brown horse with a splash of white across its chest and another man riding a gray speckled mount those would be the leaders without thinking mitrac took a quick count of his enemy at least seventy riders more than enough to wreak havoc in eskkars rear men when i give the word target those two riders he described both horses though he felt certain all his men had identified them by now two shafts from every man thats all but hold until i give the word now there was nothing to do but wait mitrac felt the excitement rising in his chest he told himself that it wasnt fear but that wasnt entirely true he and his men had nowhere to go if they left their vantage point theyd be run down his archers now had no choice but to stand together and defend this position the battle was set and the next few moments might determine his fate as well as the fate of all the akkadians y oure sure theres no more behind them yes razrek the scout replied breathing hard from his exertions we could see all the way up the valley and we saw fresh tracks so the akkadian cavalry must have just passed through were going to lose a lot of men riding through that gap mattaki said lets go back and ride around this valley eskkar weakened his forces to leave these behind even eridu should be able to hold them off why should we lose any of our men trying to get past a handful of archers they picked their spot well razrek said ignoring mattakis advice he studied the ground searching for any advantage by the time we ride around them the battle will be over there may not even be a battle mattaki argued if the akkadians havent reached eridus soldiers then well have wasted men and horses for nothing and if they have reached eridus camp eskkars archers and his cavalry will smash those fools against those odds mattaki shook his head and if they do its all the more reason to save our men and horses razrek shook his head no we cant take the chance even if eskkar attacks and pushes eridus men back our men can turn the tide of battle were going through damn you razrek what about the archers do we ride them down no half of us would never make it up the hill a few dead horses and the approach would be blocked theyd pick us off like flies well take our chances and ride through we might still be able to smash eskkars force even if he lost a quarter of his men razrek decided he would still have enough to turn the battle at the camp mattaki thought like a raider out for easy kills and quick conquests razrek perceived the real danger in the situation if eskkar broke through there was nothing to stop him from moving all the way south into sumeria to sumer itself if he wanted in that case razrek and his horsemen might need some luck to get back to sumer razrek struggled to control his horse all the animals had picked up the scent of fear and danger from his men and wanted to mill about the sooner they got past this handful of bowmen the better get our bowmen ready razrek shouted his horsemen had about ten bows the shorter ones that could be fired from horseback try and take a few shots as we ride through it took only a few moments to ready the men were going straight through he shouted now ride damn you ride t heyre coming mitrac smiled at the needless warning shouted by an excited young archer in his first battle ready your shafts men mitrac had to raise his voice to be heard over the hoof beats of the approaching horsemen but he kept his voice calm aim for the horses and remember to lead your targets almost the same words eskkar had repeated again and again at the siege of akkad bring the horse down and the rider is helpless either stunned or injured and suddenly on foot and unsure of himself an easy kill the swiftly moving horses moved into range loose mitrac gave the command and let fly his own shaft with just the slightest arch to reach the riders out in front thirteen arrows flew toward the onrushing horsemen galloping as fast as they could every rider hanging low over his horses neck well before the first arrows struck a second flight flew off the bowstrings target the leaders mitrac shouted the words with all his strength to be heard over the din of the horses he launched shaft after shaft at the enemy commander loosing as fast as he could fit an arrow to the string not all his bowmen remembered a few continued to shoot at the mass of riders but enough arrows flew toward the enemy commanders both riding on the far side of the valley and keeping the moving mass of horses and men between themselves and the hilltop nevertheless even with at least ten arrows launched at them in the first volley the two leaders rode through the humming shafts unscathed then mitrac glimpsed an arrow striking the brown and white horse in the flank the animal reared up its cry of pain unheard over the thundering hooves but mitrac lost sight of his prime targets now concealed by a mass of horses and men instead he shot his arrows as fast as he could aiming at the easiest target the first horsemen burst past the base of the hill mitrac swung his bow around and let a shaft fly he saw one then another horse go down caught by the holes even through the din of battle he heard the bones snapping and the animals cries of pain some of the following horses jumped the injured animals others swerved past them bumping and colliding in the narrow passage neighing and snapping their teeth in their confusion another horse went down screaming in agony its rider pitching forward to land directly in the path of the remaining riders crushed to death in an instant but most of the riders swept by though his archers followed their movement and continued to shoot arrows as fast as they could in the excitement mitrac had almost forgotten about the enemy commanders he didnt recall seeing either of the two horses hed marked ride past turning his gaze back up the valley he saw five horsemen still remaining obviously unwilling to chance the ride without the safety of numbers one pulled a dismounted rider up behind him and mitrac saw the brown and white horse sprawled nearby once theyd recovered their leader they took one look at the dead bodies littering the base of the hill they turned away and galloped back up the valley archers mitrac pointed with his bow at the retreating horsemen a few arrows were launched after them mitrac loosed four shafts himself and someones aim must have been good for one of the riders took a shaft in the back and pitched off his mount before the rest moved out of range good shooting men mitrac shouted he had separated at least one possibly both of the enemy leaders from their men that alone should slow them down especially if they had to decide what to do next satisfied mitrac looked around one of his men lay on his back an arrow in his throat another cursed steadily as two companions tried to remove a shaft that had penetrated his arm other than those two the rest of his bowmen were unscathed the wounded horses still cried out in their fear and pain a pitiful noise that concealed the cries of any wounded bandits finish off the wounded then put those injured horses out of their misery he shouted and dont forget to gather up your arrows he had no idea if the bandits would return but his men should be able to recover at least half the arrows theyd shot the archers descended the hill and started killing the enemy wounded a sword thrust in the neck finished them off the horses were harder to kill and took longer to die screaming like women under the clumsy sword strokes of the archers mitrac hated killing horses and their cries only made it worse mitrac heres a horse for you one of his men led a horse to the foot of the hill mitrac mounted the animal and began counting the enemy dead back and forth he rode guiding the skittish horse through the bloody grass littered with bodies the task took longer than he expected but at last mitrac returned to the base of the hill by then his men had captured two more horses and waited there for him how many eighteen dead men and twentythree dead or captured horses good shooting men they cheered at the news as well they should every archer had loosed at least ten arrows some as many as fifteen at the enemy cavalry mitrac did the calculation in his head at least a hundred and twenty to a hundred and sixty arrows had been launched with the loss of a single man his archers had broken the strength of the enemy horsemen even if those who got through reached eskkars forces the surviving sumerian horsemen would not be sufficient to overwhelm the akkadians and if the unhorsed enemy leader remained to the north he faced a long and hard ride to rejoin his men the plan had worked and mitrac felt proud that he had suggested it he might be the youngest of eskkars commanders but after this no one would ever doubt either his courage or his tactics and that alone made the nights walk and the mornings work worthwhile what happened a stupid question razrek knew as soon as the words left his lips but his head felt as if a horse had stepped on it for all he remembered maybe one had he found himself sitting on the ground his back resting against a large rock a rough edge pressed against his spine and razrek shifted to remove the source of the pain the movement sent a throbbing through his head he had trouble speaking and knew his thoughts were sluggish what happened ill tell you what happened mattaki mouthed an oath and spat on the ground they littered the ground with our dead and wounded your horse took a shaft and went wild you lost control and he threw you if we hadnt stopped to pick you up youd probably be dead by now razrek digested his subcommanders harsh words he remembered riding toward the hill as arrows struck all about him after that everything was hazy he must have fallen hard his shoulder hurt too he realized well then i suppose i owe you my life razrek said he looked around where are the rest of the men on the other side of the valley damn you mattaki shouted his face a hands length from that of his commander by the time we stopped to pick you up the men had ridden past we had to turn around and come back there was no chance of getting through i lost my horse trying to save your neck for a moment razrek stared at him his face empty of emotion then he realized what his subcommanders words meant were not with our men yes yes yes mattaki answered with at least a dozen archers between us and them well have to ride around now which is what we should have done in the first place razrek sagged back his head spinning again he lifted a hand and gingerly touched the side of his head a massive bruise met his fingers but he didnt feel any blood no doubt he was lucky to be alive without him leading them his men would find some excuse not to attack eskkars force theyd lost men and horses some would be wounded they wanted to hear his orders those reasons would be enough to stop them from moving farther south even worse razrek mattaki and the two men with them would have to swing round the valley a timewasting trip and then have to hope they could catch up with their men is it finally sinking in mattaki said with a sneer or is your head still addled damn you to the pits watch your mouth razrek held out his arm and mattaki pulled him to his feet for a moment he thought he would fall down but then the dizziness passed and he felt the strength returning to his limbs a sharp pain accompanied every movement of his head lets get moving the sooner we catch up with our men the better if they havent scattered to the four winds mattaki said his subcommander too knew what kind of men they commanded they fought for gold and loot and a chance to pillage for weeks they enjoyed nothing but easy raids on helpless farmers now they felt the reach of akkads arrows theyd look for any excuse to avoid a dangerous and unprofitable fight razrek managed to pull himself onto the spare horse whatever happened to the south he wouldnt be a part of it eridu would have to hold off eskkars forces on his own razrek just hoped the sumerian was up to the task lead the way mattaki was all he said there wasnt really anything else to say not until they linked up with what was left of their men and found out what had befallen eridu and his foot soldiers a s soon as he left mitracs archers behind hathor drove his men hard fortunately a day of rest and yesterdays easy march had refreshed the mounts at least enough to get one more days push out of them he alternated the pace between a canter and a fast walk the ground moving steadily beneath their hooves mile after mile passed as they followed the faint tracks of eskkars bowmen whenever he turned his head to the rear hathor saw no sign of razreks horsemen in pursuit yesterday when the commanders worked out the details of the plan hathor had argued strenuously over the role his horsemen were to play eskkar wanted to gamble everything on his archers reaching the enemy camp before dawn he wanted hathors cavalry to swing wide of eridus campsite slip behind the enemy and approach them from the south it would be a cunning move if everything went well but hathor convinced first the other commanders then eskkar that it was better to just follow eskkars men if the dawn raid worked as planned hathors cavalry should be able to quickly pick up the enemys trail and would save the extra miles of riding needed to get behind the sumerians the akkadian horses should still be able to ride down most of the fleeing soldiers but more important in the event that eskkars plan went awry hathors cavalry would be able to provide support most of all as hathor explained with all the energy he could muster he and eskkar would have a chance to communicate with each other the longer two separate forces stayed out of contact the greater the danger to both that thought finally swayed eskkar and he had grudgingly given in he had never fought a largescale battle with eskkar before but hathor felt reassured that his commander listened to his subordinates and didnt recklessly decide every issue himself satisfied with the new orders the egyptian looked forward to proving his worth and the worth of his horsemen then hathor remembered that he had fought with eskkar once before but not on the same side after eskkar spared hathors life it had taken a year before most of the akkadians accepted his presence and most of another year before they accepted his command now he had for the first time a chance to show what he could accomplish for king eskkar and hathor did not intend to fail the sun had climbed halfway to its zenith before his horsemen rounded another of the endless low hills and saw a lone sentry ahead the man took one look at the horsemen and disappeared no doubt running as fast as he could to spread the word hathor recognized the ground the stream is just up ahead down one hill and up another they saw the sumerian camp a quarter mile ahead of them a line of bowmen had formed up facing them but even at a distance hathor recognized the longer bows that only the akkadians could use so efficiently he slowed his men to a trot until he recognized eskkars looming figure standing at the center of the line its eskkar hes taken the camp a cheer went up from his men answered by one from the men in camp in a few moments eskkar was slapping hathor on the back practically pulling him down from the horse you did it i see captain hathor glanced around at the ruined campsite debris still scattered everywhere the bodies had been dragged away from the stream and the archers had pillaged every item the sumerians left behind searching for anything of value and adding to the litter that now covered the ground yes we arrived just in time another mile and wed have been too late as it was we hit them at sunrise he looked at hathors weary riders theres food for your men and a stream to water your horses and a dozen water sacks to carry with you if you want to carry them yes well take them they wont slow us down much before theyre gone eskkar nodded the sumerians have been running since dawn with no food or water most abandoned their weapons they cant have covered much ground on foot hathor understood eskkar always did everything as fast as he could drive his men and hathor we were right it is king eridu of sumer that were fighting apparently he raised up this army to capture the border he got away before we could stop him probably halfway to sumer by now hathor nodded that was eskkars way of telling him to be careful if the sumerians linked up with their horsemen they would still be a formidable force the riders stuffed stale sumerian bread into their mouths as fast as they could swallow while they watered their horses as hathor regrouped his troop alexar and two of his men came over they carried ten of the short bows that could be used from horseback and as many quivers in case you need them hathor he said the sumerians left them behind the brief rest coupled with food and water helped the men more than the horses but hathor didnt worry about that the fleeing enemy couldnt be far ahead and the weary horses still had at least that much distance in them they rode out at a canter following the broad track made by the fleeing sumerian soldiers the ground littered here and there with discarded weapons water skins food sandals and even clothing the horsemen had gone less than a mile when they came upon three wounded men too injured or exhausted to run any further hathors new bowmen finished them off scarcely slowing down in the process that happened again and again some of the wounded pretended to be dead but every sumerian received an arrow or two just to make sure the akkadians would collect the shafts on the way back the sun climbed higher in the sky and the temperature grew hotter as well the numbers of wounded sumerians grew fewer those strong enough to get this far would not have been injured but the lack of water would be taking its toll slowing them down and weakening their limbs a glance up at the sun showed midday would soon be upon them hathor crested a hill and saw a large group of sumerians ahead hathors men started to cheer silence halt not the slightest noise hathor scanned the low hills ahead of him about eighty or ninety men were grouped together some were already running but most stood their ground then he understood give me your bow he ordered the nearest horsemen carrying one of the captured weapons snatching the short weapon from the mans hands hathor raised it up over his head and waved it back and forth the rest of you with bows do the same after a few moments one of the sumerians returned the gesture hathor lowered the bow well walk the horses toward them with luck theyll think were their own cavalry try to look as tired as they are and keep your eyes on the ground and bunch up we dont want to look like an attack line they started down the hill plodding along it wasnt as foolish a trick as it appeared his men dressed the same and rode the same kinds of horses as the sumerian cavalry those who had attacked their camp had no mounts more important the sumerians would be expecting their horsemen to rejoin them and might assume that this was part of their own force when the sumerians realized their mistake it wouldnt matter hathor would give the order to charge he had no doubt that his thirty horsemen fresh and well armed could scatter these poorly armed exhausted and thirsty opponents their slow approach lulled the sumerians men sank back to the ground apparently relieved that they would not have to fight or run again hathors eye caught sight of four horses if these men still had mounts they must belong to the sumerian commanders else they would have vanished long ago bowmen hathor said i dont want those horses or their riders to get away make sure they dont two men moved out in front of the sumerians one was tall and lean and dressed in a blue tunic that even at a distance stood out from the rest he stood with one hand on the hilt of his sword while the other waved hathor forward impatience showing in his every movement hathor and his men drew within a hundred and fifty paces before the mans eyes widened in surprise close enough hathor decided he needed some space to get the horses up to speed attack hathor kicked his horse into a run and tightened his legs around the animals body in moments the powerful animal raced over the ground hooves pounding ears flat as excited as its rider hathors sword flashed from its sheath and he raised it up over his head and swung it around attack akkad attack as theyd been trained the akkadians shouted their war cries at the top of their lungs as they urged their horses forward akkad eskkar the words struck fear into the sumerians those standing turned and ran already two steps ahead of those who had to first scramble to their feet hathor directed his horse straight at the man in the blue tunic who turned and fled toward the horses waiting nearby in a few long strides the shoulder of hathors horse crashed into the mans back knocking him to the ground then the akkadians still screaming their war cries charged into the fleeing men swords rose and fell blood spurted into the air men screamed in agony struck by sharp blades knocked aside by the horses or just trampled underfoot again and again swords descended each strike eliciting a cry of pain a few sumerians tried to fight but a tired and thirsty man on foot had little chance against a sword swung down from a horse even those sumerians untouched by any weapon were affected the ageold fear of men on foot caught from behind by mounted warriors in moments the akkadians had swept through the scattering enemy leaving a trail of bloody bodies hathor yanked hard on the halter turned his horse around then kicked it into a run once again he rode straight toward the enemy horses tied to a bush they had panicked at all the noise and the scent of blood struggling wildly against the ropes that held them one broke free and bolted back toward the north a sumerian struggled to untie another animal when hathor struck him down an akkadian arrow slew another who flung himself across a horse and tried to escape you hathor shouted at the man whod fired the killing arrow guard these horses let no one near them the egyptian scanned the battleground bodies littered the earth many of them shrieking in pain from their wounds his horsemen had dispersed all over the area already reduced to chasing down individuals trying to flee hathor ignored all the killing his men knew what to do they would finish off every man they could until their horses could go no further dismounting he tied his mounts halter to the same bush that had restrained the sumerian horses he had time to give the animal a friendly pat on its shoulder before he walked back to the edge of the camp toward the man in the blue tunic he lay facedown right where he had fallen and to hathors amazement the man hadnt been trampled by any of the following horses a bloodspattered rock remained beneath the mans head hathor knelt beside him and rolled him over onto his back the man groaned at hathors less than gentle touch what happened who hathor still had his bloody sword in his hand he put the tip of the blade against the mans throat and pushed a little just enough to draw blood whats your name fear widened the mans eyes he gasped in terror and lifted his hands as if to move the sword aside hathor pushed the sword a bit deeper i wont ask you again eridu king eridu of sumer dont kill me well damn all the demons below hathor said so surprised that he withdrew the tip of the sword from eridus neck king eskkar wished me good hunting but i doubt he expected me to catch you in my net he lowered his sword then reached down and using his free hand dragged eridu to his feet you might prove useful if you do as youre told and dont force me to kill you eridu might have been as tall as hathor but he lacked both the bulk and his captors powerful muscles the kings shoulders sagged in defeat hathor shoved him along until they returned to where he left the horses a handful of his men were busy looting the bodies tie this one up hands behind his back use his sandal straps and make sure theyre tight we dont want king eridu to escape do we hathor shoved eridu to the ground where he lay gasping as the breath fled his body and his feet too while the soldier trussed up the prisoner hathor took another glance around his men were returning most leading horses that no longer had the strength to carry their riders a few even herded prisoners along hathor frowned at that he preferred not to bother with captured soldiers better to just kill them and get them out of the way but he knew eskkar would want to talk to them to learn why they fought and what they believed in such ideas reminded him of lady trellas influence on her husband hathor had the greatest respect for lady trella she was after all the one who convinced her husband to spare hathors life putting her will against eskkars rage and desire for vengeance not to mention the demands of every inhabitant of the city of akkad trella transformed in a moment from slave to queen offered her enemy his life even a chance to return to egypt if thats what he wanted instead hathor had sworn an oath on his honor as a warrior to follow eskkar wherever he led and hathor had included trella in that promise in the days that followed when he was greeted with scorn and contempt if not outright hatred by everyone in the city only trellas influence and firm acceptance of the egyptian gradually convinced the people of akkad to separate hathor from the atrocities of the egyptian korthac since that time hathor had discovered a measure of happiness serving akkads leaders never before had such feelings filled his life and he welcomed the opportunity to repay eskkar and trella for what theyd given him destroying their enemies would help pay back the debt that could never truly be redeemed and hathor had proven himself a skilled leader of horsemen second only to eskkar himself in the last year hed worked long and hard with the men he now commanded turning farmers and villagers into a skilled force of cavalry a name he recalled from his days in egypt the akkadian cavalry numbered less than fifty men in all and eskkar had brought only thirtytwo with him on this expedition to the southern border the rest remained in the city patrolling the nearby farms hathors riders had demonstrated their worth today theyd smashed the remains of the sumerians and defeated them for the second time in one morning and hed captured king eridu his grinning and cheering men returned congratulating each other and their leader every warrior had a story to tell either a brave act that showed his worth or something foolish the fleeing sumerians had done even the normally grave hathor couldnt resist a smile at some of the stories he heard enough celebrating for now he shouted at last putting a stop to all the chattering count the sumerian dead and finish searching the bodies kill any of the enemy wounded that cant walk then gather all the weapons and anything else of value the prisoners can carry it all back to eskkars camp theres no water here so we need to keep moving the men cheered again and hathor shook his head get moving you fools weve still got a long ride ahead of us more like a long walk since the horses were nearly exhausted hathor looked down and saw eridu staring up at him his eyes wide and mouth open in fear and im sure king eskkar will be most glad to honor his neighbor from the south the sun had begun its descent toward the horizon when eskkar finished his second inspection of the camp his men had established a strong position digging a ditch across the easiest points of access and positioning a goodsized number of pickets on the two main approaches no force of horsemen would be able to sweep in unchallenged not that he expected any would dare make the attempt mitrac and his men had arrived a little after midday struggling under the burden of all the weapons they had captured fortunately they had rounded up a few horses and used them as pack animals to carry some of the load one of the sentries gave a shout theyre coming in captain hathors men eskkar strode to the southern edge of the camp a ragged group of horsemen appeared not really horsemen he decided but tired men leading their weary animals hathor had sent a rider back earlier with the news of the battle as soon as eskkar learned of hathors victory and the safety of his men he let himself relax for the first time in two days in fact he took the opportunity to swim in the stream and clean his filthy tunic at least the garment wasnt bloodstained that would please trella who preferred that he leave any actual fighting to others theyd had that discussion many times she insisted that his life was too valuable to risk on an insignificant fight eskkar countered by reminding her that a leader needed to fight to maintain not only his honor but his reputation that argument between them he knew would continue at least as long as he remained alive now eskkar wanted to hear the details of hathors battle hathor led the ragged procession toward them a cheer erupted from eskkars archers as hathors men reached the edge of the camp and soon every soldier was shouting and congratulating each other on their victory the ragged noise soon turned into a chant eskkar eskkar eskkar he shook his head at the praise once again he had accomplished something out of the ordinary his soldiers and cavalry had defeated an enemy force that outnumbered them greatly and had done so with very little loss of akkadian life even eskkar had worried that he might lose half his men before he achieved this victory welcome back hathor eskkar gave the egyptian a hug that would have crushed anyone smaller you and your men have done well eskkar said the words in a loud voice so that everyone in the camp could hear did you lose many men no captain just two men dead and four horses but we killed fortyfour sumerians and captured three horses and fifteen prisoners not a bad exchange take care of your men hathor then join me at the tent you look like you could use a bath and some food yes captain would you take charge of this prisoner until then hathor moved aside behind him stood a single prisoner held upright by a grinning guard eskkar glanced at the footsore sumerian for the first time not much of a warrior the man looked exhausted fear showed not only on his face but in his every movement king eskkar may i present you with king eridu of sumeria no eskkar couldnt believe his ears a laugh went up from hathors men who crowded around to see their commanders reaction i asked the scout not to tell you hathor said i thought you might enjoy a surprise now i want to hear the whole story eskkar said every word but first take care of yourself and your men he reached out clasped his hand on eridus shoulder hard enough to make the man gasp and dragged him into the camp eskkar guided the sumerian along until they drew close to the tent eskkar had planned to put the prisoner inside but now he changed his mind he shoved eridu to the ground about thirty paces away stay there water king eskkar please i need water eridus voice sounded hoarse and dry he might not have had anything to drink since last night well and good eskkar decided it would put the sumerian in a more cooperative mood perhaps later after you tell me what i want to know eskkar entered the tent eridus two playthings clutched each other at the sudden appearance of their captor despite his reassurances they still believed they would end up dead or worse he had spoken to them before and even remembered their names both were pleasure slaves fresh from the slave market berlit was the taller one with brown hair that tumbled around her face girsu shorter and darker of hair and skin possessed an impressive pair of breasts he sat down on the thick blankets no doubt once reserved for eridu sit before me he ordered yes master they said in unison as they knelt before him i want you to tell me some things he said keeping his voice firm if you withhold anything if you try to lie to me there are a hundred men outside the tent who would be eager to show you their prowess yes master anything you command berlit said she clutched girsus hand as much to reassure herself as her companion berlit seemed the one with the quicker wits so he started with her describe eridu for me i want to know what he looks like the slave girl described eridu and after a few sentences eskkar held up his hand enough the prisoner outside the tent was indeed eridu not some impostor sacrificing himself for his king now i want you tell me what eridus plans were why he sent men across the border what he wanted to accomplish i want to know everything youve seen and heard for the last few weeks if you do ill take you back to akkad with me my wife will care for you find something useful for you to do otherwise he lifted his hand and pointed to the tent flap they started talking and soon the whole story came out they had only been with eridu for nine or ten days a gift from one of the kings wealthy merchants eridu had taken possession of them just before he led his men out of sumer and decided they should accompany their new master on his campaign as berlit spoke her voice grew more confident and the words that had first come haltingly now flowed like a steady stream even girsu joined in the conversation waving her hands around as she spoke filling in details left out by her companion they were well into their story when grond and alexar entered the tent followed a few moments later by mitrac hathor arrived soon after that his tunic still wet from its encounter with the stream the commanders sat behind the girls so as not to appear threatening and after a few nervous glances over their shoulders berlit and girsu soon forgot their presence eridus slaves talked and talked eskkar even interrupted them once to have water brought in for them the girls had been present during almost all of eridus planning sessions for the first time eskkar heard the name of razrek the leader of the sumerian horsemen who had ravaged the borderlands and somehow managed to escape mitracs arrows even to both wretched girls this razrek appeared to be the mastermind of eridus plan at last berlit and girsu ran out of things to say thats all we know lord eskkar we were just waking up when the soldiers raised the alarm king eridu snatched his tunic and ran outside thats the last we saw of him until you arrived youve done well eskkar said you will return with us to akkad something will be found for you there better that than turning them over to his men two women tossed among eighty men would start half a dozen fights before the girls died he turned to grond send someone to untie eridu make sure he gets plenty of water and something to eat he turned to the girls stay in the tent you know what will happen to you if you leave hathor come with me i want to show you something eskkar slipped through the flap and all the commanders followed outside he stepped around to the rear of the tent we found these in the camp more than a hundred of them he picked up a long wicker shield and held it up each shield was covered with hide and was pierced in the center to form a grip for the hand when eskkar raised it up it covered his body from the chin nearly down to the knees mitracs been shooting arrows at these all afternoon our bows will penetrate them but only at close range he tossed the shield aside and stooped to pick up a slim bronzetipped lance eridus men had about three hundred of these i think thats why he didnt fear our archers he intended to have the shieldbearers form the first wave with the rest of their men behind them carrying one or two lances a quick charge to get close enough to throw the lances then overwhelm us with their swords hathor inspected first the shield then the lance wrapped at the center to provide a good throwing grip and nearly as tall as a man in egypt many of our soldiers carried shields like these just thick enough to stop an arrow and the lances flung with all a running mans strength would be deadly at close range if they could have closed with our archers our archers would still kill half of them before they got into throwing range mitrac said perhaps eskkar said but if enough did get close enough we might have lost more than half of our fighters he picked up the lance and thought about what it implied a simple weapon compared to the bow which took months to shape and relied on bowstrings that snapped all too often and arrows that had to be straight and true nocked and feathered and tipped with bronze a thrown javelin such as this would pierce a mans body with ease the bronze blade emerging from the bodys back if eridu had a few more moments to prepare if he only lost half his men to akkadian arrows the remaining sumerians might have cut down eskkars archers a grim thought indeed it was bound to happen sooner or later alexar said breaking the silence everyone knows about the skill of our bowmen our enemies will try to find a way to counter akkads archers in the great siege grond said our archers fought from behind a wall in all our battles outside the city weve had to find a way to protect our bowmen even in todays battle we were fortunate to arrive at dawn and with the sun behind us if the sumerians had time to gather their weapons and take up these shields our losses might have been much greater grond understood the implication as well as eskkar well speak more about this when we return to akkad now i think its time to talk to eridu eskkar led the way back toward the tent the sumerian sat on the ground near one of the campfires guarded by two men his hands had been untied eridu looked up as eskkar and his commanders approached king eridu of sumer eskkar said have you eaten your fill eridu his mouth hanging open stared at eskkar and the grimfaced men surrounding him what what do you want i want to know why you attacked our lands eskkar didnt bother to keep his voice down the more his men heard the better the borderlands belong to no one eridu said trying to put some authority in his voice sumer and the other cities have as much right to the crops here as akkad still for two years you recognized the sippar river as our southern border you did nothing to lay claim to these lands said nothing to anyone in akkad instead you sent soldiers pretending to be bandits to kill our farmers and devastate our lands you marched across the border with your soldiers to kill those you knew would be sent against you and to seize all these lands and perhaps even more eridu wet his lips his eyes darted around and saw that the akkadians soldiers had moved closer all of them eager to see and hear what would be done the only sound was the crackling of the nearby fire i will pay you a ransom for my safe return to sumer eridu said eskkar smiled you came north to wage war upon akkad and its people you wanted to lead your soldiers to a great victory and have everyone in sumeria proclaim you a great warrior but a real warrior should be able to fight his own battles he turned to grond give king eridu a sword the words had scarcely left eskkars lips before grond slipped his sword from its sheath and tossed it hilt first on the ground where it landed close to eridus hand the two soldiers guarding the sumerian moved back as did eskkars commanders creating an open space for the two to fight i wont challenge you eridu said he moved his hand away from the swords hilt your men will my men will give you a horse and set you free if you win eskkar said hathor alexar you will see to that give your oath to let eridu go free if he wins eskkar took a step back and drew his sword you can ride back to sumer and tell everyone how you killed eskkar of akkad in a fight that should be enough glory for you this time eridu had to swallow before he could speak i wont fight you youre a barbarian youre a skilled swordsman ill meet whatever ransom you set anything i swear never again to send men across the border two hundred gold coins three hundred petrah my steward will see to the payment that should more than repay for the damage done to the crops and farmers eridu looked around the ring of men staring down at him and saw nothing but stony faces he pushed gronds sword away with the back of his hand i wont fight you ill pay four hundred coins for my freedom a staggering sum enough to pay for all the damages and the cost of sending the soldiers south akkad could use all that gold eskkar knew if hed met eridu in battle eskkar would have killed him without question or hesitation but no one would pay for a dead man the silence dragged on while eskkar made up his mind your ransom will be eight hundred gold coins from that sum every one of my soldiers will receive one coin an intake of breath passed through the soldiers at the sum followed by murmurs of approval that would be several months pay for most of them but first there is another price to pay eridu eskkar said you stretched out your hand to take my lands and kill my people helpless farmers tortured and murdered their women raped and killed their livestock plundered and the crops burned for that there is a separate price get him on his feet grond stepped forward and jerked eridu upright as if he were a child alexar grond take hold of his hands spread him out the two men extended eridus arms out to either side alexar used both hands clasping eridus left wrist grond also used both hands but he grabbed the sumerians right hand leaving his forearm bare eridu started to struggle but his captors held him fast his arms spread wide before eridu could understand what was to happen before he could prepare himself or plead for mercy eskkars sword flashed in the firelight and the sharp bronze blade delivered with all of his force sliced through eridus right wrist blood sprayed out everywhere with a scream eridu collapsed on the ground get him in the fire eskkar ordered grond caught the now helpless eridu around the waist with one arm and clasped the handless arm with the other in a moment grond dragged the king toward the campfire and shoved the bloodspurting stump into the flames this time the screams went on and on echoing throughout the camp grond needed all his strength to hold the arm in the flames long enough to seal the wound the smell of burning meat wafted on the air before he pulled eridu away with a sob the sumerian king fell on his face his knees drawn up weeping into the dirt the pain racked his body again and he slipped into unconsciousness get someone who knows how to bandage that up eskkar ordered several of the soldiers knew how to treat wounds he wiped his blade on eridus tunic if he lives eskkar raised his voice so all could hear hell walk back to akkad where hell stay until his ransom is paid tomorrow we start for home a roar went up from the men and this time it went on and on they had won a great victory and their king had outwitted and defeated akkads enemy most of all they would receive a share of the ransom and that gold made all the hardship and danger of the last ten days slip from their minds meanwhile the sumerian king had paid a harsh price for his evil deeds one that he would remember for as long as he lived and best of all they were returning home trella pushed a glass goblet half full of wine across the large table yavtar held it up to the light for a moment to admire the thick glass such goblets remained rare in akkad and those wealthy enough to afford them swore that they sweetened the taste of wine a few skilled craftsmen had mastered the art and learned the secrets of carving each one hollowing out the green glass with painstaking care yavtar took a sip then murmured his appreciation setting the heavy glass down he lifted a pitcher of water and filled the cup to the brim since i took up farming lady trella i find i cant drink as much strong wine yavtar took another taste of the watered mix and nodded appreciatively i must be getting old the weaker the wine the more i seem to like it isnt that how it should be the more delicate the flavor the better everything tastes still for such an elderly man you made a fast return trip to akkad trella said while he might be six or seven years older than eskkar no one would call yavtar old he had arrived at dusk yesterday offering to visit trella as soon as he settled his accounts from the trip to sumer with nicar instead trella suggested they meet tomorrow at midmorning others would also want to hear his words and the small delay would give the trader some time to rest and attend to his family and farm lady trella wore a simple red dress cut square across her breasts a silver fillet kept her dark hair from her eyes but she wore no other jewelry her thick tresses carefully combed by a servant several times a day remained her best feature she had seventeen seasons and her body had matured into that of a graceful young woman though she would never be called beautiful her inner strength and keen mind made her the envy of all of akkads women every man that gazed into those dark eyes felt the urge to possess her the strong feelings trella aroused made many call her a witch whatever they called her no one who knew her doubted her sharp wits or her ability to command respect from friend as well as enemy she studied everyone she came in contact with and her thoughtful eyes noticed every body movement every hesitation every gesture that revealed to her a persons true thoughts in the same way her mind analyzed every word and inflection as her reputation grew more and more people found themselves nervous in her presence which only made it easier for her to divine their thoughts and secrets trella understood not only the traits and habits of men but the ways of power now six people sat in what everyone called eskkars workroom the house had a second story containing only two chambers after climbing the stairs and passing through the thick door visitors entered the large workroom which offered two goodsized tables a chest and an assortment of chairs and benches another door equally sturdy provided access to the second and more private chamber eskkar and trellas bedroom with a hawk clan guard at the base of the stairs those gathered around the table could speak freely without worrying about whether anyone could overhear their words merchant gemama was pleased with the lapis lazuli you brought him more than pleased lady trella especially with the price he knew he was being bribed for information but for stones like those he was willing to take a chance it probably helped that eridu wasnt in the city and that i was leaving the next day did you need to leave so soon it seemed wise right now the city is unsafe for anyone from the north especially from akkad talk of war was in the air besides i didnt trust those sumerians on the dock yavtar took another sip of wine with all that gold on board i didnt want to take any chances we left sumer early and didnt even put ashore for the night the hawk clan soldiers helped us row i worked them and my crew like slaves fortunately we didnt have much cargo for the return trip just enough to act as ballast the riverboats trella knew behaved better when they had a certain amount of weight on board when they rode empty and high they tended to tip over often from nothing more than a stiff breeze or a sudden movement i did give him a good price nicar sat next to yavtar nicar had once been akkads leading merchant now his son lesu had taken over that responsibility while the father acted as chief judge of the laws of akkad those stones were my share of the goods from lesus trip to the indus valley i hope the information you received was worth the lower price i think gemama would have paid more for your stones yavtar said and im sure you could have set a higher price if youd sold them here nicar smiled actually i didnt want to cut into my sons profits if we had both sold our stones in akkad the price would have dropped there are after all only so many who can afford to buy such things then i think we made a good exchange nicar gemama spoke bluntly but i heard the truth in his words king eridu would have cut the tongue from gemamas mouth for what he revealed so youre certain its war then gatus the oldest of akkads soldiers and the captain of the citys guard leaned across the table two others sat on either side of trella annoksur trellas friend and confidante who also directed the large number of spies in akkad and throughout the land that gathered information for trella and eskkar bantor annoksurs husband had the seat at trellas right he commanded all the soldiers in and around akkad during eskkars absence its war yavtar answered and its going to be bad king eridu left sumer a week before we arrived heading a large force of at least three or four hundred soldiers no one knows exactly how many apparently eridu felt confident of victory the other cities have submitted to his rule or allied themselves with him willingly or not for whatever reason they all contributed soldiers to his venture for the last two years eridu has blamed every ill every grievance every problem on akkad our name is like a curse to them now the whole of sumeria believes demons rule here in akkad and that our only purpose is to create misery for sumers inhabitants taking his time yavtar recounted almost every word of his conversation with gemama when he finished silence hung in the air for a few moments eskkar must have encountered eridu and his sumerians by now bantor said he has only a hundred men with him enough for bandits but not for that kind of fighting im sure my husband will know what to do trella said he knows when to fight and when to retreat she made sure her voice carried conviction though a tiny doubt remained in her heart if anything happened to eskkar the whole balance of power in akkad would shift no matter how much she accomplished or how well she administered akkads affairs everything depended on eskkars presence his fair rule of akkads few laws had created a trust in his leadership while his warrior skills made everyone feel safe from danger no woman could equal those feelings in the populace unfortunately those same warrior skills often led him into personal danger and he trusted in his luck to carry him through heedless of the risks he ran not only to himself but to trella and their son sargon their firstborn was only two years old and while many in akkad would acknowledge him as the heir to the kingdom others would step forward to challenge the ascension of one so young the danger would remain until sargon grew old enough to share in their leadership hes the luckiest bastard ive ever known gatus said uttering words no one else in akkad would have dared to speak one of these days his luck is going to run out but not anytime soon i think yavtar said this eridu is not a soldier though he preens himself as one and seeks the glory of a conquest and no matter how many men he has they will not be as well trained as our akkadian soldiers im sure well hear from eskkar in the next few days trella said in truth she had already expected news from her husband to reach her if word didnt come soon she would have bantor dispatch a messenger to seek him out and report back but sumer as they now call their city is preparing for war yes lady trella the city is as active as akkad and growing each day walls homes markets are constructed everywhere the population grows even faster feeding gold into eridus hands the people feel no love for him or his family but he has them under control with plenty of armed men to enforce his orders if he can wrest control of akkads borderlands he will guarantee his food supply and even more gold will pass through his hands hes already promised farms and land in the border to those who support him hell change his mind after he meets our archers bantor said even if eskkar drives off eridus men this time it may not matter in the long run nicars words sounded grim if eridu has sumer under his thumb and has gained influence over the other five cities he will have to contend with us sooner or later with deserts to the east and west and the great sea at their backs they can only expand northward akkad blocks the road to their expansion how many people live in those cities trella asked directing her question at yavtar sumer itself has almost as many inhabitants as akkad say four or five thousand the other villages are not as large but taken together include another sixteen maybe seventeen thousand and all of them add new people each day ill warrant nicar said so they will all grow as fast as akkad and with large numbers of young men working the surrounding farms eridu will have plenty of volunteers all dreaming of gold or glory to swell his army not to mention a surplus of craftsmen and toolmakers eager to sell weapons and tools to the king in any large group of people trella knew an abundance of unmarried young men could be found there were always more boys than needed to work a farm or labor in the villages older men especially those with wealth took or purchased extra wives and female slaves for their pleasure beds creating a shortage of marriageable women for the young men increasing the pressure on them to find their own fortunes soldiering provided a way to fulfill that need while the danger involved merely added spice to youthful dreams even in akkad plenty of boys and young men volunteered to join eskkars warriors all seeking to improve their lives more arrived each day searching for work and as often as not getting into trouble you think this will be a long war then trella asked i think the lands of sumeria have many more people than they can sustain nicar said so yes even if eskkar drives off eridus soldiers the sumerians will return if not this year then the following year or the one after that i agree lady trella yavtar said gemama implied as much let them come bantor rapped his fist on the table each time they do well drive them off first wed better see what news eskkar brings us gatus said i agree trella said well know more when eskkar returns then well decide what to do about this new threat she glanced around the table but no one had anything more to add trella stood signifying the end of the meeting yavtar all of us give thanks to you for bringing us this information one by one the men left until only annoksur and trella remained in the workroom you said nothing during the meeting trella said what was there to say annoksur put her arm around trellas shoulders for a moment after two years of peace war is returning to akkad this time it will be a different kind of war and i think a long one i only hope that eskkar returns safely and that he knows what to do as do i trella said he understands very well why and how men fight perhaps but these are not barbarians or bandits his experiences as a warrior may not help him as much in the coming battles perhaps trella said but meanwhile there is much that you and i can do and i think we should begin by making our own plans for the possibility of war whatever unseen path the future takes well need to be ready i think there is going to be much more to winning this kind of conflict than just victory in battle our husbands will think only of winning the next fight and the next one after that we need to find a way to win the war so that akkad can remain at peace for many more years the first step should be to send more spies as many as we can to sumeria to learn what they can about our enemies weve relied too much on traders and merchants bringing us word of what theyve seen yes we can start with that trella turned to her advisor but much more needs to be done and well need to start as soon as eskkar returns lets hope eskkars battle went well both for our own sakes and for akkad yes trellas thoughts went to her headstrong husband accomplished warrior he might be but even now eskkar could be dead lying facedown on some unknown battlefield she and her son might find themselves exposed to any number of threats their future destroyed the sooner he returned the easier she would feel and the next time eskkar went into battle trella resolved to provide him with every advantage she could t hat night well after dusk eskkar rode up to akkads main entrance open the gate he shouted staring up at the men guarding the walls at sundown each day the guards closed the citys gates those travelers who arrived afterwards usually had to camp outside for the night now the soldiers peered down into the gloom and saw a band of heavily armed riders but before they could even issue a challenge the commander in charge of the gate arrived a torch in hand he leaned over the parapet a single glance told him all he needed to know open the gate he ordered its the king it took time to open the heavy gate but at last the final restraining beam creaked out of its supporting brace eskkar grond and a dozen riders cantered through once inside they slowed their horses to a walk and two hawk clan warriors led the way through the narrow lanes this early in the evening the streets and lanes held plenty of people relaxing after their days labor and enjoying the cool air everyone stopped to stare at the horsemen horses were rare enough in the lanes during the day and seldom seen after dark its lord eskkar one by one people repeated the words the king has returned a few cheers followed but eskkar ignored them guiding his horse steadily through the press one voice asked about the bandits we won a great victory grond called out to a roar of approval from the crowd the bandits are destroyed at last the party reached eskkars house and he swung wearily down from the sweaty horse grond dismissed the men who would return to their barracks after handing the horses off to the stable boys as soon as the soldiers washed the dust from their bodies they would search out their favorite taverns soon everyone would know about the battle against king eridu inside the courtyard eskkar walked straight through the open ground until he reached the rear of the house a private well provided a steady supply of fresh water for the household he pulled up the bucket and drank deeply careless of the water that spilled across his chest by then servants had arrived in a rush and one began refilling the bucket while eskkar stripped off his clothes and dropped them on the ground he washed himself as best he could trying to remove five days of sweat and dirt from his body though he knew he wouldnt really feel clean until hed had a long swim in the tigris that would have to wait until the morning with help from one of the servants eskkar scrubbed most of the dirt off his body then dried himself with a large square of linen handed to him when he finished he turned away from the well to find the servants gone and trella standing there a clean tunic in her hand welcome home eskkar she said handing him the fresh garment he pulled it on unable to resist a sigh as the soft cloth settled around his shoulders without a word he took trella in his arms and held her tight against him once again he breathed in the familiar scent of her hair and felt the ease that she always brought him after holding her close for some time he bent down and kissed her letting himself enjoy the sweet taste of her lips her arms went around his neck and she pressed herself against his chest rising up on her toes to answer his kiss with one of her own she held him tight until he relaxed against her its good to be home trella is everything all right here yes husband the city was quiet while you were gone and the bandits from sumer did you meet them not bandits but soldiers he growled putting his arm around her shoulder and guiding her back toward the entrance of the house and king eridu was there as well with almost four hundred men trying to ambush us he nearly succeeded too we just learned from yavtar that the sumerians were responsible i wish you had stayed in akkad at least until we knew more about what you might face they reached the open doorway to the house but instead of entering eskkar took her by the hand and guided her across the courtyard a second structure there held six goodsized rooms in a row each with its own entrance four were occupied by sixteen hawk clan soldiers who guarded eskkars house day and night the other two were for guests who needed a place to stay ive something to show you as they approached grond appeared from the last doorway ducking his head under the low opening ah lady trella its good to see you my thanks to you once again she said for bringing my husband home safe and sound bring out our guest eskkar said grond ducked back into the house and returned in a moment halfdragging a man behind him a hard shove and the prisoner fell to the ground at trellas feet and this is king eridu of sumer as he now calls both himself and his city eskkar answered he planned to lure us into a trap and kill us all but we managed to avoid his snare and set one of our own eridu looked up at them he appeared weak and dazed his eyes gazed around the courtyard without comprehension trella called out for someone to bring a light soon a servant arrived and held a crackling torch above eridus head she stared at him for a long time studying his face then reached out and touched his cheek with the back of her hand hes burning up with fever and what happened to his hand i cut it off eskkar said as punishment for trying to steal our land i offered him a chance to fight me but he refused so i thought this would be a fair payment for his greed hes also promised to pay a ransom of eight hundred gold coins if he doesnt ill cut off more than his hand next time trella leaned forward and inspected the burned and blackened stump ill send for the healer to attend his wounds eskkar shrugged id let him take his chances with the gods but i suppose his kin wont pay for a dead man he clasped trella around the waist and turned her back toward the house enough time to talk to eridu in the morning ill send the healer over grond lived only a few houses from ventor the only healer eskkar trusted ill return in the morning captain im sure tippu awaits your return trella said tippu and grond had married two years ago and she now carried his child inside the house eskkar and trella mounted the stairs and entered the workroom at night one corner was used as a nursery for sargon trella always wanted her son close by should he need anything a servant girl sat beside the tiny bed and its sleeping occupant she would remain awake all night to make sure no harm came to the boy too many babies died in their sleep and trella had no intention of letting sargon suffer that fate despite his weariness eskkar paused a moment to look down at his sleeping son sargon seems to have grown again he whispered he reached down his hand and gently touched a finger to the boys soft cheek i doubt hes grown much in the last fifteen days trella said keeping her voice low come let him sleep hell be chasing you everywhere in the morning in the morning ill take him down to the river with me he likes to splash in the water they went into the bedroom and she closed and barred the door when she turned around he took her in his arms and held her tight almost crushing her against him youve grown too my wife he said running his hands up her arms youre even more beautiful than when i left you we should talk eskkar i want to know what happened eridu how later and only if you please me greatly his hand brushed against her breast and he felt her nipple harden at his touch her eyes closed for a moment perhaps you should think about pleasing me she said her voice husky with emotion once again you left me alone while you went off to fight perhaps i will he kissed her gently at first then harder as his passion grew soon he lifted her dress up over her head then pulled his own tunic off each time i see you i want to feel myself inside you she swayed against him and he heard her quick intake of breath he clasped his hands around her waist holding her tight eyes closed trella lifted her head her lips parted he kissed her again this time a kiss full of passion and promise eskkar moved one hand to the small of her back enjoying the curving flesh while the other lifted to cup her breast squeezing it gently until she gasped in pleasure i missed you eskkar i promise to make up for it he said his voice husky with lust the tiredness of the long ride to akkad forgotten then he had no more words he scooped her up as easily as she lifted sargon and deposited her on the bed she arched her back under his touch and slipped her arms around his neck we can talk later she breathed into his ear try not to wake sargon youre more likely to wake him than i am she buried her face in his shoulder ill try not to cry out dont try too hard he warned her ive been gone a long time two days later just before the sun reached its height overhead a small procession wended its way out of akkads river gate the party walked along the path that followed the riverbank for half a mile then traveled across the fields to the sprawling farmstead owned by rebba one of the nobles who helped rule akkad though the nobles had lost some of their authority after eskkars rule commenced they still retained much influence and ruling the city without their support would have made that task even more difficult with this new challenge to akkads future looming both eskkar and trella knew that the nobles advice and consent would be critical noble rebba and his family owned several large farms which made him the wealthiest farmholder in the lands close to akkad his crops and herds contributed much to the citys prosperity and its inhabitants respected both his wisdom and courage in the fight against korthac rebba had gambled his life and that of his family on eskkars behalf rebbas farm lay less than two miles north of akkad and along the tigris eskkar and a small force of soldiers had landed their boats there two years ago hed raced down the river from the village of bisitun to recapture akkad from the egyptians who had seized both the city and trella trella and eskkar led the way toward rebbas holdings accompanied by grond gatus bantor alexar hathor mitrac yavtar and klexor annoksur walked behind trella though annoksur had no official duties everyone knew she controlled the large network of spies and informers that trella had established throughout the city the surrounding countryside and even in distant villages many considered her the third most powerful personage in akkad after eskkar and trella six guards accompanied the group one of them leading eridu by a rope tied around his neck the distance made for a pleasant walk in the open air surrounded by breezes from the river and the clean scent of crops growing in the fields rebba had constructed a half dozen small footbridges over the intervening canals which carried vital water to his fields travelers to and from his farm and akkad no longer needed to splash through the muddy canal waters to reach their destination a small pack of dogs began barking as the group approached the farmhouse but a servant quickly chased them away reassuring the animals that the new arrivals meant no harm either to them or their master nevertheless the halfwild creatures kept a watchful eye on the visitors as they walked past and eskkar heard their low growls the little cavalcade reached the main house which was not much larger than the other half dozen structures surrounding it they didnt enter instead they moved around to the rear where they found the rest of the gathering waiting for them in the shade of two willow trees branches formed a green canopy overhead that blocked most of the suns rays whenever a breeze sprang up the leaves rustled and sighed in a distinct voice depending on the direction of the wind rebba had gathered three tables and placed them end to end another table off to the side held wine ale bread water and fresh fruit enough to satisfy any hunger until the main meal would be served just as the sun went down as the host the noble rebba sat at the head of the table his cousin decca sitting beside him decca had sponsored many of the craftsmen and small shops which served akkads inhabitants nobles nicar and nestor who helped rule the city before eskkar and trella took control had also taken seats noble corio the newest member of the ruling group was the artisan who constructed akkads walls he sat beside yavtar and faced nestor and nicar across the table when eskkar and his party arrived everyone took time to greet and welcome each other all the leaders of akkad all the men of importance to eskkars rule were there with the exception of sisuthros who governed the large village of bisitun to the north there hadnt been enough time to summon him under eskkars authority these men made all the decisions that governed the daily lives of the thousands of people in akkad at last everyone settled in leaving only the guards and eridu standing a few steps away eskkar took his place at the opposite end of the table facing rebba trella sat at her husbands right hand while annoksur occupied a stool just behind her gatus and the other commanders occupied benches on either side noble rebba eskkar began i thank you for welcoming us to your house in this heat to gather so many inside akkads walls would have meant a long hot day and i want to thank you for offering to guard eridu trella believes that his wound will heal faster here than in akkad hes promised to pay eight hundred gold coins for his ransom so we need to keep him alive a sumerian river trader arrived in akkad from the north yesterday and we entrusted him with the task of delivering the message to sumer and eridus family all eyes turned to the sumerian eridu appeared pale and weak his tunic dirty and his feet bare nothing like the ruler of a mighty city his fever had broken but bandages covered his right forearm a yellowish stain marking the end of his stump so this is king eridu corio said who wanted to bring war and destruction to akkad elevated to his position as a result of eskkars rise to power corio could seldom restrain his impatience with what he called the old ways hed built the wall that had saved akkad from the barbarians two years ago and now directed the massive effort to raise newer stronger and higher ramparts around the expanded city that continued to grow faster than anyone thought possible he never hesitated to speak his mind as trella once remarked you always knew what corio was thinking eridu lifted his head and let his eyes take in the leaders of akkad but he said nothing after a moment he returned his gaze to the ground he doesnt have much to say does he this time the comment came from nestor i owned two of the farms your men ravaged one of my cousins is missing probably dead at your hands what do you know about those raids answer him eskkar ordered eridus lips trembled at eskkars words and his eyes revealed a glimpse of the hatred the sumerian possessed but fear overcame his hatred and he knew better than to disobey akkads ruler i know nothing of your cousin many bandits raid the land on both sides of the border i accompanied my soldiers to drive them off you marched three hundred men on foot from sumer to well north of the sippar river to chase after your own horsemen eskkar said did you intend to follow them all the way to akkad we were preparing to return when you attacked us he thinks were fools corio said perhaps wed be better off separating his head from his body king eskkar has promised to return me to sumer when the ransom is delivered eridu said a trace of defiance in his voice eight hundred gold coins a boat took the request south this morning its not too late to change our minds eskkar said so ill give you a choice tell us the truth or ill cut off your other hand your kin can feed you and wipe your ass for the rest of your life im sure its a duty they will look forward to eridus eyes widened a glance at those seated at the table convinced him stony eyes showed not a trace of mercy not one would utter the least word to stop eskkar from carrying out his threat eridu swallowed nervously what do you want to know the story came out with a little prodding none of it new or surprising sumeria needed the land the cities in the south had a rightful claim to it eridu was merely carrying out the will of the people after a while the questions died out the king of sumer had wanted fresh lands and the glory of a conquest nothing more really mattered eskkar nodded to eridus guards take him away rebbas servants will show you where to put him i still think we should kill him nestor said when eridu was led around the side of the house when he gets back hell just start preparing for war all over again i think its best to let him go eskkar said he and trella had discussed eridu only last night better to have an incompetent fool ruling in sumeria if he ends up dead we may find ourselves facing someone worse and the gold will be useful to compensate those who lost their farms nicar said the question now is what are we going to do the lands of sumeria including the six cities possess four or five times as many people as we do maybe more and their wealth taken together is far greater than akkads if they stand united and are determined to wage war against us we could be facing a long and bitter struggle just to survive our southern border stretches from the euphrates to the tigris gatus said and then follows the sippar river to the east thats close to two hundred miles from one end to the other it will be impossible to defend it all you cant patrol a border area with archers alexar added well need horsemen and plenty of them there arent enough horses in the land for that rebba added and the expense of maintaining so many animals eridus gold will be long gone before you have a tenth of what you need raising and maintaining good horseflesh took gold and plenty of it corrals had to be built cleaned and maintained a horse went through large quantities of grain and grass each day and needed to be exercised as well then each beast had to be trained to fight to charge ahead when its instincts made it want to falter or turn aside that required skilled riders who understood horseflesh who could teach both men and animals how to form a battle line charge the enemy and run a man or a horse down it all took time even in akkad only the wealthy could afford the luxury of owning a simple riding horse let alone an animal trained for war eskkar you say that eridu was ready to do battle with your archers yes nicar his men had a large number of shields and even more javelins the shieldbearers expected to charge our archers supported by the javelins until they could close the distance and do you think this tactic would have worked the table went silent for the first time and every eye lifted to eskkar yes i think it would have succeeded as long as they could close with us quickly it might have worked we were greatly outnumbered even if we drove them off our losses would have been heavy without shields of our own the javelins would have been deadly to our men a few breaks in the line and the enemy could have poured through and overwhelmed us so our archers will not be able to overcome superior numbers is that what youre saying eskkar poured some water into his cup and took a sip using the moment to gather his thoughts not necessarily our archers are well trained we pick only those men strong enough to bend a bow and empty three or four quivers without weakening as gatus can tell you it takes many months four to five at least to harden their muscles an archer must learn not only how to loose an arrow but how to gauge the distance hit a moving target and stand beside his fellows when an archer is fully trained he is a deadly and efficient soldier but for all that the archer has his own weaknesses unless hes in a defensive position hes vulnerable to surprise attack night attack or even attack within close quarters outside of a city and its walls he needs horsemen to scout for him so that he can prepare to come to grips with his enemy archers also need someone to guard their rear in the fight against eridus men i had to use our horse boys to watch our backs so youre saying our archers are of little use outside the city nicars voice held a trace of worry no what im saying is that up to now the archers have been our strongest force but that will have to change we need to prepare for a different kind of war a longer conflict and we will need new kinds of soldiers no one seemed happy to hear eskkars words least of all his own commanders most of them had trained and fought as archers using their bows theyd won yet another victory over superior numbers and now they heard their leader say that their efforts might not be enough the nobles were equally unhappy a long and drawn out war would be a drain on all of them trade would be the first casualty already the nobles contributed large amounts of gold to pay for the building of akkads walls and the ongoing support of the citys fighting men in return for that contribution they expected peace and security for their farms and trading ventures a protracted conflict with the sumerian cities would drain much of their wealth with little to show for it do you think we can win this new kind of war corio impatient as always drummed his fingers on the table yes we can win this war eskkar said as weve all seen battles are not won just by having superior numbers of fighting men we drove off the barbarians and we outfought korthac to reclaim our city both times our fighters were outnumbered until now weve taken great care in selecting recruits now we need to use all the manpower we have available to us even those weve passed over when we select our archers eskkar glanced at gatus the captain of the guard and the oldest of eskkars commanders everyone respected both his courage and his words more than that the nobles trusted him born and raised in akkad he always spoke his mind and never cared whom he offended approaching his sixtieth season hed trained most of akkads fighters and helped eskkar develop his battle plans and tactics what do you think gatus eskkar shifted to face the old soldier can you answer corios question eskkar and i and all the commanders gatus began gesturing with his hand to include the rest of the soldiers have talked about such things for years now it is time to do more than talk well need soldiers who can fight on foot who can attack an enemy with sword and spear and well need horsemen many of them to act as our eyes and ears and allow us to strike at our enemies far from akkad the old soldier spoke with passion gatus had seen every kind of enemy and knew what to expect whenever he spoke men listened but everyone at the table knew akkad had nowhere near enough men nor horses nor gold to pay them if we have to fight an extended war with sumeria nestor said the expense may be more than we can support perhaps it would be better to negotiate with the sumerians to make peace with them they may have learned their lesson we could even offer them some of the borderland trella reached out and picked up her water cup the simple gesture turned every eye toward her as she knew it would lady trella what do you think once again it was corio who spoke first nobles this conflict between our city and the south will not happen overnight eskkar dealt eridus forces a heavy blow how many men did he lose husband of course she already knew the answer trella seldom needed to hear anything more than once with her flawless memory she could recall details even many months after hearing them we killed about twenty or twentyfive of their horsemen and over a hundred and seventy soldiers twentyeight prisoners were taken and i spoke with each of them then i let them go so they could return to sumer and the other cities and tell the story of what happened there were many wounded who we left where we found them to live or die we captured most of their weapons as well that means there will be no more war for the rest of this season trella went on and probably not next year either eridu will need time to recoup his losses and rebuild his reputation the lost weapons will be expensive to replace and he will have to pay the ransom as well his supply of ready gold will be severely depleted if not exhausted she paused a moment to let everyone at the table digest her words and as my husband has explained to me the defeat of the soldiers will be a heavy blow to their morale they know they were vanquished by a smaller number of fighters their king was taken prisoner eridu will not find it so easy to recruit replacements it will take time before he can again raise a large force of men so you think we have a few years before the sumerians begin to trouble us again no the plotting will begin as soon as eridu returns home trella answered but the next year or two will give akkad time to prepare in that time there is much we can do and as akkads leading merchants perhaps you can find new opportunities for your trading ventures corio laughed a long chuckle that turned every head of course trella youre right my business will prosper because the increased need for protective walls not only here in akkad but in some of the smaller villages on the border nicars trading will increase too as he supplies us with the ores needed to forge weapons the city will grow again as we hire new soldiers and what we pay them will flow back to us in taxes and increased business yes corio trella said letting a smile cross her face for the first time if we know what the future will bring and if we have time to prepare there is no reason why everyones wealth should not increase even as our soldiers grow in numbers with sumers defeat more people will seek akkads protection more farmers in the borderlands will cry out to join with us already the city and the countryside are full of young men who have left their farms to come here it may be that in the long run all of you here today will see your trading ventures prosper nestor nodded yes that may all be true but what happens when the sumerians march north with thousands of men how can we defend the border against such a force were not going to defend the border eskkar said well patrol it with horsemen that hathor will train if the sumerians come north again well gather our forces and march south akkads walls will protect the city while we invade sumeria well ravage their lands and crops our threat to carry the war to their cities will be what secures the border and if it doesnt rebba didnt wait for an answer it wont be easy to invade sumeria youll need supplies and food and youll have to march your men a long distance and when you do arrive at larsa youll find yourself facing a walled city full of defenders larsa the northernmost of the six cities in the sumerian alliance had always been the most troublesome it would be the first one to face any attack by akkad yes rebba thats exactly what i expect eskkar said so that is what were going to prepare for when we tear down larsas walls and put whats left standing to the torch the other sumerian cities will understand the price of crossing our border and attacking our people and have you considered how you will destroy larsas walls and capture it not yet eskkar said with a smile my commanders and i meet tomorrow to begin planning for such things while we train archers horsemen and foot soldiers corio and his kin will be busy figuring out ways for us to storm a citys walls by the time such an attack is needed we should have both the manpower and the skills needed to capture a city the size of larsa within a few days if we can do that we can end the war and if the rest of sumeria fights on nestor said then what will you do well march to the next city and destroy that one too crush every city that resists and spare each one that abandons war put yourself in their place nestor would you rather fight or make peace you assume much eskkar nestor answered how can you be so certain its not just me eskkar answered my commanders think as i do he glanced around the table the soldiers were nodding agreement dont forget nobles many of our preparations will soon be known to the sumerians that may help them choose peace instead of war if they know what we might do to them they may just decide to leave us alone but as long as we have something they want as long as our fertile farmlands tempt them or they desire to control our trade they will search for every opportunity to take what they want if that means destroying akkad those who seek power or wealth will demand it we must be prepared for war whether it comes as an invasion or more raids across our border no one spoke and it seemed as if the sighing of the trees gave voice to everyones thoughts we fought to save our city from the barbarians nicar said breaking the silence we fought to take back akkad from korthac would we now give it away to the sumerians how much would it take to satisfy their demands half our land all of it so you think war is the answer rebba said attacking other cities and destroying them only if they bring war to us eskkar said we have to prepare akkad to meet whatever threat may come either next year or the year after that or the one after that no one wants war trella said then you think we can avoid a conflict rebba directed the question to trella he knew she decided akkads future as much if not more so as her husband and that she wanted peace no i think it will come trella said but we may be able to delay it and we can hope to make any conflict a short one and it will be better for akkad if the war is fought in sumeria and not in our lands then it will be their farms and villages that are ravaged whatever course of action we decide we must speak as one voice eskkar said if the people think we are not united then their resolve will weaken and sumerias desire for revenge will grow stronger my commanders and i have seen the face of the enemy we believe akkad needs to prepare for war but if the nobles and leading merchants show disagreement it will give strength to our enemy even as it weakens ourselves i agree corio said we must prepare for war as do i nicar said but with one condition we must make every effort to maintain peace with sumeria i do not want our words or preparations to force them into war nor do i eskkar said and remember they have little that we would want if akkad is to grow we will grow to the north and to the west sumeria has nothing to fear from us in time they should have the wits to understand that then prepare for war nicar said the sooner we can achieve a lasting peace the better prepare for war rebba said nestor and decca looked at each other resignation on their faces prepare for war all eyes went to yavtar as one of the most prosperous traders in the city his opinion carried weight the half dozen boats he owned plied the river carrying cargo north and south and he had risked his life in the battle to save akkad from korthac i spoke with one of the leading merchants in sumer like us he understands that trade is cheaper than war it is their leader eridu seeking the glory of a conquest who brought on this conflict if we treat them fairly in matters of trade we may avoid any future raids to accomplish that trella added we want to set up a trading village just inside the border that will make it simpler to trade with sumeria to exchange food for their goods a convenient trading outpost will make it easier for them to choose peace rather than war then were all agreed good eskkar let his body relax perhaps we can start by trying to convince eridu of our peaceful intentions it might be better if i spoke with him nicar said hes not likely to want to hear anything from the man who cut off his hand no doubt eskkar said he wanted nothing further to do with eridu anyway just make sure he knows what hell lose if he tries anything like that again the next day with midmorning approaching two members of the citys guard finally found the man they sought orodes lay sleeping on his side stretched out against the wall of a tavern ignored by the people passing to and fro in the lane bodies in the lanes drunk sleeping or dead were not an uncommon sight the guards one a seasoned veteran named wakannh and the other much younger almost walked past the inert body before the senior man slowed his pace and stopped a few steps away wait i think thats the one she wants and about time too wakannh crossed to the man and peered down i recognize him he prodded the unresponsive body with his toe drunk and passed out get him on his feet im not carrying a drunk all the way to the compound by myself the younger guard protested carry him drag him by his balls i dont give a shit what you do as a leader of ten the older guard didnt intend to waste any of his own muscles on a drunk thats what recruits were for just get him moving muttering under his breath the second guard rolled the still snoring orodes onto his back demons piss the pig threw up on himself are you sure this is the one wakannh leaned over to look closer at the mans dirt and vomitcrusted face ugghh he stinks someones pissed on him too but thats orodes he grabbed orodess arm and together they yanked him to his feet waking him up in the process the groggy man tried to protest but the two soldiers gripped orodes by his arms and halfwalking and halfdragging led the helpless man away to the amusement of those onlookers who stopped to watch two lanes over the leader of ten stopped beside one of the public wells might as well clean him up here no sense bringing anything that filthy into lady trellas courtyard the second man shoved orodes head first into the trough that collected the water and held him there until he coughed and choked flailing his arms but unable to lift his head when the guard jerked orodess head up by his hair he just hung there helpless too weak even to raise his arms what about his tunic stinks of piss and vomit probably full of lice too get rid of it wakannh agreed its worse than nothing the guard grasped the tunic with both hands and ripped it apart then he jerked the torn remnants from orodess body and kicked them aside wash yourself up you pig a few bystanders collected and laughed at the naked mans plight what are you orodes squinted into the morning sun open your mouth again and ill cut your balls off wakannh warned him someone at the compound wants you so thats where youre going they probably want to hang you by your puny prick for stinking up the city now clean yourself up or ill throw you down the well the compound as anyone living in akkad more than a day knew referred to the residence of king eskkar and lady trella the guards stood there while orodes splashed water over his face and chest again and again until most of the dirt and stench had faded away by the time he finished cleaning himself orodes appeared to have regained his senses by ishtars tits i hope they do hang him by his prick the recruit said he still stinks o rodes had never visited lord eskkars courtyard but he had little time for more than a quick glance around wakannh had happily handed him over to the soldiers at the entrance who enjoyed a good laugh at the naked mans expense but they found a castoff garment for him to wear and let him drink from the private well at the rear of the house when he finished quenching his thirst he washed his face and hands once again this time more to help sober up than get clean when he finished his ablutions orodes turned to find that the courtyard soldiers had departed and a woman taken their place even with his head feeling like it might split in two he recognized annoksurs tall frame do you have your wits about you orodes nodded then grimaced at the movement what do you want why am i here annoksur took a step toward him examining him with care youre here because lady trella wishes to speak with you if you have some other important business to attend to ill tell her so and you can return to the tavern where they found you orodes ignored the jibe whatever the reason few turned down an opportunity to speak with one of the rulers of akkad i can talk annoksur nodded agreement good come with me she led him into the house pausing only to speak to one of the women servants then led orodes up the stairs and into the workroom sit down she said pointing to the table lady trella will be here shortly orodes eased himself onto the bench then looked up to see the servant approaching carrying a tray in both her hands it contained bread a handful of dates and a hunk of cheese only slightly past its best orodes realized he felt ravenous he hadnt eaten anything yesterday morning before drinking himself into a stupor at the tavern two copper coins stolen from a drunken patron provided him with more than enough ale to drink himself unconscious by the time orodes finished swallowing the first mouthful of bread the serving woman returned with two cups weak ale and water she put them down and left the chamber he reached for the ale then stopped his hand shook and for a moment he couldnt control his muscles orodes closed his eyes took a deep breath and shifted his hand to the other cup a meeting with lady trella was not the time to be drinking anything stronger than water when he finished eating only crumbs from the bread and pits from the dates remained on the platter orodes allowed himself to take a small sip from the ale cup his head had almost ceased throbbing the door to the inner room opened and lady trella and annoksur came out a child started crying in the background but annoksur shut the door and the sound faded remembering his manners orodes pushed himself to his feet and bowed weve met before orodes trella began almost three years ago when your father fashioned eskkars new sword you helped asmar with the casting as i recall i remember lady trella im surprised that you do just before the barbarian invasion trella had visited asmars shop at first his father had tried to patronize the young slave girl dressed in a shabby garment but by her third visit orodes realized that trella not only knew exactly what she wanted but how it should be made she sat across from him and nodded for him to sit since then ive learned some things about you have you reconciled with your father master smith asmar orodes clenched his teeth for a moment so lady trella had spoken with his father that meant she knew all about the family quarrel and probably about the reasons for orodess recent return to akkad hed spent the last year and a half working at a mine in the eastern hill country operated by his uncle asmar and his brother both suffered from the same lack of imagination both believed the old ways were the best ways and that the young should do as they were told orodes clashed so often with his uncle that he was finally ordered to leave otherwise he would still be there slaving away for little more than his keep he pushed those thoughts out of his mind no my father has ordered me never to return to his house if lady trella had summoned him to talk about his father he would take his leave then i may have something that may interest you as you may be aware i know some of the mysteries of gold and the smelting of ores ive learned of a place that may have a good quantity of gold i need someone to examine the site and report back to me if there is sufficient ore of high quality i may wish to establish a mine there to extract the gold and anything else of value your father asmar says you know much about such things orodes found it hard to believe that his father had said anything good about his wayward son there are several areas where copper can be found in the eastern foothills lady trella orodes said even my father has laid claim to one such place with the chief judge copper of course was the most important metal with copper and tin combined in the right proportion you could make bronze and from bronze came tools and weapons where you found copper ores you usually also found traces of gold silver lead tin and arsenic as well as other useful metals each site would have these metals in varying qualities and quantities but all the mines were in the far north at the base of the steppes or the distant east in the foothills of the zargos mountains orodes shook his head there is little enough copper near here you might find a few pockets of gold along the tigris but most of those have already been harvested still i would like someone to examine this place and determine its potential if there is sufficient supply of the noble metals i might need a skilled smith to establish the mining operation im told that you have the necessary knowledge for such a task is this something you would consider orodes would indeed his father had driven him from his house partly because orodes in his twentythird season had already mastered all the mysteries of gold copper and bronze he also wanted to change his fathers procedures for smelting the ores and refining the metals orodes believed that with some experimentation he could improve those procedures and produce higherquality metals in greater quantities asmar a capable and skillful metal worker saw no reason to change anything in his craft or try anything new father and son had disagreed often until asmar in his anger sent the disobedient son east to his brothers mine where orodes was supposed to remain until he learned to be a dutiful son obedient to his father and elder brothers or as it happened until the master smith at the mine grew so annoyed at orodess constant and vexatious suggestions that he threw him out of course trella would know all these embarrassing facts her spies as everyone agreed knew everything about every household in the city and of course she knew about copper and where it was likely to be found telling her she might be wrong probably wasnt a good idea he focused his gaze on her eyes she sat there patiently letting him collect his thoughts waiting for him to realize the full import of the conversation he noticed that her eyes never left his face always seeking to learn more about him those same eyes also hinted that she knew more than she said the silence lengthened and he realized that he hadnt answered her question yes lady trella i can examine a prospective mining site and tell you whats worth digging for with the proper resources i can establish the smelters kilns crucibles and furnaces and convert the ores into the required metals trella nodded all the gold and silver from the mine would come to akkad but the master smith in charge of the site would be well paid how well paid would depend on what is found and how much can be taken from the earth are you interested in such a task orodes opened his mouth then closed it again those who oversaw a mine usually owned at least a part of it trella was offering to pay him for his skills like any common laborer still it was not an unreasonable offer considering he had no status as a master craftsman no patron to succor him he decided to ask for more what share of the mine would be mine lady trella she smiled at the bold question none not at first you would be paid fairly but if you wish to earn a share you will have to produce a steady and significant supply of ores delivered on time and without any being lost to the workers if you can accomplish that i would consider an arrangement where you would own a share of the mines output in the future as i said this mine belongs to the king and whatever is extracted from the earth will be used for akkads needs and in selecting you for this task i am taking something of a risk he would be a paid laborer nothing more nevertheless anything was preferable to starving in the streets of akkad and it would gall his father to learn that his wayward son had taken an important assignment from lady trella even if it turned out to be nothing i would accept such a task lady trella she turned to annoksur who sat quietly across the room apparently uninterested in the conversation can you bring in tooraj without saying anything annoksur rose and left the room you realize orodes trella went on that there must be no drinking no wandering off and not a word must be said to anyone about the mine the first time you are found drunk will be your last remember that orodes understood only a fool would risk trellas displeasure besides he drank only because he had nothing else with an opportunity such as she offered he would have no need to drink himself into a stupor annoksur returned a soldier with the hawk clan emblem stitched on his tunic following her the man wore a patch over his left eye trella rose welcome tooraj it is good to see you again orodes felt surprise the queen of akkad had risen to her feet to greet a common soldier or not so common he realized members of the hawk clan were few in number the soldier bowed much lower than orodess simple incline of the head my thanks to you and king eskkar this is the young man i spoke of his name is orodes and i place him in your care that sounded reasonable enough but the cold stare that toorajs one eye fixed on orodes made him realize that the soldier not only knew of orodess past indiscretions but didnt intend to tolerate any more of them she said to orodes tooraj will be in charge of the expedition to examine the mine please obey all his instructions she turned to the soldier are you ready to depart yes lady trella my men and i are waiting good annoksur will accompany you both to the docks if there is anything you need to take with you orodes let her know with a shock orodes realized that they meant leave now this moment realizing he had been dismissed orodes pushed himself to his feet to find lady trella again smiling at him good luck orodes i hope we can talk again soon when youre ready to tell me what youve found her smile as much as her hopeful words caught him by surprise in that moment he realized how beautiful she was and how much he wanted to please her the strange sensation stayed with him all the way to the docks that evening eskkars most senior commanders joined him for dinner at the compound the gathering included gatus bantor hathor the egyptian and yavtar no other guests attended during the meal the soldiers took their lead from their host no one spoke about the coming war that topic remained far too important to discuss in front of the servants and guards the setting sun hadnt yet touched the horizon but the heat of the day was fading when eskkar and his guests left the supper table in the courtyard eskkar led the way to the tiny garden at the rear of the house a private place usually reserved for his and trellas use the five men settled comfortably on their seats relaxing after a long day and still pleasantly full of food after the bountiful meal lady trellas cooks had served a servant brought a pitcher of ale in case anyone wanted something stronger than water and set it on the table before leaving akkads leaders alone a pitcher of fresh well water and cups rested in the center of the table the evening air would be pleasant and far more relaxing than eskkars workroom the inner walls of the courtyard whitewashed to a cool white formed two sides of a square the house itself rising up to the second story provided a third side the fourth side opened up into the rearmost part of the main courtyard a well nearby provided fresh water for the compound and eskkar had washed the dust from his body many times in the last two no now nearly three years that he lived there four wooden flower boxes extended along the base of the walls the first of summers tulips provided tiny cups of purple red and yellow scattered among the white lilies and the flax plants blue flowers a bench stood against the side of the house and two young trees gave just enough shade to cover the small table centered beneath them eskkar enjoyed the semiprivate enclosure the servants respected their masters special place and ventured into the rear of the house only for urgent matters he and trella had made love here more than once and they both enjoyed the peaceful surroundings the trees had grown higher since he first took possession of the house the assassin who had tried to kill trella had been tied between those two trees and tortured until he revealed the name of the young noble who hired him the nobles head now lay buried deep in the earth between those same trees for this meeting trella had arranged for extra chairs to be carried in of course eskkar wanted trella there after nearly three years at his side helping to rule akkad everyone sought her advice and counsel hed once asked her if she wished to be a member of the hawk clan she had after all struck a blow against korthac a woman in the hawk clan she laughed a happy sound that turned her into a young girl once again im flattered at the thought but i think you should keep the hawk clan reserved for men a few moments later trella and annoksur joined the gathering trellas friend and confidante also had an important role to play in any coming conflict the fact that she was a woman and bantors wife made no difference at this table everyone would speak as equals before she took her place annoksur spoke to the guards and made sure the sentries remained far enough away so that they couldnt overhear what would be said trella and annoksur sat on either side of eskkar facing the four men across the table yesterday you men attended the meeting with the nobles eskkar began without any preamble you heard their decision now it is time for us to talk about how the coming war will be fought we need to decide what tactics we will use how we will carry the war south and what defenses akkad will need in the next few months well face many choices and make many decisions the more we can plan for the future the easier those decisions will be he looked at each of them in turn gatus almost twice as old as the others had fought akkads battles all his life and he knew more about training men than anyone bantor had served in akkads guard most of his life and hed proven both his leadership and fighting skills in the battle with korthac hathor while new to akkad had fought for almost twenty years across the length and breadth of egypt yavtar had traded and sailed the tigris all his life and joined the fight when the akkadians overthrew korthac and reclaimed their city they had shared common dangers and fought together in some cases side by side all were hawk clan members and each had sworn the oath to stand by his brothers they all knew not only how to fight but how to lead men in battle just as important eskkar valued their ideas and knew that none of these four would hesitate to offer his honest opinion so tonight the seven of us eskkar went on are going to start assembling an army for akkad and this army that were going to build will be like no other anyone has ever seen yavtars eyes widened in surprise why am i here i know little about such things because yavtar eskkar said this new army is going to need vast quantities of food and weapons you know every bend on the tigris and euphrates for that matter as well as every tributary and stream between them and who better than a river trader to know how to supply fighting men just as important you know how to build boats and how to train men to sail them and im going to want boats that can deliver men and supplies wherever theres enough water to float a hull so the more you learn about how our new army is built the better youll know how to supply it yavtar furrowed his brow how many boats will you need youll need crews to sail them soldiers to protect them and their cargoes all that will take months perhaps years yavtars voice trailed off as he saw the smile on eskkar face yes and theres much more yavtar i also want boats that can carry large numbers of fighting men over long distances and at great speed and i want other boats filled with men who fight on their own to capture or destroy our enemys vessels youll need to find and train men who know or can learn to fight from such a boat and where will i find these men i dont know eskkar couldnt help laughing at the look on yavtars face remember when you and your boats carried forty of us from bisitun to akkad in little more than a day we were in the city long before korthac expected because we raced down the river thats when i first realized that boats could be for more than just transporting a merchants goods he turned to hathor were going to need cavalry too but i dont just want men who can ride i want men trained to fight from horseback ride long distances on little food and water and still strike a heavy blow at the end of the day were going to need hundreds of horses along with all the things a fighting mount needs to be effective that means plenty of grain sacks to carry it in leather ropes cloth buckets everything you can think of to support a horse and his rider on a long campaign and weapons of course small bows that can be shot from a galloping horse would be best but also lances long swords as well as leather vests and helmets for protection the egyptians eyes widened at the scope of the request hathor please speak your mind trella said her voice soft and gentle as always you bring knowledge of warfare from egypt and no doubt there is much we can learn from you youll need a great many horsemen lady trella probably more than you can find hathor looked at the others but no one challenged his assertion the southern border is long and distances between akkad and the sippar are almost as far to project force over such a distance requires large numbers of horsemen in egypt we had many such horse fighters all armed with sword and lance but eskkar has described the steppe warriors to me and how they fight with bow and sword if we can train and supply such horsemen we would have an effective cavalry thats what the egyptians called their horse soldiers then we will call them that as well trella said but horses strong enough to carry a man and his weapons are in short supply and akkad has few men who can ride let alone fire an arrow from the back of a moving horse trella had learned much about the ways of the steppe warriors from eskkar including what weapons they used and how they fought ive been thinking about that eskkar said the ur nammu have those skills and we might ask them to help train our men perhaps they can gather horses for us as well the horses will need training as much as the men but a welltrained mount is worth at least two or three men on foot in a battle the ur nammu were the steppes clan who fought with eskkar during the battle against the alur meriki who had nearly wiped out the entire ur nammu clan eskkar had rescued the survivors and they owed him a blood debt for that deed though few in number theyd offered assistance to akkad mostly as a result of trellas generosity toward them during that conflict for almost three years shed directed the citys trade with them and ensured that they received fair treatment in all dealings now that foresight might prove to be helpful in the coming days even with whatever help you get from the ur nammu gatus said you wont have enough horses or trained riders besides there are many battlegrounds in the hills or over rocky ground where horses are useless well still need plenty of men trained to fight on foot probably armed with spears and swords only such forces can take a battle to the enemy occupy his land and hold it infantry hathor said offering another word from his native land in egypt there were two kinds heavy and light the heavy infantry wore leather armor and carried wicker shields and spears the light infantry carried smaller shields and used hook swords one line of spearmen wont be enough gatus said well need ranks of such men at least three or four deep enough to present a solid wall of spear points against an enemy even cavalry cannot attack ranks of spearmen head on hathor agreed not unless they greatly outnumber them when spearmen are formed up in a solid line they are vulnerable only from the flanks or rear and how will we protect our own ranks of spearmen eskkar had never faced such a line and his instinct told him to attack such a formation from the rear well our bowmen could defend the flanks and rear gatus rubbed his beard as he usually did whenever he worked things out bowmen are as difficult to recruit and train as horse fighters eskkar said our heavy bows require a strong man with powerful arms and keen eyes and he must be tall enough to handle the weapon well have to recruit them based on their skills hathor leaned forward on his bench eager to impart his knowledge the tall ones with quick wits and sharp eyes become archers the stronger less mobile men become spearmen if we can find them gatus said it wont be easy well find them eskkar said men still arrive in the city each day searching for a better life even if it means fighting well use every available man we can find in akkad and the countryside well break them into four groups those with the strength and skills will become archers those who can use a spear and sword will be trained to fight on foot those who can ride will fight on horseback and all those too weak or too small for anything else will be used as auxiliaries as what those who help the soldiers fight eskkar explained he rose and went to the bench against the wall when he returned he tossed something on the table its a sling yavtar said lifting the small leather pouch with its two long leather strips a toy for children to hunt rabbits or farmers too poor to afford a weapon years ago a woman nearly killed me with one of these eskkar remarked the others glanced at him in surprise he rarely talked about his days before arriving in akkad and shed just finished killing one man and wounding another with the same weapon he glanced around the table if a woman can do that much with such a toy then think what a welltrained and proficient boy or young man could do dont bother arguing with him yavtar gatus said if hes convinced these things can be deadly then i suppose well have to give it a try its a weapon that costs almost nothing to make eskkar went on you can pick up stones anywhere and use them as missiles every shepherd guarding a flock of sheep can hurl a stone a hundred paces slings can be used on hilly or uneven ground where the slinger cant be easily attacked remember there are many places where a horse cant go or where an archer cant easily plant his feet to work his bow yavtar tossed the sling back on the table and waved his hand in a dismissive gesture most of the land in sumeria is flat and open your slingers will be run down and killed not if theyre supported by archers soldiers and horsemen eskkar said thats why theyre called auxiliaries theyll be used only in certain situations and protected by our soldiers he turned to gatus there are hundreds of boys and young men in akkad who could learn to use a sling how many such recruits do you turn away each day im not sure maybe ten twenty sometimes more in the past weve turned down hundreds of recruits eskkar said either for being too young or too small now we could have an important role for them to play slingers will cost almost nothing to train feed and house thats something i suppose gatus knew how much the skilled bowmen received each month and for each one killed eskkar went on there will be another ten ready to take his place hathor touched the sling still resting on the table you cant send slingers against cavalry but they can help protect the rear ranks i cant see a bunch of boys with slings stopping spearmen or cavalry gatus said that depends korthac had a few such forces in egypt hathor said they did more than just protect the rear they could harry the enemy before the fight attack them from heights or even battle enemy horsemen stones raining down on you from above thrown by an unseen enemy will unnerve even the bravest infantryman and they could serve as foot scouts eskkar said to protect the bowmen and spearcarriers while on the march they could also guard the supply animals and maybe archers and slingers can hold their own against cavalry we can always give it a try i suppose gatus said slingers would be a small part of our forces anyway dont discount them yet eskkar shook his head trella and yavtar are telling us that soon sumer will be able to field an army four or five times as large as what we can expect to put together they can pick the time and place of battle by invading the borderlands whenever and wherever they choose theres nothing to stop them from crossing the border and fortifying a village or two thats why yavtar and his boats and crews will be needed and thats why slingers may be useful these new tactics could turn a battle he glanced around the table since well be outnumbered in any conflict well need an army that doesnt grow weak when they see the superior numbers of the enemy gatus and i have been talking about these things and it can be done in fact poor gatus here has the hardest job of all i see nothing is going to change gatus grumbled ill still have to do most of the work everyone laughed with the old soldier they knew he wouldnt have it any other way gatus is going to build an army of soldiers who fight on foot eskkar said not archers mitrac will take charge of all the archers and keep training them as before but in our new army the archers role will be limited were going to have a strong force of men armed with spears and carrying shields who can take the attack to the enemy if you start arming and training so many yavtar said sumer will learn about it and redouble their efforts to recruit more men theyll be convinced youre preparing to invade them and if we dont prepare for war theyll use the time to build up their army anyway and invade us eskkar shook his head no matter what course we choose it always leads to war but youre right about the buildup the longer we can keep our efforts concealed the better and how will you accomplish that by training our new soldiers in small groups and scattering those groups over the countryside but especially in the north well still train here in akkad but well keep men moving in and out of the city so that the overall number here remains the same if we manage it properly we should be able to confuse sumers spies as to exactly how many men we have under arms will that work yavtar sounded dubious it will though im not sure for how long eskkar said well work out the details on all these things later today we need to think about what our army will be like each of our soldiers will have to master at least two weapons as gatus says the infantry will learn the spear and sword while the slingers will master slings and short javelins the bowmen already know how to use a sword so theres nothing new there and the horsemen will learn to use the short bow or the longer javelins as well as the horse sword he turned to gatus well need more training camps well start training the men here gatus said as we always have as soon as we establish some new camps well move the more experienced men out to the north some even farther north than bisitun well need a camp for hathor and his horsemen another one for the soldiers wholl fight with sword and shield and spears he sighed i thought i was going to be relaxing in my old age a grin spread across his weathered face archers have been our primary weapon bantor said speaking for the first time our bowmen consider themselves the main force defending akkad now you want to replace them with spearmen not replace them gatus said but support them its true our archers can wreak havoc on our enemies but they cant carry the battle to them exposed archers with no shields run the risk of being run down but supported and protected by spearmen they will remain a deadly force against our enemy remember nothing scares men more than seeing a wall of spears coming at them especially with bowmen following behind so well use a combined force eskkar said heavily armed foot soldiers lightly armed cavalry and bowmen and a support force of slingers with those four groups of fighters we should be able to face whatever the enemy sends against us the sumerians will have as much trouble finding good horses as we will hathor said theyll arm most of their men with swords and shields and send them into battle from what everyone has told me about sumeria theyll use many such fighters what we called light infantry where will the gold for all this come from gatus rapped his water cup on the table even akkads nobles and merchants wont stand for such an expense and thats assuming theres enough gold in the city have you figured out how much this is going to cost yes eskkar replied well begin with king eridus ransom that should be more than enough to get us started i think i may have the solution to that gatus every eye went to trella including eskkars a few months ago i learned of a place not far from here that might hold a rich deposit of gold and possibly silver the time has come to examine the site to see if it can yield sufficient ores to meet part of our needs if it can perhaps we can pay not only for the men but also for the equipment they will need and no one has found this place eskkar turned to trella in surprise wouldnt news of such a discovery be spread far and wide in a matter of days why didnt you tell trella touched her husbands arm to halt the questions i didnt want to tell you until i knew for sure annoksur brought a woman to me about a month ago her name was calla her family had discovered the site and were gathering up surface gold when they were attacked by bandits everyone else was killed her husband his brothers callas two children she was raped and left for dead the bandits took all the gold callas family had found and rode off she survived and managed to return to akkad and told her tale to annoksur weve been taking care of her ever since i gave her a small house and now she works with annoksur in return calla has revealed nothing about the find to anyone else now you all must continue to keep the secret until we can first examine the site and if it shows promise claim it for akkad and what of the bandits eskkar understood how bandits would react if theyre cunning enough theyll be returning to the place every few months to do their own digging they may even have taken all the gold by now if the gold is on the surface like nuggets in the river or dust in pockets the site would be easily depleted with a few days work its possible trella agreed but calla thinks the bandits just moved on satisfied with what they had taken how do you know so much about gold gatus asked eskkar something else from your past yes the single word told gatus and hathor that nothing else about eskkars previous experience with gold would be forthcoming trella returned to her story calla knew she could not claim such a site by herself i promised her a reward and a secure place of her own if she would keep the secret still we wont know for sure until we visit the place if the bandits are there or have returned from time to time well take it from them with a gold mine of our own eskkar mused we should be able to pay for many new recruits and their weapons the mine would belong to the king trella said to be used to pay for soldiers to defend the city and its people even the nobles would not object to that especially if it would lessen the burden on them the people will know we are not claiming the gold for ourselves and the gold will flow through akkad helping all of our merchants craftsmen and innkeepers you are looking into this eskkar took trella by the hand oh yes husband ive already started in the last few days ive considered each of the goldsmiths in akkad to see who would best suit our needs i wanted someone with quick wits a man flexible enough to adapt to new ways i settled on a young goldsmith who can inspect the site estimate its potential and develop the mine if there is one this morning we dispatched him north to examine the place accompanied by a few soldiers but do not get your hopes raised up just yet as you say there may be little or no gold remaining there either way we should know in ten days or so eskkar knew that annoksur had dispatched a handful of soldiers on yet another mission but he hadnt asked the reason any quantity of gold we could get it could make a difference we must all keep this a secret for now trella said as soon as i learn anything about the find well know what to do forgetting the gold for a moment bantor said speaking for the first time what are you going to tell our men about all these preparations theyll want to know why akkad is building up its forces im not sure yet eskkar said well need to find something to account for it maybe we can say that the barbarians are returning into the northern lands that would explain what were doing and it would please the sumerians im sure to know that we face an old enemy eskkar looked at each of them what ill need from all of you are ways to make this work figure out what youre going to need and how much we can tell the rest of the men for now we must keep this to ourselves youre not going to tell klexor and the other subcommanders hathor looked uncomfortable about that no not yet trella and annoksur think we should tell as few as possible for now we can keep them busy enough with the training how much time do we have yavtar settled his elbows on the table i mean if i have to build boats and find crews it could take months even years eskkar smiled at yavtars gradual acceptance of the plan well have to assume that sumer will be capable of attempting another push into the borderlands as early as next year but more likely the following year thats why we need to start preparing as soon as possible youre keeping watch on king eridu bantor asked a boat from sumer arrived this afternoon with the ransom the gold is already under guard only a few dozen paces away eridu departs at dawn then that is settled eskkar said now we know what we need to begin maybe more gatus said if eridu has learned his lesson or less trellas voice held a hint of resignation it seems wars come suddenly always catching one side by surprise yet annoksur and i have already taken measures to get more information from sumer and its leaders but we cant count on that too much lets just hope whoever is advising eridu isnt working on new ways to wage war as well yavtar said then we are agreed eskkar said satisfaction in his voice but it will be up to you four to make this plan work if you believe we can do this then the men will believe and accept these new ideas soon enough the commanders glanced at each other all of them joined together now to face the challenge eskkar knew they would already be thinking of how they could begin well start making our plans tomorrow but now trella has some more news i wanted to tell you what annoksur and i have been planning trella began first and most important we will need many spies in sumer and the other southern cities we must search for suitable men and women as quickly as possible so that they can be settled into the sumerian cities once war is imminent any new arrivals will be viewed with suspicion so the sooner we can get them in place the more likely theyll be able to provide us with information how will they get information back to akkad gatus asked its nearly nine days on horseback to get from sumer to here if your spies disappear for days on end wont that be noticed yes but yavtar can help with that merchants will use the river as much as ever boats come and go often without anyone noticing if we place some of our most trusted men among yavtars crews they can gather information as they travel up and down the two rivers weve talked about using the river for such things before eskkar said i can always use more good river men yavtar said soldiers make good rowers and i wouldnt have to pay them well not much anyway everyone chuckled at the idea of soldiers laboring to increase yavtars profits at least you wont be using any of my horsemen for rowers hathor said have you any advice for us hathor trella smiled reassuringly at the egyptian knowing that any mention of his past would bring a pang of sorrow youve fought battles with large numbers of soldiers on each side so you must know what will be needed well you will need supplies for the men the less time the soldiers spend searching for food the more they can march not only food and water but weapons as well bantor annoksurs husband and the most loyal of eskkars leaders seldom spoke but when he did everyone heeded his words there are never enough arrows on the battlefield a good bowman can empty a full quiver of arrows in a few moments once they are gone hes of little use in a fight armed only with a short sword that means we will have to make and store large numbers of arrows bowstrings and even bows trella said but if yavtar can bring your men fresh supplies of these things then our archers will have plenty of shafts to prolong their part in the battle youre assuming that all the battles will be fought near a river gatus argued soldiers need to find the right kind of battlefield and it might be a day or twos march away from wherever yavtar can bring his boats then i would suggest that all of you stay as close to the river as possible trella said the advantage of having two or three ships deliver thousands of arrows or fresh food may be as important or even more so than choosing the right place if we plan our battles in advance we can make sure of being close to water and all the major cities of sumeria are located near one or the other of the two rivers and there are dozens of smaller streams besides arrows and food bantor continued an army needs grain for the horses torches and oil to light the night ropes for the corrals shovels sharpening stones for the swords even cooking pots the more that we can load onto a boat the less the men will have to carry and the farther theyll be able to march thats another problem hathor said our soldiers will travel different distances each day depending on the land whether its hilly or sandy or grassland in egypt we never knew for certain how many days it would take to march from one village to another we need to train the soldiers to march at least a certain number of miles per day gatus said no matter what the land is like the others looked doubtful at that idea would it be of value to know how far you are from your destinations trella paused for a moment we could measure the distances between here and the southern cities then if we knew the soldiers could march so many miles in a day we would know when they could arrive how will you measure the distances gatus sounded skeptical and rightfully so no one even knew exactly how far it was from akkad to larsa which was the closest city we could train walkers trella said men who would pace off a certain distance with each step every hundred steps he moves a pebble from one hand to the other that way we could count the steps between akkad and the southern cities and villages it would also be good to know when weve reached certain places on the journey hathor said leaning forward on the table we should learn the location of every landmark between here and sumer and make a few landmarks of our own where there are none eskkar said if our walkers marked trees and rocks as they went or built up piles of stones we would know how far wed traveled that would be useful on the river as well yavtar said in time of war the river is safer at night if the landmarks could be seen at night that would be even better but when theres no moon theres little that can be seen the best landmark at night is a fire trella said it doesnt have to be a real fire a candle in an open box facing the water can be seen over great distances i think you would need help from villagers living in those places up and down the rivers gatus said can that be done perhaps let annoksur and me think about that one what else will your marching armies need maps eskkar remembered the maps they had used to fight the alur meriki if we had good maps we could mark our progress against the landmarks and know how far weve traveled and how far we had to go isnt that a lot to ask bantor said can we show that much information on a piece of cloth no not one piece trella said but a dozen or more would be enough to show everything you will need to take a few clerks with you to war eskkar they could keep track of the maps and landmarks and mark off each days progress eskkar groaned and everyone laughed since hed become akkads ruler and even before the clerks of the nobles and trellas own people followed him everywhere marking down every expense on a pottery shard a permanent record of every activity already the shelves in the storage rooms creaked under the weight clerks going to war eskkar shook his head at the idea all this is well and good gatus said but what happens when we reach larsa well have to besiege it fight our way in and from what yavtar tells us all of sumeria is building walls around every dung heap let alone larsa and isin and the other large cities yes youre right gatus trella thought about that for a moment i think we need to send corios people to visit all the cities in sumeria they should examine the walls for weak points and determine the best method and place to attack each city that way when the army arrives it can get right to work without having to worry about what to do youre fighting the war in advance lady trella hathor said but all these ideas are good ones the more prepared we are the more the men will want to fight men always fight better when they think they have some advantage eskkar said ive one more suggestion to make trella turned to annoksur actually annoksur suggested it you need a special place to meet and talk about your plans a private place a place with only one purpose we could build another room here on the second level and dedicate the new chamber to planning the war we would enter it only from the workroom so only the most trusted servants will ever see the inside and we can display the maps there as well bantor said perhaps even paint them on the walls remember the model of akkad that corios apprentices built for the first wall eskkar had looked at it in astonishment a miniature city displayed in perfect detail on a long table if we had something like that something that stretched from akkad to sumer we could use it to plan the marches and even mark possible battlefields that will take a big room indeed gatus said drawing another laugh ill speak to corio about it trella said hell have to build the new room anyway so hell be spending plenty of time here if we can do all or even most of the things youve said hathor leaned forward unable to conceal his eagerness i think well be able to wage a new kind of war such advantages would be worth a great number of men the more we know about our enemy eskkar said the easier this fight will be if our spies can learn about our enemies how many men they have how well trained what weapons they prefer how theyre fed and resupplied we can use that knowledge to help plan for battle that will make our soldiers fight even harder and if we train them gatus said really train them well theyll stand up to anything sumeria can send against us youll take charge of that gatus eskkar said no one understands how to train men as well as you do everyone nodded agreement during the battle with the alur meriki gatuss training had transformed more than a few akkadians into the equal of even the strongest barbarians so gatus you will need to outdo yourself this time eskkar said and all of you will have more ideas on how to make our forces stronger in the months to come im sure we can think of even more ways to aid the soldiers they continued speaking long into the night hathor had more to impart about cities fighting against each other and eskkar knew something about that too from his days as a soldier for hire trella asked many more questions committing to memory every word that was spoken every useful fact that she could glean from the mens words in the coming weeks and months she would know or soon learn everything that would be needed to prepare for and support such a war at last gatus yawned and declared he needed to get to sleep a glance up at the moon showed that midnight had come and gone trella had the last words let us hope war never comes but if we must fight again then let us be well prepared remember like the days when we faced the alur meriki this is a war we dare not lose before retiring to their bedroom trella checked on little sargon the boy slept well secure in his bed and with his nurse watching over him she blew out the candle and slipped beneath the blanket where eskkar held her close against the darkness im sorry that war must come again to akkad trouble seems to follow wherever i go war would come here whoever ruled she answered the southern lands are needed to provide food for our people and allow us to expand to the north and west without those farms akkad will not be able to grow and would slowly begin to starve that must not happen especially now that we have sargon to worry about yes he will rule over all these lands someday if our luck holds true its more than luck that has brought us this far eskkar say what you will but the gods favor you yes they brought you to me or my luck did she knew he believed more in his luck than any of the fickle gods who needed constant appeasement through prayers and offerings provided by the greedy priests or so they claimed to those who believed their every word nevertheless she knew fate or some higher purpose of the gods had brought the two of them together eskkar kissed the curve of her neck and she relaxed against him each day is a blessing she remembered her father saying death may come through your door at any time my little daughter so live and enjoy your life as much as you can death indeed had come for her father in the middle of the night when he least expected it she was glad that for many years he had enjoyed his life and his family so much finding some joy in whatever each day brought eskkars hands touched her breasts and she put thoughts of her father aside instead she sighed and arched her body against her husbands his strong hands always aroused the fire in her loins do you still enjoy my touch yes master she whispered this slave enjoys your attentions i will try to please you he laughed you already have trella she laughed too and returned his kiss with one of her own a fterward trella remained in the circle of eskkars arm somehow she always felt safer sleeping beside him to know that someone would fight to protect you would risk his own death if necessary meant so much more to her now trella knew how easily a life could cease in the space of one day shed seen her parents murdered her brother carried off to the mines and herself sold into slavery her comfortable life had ended in an orgy of blood and tears just when she thought all that was behind her korthac had done it again after a single night of fighting he forced her to kneel at his feet and beg for the life of her coming child that time eskkar had rescued her and hed fought a desperate fight to save her life and that of little sargon right in this very room korthac would have tossed the baby into the fires before turning trella over to his brutal soldiers for their amusement for a few days before he put her to death now another threat had arisen this one less immediate perhaps but just as dangerous the thought of the sumerians being a danger seemed odd she herself was from those lands as much a sumerian as anyone born in the city of sumer nevertheless no one in akkad ever mentioned it most probably didnt even realize it almost everyone within the citys walls had come from somewhere else those born in the old village of orak and the nearby farms were few in number compared to those who had sought akkads safety no she eskkar and now little sargon were the first true akkadians most of the citys inhabitants felt the same way akkadians first the old name of orak had vanished within a few months now another trouble had arisen to provide a new challenge to her plans for the future the cities of sumeria had grown in size almost as fast as akkad but the southern lands held much less fertile soil to feed their increasing numbers they could only expand to the north eridu had tried and failed his attempt would not be the last trella had spoken to the prisoner several times questioning him about life in sumer and his citys plans but he said little ignoring her as a mere woman who should stay out of the affairs of men no eridu was a fool and sooner or later someone would take his place someone who might be vastly more cunning someone who would be an even greater danger to akkad for that reason the sumerians needed to be stopped now her husband would be happy winning another battle driving his enemies before him in defeat but trella wanted more she needed the southern cities to be defeated so decisively that it would take another generation before they dared to think once again about the lands to the north that generation would give akkad all the time it needed by then all the northern villages would be brought under akkads rule and the lands to the east and west settled and cultivated with most of the fertile lands under akkads control the sumerians would have no choice but to accept akkads borders the danger lay in the next few years if the sumerians again went to war they would not make the same mistakes a second time in defeat they had learned much sooner or later they would have stronger leaders who thought much as she did they would come in greater numbers and be prepared to win out over any defenses akkad could raise hathor had indeed spoken the truth when he said they didnt know where or when the battle would take place or even what kind of battle might face them if akkad were indeed greatly outnumbered then a single defeat could end her dreams for the citys future no she must plan for a brief campaign that completely mastered the sumerians one that defeated them so decisively that they would never again threaten trellas city so the battle must be fought and won starting today years before the actual fighting took place trella would have to make sure eskkar and his commanders planned for this great battle the single stroke that would crush their enemies that meant that the soldiers needed to be properly supplied possible battlegrounds mapped distances measured spies set in place food and weapons stockpiled and men recruited and trained the people of akkad must be prepared as well but subtly so that they did not realize before time what they were being asked to do and how much their existence was at stake last eskkar and his commanders needed to think of total victory korthac had thought that way hed planned the battle in advance gathered his forces in secret launched an attempt on eskkars life and captured the city in a single night trella had been helpless and only eskkars determination and courage had saved the day and his luck even he had not believed he could win back the city from the egyptians but had only intended to save his wife and son now she needed to guide eskkars mind as well as his commanders along those same channels akkad might have only one chance at survival if it slipped away trella might yet end up as a slave once again her final thoughts before she slipped into sleep were that akkad would need all the gold it could raise without gold to pay the soldiers and provide for their needs the city would fall much of her future and that of their city now depended on orodes and whatever precious metals lay in the ground to the north for orodes the next few days passed quickly and he scarcely remembered all the events that took place following his talk with trella once they left the compound tooraj clasped his hand on orodess shoulder and kept it there as if to insure that orodes didnt bolt and run the soldier might be missing an eye but his hand felt as if it could crush orodess shoulder to splinters without effort at the docks he found five soldiers and a woman waiting for them every soldier carried a bow and a quiver of arrows and wore a sword belted at the waist horses were available for everyone and two others served as pack animals so many horses meant a serious expedition orodes noted my tools ill need my tools at the site already taken from your fathers house and loaded tooraj said can you ride yes of course ive ridden good get him moving tooraj directed his last words to one of his soldiers who handed orodes a halter within moments they moved onto the ferry it took two trips to get all of them and their animals across the tigris as soon as the second vessel discharged its contents on the western bank tooraj told everyone to mount up and the little caravan started moving north the oneeyed soldier apparently preferred not to waste time talking and he said nothing else to orodes for the rest of the day tooraj a competent horsemen rode at the head of the party with the woman calla at his side orodes decided that she was the one who knew where they were going either the rest of the party didnt know their destination or more likely didnt care except for their leader all the soldiers appeared less at ease on horseback like orodes they probably rode infrequently and needed to pay close attention to their mounts they made good progress the horses while no doubt not up to toorajs idea of good horseflesh were sound enough and they plodded along without much urging they camped as soon as it grew dark tooraj ordered orodes to gather firewood along with the rest of the soldiers calla prepared the fire pit while the men foraged for wood animal dung or anything else that would burn fortunately this close to the river they didnt have to wander far from the campsite to find water they ate in silence one of the soldiers produced a wine skin which was passed around to everyone except orodes even calla took a long swig before passing the skin across orodess body to one of the soldiers orodes looked at it longingly but didnt bother asking for a portion tooraj obviously had his orders about giving wine to a man found drunk and passed out in akkads lanes still the smell of the raw date wine made the skin on orodess hands and arms crawl with longing youre the guide orodes decided he might as well talk to calla since it didnt seem likely hed have much to say to the soldiers besides any conversation would take his mind off the now empty wineskin her hair had a few streaks of gray in it and he guessed her age at about thirty seasons too old to consider as a bedmate at least not this early in the journey yes my husband and his kin found the place with the gold a few months ago she told him about the mine her family and what evil had overtaken them all orodes asked her about the gold its quality how theyd extract it but calla knew little about such things mostly she had cooked the food and stitched the leather skins into sacks to hold the gold the men gathered frustrated by her lack of useful knowledge orodes put his feet toward the fire and went to sleep ignoring the stilltalking soldiers and tooraj in the morning orodes felt better a long drink from the tigris refreshed him and he splashed water over his face and neck he hadnt slept very well in akkad since his return and certainly not during the night before when he lay down drunk in the lane orodes shook his head in embarrassment at the recollection breakfast consisted of bread and dates and everyone climbed back on the horses just as the sun cleared the horizon the rest of the day and night was uneventful but by midmorning of the third day calla began to point out landmarks for someone who had known almost nothing about the gold she certainly seemed to know her away around this part of the countryside orodes wondered if her family might have been bandits themselves for two days theyd kept the river in sight but now tooraj following callas lead turned the party westward and they soon moved into the low hills that overlooked the river orodes frowned as they rode west his father and his father before him had explored this part of the country many times none of these hills had ever produced any significant amounts of gold or anything else useful by midday theyd left the tigris several miles behind orodes decided calla had led them on a fools errand when she gestured to a barely noticeable opening between two hills they followed a twisting track of rockhard ground that led deeper into the hills soon enough orodes looked up to see a steep cliff blocking their way a blind trail as anyone could see calla continued toward it and as they rounded a large boulder orodes saw where the cliff face had collapsed revealing a narrow defile that twisted its way through the heart of the cliffs until several hundred paces later the pathway opened up and revealed a goodsized valley nestled between the hills orodes riding alone just behind calla and tooraj felt his jaw drop at the sight that awaited them a stream meandered its way through the center appearing from one side of the valley and disappearing into the other orodes didnt see any other entrances or exits to this hidden canyon one full of large boulders scattered about that towered over horse and rider he scarcely noticed the ground before him instead he stared at the rocks and jagged cliffs surrounding him the land had changed completely the soft hills with their occasional boulders had vanished replaced by more rugged limestone deposits by the gods he muttered as he looked around he could almost smell the copper and lead his instincts told him lay buried beneath the surface orodes had never seen such a place some cataclysm had ripped the earth apart and thrust these hills upwards carrying with them all the ores once hidden deep within their depths it had to be an earthquake he decided only a massive earthquake could shake these hills and lift the earth in such a fashion if he hadnt seen it for himself he wouldnt have believed it existed not in these lands the party reached the center of the valley and calla called out that this was where her family had camped orodes ignored her and the soldiers he rode to the far end of the valley near where the bubbling water issued from the ground he slid from the horse and knelt beside the stream he ran his fingers into the moving water ignoring the chill a glint of gold caught the sunlight reaching down he picked up a nugget the size of his thumb washed clean and pure by the running water he tossed it aside and moved away from the stream orodes knelt again and began digging into the earth letting the dirt settle through his fingers he could almost feel the ores just out of reach gold and silver lay buried here he felt certain waiting to be taken but there might be more much more rising he slapped the dirt from his hands calla and tooraj and the others stood about two hundred paces away in the middle of the vale unloading the horses orodes cupped his hands to his mouth tooraj come here bring my tools his horse had wandered off not that orodes cared he moved toward the base of the hills where the stream had broken through the rock walls and begun its journey through the little valley a pool had formed at the waters entrance and he splashed through it ignoring the biting cold on his feet the sharp chill told him the water came from deep within the earth forced upwards when the underground river struck the once buried cliffs the stream had pierced the limestone wall long ago breaking off chunks of stone and dumping them into the pool the rocky fragments had all vanished by now washed away by the flowing water but he knew theyd left behind nuggets of lead copper iron and gold buried not far beneath the silt at the bottom of the pool orodes didnt bother searching he knew the ores were here felt it in his bones instead he concentrated on the rock wall while working for his uncle orodes had often descended deep into the mountain mine scrambling down the treacherous shafts going down gallery by gallery following the threads of ore hed stood deep underground while he examined the interior of the mine by the flickering torchlight following the veins of ore created when the earth and rock were crushed together often separated by thin horizontal lines now studying the rock face before him those usual horizontal layer lines were gone instead he saw the threads pointed almost directly up to the sky this once flat earth from deep underground had not only been shoved to the surface but it had been turned on its side the ground beneath his feet might once have been hundreds of paces beneath the earths surface deeper than any miner had ever delved orodes realized he might be standing at the bottom of a mine instead of the top no miner had ever seen such a sight at least none that hed ever heard of what do you want tooraj rode up and dumped the large sack that contained orodess tools onto the ground im not some servant to come when you call orodes ignored him he untied the sack and removed a hammer and chisel set up the camp here but not too close to the pool were setting up camp in the middle of shut up and do what i say i want the camp set up here and tell your men to bring shovels and join me theres work to be done now before it gets too dark without waiting for a reply orodes moved back to the limestone wall beside the stream and began attacking the rock in moments the sounds of his bronze hammer striking the bronze chisel began to echo through the valley tooraj stunned into silence stared at orodes then he shook his head and rode back to where calla and the others waited orodes worked without ceasing his movements quick and sure with his implements rock chips flew from the wall many striking his face and arms dust flew into his eyes but he knew how to lessen that by keeping his eyes halfclosed he forgot about the other members of the party ignored everything until someone called his name he turned to find two of the soldiers standing before him you wanted shovels where are the rest of the soldiers i want everyone in the party digging on guard duty or setting up the camp tooraj says were all you can have for now he would deal with tooraj later orodes set the two men to work a dozen paces away after giving them orders to dig down from the base of the wall until they reached solid rock then he returned to his own chipping digging his way into the face of the rock he worked steadily ignoring the weariness in his arms pausing only to wipe the sweat and dust from his eyes or to examine some interesting bit of rock some of these he tossed aside but others he deposited on the ground behind him as he worked a small pile of gold nuggets and irregular pieces of ore began to accumulate orodes its getting dark calla stood beside him the two soldiers had disappeared and he realized he hadnt noticed them leave its time to eat calla said you need to rest and tooraj wants to talk to you breathing hard from his exertions orodes glanced up at the sky the sun had dipped behind the hills and already most of the light had gone hed worked without ceasing for almost the entire afternoon ill come his voice sounded hoarse and he paused to take a long drink from the stream washing the dust from his throat and careless of the chilly water that streamed over his face and chest after hed gotten rid of most of the dirt orodes dumped the rest of his tools on the ground and filled the sack with the nuggets and samples hed marked for further study when he tried to lift it he could barely swing the sack up over his shoulder hunched over he followed calla back to the campfire i thought you were going to dig all through the night tooraj remarked as orodes let the heavy sack fall to the ground near the fire the smell of meat cooking in a copper pot assailed orodes he hadnt eaten anything since theyd set out this morning calla filled a bowl with stew and handed it to him he clasped his hands around it letting the warmth flow through his fingers for a moment then began eating what orders did lady trella give you tooraj he got the words out between mouthfuls the soldier looked at him closely this wasnt the drunken youth picked up from akkads lanes or even the sullen and quiet young man who had ridden north the last two days blood spatter marked his upper arm and tunic and one of his fingers had taken a nasty cut but orodes didnt seem to notice he had changed the moment hed arrived at this place something in orodess voice now commanded respect the soldiers noticed it too and their conversation ceased as they watched to see how their leader reacted im to stay with you a few days until youve had a chance to examine the site and settle in then ill ride back to akkad and report to lady trella collect anything else we may need and return orodes shook his head and gulped another mouthful from the nearly empty bowl hed forgotten the first rule of camping the last one to take his supper received the smallest portion theres no need to wait i already have all i need he poked at the sack with his foot you and i will return tomorrow and ill give my report to trella tooraj frowned at orodess failure to use lady trellas title but the young man was too busy licking the remains of the bowl to notice but weve only arrived i thought it would take many days before you i thought so too but i was wrong this place has already told me all i need to know now its time to return to akkad so we can come back here as soon as possible and start mining if we leave right after dawn you and i can be in akkad well before dark on the following day he stood and dropped the empty bowl in front of calla wake me before dawn i want to be on the move at first light without another word or glance at anyone around the campfire orodes rolled over onto his side cradled his head on his arms and closed his eyes tooraj appeared ready to vent his anger but calla shook her head best do as he asks lady trella will know whats best if orodes heard her speak he gave no sign in a few moments he started breathing heavily tooraj muttered an oath and stomped off into the darkness to vent his anger alone a map room very interesting yes that would require quite an expansion if you wished to work with such a large model with the single entry you want and to carry the weight of men using it i think it would need special supports extra beams a completely new design then im speaking to the right person noble corio trella said the two sat alone in the workroom she had requested a private meeting with akkads master builder to discuss a new addition to the house who else can we turn to when akkad needs something new and difficult corio hunched his chair closer to the table and picked up the slim stick of chalk bound with a rag a square section of slate framed with wood and a rope attached to the top served as his drawing board an apprentice usually carried the slate around his neck always ready should his master need his services but this morning the apprentice waited in the courtyard below while trella alone met akkads master builder no need to flatter me trella let me sketch something while we speak trella leaned forward always interested in learning something new corios nimble fingers belied the silver hair that covered his head he applied chalk to the slate and with deft strokes he soon had a rough outline to show well need to build it as a separate structure almost like a second story with nothing underneath corio said talking as much to himself as to trella the roof over the rest of the house wont hold the weight and the walls werent built for it either so if we sink five or six beams into the ground on either side we can bridge the house with planks and use those to support the floor the walls and roof will need to be wood no mud bricks because of the weight mmmn youre sure you want it up here right off the workroom easier and cheaper to build an addition to the house on the ground yes corio lifted his eyes at the response the single word offered without any explanation it would be more secure up here he said after collecting his thoughts for a few moments what you ask can be done though i dont think anyone has ever built such a structure before youll need a good supply of various types of lumber most of which will have to come from the north the land around akkad boasted plenty of trees but not the dense and strong wood needed to bear large amounts of weight all those had to be brought downriver from the forests at the base of the steppes please use whatever materials you think best corio all those beams will make it expensive are you sure i mean will you have the map room will be a great help in preparing for the coming war well use part of eridus ransom to pay for it and im hopeful that soon a new source of gold will be found so spend whatever you need but the work must begin immediately and be completed as soon as possible mmmn corio continued his sketching in silence for a few moments one door you say and only a few small windows to provide fresh air that should make construction a bit easier no one must be able to hear what is said or catch a glimpse of what lies inside corio that is most important he pushed the slate across the table support beams on both sides sunk deep into the ground i can brace them against the house and each other for additional strength when were finished well need to conceal everything with some false walls to hide the supports otherwise your house will be the ugliest in akkad and im sure you dont want that it might be interesting to slant the roof to allow the rain to run off and prevent anyone from hiding on top of the structure that will require more wood of course mmmn corio understood the need for privacy always one of the most valuable of commodities for anyone living within akkad with so many people and the occasional farm animal jammed together in small rooms only a few paces across the luxury of speaking without worry of being overheard was both rare and expensive use whatever you need corio trella went on already eskkar and his commanders have begun the planning and this work room is not big enough to hold all those who will be needed i can order the lumber today corio said it will take a few weeks to get exactly what i require meanwhile i can divert a few logs from the walls construction at least enough to get started trella nodded that would be desirable i think but that is the next matter that i want to discuss work on akkads outer walls must be speeded up and you must revisit the design if eskkar and his men are fighting in the south your walls may be all that keeps akkads enemies out of the city corio arched an eyebrow its almost too late to do anything with the design of the walls weve been working on them for nearly three years the new walls called for heights of almost twenty paces on either side of the main gate facing east akkads primary entrance still remained the most likely approach for any enemy force the wall there had already been completed including towers every fifty paces that projected out allowing archers to shoot down at enemies massing at the foot of the walls on the remaining three sides the height of the walls would reach fifteen paces with a tenfoot ditch ringing the city the high walls would be unassailable perhaps nothing significant can be done trella said but i want you to think about how we would defend these walls with fewer soldiers and archers the ditch might be dug deeper if an attack is imminent well have hundreds more craftsmen and farmers crowding the city and i think well need to make use of them to help defend the walls weve changed the plans for these walls at least ten times before we began construction corio said shaking his head in frustration now you want to add further changes it must end sometime trella if it were easy corio he laughed i know then you wouldnt be asking me still we always assumed we would have hundreds of fighting men to defend us two years ago that was true now we worry not about barbarians but about thousands of sumerians massing outside the walls men with thick shields with ladders by the hundreds and capable of building ramps as well men with skills almost as good as your own all thinking about ways to force their way into akkad back to the flattery he sighed oh well ill see what i can come up with perhaps ill have one or two of my sons try to devise ways to break in trella had been about to suggest that same thought but it was always better if corio arrived at the right conclusions on his own an excellent idea master builder and im sure bantor could provide one or two senior commanders to work with them that way you would have the benefit of their experience you could even offer a gold coin or two for whoever comes up with the most dangerous idea just when i thought i would be able to enjoy some leisure corio said now you give me new challenges unless you wish me to seek the help of some of the new builders in akkad trella said with a smile from flattery to threats oh well i should stop complaining better to have too much work than too little were going to need your skills more than ever corio trellas voice turned serious and well need your ideas on how to best attack the southern cities which is one reason why we need the map room do you have someone who can construct the models as soon as you told me what you wanted i thought of my second eldest daughter she refuses to learn to cook and sew properly and prefers to spend time with her brothers and the other apprentices in the wood room building models and sketching designs she has a fine hand for detail work besides annoying her brothers she embarrasses them with her skills and none of them will eat anything she cooks trellas eyes showed her interest shed always found it easier and better to work with women than men girls could concentrate more on the task at hand follow instructions and remain calm under pressure and they didnt have to be constantly competing with the other boys you never told me your daughter had such an interest whats her name trella knew the girls name of course but preferred corio to offer it ismenne i only wish she were a more dutiful child dutiful children tended to be of little use to trella ah yes i remember her now how many seasons does she have almost twelve soon shell be married off and someone elses problem if you think she can keep secret her work in the map room perhaps i can make use of her may i speak with her about this trella saw that her offer had caught corio by surprise like so many other men he probably had underestimated his daughters value until now he took only a moment to grasp the implication of her words of course lady trella perhaps i should have paid more attention to her myself he sighed again now shell come under your spell and ill have lost her forever i promise ill return her an even more dutiful and loving daughter who will give thanks to her father for permitting her this chance to help both her father and akkad let me speak to her mother first corio said but im sure shell agree ill bring ismenne here tomorrow i should have some sketches ready by then trella knew the girls mother would consent with the queen of akkad showing interest in her problem daughter ismenne she would have much greater opportunities for finding a good husband everyone would benefit from such an arrangement then again we will all be in your debt corio you and your daughter may do much to defend akkad from its enemies if orodess early return surprised trella nothing in her countenance showed it she sat beside eskkar in the workroom facing tooraj and orodes across the table both men still carried the dust and grime of a long and hasty journey they had come straight to the compound despite the fact that the supper hour would soon be upon the household already the sounds of a large gathering floated up from the floor below well what did you find eskkars voice sounded hard he had little patience for those who failed to obey orders why did you return so soon tooraj he came because i ordered him lord eskkar orodes answered cutting in before the soldier could reply in half a day i learned more than enough to return to akkad ive made a list of what i will require to begin mining and i brought samples with me he reached down and hefted a goodsized sack onto his lap youll want to check these samples with my father or perhaps another goldsmith you trust but im sure of what they contain and that is lady trellas voice sounded gentle compared to her husbands gold of course at first it will be mostly loose nuggets lying about or just under the top layer of dirt well also find more pockets in the stream and nearby well need to pick the valley clean of the surface gold first otherwise the workers will steal it all once weve emptied the stream and the streams pockets we can get started digging into the earth for the real ores what else did you find then almost all of the noble metals are present theres plenty of copper and tin as well as quantities of lead antimony iron and arsenic but i think well find the real strength of the mine is this orodes removed a jagged nugget from the sack and placed it on the table between them eskkar reached out his hand picked it up and held it to the light thats silver isnt it yes lord the rocks and ground at this place are full of native silver what kind of silver the fact that the king of akkad didnt know what that meant startled orodes but trella caught his eye and he knew that she understood he softened his words so as not to offend native silver is a rare form of the metal lord this nugget is almost its very pure silver with only a few impurities which could easily be removed but any silversmith could work with this nugget as it is most silver as im sure you know is obtained from smelting lead and copper ores silver is one of the residues left behind from the smelting process but the ores i found at the site are heavy with silver more silver than gold eskkar handed the nugget to trella and you say there is a good quantity of silver at this place orodes glanced at trella who had spared only a brief look at the nugget my lord i believe that this site holds large quantities of copper lead tin silver and gold and iron of course but thats of no value to us someday we may learn how to make use of it since its so common eskkars frown returned and orodes decided now wasnt the time to speak about iron but silver seems to be the most plentiful the gold nuggets resting on the stream bed are of high quality as well orodes reached into his pouch extracted an irregular clump of gold and set it on the table eskkar examined the nugget hed learned much about gold in his wanderings but it had taken the siege of akkad and trellas guidance to explain the mystery of gold to him many villagers believed the golden metal to be the most valuable of all possessions its rich and warm color satisfied some deepseated longing in men they worshipped it in secret clutching it close to their bodies before burying it deep in the earth tell me more about the gold orodes eskkar handed the nugget to trella yes lord as you know gold is the most valuable of all the metals taken from the earth unlike silver bronze copper or any of the metals only gold neither tarnishes nor rusts it can be highly polished and hammered into any shape even beaten to the thinness of a leaf malleable thats a word that we the goldsmiths call it and because gold is so malleable it can be easily divided and so accommodate exchanges of lesser value also gold can be carefully measured and its quantity determined merchants and traders for all these and other reasons seek gold they hammer out their own coins and use them to adjust their trades since much value is concentrated in such a small area and in so doing they have created a medium of exchange trella added it is easier to carry a sack of gold than a herd of cattle eskkar nodded barter might still be the most common way to trade but gold silver and even copper coins made life in the villages possible tell us more about the mine orodes orodes explained what hed found and told of his idea that the earth had shifted in the distant past and pushed part of its depths to the surface he spoke at length describing the site and estimating its potential and no one interrupted him with questions until he finished i think youve done well orodes now what do you suggest trellas face held the hint of a smile and orodes suddenly understood that she knew exactly what needed to be done i believe that we should mine this site and we should get started at once i believe we will dig a vast amount of silver from the earth to accomplish that well need miners slaves or free men there will be no trouble paying them well need carpenters to build the sluices some laborers to build a dam across the stream they can establish some farms in the nearby hills away from the mine itself so as to avoid illness we can use the stream to flush the waste then theres the fire pits that have to be dug and lined sacks and carts to carry the ores men to sort and grade the rocks others to crush them down to manageable sizes well need plenty of wood for fires but theres more than enough near the river it will have to be brought in along with food for the workers a lot of work will be needed in the beginning to get the mine up and running you might want to consider widening the trail between the mine and river and setting up some docks to load ships it will be easier to transport the ores by boat i think after that we can use fewer workers orodes stopped a little embarrassed at his long speech but the rulers of akkad still showed their interest many of those who work the fire pits and dig the ores will die eskkar said so youll need a steady supply of slaves or prisoners for those jobs as well as soldiers to guard them and the site and herders to care for the horses and other animals then there will be carts to be built to transport the ores to the river where boats will bring it to akkad and after working all day the men will want women and ale youre talking about establishing a whole village at one time yes lord i hadnt thought of it that way but all those things will be needed im sure and what do you want for yourself orodes trella asked lady trella i wish to be allowed to run the mine i may be young and you have little reason to trust me but i know i can extract as much gold and silver as can be ripped from the ground and i can do it faster and more efficiently than my father or the rest of my kin if i am worthy whatever you decide to pay me will be enough no one in akkad has ever doubted your fairness lord eskkar lady trella but remember this site is unique in all the land after we harvest all the surface metals we can dig down go deeper into the earth but the site is not limitless the other surrounding hills which i didnt examine probably hold little of value after a few years there may be nothing left to extract the site is rich in metals but i dont know how much it will produce after four or five years i can see that annoksur and i will be busy for the next few weeks weve never built a village before and now we have to create one in a matter of days trella turned to her husband but i think that if the mine can produce a steady stream of gold and silver for that many years it will be long enough eskkar yes that should be more than enough to pay for the war war what war tooraj spoke for the first time leaning forward orodes too appeared surprised to hear the word i think you had better tell them trella said rising theyve both earned our trust orodes my thanks to you you will take charge of the mine and your loyalty and skills will be well rewarded now i think i should go attend to our guests downstairs both tooraj and orodes stood as she left the room eskkar smiled at that no one had ever ordered or even suggested that people rise when she entered or left their presence but everyone did it hed done it himself tooraj we believe that there will be another even greater war with the cities of sumeria in the next few years the gold and silver from orodess mine are desperately needed to pay for the men and arms we must have to defend akkad without that gold or silver as it may be our city may not survive soldier and goldsmith stared mouths open both thought the days of war had ended now they learned that the threat had returned tooraj you will be in charge of all the soldiers and men at the site and there will be clerks and others to assist you but your main task will be to give orodes whatever he needs to start the gold and silver flowing he will be the master of the mine and all those who work the ores eskkar fixed his gaze on orodes trella has placed her trust in you i hope you will prove worthy the future of akkad may depend on what you drag out of the ground at your mine orodes later after both tooraj and orodes left the chamber sworn to secrecy eskkar remained seated lost in thought until trella returned what troubles you now husband our guests are waiting below her hand rested on his shoulder with this discovery this gold we are committing ourselves to prepare for war and this new kind of war will bring death to hundreds even thousands of men there is no other way eskkar sumerian armies would march on akkad in any case now at least we will have a chance to ready ourselves with both men and weapons without this new source of wealth we would have no chance to survive akkad is fortunate to have you here my husband the gods sent you here to found this city now theyve sent us a mine of gold and silver to pay for what we will need to preserve it well need a name for this mine he said how about nuzi its the barbarian word for silver a good name and well need a good leader to establish the village i was thinking that lani and her husband would be perfect to place in charge of the nuzi eskkar had brought lani down from the north two years ago for over a year lani had fulfilled the role of mistress helping trella in many ways besides that of keeping eskkar occupied but then her yearning to have a child of her own had changed her heart and she asked to be released from her promise now pregnant and married to grannar one of nestors sons she and her husband would be an ideal choice to administer a new village im sure they would both be grateful to leave akkad at least for a while grannars first wife and three children had died two years ago from the pox that had swept over nestors farmlands south of akkad thankfully the scourge hadnt reached akkad and the danger had passed grannar had escaped unscathed while his family died around him something about him had touched lanis heart and in time the feeling had been returned then that is decided eskkar took a deep breath and let it out since we overthrew korthac i have longed for peace trella for you for sargon for everyone in the city but it seems that there must always be one more fight one more battle if we wish to survive she rose and moved to his side putting her arm around his shoulder i see no other path before us if you do he pulled her down onto his lap and sighed no there is no other way only a fool puts down his sword while his enemies gather against him some day there may be an end to fighting but it is not this day starting today we prepare for war t hat night after eskkar had gone to sleep trella and annoksur sat next to sargons little bed in the workroom the child slept peacefully a far cry from the first six months of his life when he clung to his existence sometimes fighting to breathe sargon had arrived early weak and fitful living his first few moments of life with a battle raging round him trella thought him as brave as his father the egyptian korthac had captured the city and turned trella into a slave once again and shed delivered her child in the afternoon of the famous battle in his first night of existence eskkar and korthac had fought in the same room where trella and her new son were held prisoner little sargon had nearly been crushed by the violent struggle between the two desperate men fighting to rule akkad annoksur reached out and touched the childs head hes growing so fast soon hell be running everywhere already i wish he were older the city needs an heir someone the people know and trust one of their own you worry about eskkar and the fighting yes i see it in his face despite what he said tonight eskkar has his doubts about facing so many of the enemy so he will think he needs to lead his men that means my husband is going to fight once again hell put himself in danger in the forefront of the fighting she sighed tomorrow it will all begin hell meet with gatus and the others to go over more ideas about waging war it is what your husband does best trella even the alur meriki chieftain acknowledged his fighting skills i know still he worries me eskkar thinks hell lose the respect of the commanders if he doesnt lead the men in battle not bantor im sure your husband will be at risk as well dont speak of such things trella eskkar would not be the same if he didnt command men in battle unlike your eskkar bantor knows only fighting its the trade hes followed since he left the farm little older than a boy then we must do everything in our power to make sure our men succeed and survive the first thing well need are spies in sumer and the other cities they can be found annoksur said especially now that the sumerians have ravaged the southern lands many from those lands burn with hatred for what the sumerians did but just as important well need a way to collect and send the information back to akkad that will be more difficult yavtar will help with that we should tell him to buy or build two or three fast boats to use only for carrying information yes but i want to do something else trella said what we really need is to get spies close to the ruling houses perhaps even inside them if we could do that well gather more facts and fewer rumors if were going to have people risk their lives getting us information it should be as reliable as possible that will be difficult the wealthy merchants trust only their own servants and kin well have to bribe our way into those places that will put the spies in great danger gold always attracts too much attention i might have a different way trella said and i think a spy should be able to do more than just collect information he should be able to kill the decision makers and other key leaders if the opportunity presents itself no leader has enough competent men surrounding them look how often eskkar talks with the men watching them train trying to find good men to be leaders of ten or twenty an assassin would be useful annoksur said even one killing stroke at the right time could tip the scales of battle which means the sumerians will think of the same thing we will have to increase our own guard to protect eskkar hes still the most vulnerable target and you even this eridu will have enough gold left to dispatch a murderer or two to seek his revenge perhaps eskkar shouldnt have cut off his hand after all no it was the right thing to do trella said eskkar understands the use of force and terror eridu will carry that fear with him for the rest of his life it will cloud his thoughts everyone he meets with will know that hatred colors eridus words but we must double our efforts to protect eskkar i want more eyes following his movements i want the women to report any stranger who shows the slightest interest in eskkar or sargon or myself or the city gather as many as you need to do this and this other thing you spoke of getting someone into the ruling houses trella smiled i think its time for you to send for tammuz and enhedu i think they will be the perfect choice to send to sumeria if theyre willing but first well need to train them in secret and for that i think well need a farmhouse somewhere north of here away from the citys eyes im sure rebba can provide one near the river and what kind of training are you planning for them trella told her ill send for them in the morning annoksur said with a smile and what about orodes are you still certain hes the man you want trella sighed i hope so he has the quickest wits of any metalworker in akkad even his father had to admit that his son knew his craft its just unfortunate that orodes was born the third son instead of the first but then we wouldnt be able to make use of him and if he cant stay sober once a man falls into drink he finds it hard to abstain there wont be anything to drink where hes going that will give him time to change his habits but if hes not the right person well have to find someone else to work the mine i suppose living in the hill country will do orodes good annoksur laughed tooraj will keep him sober if orodes cant stay away from the taverns then hes of no use to us trella said in that case tell bantor to make sure tooraj gets rid of him we want to keep the mine secret for as long as we can until its well established and producing gold and we dont want anyone with knowledge of the site and its contents to be able to sell what he knows that we can always do lady trella her husband would kill orodes or anyone else for that matter if the request came from trella then we might as well go to bed i think our husbands will be up early tomorrow talking war lets hope that if war does come it will be a short one annoksur i think that is the only kind of war akkad can win if the strife with sumeria drags on for years and years our city will die book ii preparation for war the city of sumer two months later t ammuz and enhedu reached the city of sumer a little after midday each carried a large linen sack slung over his shoulder as proper enhedus burden exceeded her husbands both in size and weight dirt dust and sand covered the couples worn and patched clothing as well as their hands and faces when the strong west wind blew over sumeria it painted everything it touched in shades of gray several times in the last few days they had to stop and huddle close together backs to the onrushing air until the stinging sandstorms sighed into silence they had traveled south for four long days walking from the tiny village of mari all the way to sumer at last footsore and weary they had reached the end of their journey now they picked their way through the growing lines of chattering people entering or leaving the city four soldiers guarded the gate inspecting those trying to enter as well as those seeking to leave one stepped in front of tammuz blocking his way no beggars allowed in sumer he said glancing at tammuzs crooked left arm a cripple could do no real work were not beggars tammuz said my wife and i are farmers from ubaid the two of them had spent ten days living in the village of ubaid learning to speak like any of the ubaid villagers lest their speech give them away as coming from akkad when they departed they knew everyone and everything about the sumerian village and could answer any question as if they had lived there all their lives the guards voice implied that he had heard that claim before one copper coin each to enter the city then i see others entering without paying tammuz argued pointing with his good arm at a few people walking by they live here they have a right to come and go how do you know they live here do you see them loaded down with all their possessions now get away from the gate we plan to live here as well tammuz said not unless you pay the guard insisted another soldier sauntered over any problem with these two they dont want to pay the first guard said or they cant get rid of them wait we can pay tammuz said he turned to enhedu give them the coppers enhedu deposited her sack on the ground between her feet reached inside her dress and withdrew a battered leather pouch that remained fastened by a thick loop around her neck taking her time she undid the knot reached in and removed two coins that she passed to tammuz who handed them to the guard the second guards eyes followed enhedus every move as she withdrew the coins from the pouch if these freshoffthefarm country bumpkins possessed two coppers why not three and one more for king eridus guards with the speed of a striking snake enhedu snatched the coins back from the first guards still open palm no my uncle warned us that you would demand more if there was any trouble he said we should ask to see your commander and give the payment to him the guard frowned a small group had gathered to watch the newcomers pay their entry fee hearing the commotion they edged closer as eager to see either the guards humiliated or the newcomers driven away he glanced around his hand on the hilt of his sword all right damn you both two coins to enter either pay or get away from the gate two coppers no more enhedu extended her hand and once again the coins dropped into the first soldiers palm a few of the gawkers laughed at the guards discomfort tammuz grabbed enhedu jerking her to his side be silent woman remember your place he bowed to the guards i thank you for your help slinging his sack over his shoulder tammuz pushed his way through the gate enhedu following a step behind give her a good beating tonight a woman called out if youre strong enough another voice shouted a laugh went up and this time the guards joined in he already did the first guard added in a loud voice look at her nose enhedus first master had broken her nose in a drunken rage and it had never healed properly more laughter greeted the jest but by that time tammuz and enhedu had stepped through the gate the guards words meant nothing they had heard it all before as soon as they were well inside the city tammuz grinned at her that went well i was expecting them to ask us our business or look inside the sacks all they care about is taking bribes from ignorant farmers enhedu turned her thoughts to the present now we have to find a place to stay the night walking through the crowded lanes they attracted little attention just two more wideeyed farmers moving into the city and carrying their handful of possessions it didnt take them long to reach the poorer section of sumer yavtar had described the city in detail to both of them and they not only knew where to go but already had some idea of what they would find they stopped at one of the taverns which also functioned as an inn a humble enough place suggested by yavtar an older woman with long gray hair straggling down her back blocked the doorway her hands on her wide hips she appraised them from head to toe and appeared to find little opportunity for profit what do you want a safe place to stay for a few nights enhedu answered and perhaps some food only if you can pay too many people without any coins in sumer these days we can pay something enhedu said and we can work until were settled theres no work here but one copper coin and you can spend the night in advance supper only one cup of ale the womans firm voice showed there would be no haggling enhedu glanced at tammuz who shrugged one place was as good as another she paid the woman who stepped aside and let them enter this early in the day the tavern stood empty except for an old man leaning back against the wall dozing with his mouth open only a few flies buzzed about to enhedus surprise the place appeared to have been swept clean by tonight she knew the usual debris from the customers would litter the dirt floor since youre here early you can pick whatever place you like to sleep the woman said my husband will return before sundown no ale or wine before then if you want water theres a well down the lane thank you mistress they had already stopped and drunk their fill enhedu picked her way to a spot on the opposite wall from where they entered it was far enough away from the table where the owner would dispense the wine and ale and almost as distant from the door to discourage any wouldbe robber thieves sometimes kicked open the door in the middle of the night grabbed whatever they could and fled before the sleeping customers knew they were being robbed it had happened before in tammuzs own tavern in akkad they sat down backs against the wall grateful to be off their feet as always enhedu sat at tammuzs left his left arm crooked and wasted lacked any strength and he could use it for small tasks only with some difficulty his right hand and arm however rippled with thick muscle that bespoke long sessions each day to increase its strength the sharp knife he wore on his belt was a gift from lady trella while it appeared to be an old and wellworn weapon it had been forged from the finest bronze by akkads master swordmaker then deliberately aged and nicked a thief might give it a glance but none would consider it worth stealing enhedu carried her own knife smaller but just as sharp inside her dress the baggy garment concealed both the weapon and her wellendowed bosom in spite of her sturdy frame as tall as her husband both she and tammuz could move like cats quick and light on their feet rest husband ill keep watch she touched his leg a little gesture of affection he smiled at her then slumped down a little more she watched him drift off to sleep they would have to take turns staying awake during the night lest some thief try to rob them that was a risk they couldnt take the sacks they carried contained five gold coins ten silver ones and twenty coppers all carrying marks from sumers merchants those coins however would enable them to establish a tavern of their own much like the ones they had owned first in akkad and then in bisitun enhedu remembered the days not long ago when she would have stood in the doorway making sure customers could pay or trade before they entered king eskkar and lady trella had asked tammuz and enhedu to become their spies in sumer the couple had played a similar role once before in akkad nearly three years ago trella had rescued enhedu from her brutal husband who had beaten her so often that she begged for death his last pummeling had broken her nose after a few months to recover her health and spirit trella gave enhedu as a slave to tammuz to help him run his little tavern he had just entered his fifteenth season about the same age as enhedu tammuz had treated his new possession with gentleness and when the last of enhedus emotional wounds finally healed she found herself in love with her new master his tender feeling for her gave enhedu the first happiness she could remember tammuz already operating as a spy for trella kept watch on the worst of the beggars and thieves in akkad those desperate enough to kill anyone for a few coins to fit in with his less reputable customers tammuz bought and sold stolen goods and protected the petty criminals from the citys guard as best he could as a result he gained his patrons trust and he saw and heard much of what went on among akkads dregs trella neither wanted to know nor cared about the petty thievery that happened every day in akkad and every other village for that matter what she sought was knowledge about anything serious any whisper or hint of a planned deed that might threaten her husband and his rule by then few knew or remembered that tammuz had ridden as a horse boy with eskkar on his first skirmish disobeying orders tammuz joined in the fighting and killed an alur meriki warrior with an arrow then a horse and rider knocked him aside shattering his arm in several places injured on the war trail and forced to ride while the fever raged in his body tammuz nearly died most leaders would have abandoned the friendless boy but eskkar did his best to keep tammuz alive a few nights later when eskkar and the other handful of survivors established the hawk clan tammuz still racked with fever had managed to swear the same oath that bound all of the surviving fighters together at least thats what the others told him though tammuz had little recollection of the ritual because of his crippled arm tammuz could no longer fight and most of the hawk clan members soon forgot about the crippled boy but trella struggling to deal with the corrupt and devious nobles had found a use for him setting tammuz up in the alehouse to keep an eye on those most willing to do violence when korthac seized akkad tammuz and enhedu felt as helpless as anyone but within a few days eskkar returned from the north and in the middle of the night broke into the city fighting had raged everywhere and tammuz had rushed to join in by then hed grown proficient with a knife and several of korthacs egyptian fighters died under his blade during the battle enhedu had killed one man herself to save her masters life nevertheless the fighting and its aftermath revealed tammuzs role as one of eskkars loyal followers they could no longer pretend to be dealers in stolen goods or even plain innkeepers twenty days after korthac died under torture lady trella sent tammuz and enhedu north for their own protection to the village of bisitun that had worked for a few months but too many soldiers moving back and forth between akkad and bisitun knew of tammuzs role and soon word spread that he was one of eskkars followers after that they settled into a dreary existence as simple tavern owners conspicuously avoided by any of the local thieves or anyone trying to escape official notice trella had advised them to be patient that something important would be found for them then one day annoksur had arrived accompanied by hathor to meet them annoksur offered tammuz and enhedu another more dangerous chance to spy for akkad they would have to move to sumer become two of its inhabitants and stay for at least two or three years there would be great danger if they were discovered death by torture would be their fate however if they remained hidden and provided useful information they could return to akkad in due time and step out into the open as respected members of eskkars inner council one look at tammuzs face and enhedu knew he wanted to accept since his arm prevented him from joining eskkars soldiers he would take on any role that eskkar and trella suggested that gave him a chance to fight to tammuzs credit he had turned to enhedu to see what she thought whatever reservations enhedu had had vanished in truth she was as wearied of their life in bisitun as her husband so they agreed to go to sumer but it turned out there was much more that annoksur wanted she and trella sought information from the leading citizens of sumer not just the poor and destitute and lady trella had figured out a possible way for enhedu to gain entry to the wealthier merchants and traders nor was tammuz ignored hathor explained what eskkar wanted more training would be required for the both of them so that they could not only defend themselves but eliminate potential threats to their mission that training had lasted more than a month before annoksur and hathor considered them as well prepared as possible then they traveled south until they reached the village of ubaid in sumers northern lands one of yavtars boat captains had come from the obscure village and he escorted tammuz and enhedu there all that preparation had ended at last they journeyed south passing through several small villages before reaching sumer now that they had arrived they could at last begin their mission enhedu settled herself against the wall though she never relaxed enough so that she couldnt get to her feet in a moment as the sun began its descent customers by ones and twos arrived the poorest carried something to barter for ale a chicken a few eggs fruit bread cheese or even firewood enhedu watched one man exchange a knife for supper and the promise of plenty of ale since he carried another knife on his belt hed probably stolen the first one she guessed he would drink his ale quickly and depart just in case the real owner of the weapon arrived loud voices laughter and the occasional oath soon filled the inn the sounds were so familiar to tammuz that he didnt even wake up until enhedu nudged his arm time to eat she said tammuz remained at their space while enhedu fetched two greasy bowls only half full of stew each with a hunk of bread protruding over the top she made a second trip to bring the ale watered down to be little stronger than what came out of the well down the lane the food took the edge off their hunger but did little else the rest of the night went as would be expected in such a place men came and went women arrived to sell themselves a few lucky men drank enough to get drunk two fights started as the darkness deepened outside the customers voices rose and soon everyone had to practically shout to be heard twice men approached enhedu to see if she were available but tammuz put his hand on his knife and the men shrugged and turned away as the evening grew later and later the grinning patrons left as they arrived by ones and twos until finally the innkeeper secured the door and put out the fire snoring men who had had too much to drink soon created another type of din but tammuz and enhedu were used to that too in the morning they gathered their sacks and went out into the lane they bought fresh bread in the market then began searching for a tavern to purchase enhedu expected this to be a simple enough process buying an inn shouldnt be any more complicated than buying a house just a slightly larger one anyone could call a oneroom hut a tavern and more than a few proprietors did just that larger establishments like the one they stayed at last night would cost more coins to acquire but enhedu thought that they should be able to purchase a goodsized place for twenty silver coins or so nevertheless yavtar had warned them of the difficulties they might encounter before the sun reached its peak in the sky they found one not far from the docks that looked promising after studying it they approached the owner cant sell to you the prospective seller said wish i could but only king eridus men can buy and sell a tavern in sumer now a new law passed only a few months ago just another tax really then how do we buy one tammuz asked fresh from the farm i see the man laughed well first you have to bribe a local merchant or trader to represent you then he and the seller set the price which will be higher than you expect so they can both make an extra profit off you and in addition to the price youll pay another silver coin to king eridus men what trader would you recommend enhedu asked ones as bad as the other youll probably have to wait all day or even longer just to see one the innkeeper lowered his voice then a few days after the sale you may find yourself turned out of your place by eridus cronies at the palace they dont like people from the countryside buying establishments in sumer so once theyve taken your coins unless the king and his people approve of you they just take your property and turn you out the proprietor shook his head at the injustice if you find someone to help you come back id love to take a profit and return to nippur i was born there and now i have a farm and wife waiting there for me enhedu and tammuz thanked the helpful innkeeper and turned away they found a shady spot against a wall where they could sit the smell of urine wasnt too bad and the people passing by ignored them as they would any beggars we cant take a chance on something like that happening tammuz said if were turned out well never be able to buy another one without arousing suspicion that means well have to go to merchant gemama if he arranges it well be able to buy this place without dealing with king eridus men yavtar had advised them to seek gemamas assistance if they needed it but warned them of the danger as well as soon as we mention yavtars name hell know were spies tammuz said perhaps not and even if he does if he denounces us we can do the same to him enhedu said and what weve heard of king eridu even an accusation would be enough of an excuse to seize gemamas property or at the very least demand a large bribe from the merchant since eridus return to sumer his rule of the city had turned into a nightmare for its inhabitants king onehand as he was now called behind his back had already killed more than a dozen people for the slightest of reasons hed raised taxes twice desperate to recover the ransom hed paid not to mention the gold wasted on the lost campaign men weapons horses food eridu had expended huge amounts of gold in the last year and now had nothing to show for it the peoples unhappiness showed in their sullen faces especially the women many had lost a husband or son in the fighting then we might as well get it over with tammuz said they walked the dusty lanes until they found gemamas house the guard at the gate refused them entry of course until they produced a copper coin to show their good intentions so early in the day gemama wasnt home so they waited along with four other prospective clients for their chance to speak to the merchant we might be here for the rest of the afternoon and he still might not see us tammuz complained then well return in the morning or try and see him at the docks the other petitioners ignored them two country bumpkins who looked as poor as any grubbing farmer fortunately for tammuz and enhedu gemama must have had a good days trading for he returned to his house well before the sun began to set as he walked through the gate he glanced over those waiting to see him when he caught sight of tammuz and enhedu his eyes widened with curiosity no doubt he seldom dealt with anyone as poor as they appeared to be everyone still had to wait gemama had his own needs to satisfy before he bothered with seeing anyone who might wish to do business with him naturally tammuz and enhedu had to sit patiently until the others had been taken one by one to conduct their affairs with the merchant when tammuz and enhedu were led inside the garden they found gemama sitting at a wide table not far from the entrance to his house the merchant yawned clearly looking forward to his supper two nakhla trees as the date palms were called in sumeria provided a canopy to block the sun from their owner a frowning clerk sat at the far end of the table wet clay and wooden chisel in hand ready to record anything of interest a small wooden box rested before him no doubt filled with a handful of coins received or dispensed at the merchants pleasure what do you want gemama began not wishing to waste any time please noble enhedu began bowing low before raising her eyes we wish to purchase a tavern in sumer my uncle yavtar said we should speak with you if we needed any assistance in buying an inn we are willing to pay you a small fee each month if you can help arrange the purchase my uncle said he has traded with you before we come from the village of ubaid he has a farm there enhedu watched gemamas eyes at the mention of yavtars name but the merchant didnt react no one became a master trader who let his thoughts cross his face besides while yavtars name wasnt a common one neither was it unique enough to stand out i dont remember anyone from ubaid gemama said he lifted his ornately carved wine cup inhaled the aroma for a long moment then drained it bring me another he said to his clerk pushing the cup toward him he drummed his fingers on the table you wish to purchase a tavern you say yes noble weve found one by then the clerk was across the garden first refresh my memory of your uncle yavtar enhedu whose mind excelled at matching faces and names gave a good description of the akkadian trader gemama nodded yes i remember your uncle we have the silver to buy the tavern and we can pay you something for your help noble she added my uncle said to tell you he would again be in your debt the clerk returned carefully carrying the wine cup in both hands so as not to spill any a clumsy servant who drank part of it himself or claimed to have spilled it would find the price of the drink taken from his meager earnings a slave would simply be beaten the clerk set it down on the table close to his masters hand well if you can pay then i suppose i must honor an old friendship gemama said frowning in his reluctance you will pay me one silver coin now in addition to what the seller asks for his tavern and the fee that must be paid to king eridu then you will pay me one silver coin each month for a year you have enough for all that yes noble enhedu said forcing a smile despite the steep prices we have just enough noble with the clerk there it wouldnt do to admit to have more coins he might have friends of his own who would be interested in relieving two strangers of their wealth gemama rose return here in the morning ask for melchior he nodded to his assistant my clerk will take care of everything with a wave of his hand he dismissed them enhedu and tammuz both bowed several times before walking quickly from the garden once in the lane outside tammuz led the way he suspects us already more than suspects he knows enhedu agreed yavtar said gemama knew war was coming but hes earned even more of yavtars favor for this and at very little risk if the war goes badly for sumer yavtar will protect him if sumer wins then we can be denounced or killed at any time tammuz spat on the ground sumer will never beat akkad look at the peoples faces theyve been defeated once theyve had a bellyful of fighting for now enhedu said but in six months even a year things may change only the gods know for sure tammuz put his arm around enhedus waist and gave her a squeeze only one more night at that wretched inn with luck tomorrow evening well sleep in a place of our own once again then tomorrow night i promise to pleasure you with my new skills then whatever we pay for the tavern it will be well worth the cost king eridu pounded his fist on the table so hard the heavy wood shook under the impact what do you mean they cannot come how dare they refuse my summons a fleck of spittle driven by the force of his words hung unnoticed at the corner of his mouth five men sat at eridus council table and not one of them lifted his eyes to meet the enraged king of sumer razrek in charge of the kings soldiers sat at eridus left shulgi eridus son and second in command under razrek sat at his fathers right the three remaining men represented cities in sumeria hammurat from larsa kuara from isin and emenne from lagash the representatives from nippur and uruk had failed to arrive each sent a messenger pleading urgent business that kept them at home the sound of birds chirping came from the garden below their cheerful notes enhanced by the silence that followed king eridus rage at last kuara chief advisor to naxos the king of isin lifted his eyes they did not come king eridu because they will not support a second attack on akkads border they know the time is not yet right to start another war as does my own king naxos of isin everyone knows the barbarian eskkar keeps his promises one more raid on his lands and the war will come south it will be the cities and villages and farmlands of sumeria that will face devastation and destruction so isin is afraid to fight sneered eridu kuara reached out with his right hand to lift his wine cup he took a small sip before setting it back on the table he possessed only a thumb and forefinger on that hand the subtle gesture sent a message to eridu kuara had once fought as a soldier for king naxos until an enemy sword stroke cut off his fingers as men told the story kuara still managed to kill his opponent despite the severity of his wound isin will fight when the time is suitable when what we expect to gain outweighs the risks eridu snorted now your warrior king is a merchant weighing profit and loss kuara shook his head in resignation the land akkad holds is needed by isin even more than sumer we will fight to take that land take what is ours many men in isin are eager to wage war against eskkar and king naxos will supply more than his share of fighting men when the time is right but now is not that time that is the same concern of king naran which he wished to convey to you hammurat of larsa spoke with a hint of passion in his voice tall and spare he had advised the king of larsa for many years larsa needs time to strengthen its walls and build up its defenses if the barbarian comes south larsa will be the first to feel his fury your king naran was eager enough to cross the sippar and seize the farmlands eridu said and to take the largest share of what we captured now you want to hold back while the akkadians increase their strength larsa took the larger share because we took the greatest risk and many of our men died in the fighting hammurat shook his head we will send our soldiers across the border when a victory can be assured perhaps in a year or two king naran and the others will send more men at once eridus hand shook with anger the sooner we attack the faster akkad will be destroyed neither larsa nor isin will send more soldiers at this time kuara said nor will the other cities this is the message king naxos of isin told me to bring to you eskkars forces are too strong to challenge again mentioning the name of akkads ruler brought even more fury to eridus already red face veins bulged on his forehead the other cities will obey me they will provide me with men and gold or ill have razrek level their cities to the ground kuara turned his gaze toward the leader of eridus soldiers what do you say razrek will you lead your men against our cities razrek will do as i ask eridu said his fist clenching once again is the man who led the attacks on the border not allowed to speak for himself kuaras words remained soothing intended to calm eridus anger is this a council of equals or are we just summoned here to hear king eridus pronouncements everyones eyes went to razrek who shifted uneasily in his chair i think it would be unwise to bring force against our allies razrek said its one thing to call for war against a common enemy but many of my soldiers are from these cities they would likely desert rather than fight their own kin the akkadians are hated by all but larsa isin all the sumerian cities the men would wonder why we went to war against our allies the fingers on eridus remaining hand trembled you are saying you cannot lead your own men they you will refuse my orders no my king my men and i will fight at your command but i still think now is not the right time to resume the war on akkad or to start a new fight against the other cities of sumeria nor do i kuara said youre consumed with rage and hatred for eskkar you want to attack him and punish him for what he did to you and you want to do it now he will suffer i swear eskkars head will hang over sumers gate as will yours kuara and all of you if you do not obey my orders kuara leaned forward and rested his elbows on the table the people of isin are not yet your slaves king eridu and if any harm should come to me to any of us sumer will find itself at war with the other cities king naxos knows the ways of war quite well kuara glanced at hammurat and emenne who nodded agreement clearly kuara spoke for all of them you have less than half the number of men you had when you crossed the border kuara went on and many of these are replacements raw recruits fresh from the farm even worse any mention of attacks against lord eskkar convinces more and more of your experienced men to desert they believe he cannot be beaten in battle and they do not want to face his akkadian archers again he can be beaten eridu shouted halfrising from his chair hes an ignorant barbarian and he will be killed his army destroyed how the single word hung in the air eridus mouth opened but nothing came out i ask again kuara kept all emotion from his voice how will you defeat him by marching north by walking into akkadian arrows again by attacking the man who defeated the alur meriki in three battles and who killed the egyptian and all his men who tried to capture akkad by challenging the man who just destroyed half your army and cut off your hand at the mention of his lost hand eridus fury increased until the large vein on his forehead bulged and threatened to burst and cover the table in blood well raise more men eridu said we can raise three four times as many soldiers as akkad kuara shook his head ask razrek ask your son shulgi will numbers guarantee success against the barbarian you yourself had him outnumbered by four to one yet your men were defeated and he scarcely lost a man king naxos and i spoke to some of the survivors they saw how few casualties the akkadians took eskkar could have killed his prisoners or kept them as slaves but he was cunning enough to let the defeated soldiers live let them go free so that they would tell everyone in sumeria what they faced eskkar spoke with all of them and warned them of their fate if he ever captured them again he knows how to bend even his enemies to his will our soldiers said his men treated him almost like a god they were in awe of him we were caught by surprise eridus voice sounded hoarse and he could barely get the words out without choking we should have beaten them a few more moments and eskkars men would have been destroyed perhaps it is as you say king eridu like you i believe any man can be beaten but what is done is done raising another army is not a plan that guarantees success not against a trained and experienced warrior he glanced at his companions again so tell us king eridu how you will defeat him this time razrek and i will come up with a new plan well find a way to lure him south and crush him kuara tactfully didnt bother to mention that that plan had already been tried and failed eridu all of us wish to see akkads ruler killed and the city destroyed we all wish to take our share of the lands north of the border but our men will not follow you down that path again youve fought eskkar he offered you a sword to fight him man to man and when you refused he cut off your hand even if the soldiers obey your orders they will march into battle knowing that you dared not face him yourself knowing that their cause is lost that victory always sides with the barbarian they will fight poorly and run as soon as the first akkadian arrow flies over their heads your insolence will be remembered eridu said you all of you will my king razrek cut in before eridu did even worse damage to his cause we must be patient we have suffered a serious defeat and it takes time for soldiers to lick their wounds and forget their shame and embarrassment give me a few months and they will burn with thoughts of revenge against eskkar they will remember how he attacked them by surprise meanwhile we need time to raise and train many more soldiers and kuara speaks the truth we need to find a new plan to destroy akkad when we have that the men will take heart and fight with all their strength once again eridu wasnt ready to give up yet he turned to his son shulgi you can take command of razreks men you can lead the men north no father razrek is right shulgi said the son possessed his fathers height but broad muscles covered his chest and thick arms showed the effects of years of training he had only eighteen seasons but he spoke with the voice of one much older our soldiers believe that eskkar is either blessed by the gods or protected by demons they believe they know he will win if it comes to a battle we must remove such thoughts from their memories we can prepare for a future battle but it will be many months perhaps years before we are ready to fight again listen to your son to shulgi kuara said his voice now soft and persuasive he grows in wisdom with every passing day when the time is ready the cities of sumeria will provide men to defeat akkad but we must not move too soon eridu pushed himself to his feet his hand flat on the table for support get out get out all of you youre nothing but cowards ill lead the men myself then ill settle with each of you kuara shrugged in resignation he rose as did his companions he bowed graciously to eridu but left the chamber without a word the other two representatives trailing behind razrek started to speak but eridu cut him off you get out too you and your cowards left me alone to face the akkadians with all your horsemen you failed even to get a warning to us razrek started to answer the charge but he caught shulgis eye and saw the shake of his head yes my king razrek bowed and left the room father and son watched the soldier depart shulgi waited until the door closed should i leave too father eridu reached across the table to drag the pitcher of wine toward him and he poured himself a cup his left hand still didnt equal the right and wine spilled across the surface angering him further how dare you not support your own father you should have challenged razrek you keep telling me youre ready to lead the soldiers but youre as weak as the others you fear even to avenge your father go go back to your men and pretend to be a soldier and send my steward to me yes father shulgi rose and left the chamber as silently as the others outside the gloomy chamber shulgi found petrah his fathers steward waiting in the corridor in case he was needed the old man had served eridu faithfully for more than twenty years and in that time petrah had developed an uncanny sense of knowing when he would be wanted he asked for you petrah be aware hes in a foul mood thank you petrah never bothered to waste words he brushed past shulgi and closed the door behind him shulgi stared at the closed door for a moment his lips tight he turned away went down a flight of stairs and stepped out into the sunfilled courtyard he walked past the private well and continued until he reached the rear of eridus quarters a small but separate dwelling stood against the wall one that contained only three rooms the province of his halfsister kushanna flowers and shrubs grew along the side of the house softening for a few paces the hard lines of the compound the king cared little for anything green kushanna waited for him just inside her doorway like petrah she also seemed to know when she would be needed i saw the others leave she said stepping aside to let her brother enter they had smiles on their faces did it go as you expected shulgi could restrain himself no longer no it went the way you said it would damn you come inside kushanna said ignoring the harsh words tell me all about it he followed her through the main chamber and into one of the inner rooms not her bedchamber but a small windowless alcove where her companion slave slept at night shulgi had never been invited into kushannas bedroom even she wasnt that bold kushanna sat on a small chest while shulgi sat on the edge of the slaves bed and stared at his sister the entrance to her quarters could be seen from here but no one could hear their words as long as they kept their voices low and no one could see inside the alcove without being seen shulgi took a deep breath to calm himself i told him we told him what needed to be done that he had to be patient that he had to stop wasting his gold on weapons and men who cant be trusted marduk take him its my gold hes spending shanna my birthright even your dowry soon there will be nothing left for us and sumer will be weaker than before already the other cities no longer fear us kushanna smiled at him she did not permit many to call her by her childhood name nearly as tall as her halfbrother she had two more seasons than his eighteen graceful and willowy with light brown hair that reached nearly to her waist she attracted every mans eyes her white gown of the softest linen clung to the full lines of her body a gold ring adorned each of her forefingers and a pendant of the finest lapis lazuli dangled between her breasts so what will you do now my brother im surprised youre not reminding me about father you warned me he would not see reason i could have been wrong kushanna said picking at a thread on her dress he might have listened to your advice he still thinks of me as a child shulgi said i get more respect from my men even from razrek than our father the king i know razrek wanted you to accompany the soldiers when they went north perhaps if you had been there our soldiers might not have been defeated father did not want to share his glory with me shulgi said unable to conceal the bitterness he still felt thats why the fool ordered me to stay behind supposedly to protect his city and his gold not that i had managed to do even that much his loyal steward petrah made all the decisions in fathers name of course hes been our fathers trusted servant for many years kushanna said such loyalty deserves to be rewarded yes it does shulgi said his voice hardening as he envisioned a suitable reward for his fathers retainer petrah will obey our fathers every wish even if it means destroying sumer in the process petrah gathered the gold as soon as he received the message from akkad he paid the ransom in less than a day kushanna said he was very concerned for our fathers welfare her calm words fed the flames of shulgis rage not that he cared any more eight hundred coins wasted for nothing eskkar will use it to strengthen his army and now father wants to spend what little gold remains on another foolish attack on akkad he will ruin sumer to gain his revenge on eskkar one day when you rule here in sumer and over the other cities things will be different he lifted his eyes and met her gaze for once he paid no attention to the lush body sitting before him i think that day has come shanna my fathers mind is consumed with hatred he will destroy all of us what we talked about it must be done will you stand beside me kushanna met his gaze for a long moment studying his face as if measuring the depth of his anger and resolve satisfied she rose from the chair and sat next to him on the narrow bed shulgi felt the heat from her thigh through the thin garment as it touched his own you know i will shulgi you are the only man i have ever loved she took his hand in both of hers and pressed it to her bosom letting him feel the softness a rush of desire swept over him his eyes closed for a moment when he opened them her mouth was close to his own shulgi kissed the soft lips that reached up for him they had kissed many times before stolen moments when their father was absent or the servants occupied and each time his passion for her grew stronger this time however shulgi sensed something more than a casual dalliance he let his hand slip from her grasp and used his fingers to push the dress off her shoulder until her right breast swelled from the garments confines for once she didnt push him away instead her eyes closed and she took a deep breath her nipple firm and hard the warmth from her skin seemed to burn his hand as he brushed his fingers over her and the scent of her body roused him even more than the sight of her naked breast perfect in its beauty he cupped the heavy globe of soft flesh squeezing gently shanna leaned against him her body reacting to his touch then she opened her eyes and held his gaze while she nudged the dress down from her other shoulder then let herself fall back on the bed she reached up and traced her finger along his cheek enjoying the look on his face as he drank in the sight of her bare breasts shanna had never let him go so far then she placed both her hands behind his neck and pulled him toward her shulgi leaned over and kissed her breasts first one then the other shanna moaned softly at his caress and arched her back against him while her hand reached over to brush against the rockhard manhood straining beneath his tunic when will you make me yours my beloved her voice husky now with passion inflamed him even more and the touch of her hand made his already fierce erection even harder he moved his mouth to her lips and kissed them gently at first then with growing passion tonight my shanna tonight before our father decides to send me off on yet another wasted journey to recruit men he ran his hand over her breast teasing the nipple until it swelled and hardened besides i cant bear to wait another day for you the time for waiting is past shanna agreed tonight you will make me yours she returned his kiss one more time then slipped from his grasp and sat up smiling at him as she rearranged her dress but first we must talk about what needs to be done we must plan with care so that nothing can go wrong only when we are ready can we act shulgi forced the sight of her bare breasts from his thoughts his erection still throbbed but after all these years he could wait one more day then let us talk the rest of the day passed soon enough as kushanna and shulgi made their preparations he felt no surprise at learning that she had already considered every detail every step and only when she declared herself satisfied with his role did she agree one last kiss and he returned to the soldiers camp just outside the city where razrek had settled his men and horses new recruits those too stupid or too desperate to find another trade milled about waiting for the day to end kuara had spoken the truth in the council shulgi knew these men would make poor fighters it would take many months before even half of them reached the level of training achieved by the men eridu had led north to their deaths shulgi didnt care his own detachment of men its survivors numbering less than thirty since the battle with eskkars forces were as good as any of razreks core group of veterans more important they were loyal to shulgi not razrek not even eridu they were commanded by vanar formerly one of two of shulgis leaders of twenty the other had died by an akkadian arrow and vanar had taken charge of those that remained shulgi found vanar stretched out on the grass beneath one of the few trees large enough to provide shade taking your ease i see vanar opened his eyes but didnt bother to get up weve finished training for the day commander the men are washing down the horses in the river make sure they give themselves a good cleaning as well my father has complained about the horse stink of the guards at the house when youre satisfied with them i want you and ten men at the house at sundown our men will take the evening shift at the compound from supper to midnight that news prompted vanar to pull himself to his feet tonight commander cant we start tomorrow if youre not there before sundown ill be finding a new subcommander so unless youd rather be taking orders than giving them yes commander well be there but why so many men my father grows even more nervous about assassins from akkad so just get the men there shulgi turned and made a circuit of the camp making sure all was well the sun had touched the western horizon before he walked back toward sumers gate ignoring everyone he encountered many of whom gazed curiously at him as he passed by wrapped in his private thoughts shulgi had set the first part of the plan in motion with vanar and his men to back him there would be no problem with the household servants or guards meanwhile shanna would see to everything else inside the household as they went over what they needed to do shulgi realized she had prepared for this day months ago waiting until he came to his senses and saw what needed to be done shanna understood what it would take to rule sumer to turn the city into the mightiest in the land she wanted that power the same way shulgi did together they could achieve it if he had listened to her when she first proposed taking action shulgi would have been the one leading the soldiers north into akkads territory unlike his father shulgi knew he would have returned with a victory the men trusted him believed in him they would have fought bravely instead they had run at the first sign of attack as did eridu too late to worry about that now shulgi decided in a way this might even be a better time to act where once shanna had tried to coerce her brother to act now she merely had to encourage him they both understood the grim future that awaited them if eridu continued to rule no this was best and even better she would help shulgi rule a new southern empire even as she pleasured him in bed a sense of calm settled over him and he wasted no more time worrying about what might happen tonight instead he let his mind recall shannas body hed wanted shanna for years dreaming about her lusting for her and now the time had come long after shanna reached the age for childbearing her father had kept her at his side little more than an intimate servant then less than two years ago eridu offered kushanna for marriage to unite a troublesome village with sumer shulgi had sulked in silent fury for days afterwards less than a month later he joined the fighters defending the western borders of sumer even killing his first man in combat soon afterwards hadnt helped lessen the despair shulgi felt at the thought of another man enjoying shannas body ordering her about commanding her to kneel before him to please him with her mouth and hands those visions had tortured him for months and hardened his heart against his father who had sold his daughter to a common merchant for a mere fistful of gold the marriage indeed worked well enough her husband no doubt with prompting from kushanna had joined with sumer and supplied both men and gold for eridus growing military thankfully the gods had answered shulgis prayers and her foolish husband an old man scarcely able to walk without a cane had died little more than a year after the marriage since shanna had produced no child her husbands family welcomed the opportunity to send back the unfruitful wife to her fathers house even if they had to return part of the dowry eridu had been pleased to take her back under his roof especially since she brought a fair share of gold with her none of that mattered to shulgi now for years shanna had teased him aroused him with her touch and caresses shanna had done almost everything to him spilled his seed with her hands everything but let him take her tonight would see the end of that game tonight she would be his in his bed his property after tonight there would be no more games only an empire to build a little before sunset kushanna sat beside her father at his right side during the evening meal like her halfbrother she felt no qualms or doubts shed prepared for this night for years unlike shulgi her wedding caused her no anguish she much preferred an old man for a husband one who could be easily manipulated plenty of wine and more lovemaking than he could handle soon produced the desired death her constant antagonizing of his existing wives and family ensured her speedy return to her father now eridu in his blind rage had fallen prey to another kind of manipulation subtly encouraged by her solicitous advice and suggestions tonight king eridu still angry at the councils decision had decided to dine alone only his steward petrah joined father and daughter at the table sitting opposite his master shanna had worked with the cooks to make sure the evening meal was one of eridus favorites a roast leg of lamb covered with rosemary and seared to a golden brown the meat tender and juicy within knowing of her fathers foul mood she had ordered the servants to serve the kings finest wine and she mixed the wine and water for her father herself adding a bit more of the strong wine than he normally preferred she also cut the lamb for him taking care to slice the steaming meat to just the right size since his return from akkad shanna had filled the role of diligent daughter helping her father overcome the lack of his right hand he scarcely noticed and treated shanna like a servant complaining about the slightest oversight no matter how unfair she never protested tonight eridus mood was as dark as the wine shanna poured for him several times she tried to start a conversation but the king had little interest in talking and certainly not with shanna where is shulgi the meal was well under way before he uttered the first words spoken since they sat down he said he would sup at the camp with his men shanna said he will join us later his men eridu snorted as he stuffed another piece of lamb into his mouth chewing loudly cowards all of them and razrek is the worst of the lot youre right about razrek father shanna agreed you should get rid of him shulgi can lead the men as well as anyone i should get rid of both of them find someone with the will to fight what do you say petrah razrek is experienced in warfare my king and he leads the men well enough he may still be of some use to you hed fight just as hard for akkad if i didnt pay him so much gold hes bleeding me dry soldiers are expensive to maintain petrah said deftly avoiding eridus comment give shulgi more authority over the men father shanna said at least you can be certain of his loyalty she refilled her fathers wine cup adding only a splash of water when hes older grunted eridu hes too young yet for such responsibility they ate the rest of the meal in silence when eridu put down his knife with a loud belch shanna rose ill fetch the sweet cakes father she left the chamber but returned within a few moments carrying the cakes and dates herself covered with a piece of linen to ward off the flies shanna settled the platter down on the table eridus wine cup was empty and she started to refill it no more wine he ordered are the slaves ready to attend me shanna stopped pouring but the cup was already half full and eridu reached for it hed chosen two women for his evenings pleasure new slaves whose fear and trembling would act as an aphrodisiac to their jaded master he liked them very young and to take them two at a time and if one failed to please him a good beating would encourage the other to try harder theyre waiting downstairs father ill summon them when youre ready the door opened and shulgi entered closing it behind him he still wore his leather vest and sword as if hed just come from the soldiers camp though in fact hed waited in the courtyard for shannas signal a wave from the upper window when she went to fetch the sweet cakes shulgi moved to the foot of the table to stand opposite his father placing himself almost directly behind petrah now what eridu demanded a hint of petulance in his hoarse voice he rose wiping his face on a cloth and tossing it down on the table petrah stood also prepared to utter his thanks for his masters generosity and depart its the men father theyre demanding more gold again shanna returned to her place beside her father though she did not sit down the knife shed carved the lamb with rested on the table with a smooth motion she picked it up grasping it firmly as shulgi had instructed her then shanna turned and drove it into the right side of eridus chest thrusting the blade upward so that it would penetrate the ribs not glance off the bone she struck with such speed and smoothness that eridu scarcely gasped even as he looked down to see the knife protruding from his body the steward slow to react and shocked by shannas attack never had a chance as shanna delivered her thrust shulgi jerked out his sword twisted the steward around gripped him by the throat and drove the blade into petrahs chest forcing him backwards onto the floor eridu his eyes wide with fear and astonishment tried to call out but shanna clapped her hand on his mouth with his only hand he struggled to push her away but by then shulgi had reached his fathers side he drew a knife from his belt and plunged it into eridus heart driving the blade deep with a brutal thrust ive waited long enough for this father eridus eyes flickered from son to daughter one last time before his knees gave way he was dead before he reached the floor quick move petrahs body closer shanna kept her voice low she knew shulgi would have ordered the guard away but anybody might be outside the chamber and the door might open at any time shulgi returned to the other side of the table and dragged petrah closer to eridus body the knife shulgi used for the fatal thrust belonged to petrah taken from his quarters only moments before using both hands shanna jerked the blade shed used from the kings body and thrust it deep into the remains of the lamb any trace of eridus blood vanished she turned to shulgi are you ready shulgi had withdrawn the knife from his fathers body and placed it in petrahs hand yes hurry shanna touched his arm for the briefest moment and took a deep breath then she screamed a loud piercing sound that carried through the upper chambers and through the open window to the courtyard below at the same moment shulgi picked up the wine pitcher and hurled it to the floor where it burst into a dozen pieces the red wine mixing with the blood and staining the floor shanna using all her strength tipped the table up as high as she could before letting it drop back to the floor with a loud thud food cups and the remains of the meal clattered to the floor shanna screamed again then ran for the door help help petrah stabbed the king before she reached the door servants flung it open and rushed into the room followed a moment later by the stunned guard his face turned white with fear when he saw the kings body and blood spattered everywhere send for razrek shulgi ordered i want him at once and send my guards to me is the king is he dead the guard could scarcely get the words out yes damn you shulgi snapped murdered by petrah now get moving the guard opened his mouth as if to speak but then changed his mind and darted off anxious to do shulgis bidding his voice echoed down the corridor shouting the news of eridus death the rest of the night was full of turmoil and confusion shanna pulled at her hair hard enough to bring tears to her eyes and left it in disarray over her face she told the story again and again in a halting voice that paused every few moments to sob her father and petrah had quarreled over the cost of the soldiers eridu had slapped his steward and petrah had retaliated by stabbing his master with his knife shulgi had then killed petrah shanna kept crying her body shaking with emotion as she shouted again and again for her beloved father she repeated the story to every new arrival soon servants and soldiers filled the room everyone jostling each other to catch a glimpse of the dead king still lying whered he fallen in the midst of the remains of the evenings meal razrek arrived in haste pushing his way through the crowded chamber his meal interrupted his eyes going wide at what he saw as shulgi repeated what had happened razreks eyes narrowed petrah razreks face mirrored his confusion and shanna moved quickly to stifle any questions razrek was after all the only one strong enough to challenge their story this is your fault shanna shouted standing before razrek her face now contorted with rage it was your guard who failed to protect the king your guard who let petrah bring his knife into the room he should be put to death at once at once her voice broke down and she began to sob again her whole body shaking from her sorrow shulgi caught razreks arm and pulled him aside best to do as she says otherwise shell start claiming you put petrah up to this are you sure petrah his voice trailed off something in shulgis eyes told him not to ask any questions do it now shulgi went on his voice low with my father dead ill take charge of the city and the army youll be getting paid by me from now on is that clear enough razrek recovered his wits in a few heartbeats suddenly he remembered that shulgis men stood in the corridor outside the chamber and in the courtyard below yes my king ill take care of the guard and send my men to guard the compound no need shulgi said i have some of my men here already the rest will soon arrive now go get rid of the guard well talk about this in the morning shulgi turned to see shanna seated in a chair her face covered by her hands as she rocked back and forth servants attended her holding her hands offering water wine and cloths to dry her tears every part of her body showed her grief as dutiful as any daughter razrek shook his head and departed glad to have had no part in the nights turmoil it took most of the evening before everyone calmed down the bodies removed and the room cleaned in front of the household shulgi ordered shanna to sleep in her fathers bed tonight for her safety and to ensure that shulgi ordered his own bed brought into the dining chamber two of his men stood guard outside the chamber when he finally dropped the wooden bar across the doorway crossing the room shulgi entered what had been his fathers bedroom but was now his a single candle still burned and shanna sat on the bed combing her hair she wore a clean garment shed ordered the other one stained with her fathers blood to be burned shanna rose and walked toward him before he could reach out to touch her she bowed low as humble as any servant my king is there anything i may do for you tonight oh yes he heard the hoarseness in his voice but it didnt matter any more with shanna there would be no need to pretend or hide his emotions you can take off that dress before i rip it off she straightened and the smile was back on her face yes my king we wouldnt want the servants to see a torn garment in the morning shanna pulled the dress over her head and stepped back his eyes drank in the sight of the lush body a quick breath extinguished the candle before he picked her up and dropped her down on the bed as excited as the day he had taken his first woman his father was out of the way shanna lay naked in his bed and sumer belonged to him soon all of sumeria then akkad and the northern cities would follow one month later eskkar and grond accompanied by four hawk clan guards entered the grounds of akkads main barracks as the sounds of busy lanes faded somewhat eskkar took a moment to enjoy the soldiers quarters where much of his life had been shaped during the days when he held the post of captain of the guard the barracks housed all the soldiers as well as their weapons and horses the once familiar stable smell had finally departed along with the horses a large corral across the river now held most of the soldiers mounts with the remainder stabled at a smaller holding area just south of the city when the time came to tear down the malodorous horse pens the soldiers completed the task in half a morning glad to see the last of the odorrich structures a favorite punishment for petty infractions many men had labored there over the years cleaning out the muck in the hot summer sun new barracks soon sprang up to accommodate the growing numbers of men learning the art of war these provided additional housing for the recruits as well as weapons storage the training ground located at the back of the barracks remained untouched however as he strode across the grounds eskkar missed the horse smell he and a few others who grew up in horse country claimed they could still catch the scent of the endless streams of horse piss that had soaked deep into the earth while others complained about the foul odors even the faint scent of horse sweat always reminded eskkar of his youth and life with the clan have you heard anything about the training eskkars long legs covered a lot of ground forcing grond and the guards to hurry to keep up gatus had started training a group of recruits as spearmen less than a month after the meeting at rebbas farm nothing much grond kept his tone noncommittal i know gatus added new recruits now and then and lost a few too but he hasnt told me anything and none of his men will say a word eskkar glanced at his friend and bodyguard only gatus could convince grond to keep a secret its been almost three months since he started training them he better have something to show for it how hard can it be to teach a man to use a spear grond knew better than to answer that kind of question they turned the corner at the barracks and eskkar found gatus waiting across the open space for them sitting on his stool and holding a wood rod the thickness of his thumb in his hand the rod of gatus as long as his arm had become part of the soldiers tradition and few recruits managed to escape its touch a good whack on the arm or back gatus explained helped each man concentrate on the orders of his superior usually shouted in the recruits face at the top of his lungs the instructors too used their rods almost as freely as gatus until even the slowest witted of the recruits learned instant obedience to their superiors orders no matter how seemingly senseless or humiliating during the early months of training while the mens bodies grew hardened by exercise and constant practice with their weapons that lesson remained the most important all orders must be obeyed at once with no exceptions and no excuses the reason was simple enough in battle the enemy cared nothing for how weary or ill or hung over a soldier was the sooner every recruit learned that bitter lesson the longer they would stay alive in combat over time as the men increased their skill level the physical abuse tapered off and the trainers efforts shifted to more and longer periods spent practicing with bow sword and knife another skill every recruit had to master was wrestling it not only strengthened the mens bodies but also taught them how to fight unarmed and as the long and arduous days of physical effort passed the men grew more confident not only in themselves and their skills but in those of their companions at arms the men who trained at their side and who would someday fight beside them gatus had long ago mastered the art of turning farm boys into soldiers eskkar had acknowledged that fact early on and given gatus responsibility for training akkads archers still while many knew how to train fighting men the old soldier had learned the best ways to turn individual fighters into a fighting unit under his hard tutelage the men gradually formed a bond with each other as gatus had explained many times first you beat the recruits down showed them how weak and pitiful their strength and skills were compared to their trainers that humiliating demonstration usually sufficed to drive the recruits to train harder and harder to master the skills demanded of them by then every recruit hated his trainers as much as any enemy they would face in battle when done properly the grueling ordeal helped the men learn to work and fight together each one determined to prove to their hard taskmasters that they could not only withstand the brutal discipline but take strength from it as that happened each mans sense of pride increased with each improvement in his fighting skills that sense of worth grew stronger and stronger gradually a fighting unit took shape what started out as a ragtag group of individuals developed into a band of brothers that learned to take care of its own the stronger helping the weaker and the more skillful assisting those who needed extra work months later when the recruits had turned into true soldiers they looked back in awe at what they had accomplished by then many had changed beyond recognition muscles bulging where none had existed before skills with their weapons progressed as well from barely knowing which end of a sword to pick up to supremely confident only then did the men grudgingly admit that perhaps their vigilant taskmasters had known all along what they were doing now gatus had turned his attention to this new force of spearmen letting others train the archers and sword fighters what would result from all this remained to be seen well gatus your men look fit enough eskkar said as he approached raising his voice so that everyone could hear he got the words out before gatus could complain about eskkars late arrival what are you going to show me my spearmen are ready to show you what theyve learned gatus tapped his rod against his other hand he too spoke loud enough to make sure everyone heard why dont you and grond stand over against the wall where youll be out of the way eskkar and grond moved to the side of the barracks the hawk clan guards trailing behind them gatus waited until eskkar and his guards complied then slid off his stool tossed it aside and turned to face his spearmen behind him thirty men stood in two ranks each of them carrying a shield and a spear and with a short sword at his waist leather helmets made the men look both taller and fiercer every spear rested on its butt the bronze tip pointing at the sky as the men awaited their orders half the spears eskkar noticed extended a forearm length longer than the others he realized something else these men had awaited his arrival for some time standing patiently in the warm sunshine without shifting about or shuffling their feet no men gatus ever trained would be found sitting about in the shade when the king arrived each man looked confident and the eyes that followed eskkars movements showed no hint of fear or awe eskkar knew the importance of hard discipline in building morale unlike steppe warriors whose honor guided their training from the youngest age villagers first needed to be taught to obey before they learned how to fight warriors had learned these lessons as far back as anyone could recall eskkar accepted these ideas without question since that was the way of the steppe warrior the villagers without any real clan or code of honor of their own needed a teacher like gatus and his methods as a way to gain respect by the time the recruits took pride in themselves and their fighting skills they had also learned the most important lesson of all that of trusting and caring for the soldier who fought beside you the months of shared suffering theyd endured bonded them to their fellow soldiers they learned to trust not only their own skills but those of the man next to them because as eskkar well knew thats what made a man fight not some cause or even hope for a few pieces of gold or loot now and then you fought because your sense of honor demanded it you fought because your friend stood at your side and you could not think of letting him stand alone and you fought on when all appeared lost because your friends had died beside you and how could you do anything less to honor their memory than give your utmost most of all you fought because you had mastered the skills that would carry you to victory and that belief in yourself and your weapons made each man determined to stand strong against his enemy over the years while eskkar wandered the land he came to understand better the code of the warrior and the way it helped keep him alive his father hogarthak had taught his son well in that regard so well that even as an outcast boy struggling against an unfamiliar and harsh world those lessons remained ingrained in eskkars mind still he had never quite mastered the teaching of the same lessons to others eskkar could lead men in battle could even train them well enough but gatus could turn raw recruits into a fighting unit better and faster than anyone eskkar had ever seen with this group of spearmen gatus had worked hard with each leader of ten to make sure his subordinates knew just how far to go with the men recruits needed to be cured of their former habits but not broken in spirit when they finished their training they would be accepted into akkads warrior ranks and have the status that came with their oaths to defend their king their city and their fellow soldiers for many it was the first time in their lives that they had ever accomplished something so difficult but so rewarding whether it was hitting a target at a hundred paces with a single swiftly launched shaft or taking a man down with three powerful sword strokes men soon learned more about themselves about what they could do and accomplish than any weapon they took to hand now eskkar glanced at a small assemblage on the training ground for more than a month he had chaffed at gatus and his slow and patient methods every few days eskkar had asked gatus when the first group of spearmen would be ready soon the laconic reply grated on eskkars nerves nevertheless hed learned during the siege of akkad to leave the training to gatus in those days eskkar had been stunned to hear that it would take many months to train a competent archer hed fumed at the delay amazed that so simple a weapon required so much time for a novice to master but gatus had proved himself right one of the reasons why akkads archers remained so formidable was their complete mastery of their weaponry but did teaching a man to use a spear take as much time as learning to use a bow and arrow this time he held his tongue just in case gatus once again proved himself right and eskkar had plenty to occupy his time hed spent many days in nuzi helping establish the gold mine and clearing the nearby countryside of bandits visits to bisitun and the other northern cities took eskkar away from akkad for long periods as well and whenever he returned there were always the nobles merchants traders and craftsmen to deal with all claiming some urgent need that no one besides the king could resolve yesterday just before the sun had set eskkar had returned from the north once again this time gatus met him at the compound my first group of spearmen is ready for you to see come to the barracks in the morning gatuss demeanor provided no hint as to what would await eskkar at the barracks ill be there he resisted the temptation to ask what he would see or to add that it had taken long enough to whip a few men into shape o nce again eskkar studied the men they all looked confident and he recognized the nervous movements that revealed the excitement that lay just below the surface gatus had worked with these men for months testing changing and refining his ideas on how spearmen should train and fight no longer a group of raw recruits the men standing behind the old soldier had suffered months of hard discipline and physical labor now gatus felt satisfied that they had mastered their craft and that they stood ready to demonstrate their skills all right you men gatus called out his booming voice echoed over the training ground lets show our king what we can do he gave a command and the men turned to the right transforming themselves instantly into a column of twos carry spears the weapons bobbed upward for a moment then came down until each spear hung naturally at the end of each mans right arm the point held slightly outward so as not to jab the man in front march the barked order started the soldiers moving forward gatus paraded them back and forth in front of eskkar the men marched in a straight line and moved in unison three subcommanders stepped along at the mens side noting how each movement was executed and correcting and encouraging the men though not loud enough so that the kings group could hear the words eskkar noted that every man took his first step with his left foot so that their arms and legs moved together that would be important because if the men got out of step they would be more likely to trip and fall over each other the long spears they carried would make that dangerous enough it wouldnt take much to poke out someones eye the line of spears moved together each weapon remaining level with the earth as the men marched back and forth the drill continued the men marching this way and that until eskkar felt his attention wandering he expected more than just watching men march back and forth and with the spear held loosely at arms length the spearmen didnt look particularly dangerous at last gatus gave the order to halt and the column stopped directly in front of eskkar resuming their original formation of two ranks but about seventy paces away from where he stood another command swung the line around attack positions every spear was raised in a smooth motion held just above shoulder height each man gripping his weapon with the palm facing upwards the rear rank took one step forward so that they stood just behind the front rank shields were raised to eye level covering almost all of the mans body for a moment all eskkar could see were the soldiers eyes peering over the tops of the shields they stood almost shoulder to shoulder the tips of the weapons extending to the front advance gatuss voice again rang out over the training ground the spearmen in perfect step with each other moved toward eskkar and he saw that all the men carrying the longer spears now formed the rear rank their spear points protruded almost as far forward as those of the men in front a compact line like that would brush aside any line of swordsmen who needed room to swing their weapons and even if you could get close enough to take a swing the spearmans shield would deflect the blow and any swordsman would probably be gutted by at least two spears for his efforts eskkar saw all this at a glance as the line approached covering the distance with long strides and without hesitation if they didnt stop he and grond would be pinned like rabbits to the barracks wall grond saw the same impending danger his sword rasped from its scabbard and he took a halfstep in front of eskkar just as gatus gave the command to halt the spear points hung in midair two paces from eskkars chest taking his time gatus walked casually from behind his men to stand at eskkars side well next time youre late i may forget to give the order to halt the men didnt laugh gatuss rod which he still held in his hand would have instilled silence into their ranks still eskkar saw plenty of grins covering their sweaty faces at least he hadnt been frightened enough to draw his own sword impressive i wouldnt want to be facing them on open ground spears up at rest gatus shouted and the men raised their weapons to the vertical then let the butts drop to the earth gatus moved closer but he kept his voice loud making certain that his men heard the words of praise this line of spearmen would tear through any enemy they would at that eskkar agreed impressed by their skills but against archers how would they stand up the shield covers most of the body gatus explained in a real fight theyd be wearing bronze helmets youd lose a few to arrows but attacking at a run most of the line would reach the enemy intact or so it was hoped but now wasnt the time to talk about doubts eskkar took a step forward stopping in front of the nearest spearman he reached out to take the spear but the soldier refused to let it go eskkar tightened his grip and pulled harder putting his own muscles into it the soldier slid forward feet struggling to hold his position but didnt release his grip the mans arm eskkar saw was as thick as most mens legs theyve been taught never to let go of the spear gatus said tapping the rod against his thigh give the king your spear drannah no doubt gatus knew the name of every man in the ranks the soldier let go of the weapon eskkar hefted the spear surprised at its weight far too heavy to throw more than a short distance it was meant to thrust to push through a thin shield or a mans body the slim bronze tip carefully fitted and bolted to the shaft would enter smoothly and be withdrawn just as easily with little chance of snagging on clothing flesh or shield each man has been trained to thrust with the spear and to fight with his sword if the spear breaks or gets entangled with the enemy gatus explained the shield gives plenty of protection and each man is responsible for guarding the man on his left as well as himself and the shield can be used as a weapon itself show me how they fight with swords gatus nodded and his trainers took over the men broke ranks leaned their spears against the barrack wall and reformed once again the soldiers repeated their maneuvers now carrying their short swords they advanced striking out with the weapon as they moved the sword eskkar noted was never swung only thrust with short stabbing motions either straight ahead or upwards using the weapon that way meant thrusts to the belly chest and throat that went counter to eskkars instincts the long sword he carried was meant to strike in an arc hitting with the edge of the heavy blade and cutting through flesh and bone from the pure force of the swing the usual intended target was your opponents head or shoulders the sharp point allowed a mounted rider to vary his attack or stab downward but that was seldom the first choice in a fight nevertheless eskkar realized the benefits of thrusting with the point of these much shorter weapons less muscle was used and the stroke could be launched faster he guessed a competent soldier could get in two or three thrusts before a warrior could swing his blade a single time also a man went down as fast or faster with a blade in his stomach or bowels as long as these men had the shield to protect them that way of using the sword would be deadly to anyone in their path the soldiers broke into groups of two and each practiced against his companion thrusting with both sword and shield eskkar saw that they used the shield as efficiently as the sword shoving it forward or thrusting with the edge used together they made a deadly combination hed fought against men armed with shields and swords before but the shield had served mostly for defense against an attackers sword not part of the killing process gatus had learned something new about the craft of killing eskkar decided once the tactic spread there would be one more enemy maneuver to worry about when the exhibition ended the men were tired hot and covered with sweat but not one of them had shown any sign of weakness in the way they carried their shield sword or spear precision had marked every one of their movements all thirty of the men moving as one gatus had not only trained them well eskkar decided but hed hardened their bodies to match with their weapons hed taken untrained recruits selected the strongest men he could find and toughened them up and just as important hed shown them how to fight like a unit eskkar had learned many lessons during the siege of akkad but one lesson had stood out to win a battle it wasnt necessary to have the most men on the field of battle quality and training could make up for numbers a small force could defeat a much larger one he proved that with his handful of archers against the might and numbers of the alur meriki eskkar remembered how many months the bowmen trained until they could stand exposed on the wall and launch arrow after arrow without flinching powerful arms drawing each shaft to its full length before releasing now eskkar would have to do it again defeat a much larger force with a smaller bettertrained one except this time it would be spearmen such as these leading the way and they would have to lead he decided gatus had the right answer the new army of akkad would be built around men like these archers and horsemounted fighters would still be critical but eskkar realized their main function would be to enable the spearmen to close with the enemy to support that effort bowmen and cavalry would need to learn new ways of fighting as well that training for the horsemen had also begun far to the north in another training camp near bisitun and now yet another tactic needed to be taught how to attack or defend against enemy spearmen one thing eskkar had no illusions about whatever new trick or tactic akkad developed their enemies would learn about it soon enough and add it to their own capabilities are you satisfied gatus demanded breaking into eskkars thoughts with a few hundred men like these i could cut my way through any army no im not satisfied eskkar said raising his own voice he wanted to be sure the men heard his words tomorrow i want you to start marching these soldiers as far as they can walk march their legs off until they can cover twenty miles a day when they can march that distance carrying all their weapons and a days ration of food and water and still be ready for a fight then ill be satisfied he heard the groans from a few of the men frowning eskkar pushed past gatus and stepped to within three paces of the spearmen listen to me you men in the battle with sumer my archers marched twelve or fourteen miles at night carrying their swords and bows and then fought a battle at dawn if they can cover that much distance in the dark you should be able to do twenty in daylight that stopped the spearmens complaints eskkar didnt mention that the men had traveled light with no food and almost no water twenty miles is a long march gatus said moving up and standing at eskkars side a man would have to be tougher than bronze to make that distance then start with ten eskkar said and keep them at it until they can do twenty i will want to cover even more distance than that in time and i want all my soldiers to move quickly as fast as we can move if weve learned one lesson its that the side that can react and move the fastest is going to have the advantage he strode up and down the line of spearmen studying their faces up close looking each man in the eye unless youre not as tough as my archers eskkar suggested or if you prefer to have the enemy pick the time and place of battle no he smiled at the unanimous response that echoed around the training ground then tomorrow well see what you can do eskkar said and ill march with you just to show you it can be done will you march with me a cheer went up this time the soldiers were as excited as hed expected a long days march had just turned into a challenge to march with the ruler of akkad to show him what they could accomplish that would be something to boast about in the alehouse dismiss your men gatus well leave at dawn tomorrow gatus turned the men over to the leaders of ten with orders to prepare for tomorrows march then he joined eskkar and grond can they do twenty miles gatus theyll do whatever you can do captain but im too old for that kind of walking ill be riding my horse laughing at all of you stumbling along in the heat maybe ill join you grond said eskkar knew his bodyguard hated walking as much as he did he also knew that grond would not allow himself to ride while his commander walked youve trained them well gatus eskkar said now i want at least five hundred more of them to start maybe more if we can find enough men each as strong and well trained five hundred i was expecting to train only another hundred or two youve got one year gatus thats all when theyve completed their training you can pay them the same as the archers you were right these men are going to be the core of our strength keep training them until they can march and fight in their sleep trella estimated it would take at least one year before a new threat from sumeria materialized more likely two but eskkar knew it was always better to prepare for the worst gatus shook his head spears swords shields helmets sandals pay not to mention food ale whatever its going to take a lot of gold to support so many men not to mention time and work to train them youll find a way gatus and the gold will be coming soon from the mine at nuzi ask trella about the training and weapons too shes always full of ideas oh i forgot to ask can these spearmen stop a charge of horsemen for once gatus was at a loss im not sure about that weve never tried anything against cavalry tactics well youd better figure out a way spearmen are no use to me if a few hundred mounted riders can brush them aside sumer will have plenty of horseflesh and im certain well see all of it sooner or later eskkar smiled at the frown on gatuss face catching the old soldier offguard didnt come easy come grond we need to get back to the house gatus has plenty to do to get ready for tomorrows march with the hawk clan guards leading the way eskkar and grond left the barracks gatus remained where they left him deep in thought eskkar knew the old soldier wasnt wasting any time worrying about tomorrows march his subcommanders could handle those simple preparations no gatus would be wondering how to stop a mounted charge still if anyone could think of a way gatus would come up with something though eskkar was willing to gamble that hathor would be involved in the solution t he following night eskkar blew out one of the two candles illuminating the chamber and eased himself down onto the bed with a small grunt of relief his back hurt his feet were blistered and his face still burned from the heat of the sun the beds softness cradled him and he let himself relax with a groan of relief you shouldnt have marched with the men trella admonished turn onto your stomach and ill rub your back in a moment im too tired to move but at least i led the men out this morning and back this evening i watched a few days ago as gatus led them through their drills they looked very efficient very dangerous he hadnt known she had visited the barracks training ground leave it to trella to want to learn something new only a few dozen villagers were allowed in mostly soldiers or the wives of the more senior men of course she had blended in with the women no doubt with annoksur at her side gatus had an easy day since he rode out and back eskkar let out another groan of satisfaction glad to be off his feet as you should have done the men wouldnt have thought any less of you for riding i wasnt carrying a spear or a shield and by walking with them i got to know them i spoke with every man on the march and ill remember at least a dozen names it was a day well spent he reached up and touched her breast her nipple hardened and he smiled at the sight he liked arousing her joining with her passion first roll over she said ignoring his attention i want to practice my massage eskkar turned onto his stomach and cradled his head in his arms trella knelt with her knees on either side of him her hands pressed hard against his back as she leaned forward fingers probing deep into the muscles ahhhhaa he said giving a gasp of pain mixed with pleasure is this more of what zenobia taught you zenobia was the woman who operated akkads most famous and luxurious pleasure house trella had befriended her when she arrived alone and vulnerable after the alur meriki were driven off trella gave zenobia the gold needed to buy and operate the house now the finest pleasure girls served the choicest wines to akkads leading merchants the strong drink loosened their tongues and everything they said reached annoksurs ears only a few of eskkars closest circle knew of the relationship oh yes we all practiced on each other especially on tammuz and enhedu i can still see the blush on his face trellas hands which had started kneading her husbands lower back moved up to his shoulders each new movement eliciting a further moan of pleasure zenobia has a slave girl named teara trella went on who is wellpracticed in the art of massage zenobia brought teara to bisitun to teach enhedu the secret art i traveled with them to watch the training and see what i could learn for myself eskkar knew that she had gone north to bisitun for a few days near the end of enhedus training when i left enhedu had learned a dozen new ways to pleasure her husband sometimes with zenobia and teara and me helping id blush too if four naked women were fondling my manhood day after day trella laughed we spilled his seed so many times he begged for mercy his eyes went wide with fear when we approached zenobia and teara drained his poor member so often he could scarcely walk afterwards he probably enjoyed every moment does he still care as much for enhedu or did zenobia and teara steal his love she laughed again and moved her hands to the muscles across the top of eskkars shoulders he cares for enhedu more than ever ive seldom seen a man so smitten with his woman he would die for her and she for him i wonder how theyre doing in sumer have you heard from them no nothing but its too soon they may not even have arrived there yet besides it will take them many months to settle in and figure out what is happening and if theyre discovered then that will tell us something as well it will tell us that king eridu is wiser than we think that his men are quick to guard his secrets tammuz and enhedu will die slow deaths his voice drifted lower as the effects of a long day and trellas ministrations began to take effect they know the risks husband they both want to fight for you and for akkad and this is the only way they can and yavtar vouches for this merchant gemama yes as best he can when the war comes even gemama may be of use to us i think you should turn over now husband before you fall asleep she moved off his back and he wearily rolled over another long sigh of relief escaping from his lips before he could protest she cupped his manhood in both hands and began to massage it i may be too tired for that he said letting his eyes close but his hand reached out for her breast once again thats what tammuz kept saying let me show you what zenobia taught us for such times in moments he was rock hard and gasping at her grip satisfied she moved astride him with a sigh of pleasure see how easy it is to arouse a man wide awake now eskkar thrust himself upward feeling the heat from her body you are still the most beautiful woman in akkad then he could say nothing as she twisted her body tightening her muscles and grinding herself against him on and on until his heart pounded and his seed burst inside her later as they lay in each others arms he had just enough strength to whisper in her ear you are the only woman for me trella she understood how hard it was for him to say such words and you are the only man for me she kissed his neck pressed herself against his shoulder and held him until he fell asleep five days later in sumer in the days before king eridu died tammuz and enhedu found each sunrise bringing some new challenge the city of sumer no longer resembled the sleepy trading village that bordered on the great sea in the last five years the city had grown faster than any other village in sumeria people from all over the region migrated to sumer in search of a better life the steady influx of people had greatly added to king eridus wealth during his rule he fed sumers inhabitants with dreams of conquest and easy wealth over and over eridu assured them that only the city of akkad stood in the way of sumers greatness and prosperity once that barbarianruled city was swept aside gold would flow to sumers inhabitants from all the cities and villages of the land between the rivers even as an outsider tammuz saw how eridus stinging defeat had humiliated the people of sumer dreams of conquest had vanished replaced by a sense of gloom and worry about the future everyone now feared attacks from the north eskkar and his demon archers would invade and devastate sumeria villages and crops would burn farmers murdered in their sleep the gods had turned their back on sumer and its people a feeling of dread replaced the giddy excitement of sumers soldiers and its people after king eridus ransom and return from akkad fresh rumors of a new war were on everyones lips he increased the already heavy burden of taxes eridu onehand as many called him remained full of rage and hatred for all things akkad he seldom left his private quarters and those few whose business took them into his presence reported a man seething with hatred and bitterness word soon spread that he wanted to create another army and take his revenge against eskkar and akkad once again eridus soldiers searched the lanes and alleys looking for any ablebodied men to conscript more than once patrols stopped tammuz on the street until they saw his crooked arm despite eridus yearning for another march north the mood in the city remained sullen in sumers defeat by lord eskkar many men had died or been wounded neither the survivors nor the citys inhabitants had any stomach or desire for more battles not against an enemy that had done little or nothing to arouse them eridus claims to the contrary most people cared little for the borderlands that until recently had been ignored and untouched by any of the southern cities faced with the prospect of another war many men and older boys left the city those that remained did their best to avoid the lanes and marketplace unwilling to be forced into the training camps by eridus roaming gangs all this fascinated tammuz but he and enhedu had plenty to keep them busy as soon as they purchased the inn they moved in and almost immediately trouble started the following day some local thugs decided to take advantage of the new owners young and fresh from the farm three men entered the little tavern in the late afternoon and demanded payment for protection as they called it the inn was almost empty at that hour and the few patrons present recognizing the men as troublemakers and thieves scurried out as fast as they could youre new in sumer cripple the leader rasped a burly man who carried plenty of muscles on his arms and chest youll need someone to make sure your inn is safe well take care of that for you a scar marked his face long black hair hung greasily around his face and he was missing a tooth the combination gave him a fierce expression that he used to intimidate those weaker than himself but first we have to collect payment for your protection one silver coin pay us now or ill break your good arm he fingered the knife in his belt for emphasis while his two companions smiled broadly at the new owners apparent helplessness after that youll pay us the same every ten days or youll find someone has pulled the inn down on your heads from their private chamber enhedu took a step into the common room the three mens heads turned to give her a brief glance but she stood there speechless her hands crossed above her breasts the gesture allowed her right hand to slip inside her dress and reach the haft of her knife tammuz had expected something like this though not on their second day he took two steps back and to the side so that enhedu would be almost behind the three men why should i pay you anything the one with the knife stepped forward because if you dont youll wish you were back on but tammuz used the backward steps only to draw the man forward now his foot lashed out with all his strength striking right between the mans legs with a swiftness that caught all three by surprise with a howl of pain the leader clutched his groin by that time enhedu had slipped up behind the two henchmen snatching the knife from beneath her dress as she moved with muscles as strong as any young mans she struck downward with the weapons hilt on the back of the nearest thugs head he dropped like a sack of grain caught unaware by the unexpected attack from behind the third man still watching openmouthed as his leader crumpled to the ground reacted slowly first he fumbled for his knife then turned toward enhedu as his companion collapsed on the floor but by that time tammuz who had never stopped moving closed the gap between them before the rogue could draw his weapon or even decide what to do tammuz had his own blade out and he smashed the hilt into the mans face the thug stumbled backward tripped over a stool and crashed into a table before sliding onto to the floor meanwhile enhedu slipped behind the leader hunched over in pain from tammuzs kick and struck again this time the butt of her knife landed on the side of his head and he lolled on the dirt floor of the tavern too stunned even to groan in his pain the encounter had taken only moments but tammuz found himself breathing heavily from the brush with danger better fetch the watch before someone else sends for them he said a grim expression on his face ill see what theyre carrying i hope none of them are dead she reached out and touched tammuzs arm for a moment her eyes still wide with excitement for the second time in their young lives they had fought together theyre breathing he said glancing at the leader to make sure his wife had struck with all her strength the last thing tammuz needed was a dead body on their hands no matter what the reason or excuse it would bring down too much trouble on their heads newcomers such as themselves couldnt risk offending anyone not until they were well established and known but a few bloody heads meant nothing he hoped at least not to sumers guards while enhedu darted out to find the citys watch tammuz went through the mens things two of them had nothing of value except for their knives he tossed those into the darkest corner of the inn he might be able to sell them for a few coins later the leaders purse held nine copper coins a respectable amount for even an honest man tammuz collected his knife too and pitched it after the others by then the leader had begun to recover he groaned and attempted to sit up but slumped back to the floor too dazed to move or grasp what had happened tammuz slid his knife back into its sheath he grasped the mans right hand placing his thumb on the back of the hand and his fingers on the palm just as hathor had shown him a quick twist and the mans wrist snapped that brought another gasp of pain but by then tammuz had his knee on the mans chest he drew his knife again and placed the point against the rogues throat move and you die tammuz said not that he intended to kill the man but the thief wouldnt know that tempting as it might be cutting the mans throat would cause more problems than it cured and might even generate ill will from the mans kin or friends he remained on the mans chest until enhedu returned with two guards from the watch both of them breathing hard she must have made them run through the lanes whats going on here demanded the older of the two he had at least forty seasons and wore a sash of red across his shoulder that proclaimed him a leader of ten i told you these men tried to rob us enhedu blurted out her hands again clutching her bosom in her excitement they came in and demanded all our copper or they would kill us tammuz rose the leader of the thieves his eyes filled with pain tried to speak tammuz glanced down and kicked him in the ribs maybe you attacked them the younger guard said his eyes first taking in the men on the floor then settling on tammuz youre not from around here are you keep your mouth shut fool the leader of ten ordered do you think a man and his wife are going to attack three men besides i know these scum thieves all of them may i speak with you tammuz said bowing respectfully he tilted his head toward the darkest corner of the inn and fingered the purse in his hand the older guard turned to his companion watch them he followed tammuz across the room my name is jarud what do you want to talk about honored guardsman tammuz used his humblest voice we have just purchased this inn with merchant gemamas assistance we are his clients and under his protection it may be that until were better known in the neighborhood we might need extra protection from the citys guard perhaps you or your men could stop in from time to time even enjoy a cup of ale with our thanks tammuz held out his hand with the purse taken from the thugs this would be for your trouble jarud and each week i might be able to give you another copper coin and i should have some girls in a few days to repay you for your help the guard took the little sack of leather and hefted it trying to guess how much it contained while he considered the offer mmmn everyone knows merchant gemama a good man or at least as good as any grasping trader can be if you are one of his clients he made up his mind no doubt influenced as much by the weight of the purse in his hand as tammuzs claim on gemamas name im sure we can stop in now and again and your name is tammuz and my wife is enhedu we are new to sumer and not yet used to the ways of the city jarud glanced down at the knife on tammuzs belt you did well enough against these three tammuz moved closer and halfwhispered the words my wife struck two of them from behind he lowered his head as if embarrassed that he had to rely on his wife for assistance well take care of these thieves jarud said the work gangs can always use some new slaves a few months hard labor will settle them down one of the first things tammuz and enhedu learned in sumer was about the work gangs supposedly a punishment for petty crimes few ever returned from their forced labor with ablebodied slaves in great demand only those whose friends could pay for their release were ever seen again the three men were dragged to their feet and shoved out the door their former leader cursing as he clutched his broken wrist with his good hand tammuz went to the doorway a small crowd had gathered peering in at the little drama that had played out with a very different ending from what they had expected obviously these new innkeepers despite their youth would have to be treated with respect were still open for business tammuz called out flashing his white teeth in his best welcoming smile come in and sample our finest ale two laborers looked at each other shrugged and stepped inside are you under the protection of the guard of course as you can see tammuz said clapping the man on the back which means you may drink your fill here without worrying about thieves and we serve the finest ales and a hearty wine as well come in come in welcome to the kestrel inn enhedu had decided the inn should have a new name to distinguish it from its former owner the kestrel a small falcon that hunted during the day killed its prey with its beak instead of its talons common enough in sumeria and the northern lands no one would call one a hawk but tammuz knew a kestrel could hunt as well as any falcon despite its diminutive size in a way thats how he thought of himself a member of akkads hawk clan but who showed himself as small and agile as a kestrel the newlynamed kestrel inn soon settled down people came in to gossip about what had just happened enhedu served ale until everyone had a cup tammuz moved beside his wife both of them behind the table that hosted the stock of ale in a few days word will spread through the neighborhood she nodded weve passed the first test but only the first there will be many more in the coming months e ven with a growing reputation as people to be left alone tammuz and enhedu had plenty to do starting up an inn remained a difficult business customers of the previous owner drifted off to other haunts the local wine seller tried to overcharge them then attempted to pass off the dregs of his stock enhedu stood in the mans shop and screamed in his face until he reconsidered then problems started with the delivery the wine makers slaves delivered two wine skins one half empty and claimed it must have been damaged when they picked it up no matter that wine stained their chests and chins enhedu snatched up a cudgel and demanded they carry it back she refused to pay for any of the delivery until it was replaced the slaves no doubt received a good beating from the wine merchant who found himself covering the cost of the missing goods food bread ale everything had to be haggled over and argued a dozen ways until the kestrels suppliers realized that its new owners were anything but young fools fresh from the farm and once the word got around that jarud a leader of the guard had taken an interest in the place the attempts to cheat the kestrel faded away three days later enhedu walked the lanes until she reached the marketplace studying the women who sold themselves fortunately sumer had a plentiful supply of prostitutes the recent fighting with akkad had probably increased the number of women forced to fend for themselves and just as in akkad girls fled the farms of their fathers every day to come to the city where even selling themselves to anyone who could pay provided a better life than the absolute slavery of husband and farm the previous owner of the inn employed three girls who attended his customers but enhedu hadnt wanted to keep any of them they would be much too familiar with the customers and as liable to cheat the new owners as any grasping merchant or conniving thief as she strolled around the marketplace enhedu ignored most of the women offering themselves some were covered with as much dirt as the ground itself others stank of cheap ale even this early in the day many appeared dull or unkempt or diseased traits that often combined as the women grew older life was especially hard for those with no man to protect and provide for them at last enhedu found two women searching for customers on the edge of the marketplace both appeared reasonably clean and presentable though they looked as if they hadnt eaten well for some time enhedu approached them since they were working the streets they obviously didnt have a tavern or inn keeper to shelter and look after them are you looking for work one woman had a few strands of gray hair sprinkled in amongst her dark tresses she forced a smile to her lips and took a deep breath pushing her bosom forward and nearly out of her garment yes mistress i enjoy comforting a woman what would you like nothing for myself my name is enhedu and my husband and i have just opened a tavern im searching for someone to help serve the ale and take care of the customers no need to explain what taking care of the customers involved the woman bowed respectfully anyone who owned a business was entitled to a good deal of respect my name is irkalla and this is anu my daughter enhedu guessed anu had fourteen or fifteen seasons she looked much like her mother except anus eyes lacked the sharp wits that marked irkallas the two women resembled sisters rather than mother and daughter but that made no difference the tavern is called the kestrel just off dockside lane opposite the shop of dragush the carpenter if you perform your duties well youll have a place to sleep and you can keep a third of what you make from the customers all the copper will first be paid to me or my husband of course if you let the girls collect the coins they would try and cheat you or disappear one night with some man along with the evenings profits a third is not much irkalla said many taverns let the girls keep half their fees if the girls are beautiful and very skilled enhedu lifted her hands and let them drop have you worked in a tavern before i have but not for many years irkalla answered lowering her head enhedu guessed irkalla had thought about lying but changed her mind many taverns dont give their girls a place to sleep or feed them twice a day that is my offer if youre not interested forgive me mistress irkalla said using the usual sign of respect for any head of the household yes we are interested as long as i can keep my daughter with me she gets frightened easily we would work very hard to please your customers when can we start today now my husband will want to speak with you as well he will explain exactly what will be expected from you both then we will follow you back to the kestrel to meet your husband irkalla took anus hand and smiled give thanks to our new mistress we thank you anu said dutifully the poor girl didnt appear very happy despite the prospect of having a roof over her head tonight enhedu led the way back to the kestrel the two women still holding hands following behind d ay by day the kestrel took shape an artisan sketched an outline of the bird on the wall next to the door then finished by coloring it in shades of gray and rose a splendid image of the small but cunning aerial hunter tammuz expressed his satisfaction by serving the artist a second cup of ale in addition to the supper promised for later that day a woman living down the lane agreed to bake bread for the tavern and her two children fetched buckets of fresh water each morning after a few days the baker accepted an offer to come each day at sundown to cook the usual pot of stew comprised of whatever enhedu had bartered or purchased that day with the wine and ale sellers finally delivering what they promised the kestrel once again began to attract a good number of customers two laborers arrived with a cart loaded with clean sand to fill and smooth over the floor of the inn which had degenerated into a lopsided layer of dirt that had more rocks than soil the location so close to the docks naturally attracted plenty of river men as well as those sailors who traveled along the coast of the great sea the unruly crowd needed watching of course but tammuz had searched the dockside and marketplace for days until he found a former soldier named rimaud big and strong rimaud had taken an arrow in his leg during a battle with the desert horsemen and the wound had never fully healed he walked with a heavy limp and pain still crossed his face from time to time since he could no longer work all day or even move quickly hed suffered in finding work on the docks but for tammuz and the kestrel rimaud would have no trouble keeping order within its confines with jarud and one or two of his guardsmen stopping by almost every night word soon spread that the honest innkeeper and his wife provided good ale and decent food in a setting where you could eat and drink without worrying about getting your throat slit or your purse cut a few evenings later just as enhedu and irkalla finished serving the days stew a man rushed into the kestrel and shouted that king eridu had died murdered by his steward over their ale cups heads huddled close together many whispered words that expressed satisfaction about the death of eridu onehand not one spoke a word of mourning or respect for the dead man maybe now well have peace one man said muttering into his ale cup no one from the citys watch came that evening and most of the customers left early unsure of what the future would bring the next morning tammuz and enhedu learned that eridus son shulgi had taken command of sumer and its soldiers soon messengers walked the citys lanes spreading word that king shulgi had summoned all the inhabitants of sumer to the marketplace at noon leaving rimaud to watch the inn tammuz and enhedu followed the crowd and managed to secure a place just within earshot of their new ruler a handsome man enhedu remarked as shulgi stepped forward and began to speak not much older than we are agreed tammuz after explaining how his father was murdered by his steward shulgi proclaimed that he would continue eridus rule then he called for a time of peace and healing there would be no further war preparations everyone cheered and words of praise and support for their new king echoed throughout the marketplace shulgi explained that peace would allow sumers people to work and plan for the future no action would be taken or permitted against akkadians and trade would resume with the northern cities at once king shulgi also announced that he would send a deputation to akkad to inform king eskkar of his desire for an end to hostilities between the two cities by the time shulgi finished speaking the throng voiced their approval for their new ruler the war with akkad was over and a great weight had been lifted from sumers inhabitants mothers would not have to dread their husbands and sons going off to war and families could work their farms and shops without worrying about being conscripted again and again the crowd declared their thanks for the new king and his policy to conclude his speech shulgi declared three days of mourning for his father after which he continued there would be three days of feasting to celebrate the coming peace of course the people ignored the first pronouncement and started celebrating none concerned themselves about the demise of the unloved and aloof eridu onehand who had brought them nothing but grief and disaster tammuz and enhedu joined in the cheering waving their hands and shouting as loud as anyone but that night when the inn finally quieted down they lay in their bed and whispered to each other if there is to be peace tammuz said maybe there will be no need for us to remain in sumer yes if there is to be peace enhedu said but men may say one thing while they think another what better way to deceive your own people than to tell them what they want to hear the next few months will tell us who this shulgi is and what he really intends well meanwhile we can enjoy ourselves while we wait tammuz said he ran his hand down her shoulder and across her belly enjoying the smooth flesh that never failed to arouse him there was a time for war and a time for pleasure and he didnt intend to confuse one with the other three days later king shulgi strode into his house climbed the stairs two at a time and stepped into the council chamber where not long ago his father had met with the leaders of the other cities the house the compound the soldiers the city all that once belonged to his father now belonged to shulgi the guards who patrolled the compound reported to him not razrek king shulgi ruled over every man and woman in sumer that included kushanna eridu had treated shanna as just another possession forced to attend to his every beck and call as much eridus property as any servant or slave in due time he would have again married her off to another petty noble either for a goodly supply of gold or to further eridus needs there might not be much gold left in eridus secret places but shulgi intended to make better use of what remained than his father had kushanna entered the meeting chamber a few steps behind her halfbrother and a moment later razrek arrived two of shulgis men guarded the rooms entrance and none of razreks men had been permitted into the compound shulgi unbuckled his sword and dumped it on the table before he sat down kushanna sat as well taking the seat on her brothers right sit down razrek shulgi said weve much to talk about the soldier glanced at shanna who favored him with one of her most pleasing smiles nevertheless he sat down warily what shall we talk about the war of course shulgi said no doubt razrek hadnt expected shanna to remain yesterday you spoke of peace in the marketplace and peace is what well have for quite some time in fact there will be peace until the day were ready for war with akkad and this time well strike so hard a blow that akkads walls will fall as easily as their barbarian leader your father wanted to fight you will never mention my fathers name again razrek his plans his thoughts all mean nothing he was a merchant who thought his gold made him a leader of soldiers you took his gold and let him play out his dreams of glory to further your own ends you are as much responsible for the debacle on the border as he was razrek bristled at the slur i did my best to warn him believe me nothing would give me greater pleasure than killing eskkar and you will address me as king or my lord dont forget that again not even in private the soldier glanced at kushanna but her eyes were lowered her gaze apparently fixed on the table king shulgi razrek bowed his head what do you want of me and my men your men are no longer yours to command kushanna said her eyes now fixed on razrek from now on all of them will be under king shulgis authority razreks eyes widened in surprise and what will i be doing you will be raising fresh troops and training them said shulgi i need bowmen spearmen and more horsemen thousands of them you will take what gold i can spare build a camp on the edge of the western desert and start recruiting but that would take months years lord shulgi yes i know it may be as much as two years before we are ready but im still young and i can afford to be patient our plans will take time to bear fruit but there is much to do in the coming days to prepare for our attack this war will be won not just on some battlefield but in every city on the tigris our victory must destroy akkad so completely that it can never rise again the land between the rivers will be ruled from sumer what will the people say when they learn of your plans they will not learn of them until i am ready to tell them by then they will be as eager to fight akkad as any bride on her wedding night is eager to please her husband until that day we will talk only of peace and trade shulgi leaned closer to razrek and placed his hands on the sword resting on the table until that day only the three of us will know my plans so if people begin to speak of war ill know who is responsible then you already have made plans kushanna and i have spoken of many things shulgi didnt bother to elaborate instead he lifted his hand from the sword and placed it on her arm meanwhile you will be well paid and when we complete our conquest youll have more gold and slaves and power than you can imagine i can imagine quite a lot lord shulgi im sure you can razrek just make sure you remember to keep silent we will speak only of peace while we prepare for war people will notice sooner or later lord shulgi nodded eventually but when they do well tell them were arming against the western raiders or the barbarians to the northeast which as it happens is going to be true were at peace with the desert tribes razreks face betrayed his confusion the tanukhs and salibs were desert dwellers who lived on sumerias western border along the edge of the desert the two tribes had fought each other off and on for as long as anyone could remember occasionally joining forces to attack the sumerian cities but that tactic had failed in the last ten years as the cities increased their strength pushing the tribes back to the edge of the desert and beyond in time the tribes decided it was simpler to accept eridus gold than try to wrest it from sumers grasp yes my father bought that peace with plenty of his gold but soon you are going to approach the tanukhs to offer an alliance in return for supporting sumer we will help them destroy the salibs why the tanukhs weve dealt more often with the salib tribes in the past because the tanukhs are more numerous and because their lands are farther to the north that will make it easier for them to raid akkadian territory when the times comes and by waging our battles in the southern desert there is less likelihood of akkad discovering what were doing until its too late what if the tanukhs dont want to fight the salibs then what that will be your first new task razrek shulgi said youll have to convince them to side with us agree to fight at their side promise them anything they need in trade use gold threats whatever it takes and what do we want from them horses of course and men the tanukhs must agree to help us make war on akkad when the time comes in that way well be able to field a large number of mounted fighters to carry the battle north razreks brow furrowed you seem uneasy about this kushanna said the western desert is the perfect place to train our own fighters razrek glanced from kushanna to shulgi who seemed unconcerned about hearing a womans advice you want us to fight alongside the tanukhs oh yes razrek shulgi leaned back and took kushannas hand in his own were all going to fight the salibs until theyre destroyed or driven deep into the desert where they belong this way our soldiers will learn to fight against a real enemy not wooden posts in training camp the next sumerian army that marches north will know how to fight and how to win kushanna added it may take a few years to prepare everything but this time lord shulgi will have experienced fighters at his back to face eskkar and what else do you have planned lord shulgi oh there is more much more you will learn everything in time after you have proven your loyalty i may even let you rule in my name in akkad after we conquer the city razrek considered that interesting possibility he eased back in his chair and when will all this begin tomorrow return here at noon and we will decide what you will need gold men everything will be planned for shulgi took a breath and turned to kushanna is there anything else for razrek no my king except to tell razrek to make sure his men know who commands them from now on ah yes we wouldnt want you to forget that he saw the look of dismay on razreks face dont worry youll soon raise a new force of men one much greater than the handful you have now meanwhile our work starts tomorrow so go back to the camp and tell all your men that peace is at hand youll keep training them of course but the fact that sumer no longer has an enemy should turn that into a pleasant enough task and now you may return to your men razrek accepted the sudden dismissal smoothly enough yes my king he stood bowed and left the chamber shulgi waited until razrek had gone then rose and went to the guards stationed at the door make sure no one disturbs my rest he closed the door barred it then leaned his back against it while he faced kushanna she smiled then lifted her arms over her head to stretch and now what do you desire my king shulgi strode toward her get up she rose and faced him her breasts almost touching his chest she ran her tongue over her lips take off your dress yes my lord taking her time she reached down and gathered the dress in her hands slowly she pulled it up higher until the light brown patch of hair beneath her belly lay open to his gaze shanna held the dress there for a moment then lifted it higher until her full breasts were revealed their pink tips already hard with desire suddenly she jerked the dress up over her head and let it fall to the floor she shook her hair to straighten it the long brown tresses swirling over her shoulders her hands went to her hips she spread her legs apart and moved closer until her body pressed against his is this what you want to see my king i hope my body pleases you she ran her tongue over the base of his neck with an oath shulgi swept his arms around her your body would please the gods shanna my queen my love he leaned down and kissed the warm lips that lifted to his shanna returned the kiss then her tongue darted inside his mouth and her leg lifted up and wrapped around his thigh perhaps you would find me more attractive in bed my king your queen would like to please you in many ways his manhood had swelled into a solid rod against the touch of her leg shulgi picked her up carried her into the bedroom and tossed her onto the bed shanna laughed as she bounced on the mattress then held her head on one elbow as shulgi pulled off his tunic he moved onto the bed and knelt astride her his staff brushing her lips with a smooth motion she lifted her head up and took him in her mouth her hands reaching around to clutch him firmly ahhhha he gasped as a wave of pleasure passed through him for this i would kill a dozen men she looked up at him you will kill many more than that for me my king h alf the afternoon had passed before shulgi and kushanna once again sat at the table this time she sat across from him we need to talk shulgi at least for awhile talk about what he still could see her naked in his bed kneeling on her hands and knees as he entered her from behind pounding against her soft flesh while she moaned in delight talk about the destruction of akkad that took his mind off her body what about akkad it will not be easy to defeat this eskkar and his bowmen and the walls of akkad are strong and high we will need to set many things in motion to destroy him and his city and what do you suggest already razrek knows that we will need more men there are many other tasks that we must begin first we will need more informers and spies in sumer and the other cities in akkad trella has her agents everywhere and we must do the same nothing must happen in any part of sumeria that we do not know about the other cities are almost as dangerous to us as akkad the more we know about what happens in larsa and isin and the others the better then we must dispatch spies to akkad as well so that we may learn about eskkars plans and discover the size of his army when he becomes aware of the threat to his lands he may even try to strike you down here in sumer so we must protect you from that danger as well all that will cost plenty of gold trella spends that gold in akkad without hesitation and with no complaints from her husband can you do any less would you risk your victory over a few gold coins spent to gather information no i suppose not what else must we do trella will soon have her agents here in sumer if indeed she does not already we must find them out and get rid of as many as possible the longer we can keep our plans a secret the stronger we will be the idea of eskkar and trella spying on him hadnt occurred to shulgi but he didnt want to admit that shanna certainly had her wits about her spend whatever you need he said just remember i need all the gold i can get to buy men and weapons a few more men or swords wont make that much difference she said not if you dont learn everything about your enemy he sighed i suppose youre right good then i will start in the morning you will also need to stockpile weapons thousands of them and i think i know how that can be done without anyone noticing and without spending too much gold how will you accomplish that little trick we will buy the weapons from the land of the indus our traders go there now and again im sure those barbarians will be willing to sell us all the swords knives and spears we want we can have the traders deliver what we buy to any of the cities or even the western lands where youll be training the men that way it will not look as if our craftsmen are working night and day outfitting an army and perhaps we can establish our own forges in those outlying areas staffed by slaves to make weapons for us that will keep the greedy craftsmen from asking such high prices for their goods casting bronze swords and other edged blades took both skill and time as well as plenty of copper and tin he realized that building an empire might require more than just raising an army shulgi poured himself a half cup of wine then filled the rest with water that is a good idea i have another if we can manage it that is we should try and make contact with the alur meriki maybe when were ready to go to war we can encourage them to attack akkad once again how will that help us the alur meriki are not as strong as they once were eskkar can sit behind his wall and slaughter them even easier than he did before eskkar will not be there shanna said when you destroy eskkar and his army you must do it in our lands or along the border he must be drawn south and he must bring all his forces with him if we can find a way to have the alur meriki strike at that time the city may not have enough men to defend itself even if the barbarians fail to capture the city they can devastate the countryside burn the crops even foul the wells eskkars soldiers will lose heart and many will want to return to akkad rather than fight your men all of this will make your own success when you attack the city easier if we could get the alur meriki they certainly would like a chance to pay akkad back for their defeat and it would cost us almost nothing to encourage them meanwhile you will recruit and train an army of men thousands of them more than any man has ever assembled when you meet eskkar and his forces you must not only defeat them but you must crush them completely there must be none to escape back to akkad and defend its walls you must have an army so vast that no matter what tricks and schemes eskkar comes up with you can still destroy him on the battlefield and how many men will that be i think you will need twenty thousand soldiers perhaps more to defeat him twenty thousand no man has ever raised and commanded such a force it would take years no it must be done in less than two years shanna said firmly if we stretch and squeeze every gold coin from every merchant and city in sumeria we will just have enough to last that long if we do not capture akkad to regain our wealth we will be ruined our people starving and if that happens the farmers and villagers will rise up against us but so many men eskkar cannot raise a quarter of that number there arent that many men of fighting age in the north nevertheless thats what you will need to defeat him he is resourceful and despite everything we do trella and he will soon learn that we are preparing for war and his soldiers are battle hardened as razrek says they have already fought many battles which makes them more dangerous dont forget eskkar will make his own preparations to defeat us even as you prepare your men and that is why he must be drawn to sumeria and overwhelmed by your soldiers when will this great battle be fought my bloodthirsty queen she smiled at the compliment in twentytwo months the crops will be in the soldiers trained the weapons delivered and our people ready and that will be the best time for the alur meriki to strike if we wait longer than that the akkadians will have gathered enough men to march on sumer is that enough time the breadth of her plan stunned him but the thought of commanding twenty thousand men in a battle he would be remembered for a thousand years with that many men he would rule all of mesopotamia and possibly even the lands beyond it would truly be an empire worthy of sumer and of himself it will have to be shanna said meanwhile you must do as eskkar has done train with your soldiers fight as many battles with the western raiders as you can make your men have confidence in you and trust your judgment if the soldiers in your army stand behind you none of the other cities in sumeria will dare to disobey your rule and when the akkadian soldiers learn of your skills they will begin to doubt their own leader they will remember that eskkar is a barbarian and that he grows old when you meet him in battle he will have at least thirtyfive seasons perhaps more too old to fight himself too old to command his army war as everyone knew was best left to the very young razrek had over thirty seasons and he had grown soft of late twenty thousand men shulgi mused with so many i can rule the world with so many we can rule the world the empire of sumeria will rule the land in every direction how long have you been planning all this since our fool of a father decided he wanted to wage war against akkad i sat at his side at every meeting every war council every dinner with razrek while he planned his pathetic venture i could have told him he would fail but of course he would not have listened to me so i used the time to make my own plans to decide what you and i would do if eridu were out of the way i gave thanks to the gods when eskkar defeated him if eridu had won i still shudder at the thought with so many soldiers we will not fail if you heed my words my lord shulgi we will not fail together we can build an empire and i can help you rule it in time gold slaves the most beautiful women everything in that empire will be yours including you my dear sister including me my dear brother she took a deep breath and leaned provocatively toward him am i not worthy to be your queen more than worthy tomorrow i will tell the people that you are to be my bride their queen then my lord and master let me thank you again tonight for the honor you will bestow on me ten days after eskkars march with the spearmen he and grond splashed their horses across the tigris accompanied by hathor and twenty horsemen they departed the northern village of bisitun and rode to the northwest the trip had taken months to arrange sisuthros who ruled bisitun in akkads name had sent word through his traders that lord eskkar wished to meet with the leader of the ur nammu but the clan of steppe warriors had migrated to the west and it took endless days of often aimless and always dangerous riding to make contact with them at last a message arrived at akkad that a time and place to meet had been arranged as soon as he received word eskkar had dispatched hathor and a group of horsemen to bisitun only after hathors horsemen had departed akkad did they learn their true destination meanwhile eskkar and grond took passage on one of yavtars ships and reached bisitun five days later where they rejoined hathor and his men after a single night in relative comfort in bisitun eskkar resumed the journey to the northwest all were mounted on good animals and each day they covered plenty of ground after three days of hard riding they passed into the rugged and mostly empty land of rolling hills and rocky crags wild goats watched their progress from the heights and hawks soared overhead but they encountered few men the dry soil made for poor farming and the ever present danger from bandits or barbarians made the occasional inhabitants wary of strangers for eskkar the journey provided a chance to forget the troubles and problems of akkad and enjoy the pleasure of traveling long distances by horse once again the clear air now with a hint of coolness cleansed the smells of the crowded city from his body and the trip provided time for eskkar to grow close to his men something he did at every opportunity the more men know you trella said to him many times the more loyal to your cause they will be so he took advantage of these days of riding with the soldiers they spoke about weapons horses women all the things fighting men had discussed and argued about since the dawn of time they remained alert for danger at all times the land they traversed belonged to no one though the ur nammu rode through these places often akkad had established a truce of sorts with the ur nammu and both sides had managed to avoid conflict for over two years they had fought together twice against the alur meriki and after the final victory eskkar had established a small trading settlement north of bisitun to facilitate trade with the ur nammu twice each year traders from akkad and bisitun met with bands of ur nammu the warriors had plenty of gold usually taken from the dead bodies of their enemies for which they had little use and they needed the tools and higherquality bronze weapons that the villagers could produce more efficiently the trade benefited both the horse clan and the akkadians but eskkar knew how fragile such agreements could be a slur on some warriors honor an insulting glance a drunken brawl any incident could trigger an outbreak of raiding and looting along akkads northern border and right now eskkar needed an ally not another problem to distract him from the enemy in the south on the afternoon of the third day the akkadians saw three riders watching them from a distant hilltop eskkar gave the order to halt the horses could use a brief rest and the lack of movement either to attack or flee evidenced the newcomers peaceful intentions is that them hathor like most of the horsemen riding with eskkar had never encountered any of the steppe warriors before could be eskkar said could be anyone he turned to their guide a leader of ten from bisitun named meskalum how close are we to the meeting ground meskalum moved his horse forward to join the leaders not far now captain we should be there by sundown eskkar made the calculation about ten or twelve more miles if the guide didnt miss a landmark and get lost even after all these years he still disliked following someone elses lead but he had no choice no man could master every trail and landmark in such a vast land then its not likely there would be any other bands of warriors nearby break out the standard grond pulled the yellow streamer as long as a man was tall from his sack meskalum fastened it to the tip of his bow the wind lifted the cloth and sent it billowing everyone keep your eyes open eskkar said its an old barbarian trick to keep your attention on one band while another slips up on you from behind meskalum take the point with the guide out front eskkar set the pace at an easy canter he didnt want to tire the horses since one never knew if they would be needed to run or fight and whether they reached the agreed upon place by sundown or not didnt matter meetings like this arranged so long in advance and through so many intermediaries over great distances could never be exact as to time five even ten days early or late would be considered normal the riders continued the journey and after a time the horsemen on the hillside matched their pace and direction as the sun descended the two groups of riders began to converge looks like they know where were headed grond observed hed fought against men such as these twice before and had a healthy respect for their fighting skills lets hope theyre not getting ready to ambush us hathor said all this empty land no villages or farms makes me nervous everyone remained alert and eskkar stopped twice more to study the land and the obvious ambush sites a little before sundown they topped a hill and saw a meandering stream bordered with willow trees beneath their shade a thick belt of grass grew down to the waters edge two tents marked a campsite and the blackened remains of a fire pit showed even from the top of the hill a small herd of horses penned in by a rope corral and guarded by a mounted rider gave eskkar a quick count of the warriors he halted the troop once again while he examined the terrain ahead twenty maybe grond said coming to the same conclusion maybe twentyfive counting the three behind us by then the akkadians had been spotted by the warriors in the camp within moments a yellow standard fastened to a lance waved at them eskkar grunted in relief thats the ur nammu my thanks to you meskalum whether the guide knew the land as well as he claimed or had just gotten lucky he deserved a word of praise in front of his companions they cantered down the hill the three warriors behind them swung wide around the akkadians and raced recklessly toward the camp their horses flinging clods of dirt high into the air shouts floating across the land as they urged on their mounts eskkar smiled at the display of horsemanship in his youth he might have attempted such a ride but no longer a rider needed to be astride his mount ten hours a day for years to master that kind of riding as the akkadians drew near a warrior separated from the group and walked toward them when they approached within fifty paces eskkar swung down from his horse wait here a moment he said then moved toward the approaching warrior greetings subutai chief of the ur nammu welcome to our camp eskkar of akkad the two men clasped arms in the way of the warrior then paced side by side back to the camp eskkar waved his men forward subutai had marked a place for them about two hundred paces from the tents the akkadians would have easy access to the river without getting too close to his own camp eskkar and his men tended to their horses first making sure the animals were watered in the stream and the akkadians used the one rope they had brought with them to make a rough corral of their own winding the cord around two willow trees and a bush not much more was needed to keep the mounts penned in with plenty of water and grass to eat they werent likely to stray with the horses taken care of eskkar washed his hands and face in the stream another gesture of politeness to meet with a clan chief was a serious matter and it would not do to appear covered with sweat and dirt eskkar drank his fill from the stream but shook his head at hathors offer of a drink from one of the two wineskins theyd brought with them youll come with me hathor by custom each clan leader brings one subcommander with him so that there may be no misunderstanding or forgetting of what is said they strode across the grass to the ur nammu campsite where subutai and another warrior waited for them subutai led the way upstream to a small patch of grass a hundred paces from the river the two leaders sat facing each other unlike villagers who might talk half a day before getting down to business barbarians preferred to take care of serious matters first meanwhile warriors from both sides watched the proceedings with interest the two ur nammu warriors eyed hathor with curiosity probably neither had ever seen someone from the land of egypt eskkar introduced the egyptian as his subcommander then faced subutais commander its good to see you again fashod eskkar said nodding at subutais second in command have your men been in camp here long fashod caught by surprise couldnt prevent a smile from crossing his face only three days lord eskkar and i am honored that you remember me at all i always try to remember brave men who have fought at my side eskkar said in truth he had to strain his wits to recall the mans name when he first saw him two years was a long time despite trellas constant admonition to try and memorize every mans face and name eskkar explained that hathor didnt speak the language of the steppes that proved to be no problem as subutai and fashod both spoke the language of the dirteaters well enough your wits remain quick eskkar subutai said nodding in satisfaction a compliment to one of his men reflected on him as well your mighty city grows stronger each day and even in the far north we hear of akkads power you have grown in strength subutai the last time eskkar had seen the warrior hed been thin and undernourished now firm muscle covered his frame the result of long hours on the back of a horse and plenty of meat in his diet and i hear your people have increased as well we are much stronger eskkar now there are almost two hundred warriors under my standard in another ten years well be almost as strong as we were in the past he smiled at the prospect the ur nammu clan has grown as well after the fighting ended there were many women without husbands or fathers abandoned in these lands and these have sought our protection now there are many children playing around the campfires then i am glad for my friend eskkar said perhaps i can offer a way to help you increase your strength even faster i wondered what brought you so far north even before the next trade gathering that meeting would have meant waiting another three months far too long in eskkars mind a new enemy of akkad has arisen in the land of sumeria eskkar began i wanted to speak with you about them the land by the great sea subutai said i saw it once when i was but a young boy barely able to sit on a horse eskkar explained the growing conflict between the two cities and described the recent battle subutai listened impassively until eskkar finished so a new war is coming to akkad eskkar said and this time we will be facing not only a new enemy but a different kind of warfare the next conflict will be fought over claims to land not the grasslands your warriors need for their horses but the land needed by our farmers and herdsmen and when this war comes it will require a new way of fighting this time i may have to take the fight to my enemy our warriors will meet face to face both on foot and on horseback in that kind of fighting numbers are important and sumer will have a great advantage in men so i must find a way to offset the greater numbers of my enemy and that brings you here to the ur nammu yes i need horses a great many horses good horses and good breeding stock too in a few seasons i want to have at least five hundred welltrained and mounted warriors to protect my foot soldiers there are not that many horses in these lands subutai said avoiding a direct response good mounts were scarce and even when they were plentiful not all proved large and strong enough to carry a man and his weapons to be considered as a war horse the animal needed to be at least fourteen hands high every warrior and even the villagers tried to breed the animals so as to increase each offsprings size and strength still some smaller animals made excellent mounts while other larger horses lacked the stamina and speed needed for a war horse the breeders skill eskkar knew lay in quickly determining each horses capabilities good horseflesh is scarce eskkar agreed i will gather horses from every direction but here in your lands are bred the finest mounts and you could breed more if you had a reason to do so wherever and however you obtain them i will trade tools goods whatever you need with your people subutai rocked back and forth for a moment always taking his time before replying we have a few surplus horses but numbers such as you need this war will take time perhaps years before it begins i know that no one has as many mounts as i will need but i must start gathering them now as i must begin training the men to care for them and to learn to ride and fight eskkar had his eyes on subutai but he caught a glimpse of fashod who let a flash of excitement cross his face and if i can supply you with a good number of horses you can provide tools weapons cooking pots all the bronze we need yes as well as grain cloth food wine even cattle or sheep eskkar kept his features impassive but he thought he read something in subutais body language trella had helped eskkar understand the subtle signs given off by a mans face and body he guessed the ur nammu leader had extra horses or at least knew where he could get them then we may be able to help you eskkar that is if you can break wild stock now it was eskkars turn to rock back and forth while he considered his answer the ur nammu had found a wild horse herd somewhere such animals would be beyond the villagers skill to train villagers could breed and raise horses and teach them to accept a rider but a wild animal that was different only the most skilled riders could break a horse that had lived most of its life running free i have only a few men who could handle such animals could you not break the new mounts and exchange your trained horses with us where are you intending to hold these horses in akkad subutai clearly wasnt willing to talk about any exchanges at least not yet no i will establish camps north of bisitun said eskkar most likely on the west bank of the river even a place such as this would be suitable there are many small valleys in these lands with good grass where horses could be held perhaps your warriors could break the animals for us until my men learn how to master the skill yes thats what i was thinking subutai said i have warriors who could break horses for you in fact i have too many young warriors all eager for battle with the alur meriki far to the east there are few opportunities for them to prove themselves im sure ten or fifteen would be glad for the chance to demonstrate their horse skills then for that help i would be grateful eskkar said how big a horse herd did you find subutai smiled i see i must learn not to betray my thoughts so easily at least a hundred horses it was far to the north at the base of the mountains we took a few last year and drove the rest into the foothills then blocked their way out they should still be there or most of them there may even be more the grass was good with plenty of water we saw some fine stallions if the ur nammu could deliver a few hundred horses and help break them eskkar could assemble a basic cavalry force in months instead of years with the additional animals he would obtain through trading he might have more horses in the next six months than men to ride them my men at bisitun are almost ready to establish the first camp as you bring in mounts we will trade for them if you agree subutai turned toward fashod who nodded his agreement they had worked with eskkar before and accepted him as an equal now he was glad hed come himself the ur nammu would not have dealt with anyone else from akkad or any other place for that matter eskkar leaned back there was still much to talk about of course but the basic arrangement had been made in true warrior fashion the details would be decided between hathor and fashod that way if there were disagreements the leaders could correct the problems without anyone losing honor you have something else to say the question caught eskkar by surprise unaware that his own thoughts could be read on his face the idea of so many horses arriving so soon had not been part of his plan but now that the possibility existed he might be able to improve on his original idea i was thinking about bows for the riders your people can make them as well as mine they would be a powerful weapon for my men you think you can train men to shoot arrows from the back of a horse even subutai couldnt keep the skepticism out of his voice eskkar grinned not at first but perhaps a few of your young men with someone like fashod to control them could help train my young men in the ways of fighting from horseback subutai laughed the sound carrying across the grassland dirteaters fighting on horseback enough talk for today he said rising to his feet he extended his hand and pulled eskkar upright tonight we will feast then tomorrow we will talk again i wish to hear all about your new enemy these sumerians eskkar felt the strength in subutais grip the warrior had indeed regained his full strength then well feast he said i brought two wineskins from bisitun for you and your men that should be enough to get most of them decently drunk l ater that night after the feasting and singing and drinking eskkar checked the guards and the horses before readying himself for sleep his head hurt from the third cup of wine more than hed drunk in some time a footfall crunched in the dirt and he looked up to see subutai walking toward him the ur nammu leader squatted down beside him eskkar i think i may be able to offer you more help if you can find a way ill take any help i can he wondered why subutai was bringing this up now and without fashod or his men present as i said i have plenty of young warriors and not enough fighting or riding to keep them occupied with nothing to accomplish they grow restive they fight with each other and make trouble over women and horses and question their leaders eskkar knew thats why the warrior clans needed to keep their young men fighting warriors need to ride eskkar agreed still not sure where this talk was heading if you were interested in taking some of them into your army for a time they would make fine fighters for you they could learn much about the ways of war and practice their skills on your enemy a force of steppe warriors even a small one would be a blessing from the gods eskkar knew they could act as scouts and messengers and could harass the enemy as well if any of your warriors wished to join my men they would be welcome just for a year or two subutai cautioned i dont want them deciding to stay with your army when theyre needed here but what they would learn would be very useful it certainly would eskkar decided they would learn more about eskkars army and his forces their strengths and weaknesses than he would have cared to share with the ur nammu but that couldnt be avoided like subutai eskkar understood that the day might come when they faced each other across a battlefield but such a day would not come soon he knew i think we can make a fair arrangement subutai that satisfies you and your needs good well speak of this again in a few days better to let my men get used to the idea of delivering and breaking horses for you first when the leader of the ur nammu had gone eskkar stretched out on his blanket a force of warriors under his command something hed dreamed about as a young boy he found the idea strangely satisfying and knew his fathers spirit would approve of his son leading horsemen into battle the ur nammu might not be the alur meriki but they shared a common ancestry both clans riding down from the distant northern steppes many generations ago with their skills subutais warriors would make a powerful addition to his future army there would be risks of course and plenty of problems but he felt sure he could manage it with a little luck hathor would help and he would make a fine leader of akkads horse fighters eskkar wrapped his blanket around him and closed his eyes horses and fighting men from the ur nammu trella would be pleased little more than a month after king shulgi took control of sumer enhedu stood with her hands on her hips looking about the crowded tavern full of happy patrons since their arrival in sumer both she and tammuz had worked hard but at last the kestrel tavern had settled into a satisfying routine irkalla and anu handed out the food and ale and serviced the customers those able and willing to pay for their special services the cook helped by enhedu and the girls made the evening stew while rimaud carried ale and anything else of bulk to the kestrel by day and kept the crowd under control at night with tammuzs reputation in the neighborhood established by knocking the three thieves unconscious and rimauds massive arms and shoulders not to mention the short sword he wore day and night only the very foolish or very drunk dared to make trouble guardsman jarud stopped by almost every night often with two or three of his men who either had done something well during the day or possibly just avoided their leaders ire he usually arrived well after sundown to enjoy a latenight cup of ale his presence helped convince the gangs who lurked in the marketplace and roamed the lanes at night that it made more sense to leave the kestrel and its new owners alone and concentrate on more vulnerable and less popular prey serving decent food and strong ale the kestrel soon earned a good reputation especially among those sailing or working on the riverboats and docks located only a few hundred paces away patrons could drink themselves senseless fall asleep on the floor and still find their purses not to mention their throats intact in the morning rimaud even accompanied an occasional sailor back to his boat at closing time or got them to the docks just after dawn tammuz and enhedu still labored from dawn to dusk each day everything and everyone had to be under someones watch lest problems arose even good customers would cheerfully take advantage of any lapse of the owners guard either by stealing ale or pilfering from another customer who might have drunk too much still people came to the kestrel to eat drink meet and talk with their friends or just to find a safe place to sleep at night that kept the little tavern open for business from dawn until well after dark enhedu and tammuz made sure that one or both of them were present to keep an eye on things at all times though they soon realized that rimaud could be trusted as well his gratitude for their concern showed on his broad face he made sure that neither the customers nor the staff could take advantage of the kestrels owners like any trade or craft the owners also had to exercise constant care to maintain a profitable business enhedu kept track of all the expenses and informed tammuz that in another month or two the kestrel would be turning a profit that was important not only because they had to earn their own bread but because an unprofitable inn that remained in business would attract suspicion and there were plenty of informers who dropped in to hear the latest talk on the river ready to take notice of anything out of the ordinary enhedu and her husband soon knew who they were their clumsy attempts to gather loose talk and draw information from the northern boatmen made many of the regular customers laugh enhedu was working alone one afternoon when a man entered the kestrel his eyes squinting into the shadowy interior not much light entered from the door or the roof hole and it was still too early in the day to start a fire he glanced around then went to a table and sat down the tavern was almost empty except for two drunks snoring their heads off in the corner tammuz and rimaud were out buying ale while the girls were trying to snatch some sleep in the tiny room that they shared with rimaud and those clients who were willing to pay extra enhedu reached the table sizing up the potential customer he looked like a man with a coin or two in his purse welcome to the kestrel ale costs one copper coin for two mugs or one cup and a loaf of bread it was always best to get the prices clear in the customers mind right away otherwise they would claim theyd been distracted and hadnt realized what things cost or they claimed to have forgotten which she could almost believe from some of the more ignorant farm workers especially after theyd drunk a few cups of ale by now enhedu had heard every trick and sad story a customer could come up with the man smiled reached into his tunic and pulled out a leather pouch that remained looped around his neck and to stay the night how much is that a customer with ready coins always received a smile and a softer tone for two copper coins you can have as much ale as you like with stew for supper and a place to sleep tonight that wasnt as generous as it sounded almost no one could drink more than three or four cups of the powerful brew one customer had downed six cups before passing out and cracking his head on a table he didnt wake up until nearly noon the next day a man with plenty of coin might also be interested in irkalla or anu especially after a few cups of ale enhedu would point this one out to irkalla the woman knew how to take advantage of such situations and sometimes ended up doing little more than bring the man into her chamber and put him to bed in the morning she would tell the confused customer how strong and virile he was two copper coins then the man said my name is malok i just arrived today from akkad enhedu showed no sign of recognition at the mans name lady trella had said they would be contacted by a man named malok the name was half the password if i were you i wouldnt be quick to tell people im from akkad travelers from that evil city are still not very welcome in sumer despite shulgis announcement of peace with his northern neighbor peoples feelings took a long time to change and offering that bit of advice meant nothing sumers spies kept watch on the docks and would take note of anyone from akkad even a lowly riverboat crewman i grew up here in sumeria malok said i only attend my master who travels up and down the river wherever the trading takes him well i hope youll return to the kestrel many times enhedu said she scooped up the two coins and went to the ale table pouring a generous amount into the wooden cup she carried it back to the table supper wont be ready until just before dark the cook hasnt even started the ale will do until then malok took a mouthful of ale and sighed with pleasure and you are my name is enhedu my husband tammuz and i own this place i knew an enhedu in my village where i grew up a place called ubaid you remind me of her enhedu laughed i am her malok i remember now there was a boy named malok son of grimald no grimald was my uncle tibor was my father they laughed at the seemingly chance encounter enhedu felt satisfied their little string of falsehoods agreed malok was the first messenger from annoksur the man who would deliver and carry messages back to akkad like any old friends reunited they spoke of ubaid and enhedu realized that malok was indeed familiar with the village hed probably gone there just as she and tammuz had done spending just enough time to blend in malok had chosen a good time to visit the kestrel that timing might not be by chance she decided a quick glance toward the snoring drunks reassured her they would sleep the remainder of the afternoon so whats happening now in sumer i hear you have a new king yes king shulgi son of eridu now rules here king shulgi is young but wise for his seasons unlike his father our new king wants only peace some evil people think he murdered his father that he wanted to seize control and to take his halfsister to his bed she laughed as she delivered the local gossip people always have to have something wicked to talk about but i heard him speak in the marketplace months ago when he took his fathers place and i say king shulgis wits are keen as are those of his new wife kushanna as if they were merely having a casual conversation enhedu told malok everything she and tammuz had learned by the time she stopped talking the ale in maloks cup was gone well at least there will be peace between sumer and akkad now yes there is much talk of peace enhedu put the slightest emphasis on the word talk one of the sleeping drunks might be awake and listening but the recruiters are still talking to every farmboy and goatherd that enters the city though most of the training camps around sumer have emptied one customer claimed they have been moved to the west near the edge of the great desert that seems strange malok said why so far from sumer the desert tribesmen are raiding the border again farms and small villages have been burned sumer has to protect its borders enhedu shrugged whatever the reason its bad for business to have so many men so far away as long as sumer wants peace who cares how many soldiers your king recruits or where he sends them perhaps meanwhile king shulgi is most active in consolidating his rule the other cities have not yet agreed to accept his leadership but i think they will in time king shulgi is governing wisely though the taxes remain high because the greedy barbarian king in akkad demanded so much in ransom for shulgis father malok took another sip of ale i know little of such things when warriors struggle against each other a poor boatman like myself must just grovel in the dirt on his stomach and hope neither side steps on him enhedu laughed at that well despite all that akkad can do to stop us sumer is too powerful and too strong to not take the lead of the southern cities people who travel up and down the rivers say that sumer is now the largest city in the world thats what they say in akkad but with akkads name instead of sumers malok said with a smile still peace is good for trade which means my master and his grasping boat captains will be pleased and good for the kestrel if all the men are at war then there is no one to drink and entertain my girls and our patron merchant gemama would still demand his profit every month no matter how many customers we had she wanted yavtar to know that gemama had decided to help them then ill have another cup of ale to drink to peace between our cities enhedu fetched it as she set it down she passed the final piece of information our new queen kushanna is very wise and very powerful she attends all the councils and the king seeks her advice on everything ill remember that enhedu of ubaid is she as beautiful as they say oh yes and a few seasons older than her new husband enhedu described kushanna in detail knowing that lady trella would want to know such things two men stepped into the room and one shouted for ale no need to shout enhedu said raising her own voice as loud as the newcomers i can see and hear you well enough she rose and smiled at malok enjoy your stay at the kestrel enhedu said nothing to malok for the rest of the evening and didnt even tell tammuz until they were in bed and she could whisper the words into his ear make sure you see him before he leaves in the morning so you can recognize him next time you think hell be back maybe theyll send someone else hes working on a riverboat now that trade has resumed boats will be moving up and down the tigris hell probably be here every fifteen or twenty days no one will be suspicious of a sailor spending an evening or two in a tavern i wish we could tell trella ourselves the messenger will be both loyal and discreet she will have seen to that now go to sleep husband he held her tight for a moment then let himself relax soon he fell asleep and enhedu could worry without disturbing him tammuz was right the most dangerous part of this enterprise was delivering the reports to the messenger if anyone suspected him or them a long and painful session in shulgis torture room would drag the truth out of even the strongest man or woman enhedu wondered what she would do if the hot irons were pressed against the most tender parts of her body she shivered best not to be taken alive she knew enhedu cleared her mind of problems instead she let herself enjoy the warmth and touch of tammuzs body against hers so different from that of her previous master her first owner had been brutal and cruel turning her into a helpless animal pleading to avoid his fists he had broken her nose at least once and shared her with his friends or anyone willing to pay for more ale enhedu cried every night and begged the gods for a quick death to release her word of her mistreatment had reached lady trellas ears and she and her guards arrived at the tannery owned by enhedus master to stop the beatings that had offended and embarrassed everyone living nearby with lady trella threatening to drive enhedus owner from the city he grudgingly accepted a decent price for his slave lady trella took the frightened and still crying girl by the hand and led her to a new life it took weeks for the pain and bruises to fade and for her wits to return as she regained her health and strength enhedu impressed lady trella in time she gave enhedu to tammuz as young and inexperienced as herself like two wounded chicks in a nest they found strength and comfort in each other together they blossomed into something stronger than either of them could have ever hoped for the crippled boy and the plain and ungainly girl fell in love with each other even as they spied for lady trella and they also managed to strike a blow against the usurper korthac killing several of his soldiers during the fighting with tammuzs quick reactions he had saved gatuss life as well now she and tammuz were two of trellas most important spies working in the heart of sumer if they were successful enhedu and tammuz would be greatly rewarded and they could live a life of ease in akkad to achieve that goal however would involve much danger lady trella had warned them of what would happen if they were discovered or betrayed death would be a mercy if they were unmasked that enhedu decided was not going to happen not if she had anything to say about it if not for herself then at least nothing must happen to tammuz forty days later shulgi and two hundred horsemen arrived at razreks camp located just before the river that marked the edge of the desert every man rode a sturdy horse wore a leather helmet and carried a good bronze sword the men in the camp ceased their tasks and watched the king and his sumerians arrival looking for lame or weary horses tired riders or signs of poor horsemanship skills no hint of any such weakness could be seen the competent riders sat comfortably on their horses appearing relaxed after a fiveday ride across sumerias southern lands under the fierce desert heat shulgi riding at the head of his cavalry ignored everyones gaze since taking over from razrek hed put these men through vigorous training working them and their horses from dawn to dusk shulgi started by placing vanar in charge between the two of them they soon identified the troublemakers and slackers two executions for disobedience one for desertion and the transfer of another ten or so men to razreks western desert force left shulgi with a solid core of horse fighters by that time they were loyal only to the king of sumer as it turned out shulgi didnt even have to increase their pay instead he just made sure their promised wages actually reached them as expected razrek had skimmed a portion each month since shulgi had no urge to possess gold himself he could give the men their due to the horsemen it made the long days easier to bear and the extra coins in their purses increased their respect and loyalty for their new king and his commanders since razreks departure the defeated horse fighters now under vanars command soon recovered the swagger lost in the battle with the akkadians now only a few months after eridus debacle men came to sumer each day eager to join the horse fighters already shulgi had another hundred or so men training outside the citys walls welcome my king razrek called out as shulgi halted his horse a powerful stallion almost sixteen hands high before razreks tent the men look fit yes my men are well enough shulgi placed just the slightest emphasis on the mention of his men but they need a real enemy to fight theyll find one here and soon enough then youve done well also has the leader of the tanukhs arrived shulgi handed off his horse and followed razrek into the tent no one stood out in the sun if it could be avoided kapturu rode in last night with fifty riders razrek filled two water cups and handed one to shulgi the rest of his men he claims he has over three hundred more are in a camp a few miles away but i doubt he has much more than half that number several of the tribes have refused to join the fight still with the men you brought today well have more than enough and once we loot a few villages more will join us good kapturu has taken enough of our gold in the last few months now its time both he and you earn some of it since i sent word to you in sumer ive added another fifty riders to the hundred i brought here my king the recruiting goes well considering what weve got to work with not all are well trained but they can ride and that should be enough for now if we only had more horses well get them from the salibs he counted the men available with those under razreks orders shulgi commanded over four hundred riders if this tanukh kapturu had half of what he claimed they could number close to six hundred horsemen more than enough to sweep through the desert villages when can we ride south the nearest salib encampment lay almost eighty miles south a twoday ride through the heat if kapturu agrees we can depart tomorrow my men are ready shulgi had no doubt that they were he had known razrek for almost three years and the man knew how to recruit men and lead them in battle razreks weaknesses were his lust for gold and his preference for relaxing in sumers alehouses as long as shulgi could keep razrek away from the citys temptations the sumerian would help build shulgis army a soldier entered the tent the leader of the tanukhs is coming commander they must have seen you riding in razrek said shulgi nodded to the guard tell vanar to join us and to bring the gift a few moments later they heard the sound of horses shulgi stepped outside the tent just as kapturu halted his horse a white stallion even bigger than shulgis a touch on the heels and a flick of the halter against its neck and the animal reared up its hooves flashing in the air before they plunged back to the earth with a spray of sand satisfied with his impressive entrance kapturu swung down from his mount with a swagger the tanukh leader tall and with a thick black beard patted his horse on the neck then glanced around his eyes resting on shulgi only in passing where is ah razrek the greetings of the desert to you my friend welcome chief kapturu mightiest leader of the brave tanukh clans razrek favored kapturu with a nearfawning bow before straightening up and smiling enter our tent weve wine and water inside before razrek could say anything more kapturu strode past shulgi almost brushing him aside as the tanukh entered the tent four of kapturus men either bodyguards or advisors shulgi couldnt decide followed their leader inside they too ignored shulgi who was left standing alone outside the tent vanar walked up pushing his way through the tanukh horsemen you sent for me lord shulgi he carried the gift under his arm yes shulgi took the bundle from his second in command order your men to approach as close to the tent as possible if theres any trouble with these tanukhs i want you to be ready then join me inside as quickly as you can without waiting for vanar to reply shulgi ducked into the tent the last of kapturus men had just taken a seat closing the ring that contained razrek and the tanukh leader seated face to face with a small open space between them this is king shulgi of sumer razrek announced already aware of the awkward situation that had developed everyone turned toward shulgi who smiled and stepped into the circle one of your men will have to wait outside chief kapturu shulgi gestured toward the man seated at razreks right i dont think theres room for all of us this boy is your king kapturus voice boomed throughout the tent and his words carried easily to those waiting beyond i thought he was one of your playthings all the tanukhs laughed including kapturu razrek tightened his lips concerned that things had gone badly and could go worse ive a gift for you chief kapturu shulgis words slowly ended the laughter he untied the cord fastening the bundle unwrapped the cloth and held up a gleaming bronze blade unlike the straight swords the sumerians carried this one had a curve that started a hands length from the tip where the blade widened as well would you like to see how well it strikes i can kill that one now if he doesnt get up from my place the laughter and smiles vanished shulgi stood in the center of the tent his head barely brushing the roof with a sword in his hand everyone else was seated even if they reached for their swords they would be at a disadvantage you dare to insult my men kapturus voice hardened the tent flap jostled again and vanar ducked inside he took one look at shulgi standing there sword in hand and instinctively dropped his left hand to clasp his scabbard ah vanar are your men outside how many did you summon yes my king two sections sixty men good shulgi turned to face kapturu sword now held high in both hands you might as well tell all your guards to leave shulgi decided that these tanukhs were mere bodyguards meant to impress the sumerians they wont be needed while we speak my men stay with me and i dont take orders from a sumerian boy who calls himself a king shulgi shrugged in resignation very well he whirled around striking as fast as any desert snake the blade swinging sideways narrowly missing razreks head before slicing deep into the neck of the tanukh seated beside him the blow came so fast that no one had time to react blood splattered everywhere the spray covering razrek without stopping after the killing stroke shulgi spun the blade around its bloody tip now a hands length from kapturus throat would you like a further demonstration chief kapturu stop kapturu directed the word not at shulgi but to the rest of his men who had started to draw their weapons seated on the ground kapturu knew hed be dead before anyone could strike a blow in his defense shulgis eyes flickered to vanar his commander remained in the tents opening blocking the entrance and no one outside could have seen what happened perhaps we should begin our meeting shulgi took a halfstep backwards then thrust the bloody blade deep into the sand as you can see this sword will take a mans head from his shoulders with ease the moment of truth had come if kapturu gave the order a death fight could break out within the tent to be matched by another outside shulgi dropped his left hand to his own scabbard the gesture telling everyone in the tent that he was as willing to fight as to talk kapturus smile had vanished jaw clenched he considered his options shulgi kept talking as much to relieve the tension as to give the tanukh time to reach the right decision after your men remove the body tell them to wait outside chief kapturu our discussion should be more private i think no one spoke either the tent would erupt in bloodshed or the tanukh leader would realize how vulnerable he was with vanar and his men outside and this boyking facing him the silence dragged out the tanukhs still not moving while kapturu worked out the implications suddenly he leaned back and laughed then clapped his hands on his knees yes it looks like a good blade perhaps one day i can give you a gift of equal value he turned to his men remove the body and wait outside kapturu smiled up at shulgi then we can begin our talk shulgi moved to stand beside razrek he stood there while kapturus three men rose and dragged the corpse of their companion out of the tent a babble of voices rose up outside as the tanukhs saw the body shulgi kept his face calm but he knew a moment of legend had come soldiers would talk about this story around the campfires for months even years how their leader had killed a tanukh who offended him how king shulgi defied the desertdwellers to strike back kushanna had known the importance of such moments she had urged him to seek out danger to prove to his men that he was worthy of their loyalty and respect to add to his reputation and downplay the fact of his youth just dont get yourself killed my husband she whispered in his ear killing his father had been one such moment shulgi knew but that had to remain an unspoken secret only hinted at by those who could guess the truth now this story would begin to expand his reputation and men would think twice before they dared to laugh at him or his youth at last only kapturu and razrek remained with shulgi in the now uncrowded tent the sword still remained in the tents center bloody sand crusted around the blade where it emerged from the ground lets us begin shulgi settled himself on the ground hitching his sword around until he found a comfortable position we have much to talk about chief kapturu together we can destroy our enemies loot their villages and take their women and horses he hadnt ridden from sumer to mince flattering words with any desert barbarian first well destroy the salibs and then well turn our attention to the north where the real wealth of the land between the rivers lies to make all that happen we need only to work together a few years a few battles and the desert and all it contains will be yours kapturu leaned forward no doubt already anticipating the wealth that would flow through his fingers he too knew how to speak directly then let us talk about the destruction of the salibs king shulgi i n sumer kushanna frowned at the man standing before her shuffling his weight from foot to foot gone just gone gone where yes my queen sohrab kept his eyes on the chambers floor i waited seven days in akkad but they never arrived they must have continued north probably by boat horses are scarce in akkad and almost none can be purchased at any price kushanna resisted the urge to have the man flogged it was not the fools fault for being the bringer of bad tidings the two spies shed dispatched to akkad had taken her gold and disappeared they might even have sold their story to trella earning a few more pieces of gold before running to the north trella would be laughing at the sumerians at kushanna if that were the case the traitors would stop laughing soon enough if ever they returned within the grasp of sumers guard and the other cities are our men in place there sohrab lifted his eyes grateful for a chance to present good news yes queen kushanna we have people in place in all the southern cities they are still settling in but already theyve provided useful news the most useful news of all would be the names of those who spoke out against sumers growing influence in the next few months that would prove more valuable than any news of akkads activities good kushanna leaned back in her chair sohrab would continue to stand in her presence at least until he learned to bring better news and what of razrek what have you learned about our brave horse commander sohrab met her eyes for the first time razrek is not his true name his birth name is sondar no one knows where he was born but he lived many years in a small village in the northeastern part of sumeria named carnax a prosperous but dreary place from all accounts bandits destroyed the village killing or enslaving its inhabitants only a few farmers live nearby now the rest remains in ruins and men say the land is accursed but our brave commander survived somehow more than survived my queen he glanced around as if concerned that someone might be listening one person claimed that sondar himself was involved in the villages destruction that he killed his master the village elder at any rate sondar survived and with plenty of gold he formed a band of horsemen and began plundering the countryside eventually your father king eridu took notice and persuaded sondar to change his ways and fight for sumer kushannas irritation at the mention of her fathers name almost made her miss something the name of the village carnax shed heard that name before it took her a moment but then she recalled the conversation one of the spies reporting on akkad had mentioned that lady trella as she preferred to be called rather than queen had come from a sumerian village named carnax she leaned forward and stared straight into the mans eyes what else do you know of razreks past kushanna dragged every bit of information she could extract from sohrab but he had little more to add at first shed been merely curious now she sensed something more useful might be gleaned i want you to discover everything you can about this village of carnax visit it yourself talk to those living nearby find out exactly what happened to the survivors if you can bring one or two of them here so i can question them myself sohrab had proved useful in finding things out but he lacked the skill to probe beneath the surface any information about trella would be useful if only to understand how shed gained her power over the men of akkad kushanna didnt believe in the priests or their gods and demons but witches existed everyone knew that some women could bend men to their will or call down spells to render them impotent more than a few in sumer had called her one too yes my queen im sure i can find a few survivors from carnax it was only four or five years ago that it was destroyed so many should know about it good and this time bring me back something useful when she dismissed sohrab kushanna moved from the table to the balcony she liked to sit and gaze out over the city her city already everyone obeyed her slightest wish and in the coming months and years her power would only increase shulgi desired only conquests and there would be years of fighting ahead of him leaving her more than enough time to solidify her grip on sumer and fighting could prove deadly even to shulgi after a few years if he fell in battle she could continue to rule in his name at least until she could sit another even more pliable man on the throne that brought a smile to her face shed already caught one of vanars commanders staring at her every time she passed kushanna had given him the slightest smile just enough to keep his interest like many others he was smitten by her beauty such a soldier would do well enough should she need another man at her side nevertheless she hoped shulgi survived the battles in the desert and the coming war with akkad at least survived until victory was assured then she knew anything could happen in her private chest hidden in the false bottom was a small box containing three different kinds of poisons any one of them their taste masked by strong wine would free her of her husbands company should he need to be removed for now shulgi worshipped her body and that gave her all the power she needed together theyd killed their foolish father and taken his city now the son and daughter would build sumer into an empire worthy of them both and she would be right at his side to whisper in his ear at night yes such thoughts brought a pleasant glow to her body shulgi rode her well long into the night leaving them both exhausted and satisfied shed allowed only a handful of men to enjoy her body and he was by far the most energetic kushanna looked forward to his return perhaps by then she would have learned all there was to know about lady trella possibly even enough to have her killed there was after all plenty of poison in the box midmorning had come and gone before eskkar arrived at the barracks his long strides forcing his guards to hurry to keep pace he hated being late especially over such a petty interruption as the one he had just left behind a dispute between two traders had escalated into a pushing and shoving match which brought them before nicar in his role as chief judge of akkad for once even nicars conciliatory skills had not managed to resolve the issue and both sides had demanded an appeal before the king after three years of settling many foolish disputes eskkar had learned to control his temper and keep his patience todays crisis however required him to keep from laughing the two men involved both prosperous merchants had practically come to blows over a prospective virgin bride the girls father had somehow managed to offer his daughter in marriage to both belligerents the man who first received the promise demanded the girl at the original and agreed upon price the second potential husband had entered the fray soon after offering more coins for the girl naturally the father had changed his mind as to his choice of suitors the men involved caught up with eskkar just as he departed the compound for the barracks and insisted on their case being heard right there in the lane while the two traders exchanged insults and threats the father demanded his right to sell his daughter to whomever he pleased and the girl alternated between sobbing at her embarrassment or shrieking at her father it seemed she preferred the first suitor but eskkar couldnt be sure his first thought which he decided to keep to himself was that whoever won the girl would be overpaying and getting a poor bargain by then the crowd included the families of the two prospective husbands the father of the girl involved and a few dozen onlookers as excited as if they were watching a wrestling match the onlookers voiced their own opinions calling out one or the others name each faction trying to outshout the other a few placed bets on the outcome at last eskkar made his ruling the girl was to go to the first suitor but the father was ordered to pay half the dowry to the second man because hed offered something for sale that he didnt have a clear violation of the marketplace rules howls arose over the harsh ruling but eskkar ignored that the next time a foolish dispute cropped up those seeking settlement might remember and accept the chief judges decision by the time everything resolved itself and eskkar could slip away the sun had moved high in the sky and no one appeared satisfied except perhaps the redfaced virgin and most of the onlookers who always enjoyed watching someone elses discomfort eskkars good mood had vanished into a black cloud of anger that showed itself on his usually calm face with grond at his side eskkar entered the training ground and strode to where gatus sat on his tall stool taking advantage of a sliver of shade cast by the barracks on the wall just behind gatus and his stool a charcoal outline of a man had been scratched into the mud a small table stood nearby two young men eskkar didnt recognize sat in the dirt beside gatus a few dozen paces away half a dozen skinny youths waited with barely suppressed excitement staring open mouthed at the king of akkad eskkar caught the look on gatuss face and knew the old soldier was tempted to remark about the lateness of the hour gatus resisted the urge probably only because there were so many young recruits around we were delayed by the chief justice gatus grond called out as they approached thereby avoiding eskkar having to say something that might sound like an apology no matter gatus slid off the stool and paused a moment to adjust his tunic at my age i need the rest anyway what have you got for me eskkar asked aware that his voice sounded harsh he took a deep breath no sense taking things out on gatus and these men older boys actually and probably too young to know what they were getting into ive found a few slingers for you gatus nodded his head toward the two young men beside him they scrambled to their feet as soon as they saw eskkar theyre ready to give you a demonstration eskkar appraised the two both wore ragged clothing tunics either too small or too large both patched and worn through in spots each had long and wiry arms neither man came up to eskkars shoulder in height and he guessed their age as about fifteen or sixteen seasons barely enough to be considered a man even in akkad gatus stretched his arm and pointed to the closest one this is nivar nivar had long brown hair tied back with a bit of leather shappa has fifteen seasons gatus said gesturing toward the other hes the older so ive put him in charge of nivar and the others for now theyre the first of your detachment of slingers if ever there is such a thing as for the rest of them he jerked his head toward the others standing nearby well see eskkar ignored gatuss remark in part because he knew the old soldier was as interested as eskkar in learning if slingers could play a part in akkads growing army nevertheless eskkar had proposed this idea and he didnt intend to change his mind now no matter how foolish it might turn out to be he studied the two slingers for a moment he was reminded of tammuz a skinny thief who had disobeyed orders taken a bow and killed an alur meriki warrior in the first battle to save the city another of trellas sayings came to mind if a thing is worth doing then do it as well as you can it was her idea after all to make use of tammuz and that had worked out well despite eskkars misgivings he walked over to the table and picked up one the slings eskkar hadnt touched one of these since his boyhood when hed used one to hunt rabbits and other small game for his mothers cooking pot this sling was longer with a shaped leather pouch at the end of two long strands of flaxen cords the cords he noticed were made of thinner plaited strands that felt supple to the touch one end of the cord ended in a small loop the other in a thick knot the pouch differed as well squareshaped but fastened at opposite corners the remaining points faced up and down it had a hole the thickness of his thumb in the center well nivar and shappa im glad gatus found you perhaps we can convince old gatus that slings can be as deadly as an arrow and even more useful in other ways the boys bowed and only shappa managed to mumble a greeting they were clearly in awe of eskkar who towered over them both in fact everyone appeared tense not sure what would be asked of them he decided to relieve the tension a bit did i ever tell you gatus about the time i was nearly killed by a slinger eskkar raised his voice so that everyone could hear the stone flew right past my ear and splintered against a cliff face he didnt add that it was a woman whod nearly split his head it would take a dozen stones to dent your head eskkar gatus said grond laughed while the boys standing close enough to hear gaped in shock at the rude jest directed at their king its true eskkar ignored the remark then another time i was on horseback and a man nearly unhorsed me with a sling hed almost said the word shepherd but decided that it didnt sound very impressive to admit hed almost been killed fighting a sheep herder over a band of foulsmelling sheep but you survived gatus said so the slingers stones didnt bother you too much no but they made me change my tactics and thats why i want to see what can be done with these men he turned to shappa show me what you can do shappa took the sling from eskkars hand and selected three slightly oval stones about the size of a fat walnut from a pouch at his waist the boy could scarcely control his excitement he slipped the middle finger of his right hand into the loop and grasped the knot of the other stand between thumb and forefinger he dropped a stone into the pouch and started walking away from the wall everyone moved with him leaving the wall empty two of the boys carried the table well to the side and gatus picked up his stool and took it with him shappa stopped about forty paces from the wall and looked at gatus go ahead he settled himself on the stool once again the slinger turned slightly away from the target with his left hand closest to the wall the pouch hung straight down from his hand with a snap of the wrist shappa spun the sling toward the ground stepping forward and extending his right arm as he released the cord a shower of mud showed where the stone impacted close to the center of the targets body for the first time eskkar noticed the many pock marks in the wall gatus must have had the boys practicing for some time eskkar frowned hed been unprepared for the swiftness of the throw and had missed what shappa had done again he ordered shappa picked up another projectile with all of eskkars attention focused this time as the stone fell into the pouch he understood the reason for the hole in the center to give the pouch a better grip on the projectile making it less likely to slip out during the rotation odd that hed never thought of that as a child nor had anyone else in the clan this time the slinger whipped the sling around twice releasing the stone before the second whirl had been completed again stepping forward with an overhand throwing motion with another spray of mud fragments the second stone landed just below the gouge the first had made two good casts eskkar decided but nothing that he couldnt have duplicated with a bow he pushed that thought from his mind comparing bowmen to slingers made no sense he didnt intend to use slingers as bowmen these boys werent strong enough and the bows and arrows his archers required took plenty of gold to construct and the men months to train no one said anything but every eye was fixed on eskkar he looked at gatus but the man had occupied himself cleaning a fingernail eskkar turned back to shappa how fast can you make a throw shappa moved toward nivar who had brought a handful of stones with him the slinger selected three stones and then stepped back to his original position he dropped the first stone in the sling and this time he turned to eskkar begin again eskkar focused his attention on the slinger the sling swung round the stone released at the top of the swing as the pouch descended the release strap flying through the air shappa extended his left hand a stone held in his fingers the stillwhirling pouch closed over the second stone the trailing release strap swung back to the slingers right hand he caught the knot and applied another powerful spin to the sling the second stone was launched toward the target while shappas left hand extended once again into the pouchs path the third stone soon flew on its way eskkar realized his mouth was open and closed it hed never seen anything like that before still didnt believe what his eyes had just told him in fact if anyone boasted they could reload a pouch like that he would have thought him a liar eskkar guessed that the three stones had been launched before a man could count to five even mitrac and his arrows couldnt match that speed but of course the arrows flight had much greater range or did it how far can you cast such a stone with a good chance of a hit king eskkar about seventyfive paces shappa answered looking more confident now that hed proved his skill but with smaller stones ive hit targets at double that distance that matched the distances an akkadian archer had to hit his targets three out of four at seventyfive paces and two out of five at one hundred and fifty mitrac and some of the other master bowmen could hit targets at over four hundred paces something else eskkar once wouldnt have believed if he hadnt seen it for himself can you do better can the range of throws be extended no my lord not easily the stones vary in weight and shape too much to make a perfect cast each time do it again eskkar said and this time do it slower and explain what youre doing at every step he made the boy do it twice more until eskkar felt certain he understood the process then he turned to nivar let me see what you can do underhand nivar gatus called out still sitting on his stool nivar stepped forward and took shappas place where the first slinger had shown a calm demeanor nivar could scarcely conceal his excitement the stone slipped from his fingers when he tried to drop it into the pouch to eskkars surprise not one of the onlookers laughed everyone kept silent except gatus who scratched his beard noisily nivar faced the target his body turned slightly to the side in the same position as shappa this time the sling swung the opposite way but the projectile flung itself forward almost as quickly when the stone struck the target it was still traveling at an upwards angle a good shot and just as much mud had blasted off the wall again eskkar ordered his eyes narrowed as they watched every movement determined to miss nothing of the process another throw the underhand motion similar to the way eskkar had skipped stones across a pond in his youth this time the missile struck in the targets head no doubt a few more paces back and it would have missed the target a good throw nivar eskkar wanted to encourage the boy how fast can you throw three stones nivar tried to duplicate shappa quick reload but the second stone missed the target and the third failed to stay in the pouch im sorry lord eskkar the embarrassment in nivars voice was plain to all i only learned shappas way of reloading a few days ago which method will cast the stone farther eskkar asked at the same time he motioned to shappa to give him the sling there seems to be a difference of opinion about that gatus said a lot depends on the individual slinger of course but it seems to me that the underhand method will throw the stone farther but perhaps not with the same force better a stone falls on the rear ranks than in the dirt eskkar remarked modifying the archers old adage by now hed fitted the sling to his finger and dropped a stone in the pouch he whirled the sling turning it over again and again until he thought he knew when to release it imitating the two slingers he stepped forward as he let it fly the stone sailed right over the barracks and landed somewhere out of sight but not out of hearing a loud voice began cursing the fool who threw stones in the air eskkar had to force himself not to smile he didnt mind looking foolish not as long as he could master the skill again and again he threw five ten up to twenty stones at first he took two revolutions for each throw but soon learned to launch the projectile with a single spin a second revolution added little to the force of the stone eskkars results ranged all over the barracks wall the dirt between and the sky above but by the twentieth stone hed slipped into what had to be the proper rhythm stepping forward and throwing his arm directly at the target he grunted in satisfaction when he struck the target twice in succession by then sweat covered his face and bare chest the task seemed simple enough but he realized you had to concentrate on what you were doing no doubt over time the skill of each slinger and the individual steps would merge into a smooth motion that required little thought just like an archer when you mastered your craft you scarcely needed to aim the weapon but not on the first day or the second he looked around and found gatus had gone leaving eskkar and grond alone with the recruits gatus might have rounded up the boys but it was the king who conceived their use and it should be the king to whom they gave their loyalty all right i want to see every man throw line them up shappa nivar get some boys and collect the stones grond helped out making sure the now excited boys stayed at their place in the line eskkar told them to start with the more usual overhand throw there would be plenty of time for practicing with the underhand toss one by one the boys demonstrated their skill soon stones were flying all over the barracks area and grond had to clear everyone out of possible danger that included anyone to their rear as some boys in their haste sent rocks whirling behind them into the dirt at their feet or straight up into the air with everyone dodging the missiles return to earth eskkar took several more turns with shappas sling which he decided he preferred after trying a few of the others everyone wanted to demonstrate his skill and as the boys grew accustomed to eskkars presence their nerves steadied their voices rose and the ability to strike the target improved not that he cared much about an individuals expertise eskkar wanted to see how effective a group of slingers could be working with five at a time he had them rain stones on the abused barracks wall which soon looked like it was in danger of crumbling back to the mud he still had trouble imagining the force with which the stones landed any enemy struck in the head would be going down even if he happened to be wearing a helmet hits on arms and legs would be painful and slow a fighter down probably taking him out of the battle the sun moved across the sky but eskkar never noticed midday came and went and he kept the boys at it are you enjoying yourself eskkar he turned to see trella standing behind him annoksur at her side trella must have been there for some time her usual four bodyguards accompanied her all of them watching the performance trella held a basket in her arms the smell of fresh bread made him realize how hungry he felt and that hed promised trella he would return to the house at midday to join her a glance at the sky told him that it was closer to midafternoon than noon trella im sorry she laughed and touched his arm i havent seen you this excited in a long time all of you playing like children he wiped the sweat from his brow did you see them make throws some are good others he took her arm and guided her more to the side where they might be safer from an errant throw since you missed your meal i brought you and grond some bread she handed a loaf to each of them eskkar tore a hunk of bread from the loaf and took a bite we forgot to eat were were having too much fun that wall is going to collapse soon the whole barracks may come down these stones when they land they could smash a mans ribs knock him off his feet theyre hot to the touch after they strike the wall i wonder why i dont know husband let me think about it does it matter no what matters is that a good slinger can cast stones very quickly and with good distance and accuracy he finished another mouth of bread these boys are too small and weak to make good swordsmen or archers or spearmen but they can still kill if theyre used right he glanced around feeling guilty for having the bread when the others had none a few boys were still slinging stones at the wall but most of the others sat on the ground taking a rest watching the king and queen enough slinging eskkars voice caught everyones attention come here and sit down the boys moved closer to where eskkar trella and grond stood most of them had never seen lady trella since she seldom left the house and its grounds of course they all knew the stories told about her and curiosity had them staring at her with their mouths open some forgot their manners and stared in the way of young boys at the nipples pushing up against her dress eskkar bunched them closer so that he could see their faces each looked tired covered with sweat and full of excitement some still talking about what they had done the moment eskkar started speaking they quieted down each of you came here today because you wanted to fight akkads enemies eskkar let his eyes meet each and every face to be an archer or spearman or swordsman requires both great strength and size all of you would be turned away if you tried to join those ranks i wasnt sure that a sling could be effective in a real battle but today youve proven to me that men of smaller stature can fight and kill as well as any bowman or spearcarrier ive seen that in your hands slings can be a deadly weapon and soon akkad will need all the weapons and men it can find those of you who want to fight our enemies will be given the chance if you do not want to fight then you should leave now he waited a moment giving them time to consider but of course not a boy moved all of them were caught up in the moment right now they would do anything and everything he asked of them if you stay youll have a safe place to sleep and enough food to eat both those were important half of them looked as if they hadnt eaten in days youll even be paid first as a recruit then after you master your skills as a soldier in return youll work hard and train every day in time the best of you will train the others for now shappa and nivar will take charge of your training for as long as they show themselves worthy food shelter and an occasional copper coin would be more than most of them had ever had or expected every upturned face shone with happiness and pride when the time comes to fight youll be assigned to where youll do the most good but i promise you that akkads bowmen and fighters will be at your side to make sure you do not stand alone are you with me they all shouted at once speaking so quickly eskkar couldnt be sure of what anyone said it didnt matter they would join they would train they would fight many of them he knew would die but that didnt matter now either he turned to trella she nodded and he knew hed done well binding more recruits to his side shappa take your men to gatus tell him to find quarters for you and that youll start training in the morning no doubt gatus was expecting them he would have understood the implications of the sling at once yes lord eskkar and the first thing youll do is make some real targets and repair that wall before it falls down that made them laugh eskkar grinned too he placed his arm around trellas shoulders and led the way back to their house their guards falling in behind and in front that night a weary eskkar lay back in bed trella curled up against his side their lovemaking relaxed him almost as if hed fought and conquered a real enemy today my arm is sore trella started to shift her position but he held her tight no not that arm my throwing arm and my fingers are still swollen i cant believe how difficult it was to sling those stones how much force it took do you really think slingers can help the soldiers they looked so small so young oh yes ill find good use for them everyone sees the sling and thinks of it as a childs weapon or something for shepherds to frighten off wolves but those stones can kill akkad is full of boys and young men all eager to join akkads army and fight akkads enemies theyll cost almost nothing to arm and supply and they might prove very useful in certain kinds of fighting now all i have to do is make sure that when we face akkads enemies the slingers have a role to play and possibly even a chance to survive you think most of them will be killed no not most but many if they come against swordsmen or archers theyll be cut to pieces but theyre young small and quick and that can sometimes keep a man alive when brute strength isnt enough it all depends on how we use them in battle what kind of fighting the question held more than idle curiosity everything interested trella and every time she bent her will to a task she found a way to improve it well first of all i think they could be very useful in hilly country places where a horse cant go places where sword or spearfighters have trouble traversing slingers could harry an enemy from above they could also act as scouts or rearguards to keep enemy horsemen at bay wouldnt horsemen just ride them down everyone thinks so but im not so sure he shifted in the bed to face her these boys are small and quick i think they could get out of the way of a charging horse dodge the riders sword if they carried knives knives with very sharp blades they could hamstring the horse as it went by ive seen that done before the knife would need to be longer than most wouldnt a curved blade be more effective for such a task all knives and short swords were straight some long swords were cast with a slight curve to them but eskkar distrusted them it made the blade heavier without increasing the length and favored a slashing cut rather than a thrust sometimes that would be more useful especially on horseback but hed fought with a straight blade all his life and didnt intend to change now for men on foot he said almost thinking out loud a curved blade would be better it would cut deeper and across a greater length of flesh or muscle he pictured the scene in his mind if we armed the slingers with curved blades and taught them how to strike at the horses rear legs im sure they could bring horse and rider down since the weapon wouldnt be used as a sword trella said it need not be as heavy just very sharp and strong enough to slice through flesh he hadnt thought of that a sword needed to be thick enough to block or deflect an enemys stroke a man on foot scrambling around and dodging a horses hooves didnt have that to worry about no knife no matter how thick would stop or even deflect a sword swung with full force from a moving horse thats true we dont want to weigh the slinger down with anything heavy hell be carrying a load of stones with him as it is so theres no need to give him something else heavy to lug around they might have special tunics ones with many strong pockets sewn into them that would spread the weight over their bodies and make it easier to move about a thick belt would be useful too he added they could fasten a pouch of stones to it then cut it free if they needed to move quickly she laughed and kissed his neck then arched her body and let her breast fall across his chest youve gotten yourself a new force of fighters but now its time to sleep well talk more about this in the morning and in the next few weeks im sure we can find ways to improve their effectiveness after all you turned villagers into bowmen why not boys into slingers he pulled her close why not im sure youll think of something special for them eskkar knew his wife too well to ask her what she might possibly do if she put her mind to a task then something was sure to happen he kissed the top of her head then theyre in good hands with you worrying about their lives they drifted off to sleep secure in each others arms thoughts of war and battle set aside for the rest of the night ten days after the messenger from akkad departed two men stopped before the entrance to the kestrel late in the afternoon tammuz and enhedu had just finished enjoying the shade outside the taverns door the kestrel had been open for business for more than a month and a steady routine had established itself the mornings kept them busy serving bread and ale to anyone who stopped by or who had slept over that meant rising with the dawn to keep an eye on the customers still sleeping on the floor or those who might have availed themselves of irkalla and anu the ale had to be watched of course at all times and it wasnt unheard of for customers to rob those still sleeping then depart when the last of the patrons left the inn preparations began for another days activity the common room had to be cleaned each morning a man whod drunk too much ale seldom bothered to step out into the lane to relieve himself in the middle of the night even assuming he could get rimaud to open the door while the cleanup went on ale and provisions needed to be purchased but most of the days preparation ended well before midday at noon tammuz and enhedu often carried a bench outside the kestrel they took time to relax and watch the people passing by in the lane while they shared a loaf of bread and a cup of weak ale afterwards they would take turns getting some sleep late in the afternoon found tammuz seated on his stool behind the ale table he took one look at the two men standing before the entrance and frowned one was a bodyguard complete with sword and a sack he carried over one shoulder the other wore the sash that proclaimed him a member of king shulgis officials this is the new tavern the kestrel a stupid question since an image of the bird was directly behind tammuzs head not to mention the one outside next to the door he rose from the bench yes master do you need a place to stay the man snorted in annoyance i wouldnt waste my time in a filthy place such as this i am king shulgis collector of taxes fetch the owner that was unfair tammuz thought they kept the kestrel cleaner than most taverns in sumer i am the owner my wife and i enhedu stepped from their bedroom but the tax man didnt bother to acknowledge her presence your tax is due three silver coins if you cant pay your tavern will be closed and your goods confiscated merchant gemama told us that the tax would be two silver coins enhedu said moving beside her husband the tax for a tavern used to be two silvers now its three well pay two tammuz said the tax collector could easily be trying to take advantage of them collecting three coins and turning in only two thats what merchant gemama told us we had to pay the tax collector tightened his lips king shulgi announced the new tax ten days ago when he spoke in the marketplace a small crowd of the always curious had gathered just outside the door to watch the little drama one of the bystanders called out its true the tax was raised to three silvers tammuz turned to enhedu dismay on his face that will take more than weve earned she shrugged what can we do well have to pay it the king doesnt care about your profits innkeeper now pay up or the tavern is closed ill fetch it enhedu went inside and a few moments later returned the taxman held out his hand enhedu held her fist to her chest i want a stone first to show that weve paid a small clay shard marked with the kings sign a different one starting with each new moon provided proof that the tax had been paid not very trusting are you the mans sarcasm was wasted on her all right he dug into the bodyguards pouch and handed over the redbaked clay marker enhedu examined it then handed him the tax without a word the man turned and left the tavern tammuz and enhedu followed him to the door and watched him walk down the lane heading to the next place of business with nothing to see the crowd dissolved and tammuz and enhedu stepped back inside the kestrel wait another man followed them in tammuz recognized melchior gemamas clerk he muttered another oath under his breath merchant gemamas fee is due today one silver coin do you have it melchiors voice grated in tammuzs ears gemamas clerk spoke as if he expected them to plead some excuse or ask for a delay yes i have it he nodded to enhedu once again she handed over the coin make sure your master gets it tammuz warned we wont be paying twice after a quick inspection to make sure the coin was sound melchior placed the coin in his pouch and let it slip inside his tunic he too left without another word there go our profits for the month enhedu said she lowered her voice if we had to earn that from the kestrel wed starve no wed dilute the wine and ale serve bad food and steal from our customers like every other innkeeper in sumer still were going to need more copper coming into the inn she said who knows perhaps the tax will be raised again in a month or two maybe it is time to start using zenobias teachings the owner of akkads finest pleasure house had taught enhedu the secret skill of massage the hidden pressure points on a body that would respond favorably to a knowing touch enhedu had mastered the teaching learning quickly and with her strong hands and powerful arms she could push and prod and knead as well as any man tammuz didnt care for this part of the plan at all he didnt like the idea of enhedu touching other women not to mention men there would always be requests for more intimate services from both sexes she saw his frown dont worry husband ill take care i promise he took a deep breath and put his arm around her i know but i still another man entered the tavern this one glanced around and seemed happy to find the inn still empty what do you want bad tidings always arrived in threes tammuz knew the man was no customer he looked too well fed and the long knife in his belt didnt go well with the rundown clothing i want to talk to the owner is that you tammuz yes im tammuz and this is my wife enhedu we own the kestrel who are you the man smiled then sat at the nearest table and motioned for them to join him tammuz eased himself down onto the bench facing the man while enhedu stood just behind him i spoke to guardsman jarud he says you can be trusted tammuz said nothing still waiting for the man to give his name he took the hint my name is enar he paused as if he had just imparted a great secret jarud says that many of your customers are river men some of them from up north the kestrel is close to the docks tammuz said who else but boatmen would come here can your wife be trusted to keep her mouth shut my wife speaks only when shes told to tammuz said mmm a good woman then she may be useful too an innkeeper and his wife hear many things from their customers especially when the customers have drunk too much ale when you hear such things that may be of interest i would like to know them you would of course be paid for what you tell me provided it is useful what kinds of things oh anything of importance things that might be of some use to sumers rulers any talk about unrest people complaining about the kings rule gossip about akkad even information about trade and cargoes boats caravans anything of interest tammuz and enhedu had heard rumors that the new queen kushanna wanted as much information as possible about the six cities in sumeria as well as the far north enar would be one of her informers seeking such information from any source he could find he glanced at his wife who nodded how much would you pay at least a copper coin for anything of value more if it is especially useful much more if what you hear is of real importance such as anyone plotting against the king the kestrel is a good tavern tammuz said but not good enough for most ship captains or boat masters all that come here are the crewmen the rowers and some guards i know who patronizes this place ive been here before you must not remember me tammuz didnt which annoyed him he should be alert enough to recognize a sumerian spy how would i get such information to you i stay at the white gull if im not there you can leave a message with the owner tammuz nodded ill keep my ears open if i hear anything another thing you might want to encourage some of your more interesting customers to talk slip them a little extra ale if need be your wife your whores the more you can get your patrons to talk about home especially those from akkad and upriver the better we can do that enhedu said joining the conversation for the first time as long as you pay each time a brief frown crossed enars face at her impertinence women should speak only when spoken to ill pay when you tell me something useful he returned his eyes to tammuz best if you didnt say anything about this to anyone else nor to jarud even those who live here in sumer might need to be reported should they say anything against king shulgis interest that includes members of the citys guard i understand well then ill be on my way your first customers should be arriving soon enar stood nodded approvingly and left the tavern enhedu sat down beside tammuz at least he didnt demand a silver coin from us who knows but we may be able to make a few extra coins this way it does only seem fair with what were paying in taxes and fees to get something back they laughed at the idea of spying for sumer t he next day enhedu gave massages to irkalla and anu both women worked hard and enhedu knew they would appreciate a little attention mother and daughter kept the kitchen common room and their own chamber clean they started working early in the day before the first customer arrived and then sometimes labored until tammuz fastened the door and even after some customers wanted servicing long into the night and again in the morning as the kestrel grew more and more popular the number of customers increased and irkalla and anu rushed back and forth carrying food and ale in addition to occasionally disappearing into their chamber with a patron for a time usually as brief an interval as the girls could manage giving the mother and daughter a massage helped enhedu who needed the practice aside from tammuz she hadnt given anyone a massage since they left akkad she started with irkalla who had never received a massage before this early in the day there were no customers in the kestrel anu covered a table in the common room with a folded blanket and enhedu told irkalla to remove her dress and lie face down on the blanket with anu watching enhedu began working the womans neck and shoulder muscles a few drops of oil helped warm irkallas skin and soon enhedu moved down to the lower back by then irkalla sighed with pleasure as the stiffness in her body faded and the muscles stretched without straining by the time enhedu had finished anu showing more excitement on her face than enhedu had ever seen pleaded for a similar rubdown hopping up and down in her eagerness please mistress anu said my back has been hurting for days enhedu smiled at the girl give me a few moments to rest while irkalla dressed anu removed her garment and moved up onto the table as enhedu began she saw that the girls back really did need work the muscles in her right shoulder were knotted now that she noticed it enhedu realized why the girl sometimes had trouble standing up straight you are very stiff anu we shall have to do this every day for awhile until your back is straight shadows blocked the door and enhedu glanced up to see tammuz and rimaud returning the guard carried a wineskin under each arm and tammuz had a third one slung over his shoulder tammuzs mouth opened in surprise at finding his wife working on a naked anu who moaned and sighed at each touch of enhedu hands she smiled at her husband who stood there fascinated enhedu saw his eyes fasten their gaze on anus body and a moment later she caught sight of his erection pushing up against his tunic almost finished she said to tammuz then you can take anus place its time we took care of you tammuz blushed which made irkalla laugh enhedu moved her hands lower down on anus back and began squeezing the globes of her buttocks enhedu slipped her hand between the girls legs and found her secret place wet and aroused anu moaned again at the touch and opened her legs wider in invitation enough for today enhedu said giving the girl a friendly slap on the buttocks now its your turn tammuz i think the three of us should be able to satisfy you before her stillblushing husband could protest she took his hand and guided him to the table enhedu helped him remove his tunic and then she undid his undergarment letting it drop to the floor with irkallas assistance she eased tammuz onto the table on his back his unfettered erection throbbed in the air so big irkalla said brushing the member with her fingers he must give you much pleasure oh yes it feels so good inside me shall i relieve him for you irkalla asked or anu no his rod is mine alone enhedu said but you can use your mouth to satisfy him while anu and i will keep his hands and lips busy she slid her tunic down off her shoulders and moved up onto the table letting her breast brush against tammuzs mouth in a moment anu moved to the other side and did the same at the same time irkalla knelt on the blanket between his legs and took his staff into her mouth tammuzs hands went to the womens breasts and he cupped and squeezed them even as anu shifted her body so that her left breast brushed his face except for the training with teara before they left akkad tammuz had never had such an experience soon he was groaning and writhing in pleasure as irkallas skilled mouth tongue and hands brought him to a massive explosion of seed into her mouth she gagged a little as he came but she never stopped moving her head up and down draining every drop from his rod while he clutched at anus breasts in his passion enhedu reached down and kissed him i hope you enjoyed yourself husband next time well spend more time pleasuring you dazed tammuz struggled to sit up all the women had smiles on their faces his penis might have emptied itself but it remained hard enhedu knew it wouldnt take much effort to arouse him again she realized that rimaud had watched the whole thing he still stood there his mouth gaping open as his eyes went from one to the other i think you should put your dress back on anu enhedu said the customers will be arriving soon we wouldnt want them to think they should get the same service would we t he next morning enhedu gave rimaud a long and vigorous massage that left the big man gasping for breath and scarcely able to stand but the day after that the pain in his leg lessened and he pleaded with enhedu for another even offering to pay her after speaking with tammuz she decided to give him one every other day with no charge that would help relieve his pain and by not charging him for the service it would make him even more loyal the cook became enhedus next patient like many other women who performed hard labor all day long she had lived with back trouble for years and the massages brought the first relief she had ever known the womans gratitude was even more embarrassing than rimauds she soon spread the word throughout the neighborhood telling everyone at the market and along the river where the women went to wash their garments of enhedus wonderful talent word of enhedus skill with her hands soon spread except for the wealthy nearly everyone worked long hours and many earned their bread and a place to stay by carrying heavy loads on their backs women who lifted more than their share of bales and bundles soon began appearing at the kestrel seeking to speak with enhedu and asking in halting words and nervous voices if they could have a massage enhedu charged each one a copper coin but most women could not afford to pay for such a luxury instead they bartered their services or other goods to pay for each massage soon enhedu had chickens rabbits bread fruit cloth garments and dozens of other items being traded for her skill enhedu and tammuzs sandals worn down from the long walk from ubaid were repaired for free the local carpenter across from the kestrel and the leather worker down the lane started spending time on enhedus table and paying for the service by doing work around the inn the carpenter made her a narrow table to facilitate the massage as well as some new tables and benches for the inn and the tanner provided straps to repair the sagging bed and replace the door hinges another customer provided cloth and rope to create some privacy for a corner of the common room so that the women could remove their garments without worrying about the customers gawking at first a few grinning patrons tried to peek behind the curtain nonetheless but rimaud took care of that problem by tossing them out into the lane all this work took time away from running the kestrel but thankfully a normal routine had settled in enhedu and tammuz gave irkalla more responsibility and increased her wage to compensate the inn now filled up almost every night so they added another one of the cooks daughters to help prepare meals beside the basic stew almost every night meat was served depending on what enhedus customers brought in barter that day two months after enhedu gave her first massage she found herself working almost full time doing five or six people a day some of the customers who stopped in after a hard days labor decided they would rather have a massage than two cups of ale more customers flocked to the kestrel to take advantage of her expertise many of course wanted extra servicing afterwards but irkalla and anu took care of that part of the business a few quick strokes from their strong hands soon satisfied the relaxed customer as word of her success spread through the city some of the other taverns began offering the same service but these were generally mere serving girls who specialized in a more personal massage they lacked enhedus special skills and those in pain or suffering stiffness continued to patronize the kestrel enhedu came to enjoy the work with practice her arms and hands had grown stronger and she no longer exhausted herself by a long days work shed also learned to examine each back and vary her efforts those who really had knotted muscles received the full massage but those who merely wanted to relax or loosen up their backs were easily satisfied with a different routine that required less effort tammuz changed his mind about her work he saw the gratitude in the eyes of those she helped besides everyone praised his wifes skill which helped improve his own standing in the neighborhood best of all and despite all the extra customers the kestrel operated so smoothly that it required less work on their part by now they often forgot the real purpose of their being there one day just before midmorning two men entered the kestrel one was dressed in a clean garment fine sandals and wore an intricately stitched belt around his waist the other had the size and weight of a bodyguard and carried a sword hanging from his belt is this the kestrel tavern is there a woman name enhedu working here tammuz had grown so accustomed to the first question that he no longer bothered to point out the painted bird next to the inns door which in his trusting way hed thought even a fool of a city dweller should be able to recognize yes enhedu is my wife my mistress has need of her services and you are the man seemed insulted that tammuz didnt recognize him i am joratta steward to the house of puzuramurri my mistress ninlil is his second wife she desires that the woman enhedu attend to her right away tammuz glanced at enhedu who entered the common room from their private quarters wiping her hands on her dress hed heard of puzuramurri one of the richest traders in sumer rumored even more wealthy than gemama but had never seen him or any of his wives and knew even less about them my wifes services cost one copper coin that is for my mistress ninlil to decide after the massage well where is she tammuz knew the answer to that question before he asked it tell her to come in the servant looked shocked at the suggestion that his mistress would enter a common alehouse the servant enhedu is to come to puzuramurris house and right now thats a long walk from here all the way across sumer my wife has work enough to keep her busy right here id have to charge you two coppers and you would have to escort her back here that much was true enough though he trusted enhedus ability to take care of herself he didnt want her walking around unescorted in a strange part of sumer where she might not be as well known lone women could be easily assaulted or even taken away it had happened before my mistress will decide that joratta repeated she cant go right now tammuz said theres work to be done here maybe later in the morning my mistress is needs her services at once right away joratta glanced at the bodyguard the man stepped forward moving past joratta until he was right in tammuzs face shes to come with us now cripple or do you want your good arm broken he leaned closer and reached out to poke tammuz in the chest tammuz caught the mans wrist in his right hand and jerked him forward in the same motion he shifted to the side and extended his leg the bodyguard went crashing to the floor and before he could react tammuz had his knee on his chest and his knife at his throat touch me again call me a cripple again and ill kill you he emphasized his meaning by jabbing the tip of the knife into the guards neck a trickle of blood appeared and the mans eyes widened in fear a sword rasped from a sheath and joratta still in shock at the sudden movement turned to see rimaud limping toward him the short blade carried menacingly in his hand wait stop joratta raised his hands he couldnt conceal the fear in his voice dont do anything foolish theres no need for violence tammuz regained his feet in a smooth motion and slipped the knife back in his belt next time keep your bodyguard out in the lane where he belongs joratta pulled the shaken bodyguard to his feet and pushed him out the door husband i can go now with joratta enhedus voice was properly subservient a dutiful wife trying to mollify a gruff husband my other client can wait until i return tammuz frowned at her for a moment as if making up his mind well then go remember to come back with two copper coins ill get my oils enhedu said bowing to joratta tammuz followed her back into their quarters and gave her a quick hug good luck to you and take care around joratta and the guard theyll be angry enough you did well husband ill try and soothe jorattas feelings on the way and the guards she left the chamber and the inn tammuz followed her to the doorway and watched the three of them disappear up the lane this was what lady trella had hoped for planned for a chance to move into the inner circle of sumers elite now he just had to hope he hadnt played his role too strongly enhedu did soothe jorattas feelings on the walk back to his masters house and even the bodyguard stopped glaring at her servants and slaves of powerful families often became as arrogant as their masters and expected everyone to obey their slightest command nevertheless enhedu felt worried that perhaps tammuz had angered the servant so much that he would convince his mistress never to summon her again the house of puzuramurri was an imposing twostory residence in the most fashionable of sumers quarters not far from king shulgis compound it lacked a walled courtyard to separate it from the lane but competent workmen had plastered the front of the house and painted it a light blue the doorway taller than a man and wide enough to allow two men to walk in abreast announced its owners wealth and position enhedu saw that a servant stood watch outside the door opening it for expected guests and making sure no one in the lanes used the walls of the puzuramurri home to relieve themselves inside enhedu found herself in a large chamber that seemed to have no purpose an opening that reached up through the second floor allowed light and fresh air to enter the room benches faced each other from the side walls and two doorways led to the interior of the house the chamber provided a place out of the heat for clients to wait until master puzuramurri deigned to meet them a real extravagance she decided those wishing to visit his wives would also remain here until summoned wait here joratta ordered he disappeared through the door on the right enhedu had expected to be brought to the wife ninlil right away but apparently whatever urgency dispatched the servant had vanished after awhile enhedu set her basket of oils on the bench and sat beside it the oddshaped shadow caused by the sun moved slowly across the floor once a man came out of the second door but he didnt even bother to glance in her direction as he left the house at last joratta returned come with me be respectful to mistress ninlil and do as she asks he led the way through the other door down an impressively wide passageway until he reached another chamber a carved door stood open but joratta knocked anyway a listless voice bade him enter mistress the woman enhedu is here enhedu timidly followed him into the room a bedroom larger than anything she had ever seen in akkad even in the house of lady trella greeted her eyes a narrow window looked out into a courtyard that faced the rear of the house a table rested near the window flanked by two carved chairs three chests lined the opposite wall and enhedu wondered how anyone could have so many possessions as to need that many the remainder of the room was taken up by the largest bed enhedu had ever seen the merchant puzuramurri must have plenty of wealth to lavish so much of it on a mere second wife ninlil reclined on the bed her head propped up by two cushions a loose garment dyed light brown covered her breasts but her shoulders were bare she spared enhedu a quick glance and wrinkled her mouth in distaste shes filthy i wont have her dirty hands on me are you sure shes the one yes mistress enhedu of the kestrel inn can you give a good massage woman enhedu bowed low yes mistress she let a quaver slip into her voice ninlil expected to be feared and obeyed oomara says you helped her slave shed injured her back and she claimed you cured it i am not a healer mistress only a giver of massages many times it can help ease the pain in a persons back ninlil pondered her choices for a moment clean her up joratta scrub the dirt off her if you have to she closed her eyes and let her head fall back on the cushion joratta took enhedus arm come with me he said his voice almost a whisper as if he did not want to wake his mistress enhedu followed him through the door and into the passage turning this time in the opposite direction until they reached the rear of the house he guided her to the well which provided fresh water for the household and enhedu drew up a bucket she washed her hands and face drying both on her dress while joratta leaned against the wall impatience showing in his nervous movements im ready joratta youd best do a good job or shell take it out on me yes i understand back in the bedroom they found ninlil sitting up in bed she dismissed joratta let me see your hands she commanded clean enough i suppose she muttered but take off that dress i dont want your filthy clothes touching any part of me or my bed enhedu wasnt a slave to be commanded or paraded naked for her masters benefit but joratta had closed the door behind him so the two women had the chamber to themselves enhedu set her basket down on the floor and pulled her dress up and over her head she held the garment in her hand then dropped it on the floor no doubt ninlil would have protested if enhedus dress had touched anything else in the room ninlil removed her covering and flopped back onto the bed on her stomach the movement drew a gasp of pain from the woman as she tried to find a comfortable position begin do something enhedu heard the pain in her voice she ran her fingers down the womans back the first thing she noticed was how soft ninlils skin felt to her touch too soft enhedu probed with her fingertips and felt little resistance the beautiful body was weak with no firm muscles resisting enhedus probing touch ninlil had probably never done any physical work in her life likely never lifted anything heavier than a wine cup fawning servants no doubt provided everything at her command watch where you touch woman that hurts it probably did enhedu saw a lump under the skin showed where the girls pitiful muscles had contracted in a knot the spine appeared crooked as well she opened her mouth to tell ninlil what she found then closed it better to say nothing about such things im going to knead the muscles on your back mistress it may feel painful at first but it should give you relief enhedu poured a few drops of oil across the girls shoulders and started working the muscles from the neck down the base of ninlils neck had another clump of strained muscles and she massaged that slowly taking her time and letting the heat from the oil and her hands warm the flesh gradually the knot loosened a bit and enhedu moved her hands lower groans and grunts accompanied her every touch how long has your back troubled you mistress talking might distract ninlil from the pain none of your damn you that hurts cant you be more gentle im sorry mistress but i must work your muscles if you are to feel better i fell and hurt my back about two years ago since then the pain has grown worse each day now when my husband visits my bed he complains that i cant pleasure him properly how often does he come to you enhedu moved her hands lower every three days he has two other wives neither is as beautiful as i am but they have no pain to deal with they can do things to him that i cannot how sad she added a few more drops of oil and moved her hands lower now the really deep massage would begin and enhedu had no doubt that it was going to hurt if i cant please him he may send me back to my fathers house and demand the return of his dowry the other wives would be glad to be rid of me the story came out as enhedus hands kept pushing and kneading the soft flesh puzuramurri a vigorous and wealthy merchant nearing his fiftieth season had been captivated by ninlils beauty pursued her with passion and paid plenty of gold to her father for her maidenhead but now puzzi as she called him had grown annoyed at her problem especially when she had been unable to keep his shaft firm a task that apparently required quite some effort as ninlil related her tale of bedroom failures enhedus fingers kept moving working the flesh probing the weak areas moving all the way down to the lower back and the curve of her buttocks as she worked enhedu tried to recall everything that zenobia and teara had taught her the muscles must be massaged firmly and with pressure to send the warmth of the oil and enhedus hands deep into the body by now ninlil had reached the peak of the massage her breath came heavily and she moaned at every movement followed by a sigh of pleasure when enhedus hands moved away from the weak points i think mistress ninlil that is all i can do for you today enhedu stepped away from the bed leaning over like that tired her own back and the muscles in her forearms ached from the strain now you should rest she gathered up her dress and slipped it over her head ninlil pushed herself up to a sitting position her head swaying at the movement i feel weak she stretched out her arm for her garment owww it hurts what have you done to me you must lay still for now the pain will pass in a few moments damn you youve ruined me ill have you whipped for this with a gasp of pain she tried to sit up then collapsed back onto the bed joratta help me enhedu never got another word in ninlil kept shrieking and joratta who must have been waiting just outside the chamber rushed in and attempted to calm her her cries grew louder and soon other servants rushed into the room all anxious to soothe their mistress joratta turned to enhedu he mouthed the word go enhedu snatched up her basket and slipped out the door she practically ran through the house and back into the street as she turned off the lane she glanced behind her to make sure no one followed it would be bad if they caught her and brought her back for a beating but no one showed any interest in her passage dejected she set a quick pace and started the long walk back to the kestrel e nhedu was still distraught when she related the story to tammuz he poured a cup of ale mixed with water and she drank it gratefully well you tried your best she should not have moved i told her to lay still at least you got out of there before they realized you were gone if she had been pleased others of her class would have sought me out now there will be no one a servant skilled at massage especially one dealing with the wives and concubines of the wealthy class would have access to much information men talked too freely in front of their women or boasted of what they knew to impress them either way as trella and annoksur had discovered women knew much more than their husbands and lovers ever dreamed stay close to the inn for a few days tammuz cautioned she may send joratta to search you out and have you beaten if she does you mustnt do anything a beating is nothing i can endure far worse but you might risk everything we have if you try to stop her well see he patted her shoulder well see the rest of the day brought no news of joratta or ninlils other servants no threats or complaints enhedu returned to her regular routine and saw her usual clients as a result of her skilled hands that day the kestrel made a profit of two copper coins two chickens and a handcart load of clean white sand direct from the beach to spread across the floor the evening passed quietly as well and tammuz pushed joratta and his whip to the back of his mind tammuz and enhedu had a business to run and its demands soon took their thoughts away from ninlil another day and night went by without any sight of joratta but midmorning of the next day brought ninlils servant and his bodyguard back to the kestrels door tammuz glanced up when the entrance darkened it took a moment to recognize joratta but as soon as tammuz did he summoned his own bodyguard rimaud the kestrels guard stepped into the common room and limped slowly toward tammuzs side left hand on the scabbard of the short sword joratta eyes blinking in the semidarkness either didnt notice their alertness or didnt care where is enhedu she must return to my mistress as soon as possible so she can be whipped tammuz moved to his feet and rested his hand on his knife what a look of disbelief crossed jorattas face no of course not my mistress wants to have another massage tammuz looked toward jorattas guard in the street this was a different man and he paced slowly back and forth outside the kestrel showing no interest in his masters business joratta obviously had no thoughts of a beating on his mind if the woman wanted another massage go back to your mistress while you can still walk tammuz returned to his stool but kept his feet on the ground and before i remember you owe me two coppers for my wifes labors my mistress will pay her whatever she asks but she must come now tammuz laughed your mistress has no credit here shell pay what she owes and pay in advance if she ever wants to see my wife again tell her that you dont understand my mistress he moved closer and lowered his voice she pleasured her husband so well that he wishes her to come to his bed again tomorrow so she must have another massage right away i thought she was screaming in pain when she threatened enhedu with a beating joratta grimaced she was in pain for most of the night but in the morning when she awoke she felt much better and by the evening when the master came to her chamber the pain was almost gone tammuz couldnt keep the smile off his face maybe your master should come here to spend time with enhedu himself she could pleasure him without getting your mistress involved rimaud snickered at the jest and joratta frowned again you owe me two copper coins tammuz leaned forward and pointed his finger at ninlils servant plus another one for threatening my wife and letting her walk back here without an escort then two more for if your mistress wants another session thats five coins pay now or get out i cant pay that joratta looked uncomfortable what if my mistress refuses to pay so much or if there is more pain i dont care go back to your mistress tell her what she must pay if she agrees you can return here enhedu will be back by then and if shes willing to give your mistress another massage you can walk her there and back and by all the gods in sumer if she walks back alone this time shell never set foot in your mistresss house again joratta decided tammuz meant every word just make sure shes here when i return he turned and walked from the kestrel shouting at his guard as he emerged their voices quickly disappeared up the lane do you think shell pay tammuz looked at rimaud and laughed a second wife who cant pleasure her husband shell pay that and more they were both still laughing when enhedu arrived two months later shulgi picked his horse through the bodies of men women and children until he reached what had been the center of the village not that much remained his men had put the torch to all the tents and reed huts of the salib encampment theyd stripped the bodies and the dwellings of anything of value first of course flies buzzed about his head and he brushed them away they had more than enough to feast on more than a few carcasses of horses cows sheep goats and other herd animals lay scattered about mixed randomly with the bodies of their former owners even a few dogs who could have escaped easily enough had died defending the animals entrusted to their care others howled from the edges of the encampment driven away by the sounds and smells of death the wail of the surviving women and children hung in the air as well the cries of anguish and sorrow seemed almost powerful enough to return the dead to life men lined up to rape the women pushing and shoving to keep their places not that shulgi or his men cared in the slightest about their victims alive or dead the salibs even more than the tanukhs had raided sumers lands too often in the past everyone in sumeria hated them even more than they hated the akkadians in the north shulgi felt satisfaction at the thought that he would be the one to pay back the salibs for their constant raids for generations the villages of sumer had been too weak to strike back at their tormentors from the desert now as the cities swelled in number that had changed and the power of the sword now rested in sumeria rested in shulgis own hand when all was said and done hed led his men in the attack guiding them straight toward the largest concentration of salibs two who opposed him had died though one was an old man and not really worth counting most of the salibs fled when they realized the numbers of their attackers more important his men knew he fought in the forefront not from behind their ranks as his father would have done from this day on sumerians could speak about their warrior king without any doubts as to his courage or skill shulgi let his eyes scan the battleground a few of razreks men galloped in from the desert after chasing down the last of the fleeing tribesmen by the desertdwellers standards this had been a rich village where men measured wealth in the number and strength of their horses now most of those horses belonged to sumer and would be used to build the evergrowing force of cavalry shulgi demanded every mount captured would be a weapon aimed straight at akkad the rest of the loot whether livestock gold jewels or women would be divided into three parts with two parts going to his tanukh allies razrek and two of his men rode up their horses picking the way through the rubble and dead bodies hail king shulgi a mighty victory did you get all the horses shulgi ignored the words of praise defeating this desert scum meant little they remained only the first step on his long march to akkad nearly all of them more than we expected many broke loose and it will take a few days to round them all up we should add at least two or three hundred horses and i dont think well have any trouble with our friends after this the success of this first joint raid with kapturus men should ease some of the tension between the two groups the tanukhs had earned their share of the gold and women they prized so much that should keep them from bickering and arguing over every little detail with their sumerian ally the fact that shulgi had ridden at the head of his men would also be noticed along with the salib blood still staining his sword chief kapturu had remained safely out of harms way throughout the fighting i suppose well have to waste a few days celebrating shulgi shook his head in disgust no way to avoid that razrek agreed when thats over with kapturu will send some of his men back to his village with the women and spoils shulgi had lost a handful of sumerians in the fighting and now the tanukh chief would further weaken their combined force just to safeguard his share of the loot meanwhile the next village in their path would have plenty of warning either to flee or fight from this day onward it would be war in the desert and shulgi would need every man i managed to grab a couple of women from kapturus men so well each have something to keep us occupied razrek offered that to try and cheer his commander compared to kushanna these would be ugly enough still any woman was better than none and by now razrek knew enough to make sure his king received the more promising of the two make sure you clean them up first shulgi ordered razrek smiled at such fastidiousness dont worry my king theyll be grateful enough that we havent handed them over to the tanukhs shulgi turned away his men would be erecting a tent for him he would bathe in the oasis that had supported this village then he would amuse himself with the captive woman for the next few days as a leader should there was nothing else he could do shulgi knew he had to be patient it would take many months maybe even a year to subdue the salibs only after that feat ended could he think about preparing the tanukhs for war against akkad still word of this victory would spread over the desert even as the salibs banded together so would more tanukhs rush to join kapturus standard and shulgis losses would be steadily replenished from the training camps in sumer and the surrounding regions most important his men gained fighting experience all this should happen without alerting akkads spies to what he intended after all he could afford to wait a few years for his empire he would then have a long life with kushanna as the first of many wives to enjoy the world he had conquered k ushanna frowned at the man on his knees before her big but soft she decided recent tears had streaked his dirt covered face bruises covered his face and arms and his bound hands shook as he held them against his chest his eyes held a hint of wildness as if he were not quite right in the head sohrab accompanied by two guards had escorted the prisoner into her presence sohrab had returned to sumer with his captive last night and requested a morning audience is this the man from carnax yes my queen hes the only survivor i could find his name is dilse i searched all over but you had to force him to come to sumer not that she cared but something seemed odd with the situation any plodding farmer should be eager for the chance to earn a few coins and visit sumer sohrab licked his lips hes not exactly one of carnaxs survivors he saw the frown and hurried on it seems he was one of the bandits who sacked the village i think hes afraid hell be killed for what he did interesting and perhaps even better than some ignorant villager who probably knew little about the raid lift up his head one of the guards grabbed the man by his hair and twisted it back until the mans mouth hung open and his adams apple bulged toward her his eyes lost the wild look replaced with fear listen to me dilse i care nothing about whatever youve done in the past but i want to know everything about the raid on carnax if you tell me what i want to know youll be set free and even earn a few coppers she waved her hand at the guard and he released his hold on dilses hair now speak my queen he gasped i know nothing about any raid im just a caravan guard who became separated from my master please ive done nothing a child could have recognized the lie you should not try to deceive me dilse perhaps some time with the torturers will help loosen your tongue she turned to the guards take him outside and cut off his fingers one by one until hes ready to speak for a moment kushanna enjoyed the look of horror on the mans face then she turned away no ill tell you what i know please mercy she ignored the cries for mercy the guards knew what to do theyd cut off one or two fingers before dragging the prisoner back no matter what he promised she walked across the room to the balcony come with me sohrab yes my queen tell me what you learned she gazed down into the courtyard the two guards soon appeared jerking dilse along between them a small table set against the outer wall held several small knives and other implements i spoke with several farmers who lived nearby they knew little of what happened that day it was almost four years ago those who lived too close to the village were all murdered apparently there was a power struggle among carnaxs elders a trader named fradmon sought vengeance for the death of his son executed for murder by the village elder this fradmon hired some bandits and they attacked the village at night the village elder a man named ranaddi perished at fradmons hand ranaddi had a trusted advisor and he had a grown son and a young daughter named trella its not that uncommon a name no my queen but this trella was favored by ranaddi favored enough that she attended many of his meetings she was said to be keen of wit kushanna frowned that sounded like the witch of akkad how old was this child not a child my queen she had already been given the rites of passage despite that no man had claimed her for a husband a shriek erupted from the courtyard kushanna glanced down just as the guard tossed the first finger into the dirt and what happened to this trella it seems that fradmon who planned the attack was killed by the leader of the bandits who turned on his master and then took all the gold for himself and his men instead of killing everyone the bandit spared the women and a few young men he took them with him when he departed probably to sell as slaves another scream of pain echoed against the walls this time the guard looked up at the balcony kushanna signaled the guard to cease and dilse was one of the bandits thats what the people living nearby believed he returned to the area a few months later still with plenty of coins in his purse apparently he is not quite right in the head a few times he got drunk and boasted of the raid on carnax down below the guards were binding up dilses hand it took only moments before they disappeared from view kushanna turned away from the balcony well well soon know she led the way into the chamber the guards returned dragging the prisoner between them theyd wrapped his right hand in a rag to catch the bleeding they knew she didnt like bloodstains on the floor hes ready to talk queen kushanna they usually were after a losing a few fingers give him some water she ordered dilse managed to choke down a mouthful but more spilled on his chest and the floor mercy mercy his voice trailed off into a whimper tell me of carnax she ordered tell me everything you know of the raid or youll lose more than your fingers the story came out between sobs dilse had been a servant for the merchant fradmon he and his steward had returned and slaughtered almost the entire village but then the steward a man named sondar turned upon his master killing him and taking the few survivors as slaves they marched the captives mostly women and children off to a slave trader waiting nearby dilse even remembered the name of the slaver drusas the name made kushanna smile an odious little man he lived right here in sumer flaunting his wealth and still dealing in slaves a stroke of luck that dilse remembered the slavers name kushanna decided drusas took delight in every one of his slaves she felt certain he would remember what happened to trella and her brother and this trella and her brother were sold to drusas yes my queen dilse had to pause to choke back the sobs sondar sold all the captives to drusas once they were gone all of us rode north eager to get away from carnax no doubt she turned her gaze toward sohrab did you speak to drusas i tried to my queen i went to his house last night to ask if he remembered anything about trellas brother but drusas had departed yesterday morning for the slavers camp upriver he wont be back for several days at least sohrab understood the importance of the information she decided there was little more to glean from the wretch kneeling at her feet then she had another thought this sondar can you describe him a few moments later kushanna glanced at sohrab he nodded agreement i think we have no further need for poor dilse kushanna said take care of him the guards smiled and dragged the prisoner away theyd take him to the rear of the courtyard and drive a sword through his heart youve done well sohrab keep all this to yourself it may prove useful wait here for a moment of course my queen sohrab bowed at the compliment kushanna returned to the balcony she wanted some time to think sondar had changed his name to razrek and within a few months had become king eridus most favored leader not that razreks murderous past made any difference he could have burned a dozen villages for all she cared but there might come a day when such knowledge might be useful even more useful might be trellas brother if he were still alive and could be found at the least she should be able to sell him to akkad for a heavy price depending on trellas feelings of affection perhaps even further advantages could be obtained but first the witchs brother must be found she turned away from the courtyard and swept back into the room i want trellas brother brought to sumer go after drusas and find out what he knows make sure he tells you everything about the raid on carnax as well as what befell trella and her brother tell him if im not satisfied with what he remembers he may find more of his property in sumer confiscated yes my queen and if i find that the brother is dead ill reward you well if you bring him back but even if hes dead knowledge of his fate might be useful kushanna smiled yes alive or dead trellas brother would help sumer the morning after he returned to akkad eskkar went down to the barracks to see gatus last night at the evening meal the old soldier mentioned some new training routines that he wanted eskkar to see eskkar promised he would stop by the barracks at midmorning even with gatuss warning eskkar slowed in surprise when he entered the training ground months had passed since gatuss last demonstration eskkar had seen the men training during that time but between governing the city working with the slingers visiting nuzi and the horse camps not to mention his own training he hadnt paid much attention to the mens training he had more than enough to occupy his time eskkars eyes widened at the size of the group today one hundred spearmen stood there waiting for his arrival all of them carrying shields swords and resting the butt end of their spears on the ground every man wore thick sandals and each had a bronze helmet the latest idea gatus and trella had come up with it made the soldiers appear both taller and fiercer they looked ready to march into battle gatus sat on his stool facing them waiting patiently the men had assembled in four ranks of twentyfive each two of the ranks faced the other two about twenty paces apart gatus picked up his stool and strode over to where eskkar stood good morning captain i think youll enjoy this were you waiting long for me eskkar imagined the men standing in the hot sun all morning waiting for his arrival no i told a runner to let me know when you left the compound eskkar remembered seeing a boy dash off down the lane and of course gatus was too good a commander to let men stand about in the hot sun doing nothing at least not without a good reason what am i going to see ive been thinking about sumers army we know theyll have men armed with swords and shields and i think we should expect them to have plenty of spearmen as well so i decided to figure out what our first encounter might look like weve been practicing this for the last ten days now you can see what weve been doing gatus walked back to the men and moved into the center area between the facing ranks you men know the rules today you will be the eagle army he pointed to the men on his left against the hawk army with his rod he gestured to the men on his right first side to push an opposing man across the rope is the victor the losing side will buy ale for the winning side all night long a murmur went through the men as they readied themselves eskkar noticed two ropes stretched out and pegged down at either end about ten paces behind each side and this time gatus added i dont want to see anyone on the losing side trying to join the winners that brought forth a brief laugh up and down the lines gathering his stool gatus moved out of the open area but stayed just on the edge of the ranks two of his subcommanders took positions on one end of the spearmen and two others shifted to the opposite end eskkar as he moved to gatuss side realized the subcommanders would judge the mens performance spears ready the men all serious now lifted the spears off the ground keeping the bronze tip pointing upward what side do you favor captain eskkar smiled as he studied the ranks both sides appeared similar in size and weight so there was little to distinguish one group from the other ill take the hawks ha the hawks always lose to the eagles gatus said youll be buying my ale tonight he faced the two ranks shields up spears forward the spears moved into a horizontal position held shoulder high and palm up and facing the opposing side the men in the second rank of each group moved forward as well each man letting his spear jut out between the shoulders of the two men in front of him the longer spears of the second rank reaching out as far as the front rank two spear walls now bristled threateningly at each other across the open space even from where eskkar stood the line of bronzetipped weapons looked formidable every shield was held at eye level slow march forward march gatus leaned toward eskkar this is where it gets interesting hopefully no one will get hurt this time the ranks began to walk toward each other eskkar watched fascinated the men were going to gut each other but as the opposing spear tips crossed he saw the men angling their weapons up so that they would pass between the heads of the men facing them as soon as the spears extended out past the line of men the ranks surged forward taking the last step with a rush that brought the two ranks into jarring contact shield crashed against shield the sound echoing around the barracks and accompanied by the grunts and shouts of the men in an instant the lines were struggling against each other the mens feet kicked up dirt as they fought either to remain where they were or push forward eskkar saw a few men in the rear ranks slip to their knees but they immediately regained their position the men in the front rank couldnt fall down since they were held upright by the opponent as well as the man behind the air filled with curses or cries of triumph spears shifted and waved in all directions and eskkar saw men struck on the side of the head by the thick shafts whether by accident or on purpose he couldnt tell for the first time he noticed the many dents on the bronze helmets the lines wavered and buckled as different parts of the ranks moved forward or back the earth beneath their feet churned into a cloud of dust that hovered in the air in moments sweat covered every mans brow and red faces showed the effort the men were expending the rearmost rank pressed their shields into the backs of the innermost rank and used that as leverage to shove the leading man forward leg muscles straining every man tried to use his spear as well to knock aside the opponents shield or just to land a blow by now eskkar could have extended his arms and enclosed all four ranks so close together had they jammed themselves the two leading ranks shield pressed against shield were crushed up against each other not only by their own force but the pressure of the men behind them slowly the hawk line began to move backward men shouted to their companions to hold on to not take that step backward but some had no choice the hawk line still gripped their spears using them to try and dislodge their opponent nevertheless the hawk line grew more jagged as the eagles pushed deeper and deeper into their ranks by now every man gasped for breath a man went down near the center of the hawk line and that marked the beginning of the end sensing success the eagle army pushed harder and broke through the ranks knocking opponents to the ground and trampling on them spears entangled themselves or were torn loose from their owners grip the eagle teams shouts rose up as they rushed forward the hawk line collapsed its men either driven back or knocked to the ground trying to avoid being stepped on by the surging eagles halt gatuss voice carried over the spearmen who crowded against each other gasping for breath some jumped up and down in victory while the losers shook their heads in defeat reform ranks eskkar saw how well gatus had trained them within moments the men disentangled themselves everyone helping the fallen regain their feet they gathered up their spears and reformed the ranks guided by additional orders from the subcommanders a few of the men needed assistance to regain their positions helped by those still strong enough to stand blood lay scattered across the once smooth ground between the two ranks eskkar guessed that a few spears in the belly would have drenched the earth with blood and entrails perhaps you should inspect the men captain congratulate the winners gatus led the way back into the open space between the ranks the blood smell now floated in the air several men had deep scratches or cuts others bled from their mouths or noses two or three men looked seriously hurt dazed and barely held upright by their companions stand easy men eskkar started with the eagles moving up and down the smiling line talking to the men congratulating them on their victory he inspected the hawk ranks next here he saw only a few smiles more hawks had been injured most of the faces were grim theyd lost the struggle suffered embarrassment in front of their king and tonight would have to pay in the tavern for their defeat when he finished his inspection eskkar knew he would have to speak to them this was one of those moments as trella explained to him where he could bind men to his cause he turned to gatus may i command them the polite request was for the benefit of the men yes lord eskkar gatus replied all of you close up and face me the odd command confused more than a few but the subcommanders stepped in in moments one hundred men were packed together facing him how many of you have fought in battle a few voices answered him but not more than a handful what youve just done will give you a good idea of what to expect on the battleground the enemy will not yield easily your spears and swords will have to push him back step by step until his line breaks youll need to be tougher and stronger than your enemy because they will probably have the advantage in numbers he let his eyes scan the mens faces by now they caught their breath and he held the attention of every one of them ive waged many battles most on horseback or using sword against sword what you have just done here is different and i dont know how well i could have stood against you in battle but im certain this is very much the way real fighting will be you will be tired and hot so will your enemy you will probably be hungry and almost certainly thirsty but so will your enemy what will be different is that you will take the fight to them they will see you ignoring your hunger and thirst marching toward them spears pointing at their faces and they will be afraid when you smash into their ranks their fear will overwhelm them as you drive them into the ground you will be covered in blood but it will be their blood not yours he paused and a ragged cheer erupted eskkar let them go on for a few moments then held up his hand for silence and remember this if you remember nothing else the side that breaks first will be slaughtered its broken line easy kills for the advancing enemy you saw what happened when the hawk line started to slip no man can fight well moving backwards and if your enemy turns and runs his death is certain heads nodded in agreement and he saw the gleam of selfconfidence in their eyes you men will be the pride of akkads fighters its first army of spearmen never before has anyone trained so many to fight as one if our enemy has greater numbers it matters little if you work and fight together as gatus and his commanders teach you no foe will be able to withstand your charge when the enemy sees you approaching his knees will go weak with fear when you smash into his shield wall he will turn and flee he will do this because he will know in his heart that you are stronger tougher and better trained than he is he will not stand against you this time another cheer went up louder than the first and it went on and on despite eskkars efforts to silence them now you must continue your training but i will join you tonight to buy ale for gatus i will sit with the hawk army and complain about our bad luck as much as any of you a laugh rippled through them gatus take command of your men again he waited until gatus had given the orders and turned the men over to the subcommanders the two friends walked away from the training ground found an empty spot in the shade of a barrack and sat down on the ground both of them leaning back against the wall and gazing out of the common area gatus youve done well these men look good gatus shook his head i think they can be better i want to train them harder i want to increase the training and try some new tactics as well eskkar glanced at the veteran gatus had always been an excellent trainer a good second in command but seldom initiated anything new gatus caught the glance hear me out first i want to toughen them up even more that means longer marches more spear practice i want them to handle their spears as well as you handle your sword theyll need to learn how to fight with a sword as well so well need more sword work and i want to change the spears i want thicker shafts too many splinter or break at the first hard contact even on the training ground in a battle many would be lost after the first thrust then well have nothing but an army of swordsmen eskkar had seen it himself even men in training could thrust hard enough to penetrate a sumerian shield and that effort sometimes snapped the shaft a heavier and longer weapon will slow them down on the march such weapons would cost more too but neither man worried about that trella had already collected a good supply of gold from nuzi and the first shipment of silver arrived only days ago thats one reason why i want to toughen them up you saw this group almost all of them are bigger and stronger than most of the men in akkad with the right training i want to train all the spearcarriers every day work them until they cant even stand remember what mitracs father did with the archers working the archers didnt involve them ending up bleeding and bruised you wont be popular with these spearmen i dont care and neither do you for all your fine speeches i remember when you couldnt say three words without stumbling over the fourth eskkar grunted somehow gatus always managed to annoy him remind him of the days when eskkar seldom spoke more than a dozen words from dawn to dusk trella of course was responsible for his newfound eloquence but the two remained friends the way that two men who have fought side by side against overwhelming numbers always do no matter what words pass between them do what you like with them gatus i know you will anyway just make sure that when the time comes theyll march and fight better than any force sumer can put in front of them remember theyll be facing two or three times as many enemies thats why i want to train them harder first ill show them how soft and clumsy they are then rebuild them toughen them up until theyre stronger than any fighting men in akkad when im finished training them theyll be the finest fighting force in the land just make sure you dont waste their lives to protect your precious horse fighters i know how to use my riders when the time comes dont worry about that what else do you have planned i want them to master every possible way to fight with a spear i want to teach them how to brace a spear against the ground to stop a charging enemy even if hes on horseback i want my men to learn to thrust with the spear just using their arms until they can hit a man in the face or groin every time another technique i want them to master is to hold the spear tight against their bodies and deliver the thrust by stepping forward or use a long thrust with one hand or two hands stepping forward with one or both feet when theyve mastered all those ways to kill a man ill teach them how to throw the spear on the run ive practiced it myself and found its best to release the weapon when the opposite foot is forward eskkar felt the surprise cover his face how long have you been thinking about all this months almost from the beginning but i had to know what they could do before i tried to teach them any of these new tricks the last thing i want them to master is swinging the spear if a man swings the spear from side to side the tip of the blade will slice right through flesh and bone if the spear is moving fast enough even the shaft will cause injury that trick will give a spearman a chance if hes alone and in open ground against more than one opponent how long is all this going to take gatus laughed if i told you you wouldnt believe me but the wait will be worth it i promise when im done these men will wield a spear as easily as you whirl your sword around and theyll fight through twice their number with ease they may have to eskkar shook his head this time in admiration at what gatus had already accomplished youve done well gatus i mean that and now ill get back to my work and let you continue with yours just keep moving the men up north gatus kept the number of men he was training in akkads barracks at about one hundred more or less what most people didnt notice was that as the men grew more proficient small groups were moved north to be replaced by new recruits sumers spies would count the number of men in training but hopefully wouldnt notice the gradual movement north or at least not be able to count the entire force will you join us at the tavern tonight oh yes after what youve shown me and told me i think im going to need a large cup of strong ale just make sure you tell trella about the new weapons you want im sure theyre going to cost more gold which will be nothing compared to what youre spending on horses eskkar pushed himself to his feet talking with you makes my head ache if you dont mind i think ill ride to the north tomorrow at least up there i wont have to argue with you all day the first portion of eskkars journey to the lands north of bisitun was by riverboat in the last few months he received several reports regarding the training at the horse camp and wanted to observe the mens progress himself each departure from akkad now required careful preparations as usual trella wanted as few people as possible to know when her husband had left the city whenever eskkar departed the hawk clan guards increased their security around trella and gatus and bantor kept the soldiers on heightened alert there would be no repeat of someone trying to seize the city by force while eskkar was gone any who enquired about eskkars whereabouts would be told that he was occupied with important matters and remaining in the compound to help maintain secrecy on this trip the first stage of the journey to bisitun would be by boat eskkar riding out of akkad on horseback day or night would certainly have attracted notice but few paid much attention to what went on at the docks especially in the early morning eskkar and his companions boarded their vessels before first light and the two boats departed as soon as the sun cleared the horizon yavtar commanded the boat that carried the king and seven of his guards another eight rode in the second vessel for this visit the men eskkar took with him had all been carefully chosen by hathor all were archers and more important all knew how to ride for that very reason grond remained in akkad the big man could ride but was no horseman and eskkar wanted skilled horsemen only meanwhile gronds presence moving about the city would convince many that king eskkar remained within the compound the river journey to the north had another purpose yavtars men had finished two new boats and he wanted eskkar to inspect them the boat captain had taken over a farm about ten miles north of bisitun and installed everything needed to build and test the new boats that eskkar and his commanders required two days after departing akkad the ships rowed past bisitun during the late afternoon and reached the small jetty of yavtars farm just after dusk every member of the crew slumped against the oars exhausted from driving the boats upriver eskkar had taken a hand with the oars unwilling to sit idle while others worked besides he wanted to get a feel for the boats that plied the river and he enjoyed every chance to work his muscles by now hed overcome his initial worries about being on the water and almost managed to enjoy the trip once on shore they ate a quick meal then relaxed over a few cups of ale the difficult journey upriver made sure every man slept well that night in the morning as soon as the sun had begun its journey across the heavens yavtar brought the three soldiers stationed at the dockyard and more than a dozen villagers to meet their king since this was eskkars first visit he took the time to ask each one his name and say something encouraging they might be mere carpenters or laborers but these were the men who would build the boats akkad needed most just stood there wideeyed and afraid to say anything to the man who ruled their world yavtars shipyard as everyone called the place didnt look like much three small houses a few sheds and a corral that held the dozen or so horses that would take eskkar and his guards on the next part of their journey the most impressive part of the shipyard was the dock itself built with sturdy wood from the northern lands it had enough slips to hold seven vessels three of the slips were occupied two with yavtars boats that had just carried them up the river while the third slip held a craft that had arrived yesterday from the north carrying more lumber this may not look like much now captain but when we have forty or fifty men building ships all those slips will be filled i promise almost all the wood needed to construct our ships comes down the river just not enough big trees near akkad most of the trees in the land between the rivers were willows or date palms and even eskkar knew that their wood wasnt hard or dense enough for major projects good enough for cups bowls small tables and chairs but not for much else the gates that provided entry into akkad had all been built from trees floated downriver from the northern forests with the docks in place yavtar continued we can load and unload all we need at the same time we can keep two or three of our new boats floating there while we work on them but now let me show what i wanted you to see not far from the docks yavtar had established four construction cradles boats in various stages of assembly rested on each of them he guided eskkar to the first cradle where a halffinished boat sat on its blocks this is the third one weve started the first two didnt meet your needs so we tore them apart and started over but this one will i think at least it will last long enough for us to learn all we need it doesnt look any bigger than whats plying the river now it is at least five paces longer than my longest riverboat but whats more important is that its almost two paces wider and with a steeper pitch to its sides that means it will ride lower in the water why is that important trella had finally overcome eskkars reluctance to admit that he didnt know everything and he no longer hesitated to ask questions making assumptions hed learned almost always led to mistakes you wanted boats that could carry plenty of men especially archers as well as large cargoes to resupply your fighters but if weve got a dozen archers shooting arrows at the shore or another ship the boat will tip over at the slightest movement so we need to have a way to keep it stable since we wont be carrying any fragile cargoes like wine or pottery we can take advantage of heavier ballast my builders have worked on an idea that well need to test but i think it will work eskkar couldnt help laughing ive never seen you so excited you seem to enjoy building ships these are new kinds of ships captain and thats something to get excited about yavtar said ive got women in bisitun stitching linen bags with a drawstring top for us well fill the bags with sand or dirt and spread them flat on the bottom of the ship the archers and crew can stand on them if they need to when were ready to go into action the ships crew will shift the cargo to one side or the other to compensate for the archers weight and if we have to carry cargo we just dump the sand and stuff bread or whatever into the sack will that be enough to keep the ship from rolling over eskkar could picture archers trying to work their bows while the ship bobbled and wavered beneath their feet you should have been a ship builder captain no it probably wont be enough but one of my men thought of this what do you think yavtar took a few steps and stopped before two wooden sawhorses a thick log about three paces long rested there it had two support members fastened to it at either end the supports ended in a thick crosspiece what is it eskkar had never seen anything like it before weve been calling it a brace but that doesnt explain what it does when were ready to go into battle these crosspieces will fit into notches cut in the sides of the ship the log will ride in the water if the boat starts to lean toward that side the log will be forced deeper into the river and it will resist the boats tendency to roll eskkar had noticed that the unfinished boat at the slip had notches cut into its sides how will that keep the boat from tipping ever try to hold a log under water captain the more you try to submerge it the more it resists your efforts and since it projects out two paces from the side of the ship it will be almost impossible to roll the boat over it should keep the ship stable enough for your archers to loose their shafts if you say so eskkar still wasnt sure how it would work but if yavtar thought it would be useful he would trust the old sailor next time you visit here youll get a real demonstration on the river but i think we can build boats that can carry fighters and supplies at the same time a craft like that would be able to defend itself from horsemen and archers on the shore or another boat for that matter ill need the supplies yavtar in our last fight in the south we were out of food another day or two and the situation would have been bad if we have ten times the number of men well never be able to carry enough food for them not to mention grain for the horses and extra weapons besides carts and wagons need more horses or oxen to pull them and will slow our pace the good thing about sumeria is that the land is full of rivers and streams and you should be able to march near one if you do well be able to bring you supplies something else that would be useful can you build a few boats built for speed and nothing else we could use them for carrying messages back to akkad hmmm i suppose we could do something no ones ever thought about a ship that didnt need to carry cargo let me think about it now its time to have some bread and ale for breakfast t he next morning eskkar and his ten guards crossed to the west bank of the tigris and rode north to meet the ur nammu and learn how many horses the steppe warriors had brought with them this side of the river held few farmers and the land remained mostly empty though trella had predicted that in a few years all of this would be under cultivation or support flocks of sheep and herds of cattle with all the land under akkads protection by the third day the land had turned hilly and the number of valleys began to increase none of them were large or had steep walls but they sheltered good grassland that would be ideal for raising horses midmorning on the fourth day eskkar saw ur nammu riders standing on a crest line outlined against the sky he gathered his horsemen around him i think weve reached the place eskkar said now remember what ive told you make sure you give no offense no matter what happens and the first man who puts his hand on a sword will wish hed never been born they rounded the base of the hill and trotted the last few hundred paces until they reached the entrance to the valley he counted fifteen warriors waiting for them subutai wasnt among them but eskkar relaxed when he saw fashod eskkar halted his men a few paces from the waiting horsemen a good day to ride eskkar said one of the traditional greetings used by the horse people a good day to ride fashod replied welcome to our camp eskkar glanced around he didnt see any ropes blocking the valley entrance and wondered what kept the animals from bolting out how long have you been waiting for us only two days it took longer to bring the animals here than i thought a few ropes broke and twice a pesky mare slipped her noose how many horses did you bring eskkar couldnt restrain his curiosity thirty are these the men who will need to be taught how to ride no those should arrive tomorrow there will be twenty to teach as well as men with tools to build corrals and whatever else is needed theyll bring plenty of rope these men eskkar waved his hand to include those who had ridden with him need only to be taught how to fight from horseback good then the rest of today we can hunt and talk and begin work tomorrow would you like to see the horses very much fashod eskkar turned to the leader of his guard you stay here and remember what ive told you fashod wheeled his horse around and started up the valley and eskkar galloped after him the rest of the warriors followed and eskkar had the strange sensation of riding with a group of warriors something he had not done since his boyhood days with the alur meriki the valley curved slightly and as they rounded the bend he saw the horses already in retreat away from the approaching men fashod slowed his pace as they neared the end of the valley the nervous animals watched them approach ears flicking back and forth a stallion pawing the earth as it kept its gaze on them good horseflesh eskkar said his eyes examining the animals you couldnt be sure of course until you worked with them but he didnt see any dull coats or listless movements every head stretched upwards and the wild look in their eyes showed plenty of spirit a few good ones fashod agreed better than most horses that dirteaters ride the horses were growing more restive unsure of these strange men and animals theyd been driven a long way but they were still wild and it would take a lot of hard work before they would let a man approach them let alone slip a halter over their heads the horsemen rode back to the mouth of the valley and dismounted eskkar asked fashod if he could meet his men and fashod obliged many of the warriors were young in the alur meriki clan of eskkars youth they would still have been considered boys but the ur nammu had been devastated by war and nearly exterminated and now the clan needed its boys to turn into men as fast as possible the warriors were cool to eskkar they didnt know much about him to them he was just another clan deserter or outcast someone who had joined with the dirteaters even worse some suspected he had come from the clan of their hated enemy the alur meriki most of all the ur nammu considered themselves superior to any villager or farmer and their words were cautious or aloof one warrior eskkar guessed he had about twenty seasons did more than repeat eskkars name in greeting my name is chinua i know you eskkar of akkad i fought with you and your men when the alur meriki nearly overwhelmed us in the canyon of death he raised his voice so that all would hear all of you have heard many times the story of that fight i was there and i say that eskkar of akkad is a mighty warrior who saved my life and the lives of many ur nammu that day despite his many wounds he helped subutai slay the leader of our enemy chinua which eskkar knew meant wolf moved to face the rest of his men some of you have loose tongues and foolish words if any of you insult king eskkar or his men it will be as if you have challenged me i will not forget the blood oath that binds all ur nammu warriors with eskkar of akkad the little speech coming from one of the warriors and not fashod did more to impress the men than anything either commander could have said eskkar wondered if fashod had suggested it your words are wise chinua eskkar moved his horse beside that of the warrior and extended his arm it is always good to greet an old comrade again chinua clasped eskkars arm in friendship we will break many horses for you and help me train my men to fight as warriors fight eskkar didnt like to give speeches but he knew that at times words were more powerful than swords as the ur nammu have fought against the superior numbers of the alur meriki so will my men have to fight against great odds that is why we seek your help as brother warriors so that we can overcome our enemies that was important to remind them that subutai and eskkar had sworn the blood oath of warriors the enemy of my enemy is my friend it is true fashod added i too have fought at eskkars side not once but twice though because of him i have a wife that i must beat regularly taken in a raid against the main camp of the alur meriki the men laughed at the jest but the words of chinua and fashod and even eskkar made them aware of the special relationship that existed between them eskkar saw some of the hostility and distrust fade from their faces a good start but much more would be needed to bridge the gap between them with luck they would have plenty of time now it is time to feast fashod turned to eskkar is there any wine in those skins i saw your men carrying only one skin eskkar said but i will have more brought out if you and your men think you can drink with my men a fair challenge fashod turned his horse back toward the camp first one back to the camp gets an extra cup of wine in an instant the riders whirled their horses around and burst into a gallop leaving eskkar still struggling to turn his mount around by then the ur nammu were thirty paces ahead of him and eskkar realized that he would likely be the one without any wine tonight a fter the men finished their meal fashod came over to eskkars campfire he sat down beside eskkar so that both of them faced the fire tell me of your plans eskkar first we must break the horses and train the men i will send orders back to bisitun and soon more of my men will come theyll bring ropes poles shovels everything needed to hold the horses wine and food too if this place seems suitable ill send for masons to build a wall across the mouth of the valley with a gate that way well be sure the horses cant break out all that will take time fashod mused there is time but i intend to waste none of it as long as you keep bringing me horses i will have more men coming to learn how to fight bows arrows lances those will be needed as well eskkar nodded all has been considered including what you and your men will receive in return for your help if anyone is unhappy with the exchange come to me and we will work things out between us i want no ur nammu warrior feeling slighted will your men obey our orders they will if you set the example treat them fairly but no better than you would treat any of your own they have much to learn and the sooner the better as you train these they will help train those that follow them it will be as you say eskkar he stared at the fire for a moment do you think you will be able to defeat your enemy when you come to face him the future is never certain fashod but ive learned one thing in the last few seasons if nothing else welltrained and wellarmed fighters can defeat almost any number of the enemy then i promise you eskkar of akkad that when the time comes your men will be ready t hey started the next morning fashod gave half the warriors to chinua and told him to get started on the horses eskkar told his men to form a line with each rider ten paces apart facing fashods remaining warriors who formed a similar line two hundred paces away when i give the order eskkar said well walk our horses toward fashods line his men will move toward us at a walk each of you will guide your horse into the gap between two warriors at all times keep the line intact blank looks and open mouths greeted these orders we need to train our horses to fight and this is how we begin the horses must get used to seeing other animals coming toward them they must also think that there will always be a gap for them to pass through otherwise they will not charge in combat or if they do they may pull up at the last moment turn aside or dig in their heels and toss their rider now we begin he moved to the end of the line walk at the same time he raised his sword in the air held it for a moment then lowered it fashod repeated the same signal and his men advanced as well the ten men started moving immediately the line grew ragged some animals were impatient others too slow the riders all had different ideas about what a walk meant damn you look at fashods line the men lifted their eyes to stare at the approaching line of warriors all moving evenly across the grass toward them straighten out the line eskkar knew the warriors would be grinning at the clumsy dirteaters by now the two lines were drawing close to each other and the nervous horses added to the confusion they passed between fashods men in twos and threes a sorry example of horsemanship keep the line even eskkar made them continue pacing forward until they reached fashods starting point wheel left reform the line two riders turned to the right which brought guffaws or curses from the mount they bumped into eskkar swore again the idea of right and left wasnt clear to some of them that too would have to be explained nevertheless the line eventually reformed of course fashods line had turned smoothly without a lost step and they now waited patiently walk the ten horsemen plus eskkar moved forward the line ragged within a few steps keep the line even damn you his voice would be hoarse by the end of the day if he kept shouting at this rate they did a little better the second time when theyd finished the tenth pass the line remained nearly straight still eskkar wasnt sure if it wasnt the horses who grasped the concept quicker than their riders now well try the same movement at a trot one rider started forward damn you wait for the command eskkar bellowed at this rate his voice wouldnt last the morning let alone the day the sheepish rider had to ride around his grinning companions to regain his place trot this went a little better a lot of the work depended on the horse but gradually each animal got used to keeping pace with the horse beside it after ten times eskkar gave the order for a canter once again the horse and rider had to learn what that command meant what gait to set the faster horses being held back the slower ones urged to move a bit faster again and again eskkar shouted to keep the line even as midmorning approached both horse and rider were getting weary the drill seemed senseless and only the fact that the warriors executed each pass with precision proved that they too had practiced such things the men were getting tired which was what eskkar wanted weary horses and men would be less likely to do something foolish or injure themselves now we try a gallop the sooner you get it right the quicker you can rest this time the line held together better than expected either by luck or skill and the two lines rushed toward each other eskkar repeated the drill three more times then waved fashods men in enough for now take care of your horses wash them down and return here move fashod discharged his men as well but he rode over to join eskkar both men dismounted and sat down on the grass your men did better than i expected these men are experienced fighters good archers and decent riders but theyve never learned how to use a horse in battle the next group will be far worse fashod grunted at hearing that in ones and twos eskkars men returned he waited until he had all ten sitting on the ground before him any questions the men glanced at each other but one man finally spoke why are we doing this well never walk our horses toward the enemy eskkar kept the frown from his face better to let the men ask questions even stupid ones if he started cursing at them theyd never learn to speak out do you know why the steppe warriors are so ferocious no one answered its because theyre better horsemen theyve learned that a welltrained horse is worth two or three men in a battle and this what weve done this morning is how they train their horses their animals will charge toward an approaching group of horses because they know there will be a gap for them to pass through and they trust their rider to find that gap in battle they strike together crashing into their enemy when villagers fight on horseback they ride up to an enemy stop the horse and start hacking at each other with their swords the warriors let the horse do the fighting they never stop they know a wound is just as good as a kill so they strike at the horse the rider anywhere they can and they keep moving forward they push through their enemy until they break through to his rear then they wheel around and attack again they never worry about their back because theyre always moving forward eskkar glanced at fashod tell them what eskkar speaks is true we train the horse to use its shoulder to crash into an opposing horse to step on anything in its path and to always continue forward when we attack dirt villagers they break quickly because they suddenly find warriors behind as well as in front the moment a horse fighter starts worrying what is happening behind him what danger may be approaching hes easy to kill either that or he turns and runs horses have a natural tendency to jump over obstacles in their path they had to be trained to step on anything on the ground man or beast a good horse takes months to train eskkar said a warrior guards a prime animal as much as his wife maybe even more because he knows a good horse can save his life in battle its not likely we can ever do as well as fashod and his men but the sumerian horsemen are not warriors mitrac proved that a few months ago with a handful of men he struck a heavy blow so akkads horsemen just need to be better trained and better mounted than our southern enemy and that he waved his hand toward the valley is why were here he stood enough talk for now while the horses rest we will practice our sword fighting they worked with their swords the rest of the morning and early afternoon then they gathered their horses and repeated the mornings drill moving quicker this time through the walk trot and canter and into the gallop when they finished eskkar collected his weary men tomorrow well start again this time well narrow the gap a little each time until there is just enough room for horse and rider to pass through fashods line and then well start all over again yelling our war cry and waving our swords the horses need to hear and see all that as well in ten days or so well slaughter a cow and cover everyone with blood your horses will need to get used to that scent too now get some sleep youre going to need it by noon the next day both the men and their mounts stood exhausted before eskkar he ordered them to take care of the horses first then find something to eat and get some rest as they moved to obey a shout turned eskkars eyes back to the mouth of the valley a small caravan had arrived eskkar dismounted and led his horse toward the newcomers as he approached them he took a count thirty men on horseback another twenty on foot and three small carts laden with supplies klexor swung down from his horse as his captain arrived by the gods captain if you were any farther north wed never have found you the two men hugged each other for a moment two days ride from bisitun and youre complaining if you had to listen for two days to those carts squealing with every turn of the wheel youd be glad to arrive anywhere even the demon pits below cant be that noisy have you brought everything not everything had arrived in bisitun klexor replied and i knew you wanted to start the men training as soon as possible another caravan should arrive tomorrow or the day after after that sisuthros will have you on a regular schedule with a caravan arriving every three days what have you brought twenty men who claim they can tell a horse from a donkey half of them are liars im sure three of my best riders to help with the training five men to escort the carts and drivers back to bisitun they can leave in the morning half a dozen laborers to build your walls three rope makers two weavers two cooks and five farmers the carts are full of grain food wine and ropes as well as tools and weapons for the ur nammu he lowered his voice any trouble with them no fashod and chinua one of his leaders of ten have spoken to them about us enough for them to give us a chance to prove ourselves you just make sure of your men ive done nothing but pound that fact into their thick skulls for the last two days the first one that gets out of line will wish hed died in his mothers womb eskkar grunted in satisfaction it wasnt everything he needed but it would do for a start we need to get an enclosing wall built across the valleys mouth as soon as possible but we can manage with ropes for now he didnt want anything fancy or solid just something tall enough to make the bravest horse turn away wild horses tended to be powerful jumpers and ropes alone might not stop them long well you wont see any walls for a few weeks theyll have to make the bricks and let them dry before they can use them eskkar nodded he knew all about the construction of bricks and walls trella and corio had seen to that probably he would need more masons and laborers as well this valley is the perfect place to train horses klexor we can seal off some of the small openings and use them to keep the halftrained beasts from the wild ones and more horses will be arriving in a few days the ur nammu warriors who helped drive this herd here have already left to capture more animals by the time youre finished here youll have built another village no doubt as soon as the walls are up well start building some huts for the men until then everyone sleeps on the ground now come with me you and fashod need to meet and decide how youre going to train the men the three leaders spent the rest of the day and most of the evening talking only when klexor understood every part of the process did eskkar relax the new camp would slowly take shape but over the next few months everything needed to train both men and horses to ride and fight would be in place supplies and fresh men would arrive on a regular basis and as the men became proficient in their horsemanship they would help train the newcomers as far as eskkar knew no one had ever done anything like this before usually a village anchored a training camp or a place to assemble and work the horses this valley would be dedicated to nothing but horsemanship raw recruits would arrive and when they left eskkar was determined they would be efficient horse fighters the longer he could keep this place secret the better for akkad trella stood in the entrance to the map room it had taken more than four months to construct and she had watched the builders create it plank by plank brace by brace when they finished the last crew of carpenters cut the door into eskkars workroom connecting the two chambers for the first time during construction the laborers entered by ladders from the courtyard so as not to disturb eskkar and trellas private quarters any more than necessary this morning the last of the tables benches and other furnishings had arrived and settled into place the gleaming white walls added to the sunlight slanting down through the slit windows spaced around three sides of the room fifteen paces long and twelve paces in width the chamber would provide a secure place for the commanders to plan akkads defense now trella had only to add the final touches that would turn it into something truly unique well ismenne are you ready to begin yes lady trella corios daughter clutched a bulky sack in both hands trella had offered to help her with it but ismenne shocked at the idea that lady trella should actually lift anything herself insisted she could manage alone trella moved inside running her fingers down the long rectangular table that sat in the center of the room almost as long and half as wide as the map room the tables plank surface and its ten stools dominated the chamber this end will point to the north trella said she helped ismenne lift the sack onto the bare table from bisitun to sumer are you sure you have everything you need to get started yes lady trella the rest is downstairs in my room bantor and annoksur had once used that chamber as their home but over a year ago bantor had purchased a house for his wife and daughter down the lane still annoksur used her former home often enough especially when eskkar traveled to the north to stay close by trellas side the idea of having a room practically to herself had excited ismenne as much as working with trella ill have one of the servants carry your models and sketches up to the workroom trella said you can move them into here yourself ismenne nodded and started pulling thin strips of wood from the sack and spreading them out on the surface for the last three months she had prepared drawings of the major cities and villages whose shapes would soon be sketched painted or modeled onto the table the girl had attended every meeting where annoksurs agents reported to trella about the lands to the south ismenne also sat in on those meetings where soldiers river men and travelers discussed distances and landmarks it had all started with gatus trella had him march his fully armed and burdened men one hundred paces across the training ground several times marking the area with pegs each time when trella decided she had the proper length gatus trimmed a long spear the exact length of five paces when the measuring spear fitted within the hundred paces exactly twenty times trella had her basic unit of measurement another strip of wood one pace long was matched to the measuring spear now that she had a standard length for a soldiers pace trella provided that distance to her walkers and dispatched them to their destinations bags of pebbles would be used to measure the distances after a hundred paces a pebble would be shifted from the full sack to the empty one a process that would be repeated as long as necessary already trella had calculated the distance between akkad and the nearest villages and her walkers had gone as far north as bisitun as soon as she trusted their skill trella sent the first one south to measure the distance to larsa the nearest of the sumerian cities in the next few months every distance in sumeria would be paced on at least two separate occasions and the tally recorded in the soft clay shards used to keep records eventually the information reached trella and ismenne who would then sketch the distances directly onto the table gatus had provided more information in the last few months he would march his men hard for five days carrying extra provisions and record how far they traveled each day the pace naturally speeding up as the weight of supplies decreased now trella had a figure for the average distance an army of spearmen could travel in any given day it wouldnt be perfect of course differences in the landscape whether hard earth tall grass or soft sand would alter the calculation as would the heat of the day wind or rain or even the scarcity of water but at least they had a beginning and soon akkads leaders not only became more aware of the land around them but knew the marching distance from one place to another trella hadnt stopped with gatus hathor had put his horsemen through the same process now he knew how far his men could ride in a given day even yavtar had contributed matching the travel times for various ships and measuring the distance along the tigris and the other main streams that flowed to the south on their way to the great sea a ll these numbers and measurements found their way into the map room where ismenne worked from dawn until dusk she attended countless meetings with trellas walkers as well as the citys traders and merchants to them the girl seemed nothing more than a minor servant or a clerk helping trella record their information but the girl listened to every report every story about the landscape the hills and valleys what the walkers saw and felt everything trella could extract from their memories when they were gone ismenne would begin a new sketch matching what shed learned against her previous attempts slowly the long table underwent a change turning into a map that illustrated every major feature of the countryside between akkad and the cities of the south every bend in the river every stream that fed into the tigris every hill and valley took its place on the map eventually the table ceased to exist giving birth to the map that would guide eskkar and his senior men through the coming war by the end of the first year the map stretched from bisitun to the great sea beyond sumer but the work never ended trella continued to gather new information from her spies and she relayed it to ismenne traders travelers even explorers trella spoke with them all gathering information as innocently as possible in that same year ismenne passed from child to woman her body filling out she stood a hand taller than trella now with hair as dark as her mistress strangers often assumed ismenne to be trellas younger sister fortunately for trella at least ismennes change into womanhood bonded her even closer to her queen ismenne felt no urge to marry no awkward feelings toward the boys and young men around her no rush to experience the pleasure of the gods she understood the importance of her work and was determined to see it to completion i n their workroom trella faced eskkar across the table after being gone for almost forty days visiting the horse camps in the north eskkar had worked up quite an appetite and he consumed almost all the sausage cheese and bread the servants carried up to their chamber trella ate her fill too like most people in akkad she preferred to eat only twice each day in the midmorning and at the days end at last eskkar pushed his plate away and leaned back in his chair with a smile of satisfaction on his face are you ready to meet with your men he nodded yes now i can face a long day of talking im not sure why but the food here at the house always tastes better than anywhere else he reached across the table and touched her hand perhaps our lovemaking improves the flavor she clasped his hand he had practically dragged her into bed as soon as he arrived pausing only long enough to wash up at the well before their passion subsided the evening supper had come and gone and they had dined on cold chicken and bread before he fell asleep your commanders should be arriving now she could already hear gatus shouting about something or other in the courtyard below he and the others had been summoned by eskkar to discuss what progress they had made and to hear about his inspection of the northern camps i have a surprise for all of you this morning the map room is ready for use eskkar lifted his eyes to the door when he had left for the north two planks nailed across the entrance sealed the room shut now all traces of the planks had vanished and the door stood ajar let me see he started to rise let it be a surprise eskkar none of your men have visited it either so you might as well see it all together heavy steps sounded on the stairs eskkar were coming up gatus had a powerful voice that penetrated throughout the house trella stood by eskkars side as gatus pushed the door open and the commanders filed into the workroom good morning she said nodding in turn to bantor hathor alexar mitrac klexor drakis and yavtar who like eskkar had returned yesterday from another voyage to the south today you will have your first meeting in the map room i think you will find it quite a surprise the gods know youve been building it long enough gatus said but he softened his voice as he always did when speaking to trella i hope its worth the wait follow me then she led the way pushing the door open one by one they stepped across the threshold and every one sounded a gasp or uttered words of astonishment eskkar the last to enter found his men gathering about a long table that stretched nearly the length of the room trella had moved to the far end standing beside her was another woman this is corios daughter ismenne she has done most of the work on the map and is the best person to answer your questions trella could have explained it just as well but wanted the soldiers to know how she felt about ismenne trella wanted ismenne to have their trust and that would be best accomplished by keeping her not only in the room but privy to all the questions and information the commanders possessed youve grown into a woman ismenne eskkar said as he approached the head of the table he too gazed down at the map in wonderment and this is all your work yes lord eskkar now every man in the room stared at the map they could see the miniature city of akkad marked out by the curve in the river the village of bisitun the gold camp at nuzi the horse and training camps to the north eskkar moved down the table his fingers trailing along the edge of the table following the river until he stood beside the city of larsa the first of the sumerian cities the citys outline looked different from what he remembered from years ago he extended his finger to touch the map then hesitated and glanced at trella eskkar knew a map sketched on papyrus required a pointing stick to avoid damaging the material or smudging the image ismenne understood the unasked question you may touch the map lord eskkar these colors will not smear unless you rub them too hard and any marks can be easily removed or repaired she has painted and repainted every spot on the map dozens of times trella added what are these lines hathor had leaned over the table and pointed at the model of akkad a series of short strokes radiated out from the city in several directions the black lines show how many days march any place on the map is from akkad the red lines trella extended her slim arm and pointed to another group of lines indicate a days ride for a company of horsemen as you can see there are five black lines leading from akkad to bisitun but only three red lines now you can understand why i have had so many questions about men and horses for gatus and hathor and yavtar too for traveling times up and down the rivers those are the white lines marking the downstream water routes and the blue lines upstream so its three days march to the gold mine at nuzi eskkar said letting his own fingers step over the lines as he counted as gatus explained to me trella said that assumes the men are carrying their shields spears swords some food and their water skins and assuming there is one pack horse for every forty men if the soldiers have to carry more then each days journey will take longer the pack horse carried the mens cooking pots a shovel and other odds and ends needed by the men hathor and eskkar had argued over the cavalrys number of pack animals before finally settling on one pack animal for every thirty men a large train of animals would slow a fastmoving force both men had agreed that the cavalry should move at least three times faster than a company of men on foot so it is five days march to kanesh gatus said his eyes blinking as he strained to see the markings and from there another four days march to larsa gatus trella knew could see things at a distance without difficulty but lately had trouble seeing things close up another problem of those who lived to old age yes our walkers have estimated these distances and made adjustments for the terrain so if the land is hilly or ground soft it will take longer to cover the same distance i can see where well need yavtars boats to bring supplies eskkar said his finger brushing several places on the map and other sites where we should store food and weapons supplies too should be prepared in advance perhaps hidden or buried in the earth your boats are going to make the difference in the coming war yavtar trella nodded her husband never failed to impress her by his knowledge of such things as gatus had once told her eskkar could take in a battleground at a glance and come up with the best plan of action he did it without thinking the natural skill of a man who had fought many engagements im building three kinds of boats lady trella yavtar said lifting his eyes from the map for the first time you might want to add more lines for the different types of vessels yes thats a good idea trella turned to ismenne well work with yavtar tomorrow to get estimates of his fighting ships as well as his messenger craft the war vessels that yavtar had designed with their larger crews could move faster than a heavily laden boat carrying cargo the smaller speedier craft would be mainly used to carry news and reports for these a crew of eight to twelve rowers would speed the craft up or down the river eskkar stepped down to the other end of the table to where trella stood before the great sea the model of the city of sumer was as large as the one of akkad and this is what the city looks like now as best we can know one of corios sons visited the city a few months ago and memorized the layout but there is much building of walls going on and it may have already changed as we get new reports ismenne will adjust the model eskkar lifted his eyes to the girl a great deal of responsibility rested on her shoulders if her drawings were wrong if the information she provided incorrect the results could be serious even deadly trella saw the look and understood eskkars thoughts now that you have all seen the map you can understand how useful it may be ismenne and i will be examining and testing each line on the map and all of you will help provide any new information or corrections that need to be made if we keep the map current and accurate it should help you plan the war it will indeed lady trella even in the land of egypt where many models of cities were built ive never seen such a thing then i think hathor that you and everyone here will agree that this room and its contents must remain a secret the fewer who know of its existence the better ismenne and i would ask that you tell no one of this not your wives or lovers or even your subcommanders if sumer learns of this and build their own map room much of our advantage will disappear all our lives may depend on keeping this secret who else knows of this eskkars voice held that grim tone that told trella told everyone in the chamber that he had made up his mind corio and ismenne of course trella said as well as annoksur and grond others may know that this room will be used for planning but no one else has seen inside aside from you leaders no one else knows how much effort and detail went into building this even the servants have been forbidden to enter or even to discuss its existence since the chamber could be entered only from eskkar and trellas private quarters the map room door would be seen by very few which should help hold its secrets then i suggest that we all heed trellas words eskkar said the hard edge still in his words this place should not be mentioned to anyone else everyone nodded they were all hawk clan she knew they would heed his words then we can start our planning she said who wishes to begin three months later eskkar and trella rode into the mining village of nuzi just after midday trella had never visited the place before but eskkar had stopped by twice since the digging began both times when he traveled north to visit the horse camps his descriptions of those brief stopovers hadnt satisfied her curiosity and while orodess reports of steady progress had proved satisfactory trella decided she wanted to see nuzi for herself orodes had started sending gold back to trella almost from the start within ten days of his return to the mine the first sacks of gold dust had reached akkad nuggets sifted out of the stream or dug from the hills and borders of the flowing water soon followed since those first deliveries a heavily guarded boat arrived every five days bringing gold and silver to trellas coffers to safeguard the precious metals trella ordered a small house with thick walls and a solidbeamed roof built within the compound the new chamber also provided a place for the two goldsmiths to work under close supervision they hammered and worked the gold silver and copper extracted from the mine into coins at orodess recommendation each coin was carefully trimmed and worked into a round shape that carried the mark of akkad on one side and the hawk emblem on the other almost as soon as the coins appeared in the marketplace they set the standard for quality that other merchants and traders were forced to match good as eskkars gold became the new criterion for value throughout akkad and the countryside despite trellas best efforts to keep nuzi a secret word of the kings gold mine quickly spread gold seemed to loosen the tongue of everyone who came into contact with it every laborer soldier and miner working at the site whispered news of the gold and silver deposits within months the hills and valleys surrounding the village held dozens of groups of ore hunters all searching for another cache of gold but orodes had spoken the truth about the find whatever precious metals existed nearby remained locked deep within the earth inaccessible to even the most determined seeker tooraj with the help of a handful of hawk clan soldiers established a tight ring of security around the mine and surrounding valley gangs of laborers dug away at the hills shearing them into vertical cliffs that only a mountain goat could have scaled soldiers guarded the single entrance to nuzi day and night and every person leaving the site man woman or child was stripped naked and searched some desperate laborers swallowed nuggets to conceal them but that trick carried its own risks in the first month two men died clutching their bellies within days of leaving nuzi orodes issued a decree that anyone caught attempting to smuggle any precious metal out of the site would labor alongside the slaves for six months since a good number of the slaves and thieves forced to work at the mine died within that length of time not many were willing to risk their lives for the handful of gold they might purloin nevertheless trella felt certain that small quantities of gold and silver still found their way out of the valley but as long as orodes kept such pilfering small and inconsequential trella didnt concern herself about the loss as eskkars little caravan approached nuzi trella saw the smoke from the smelting fires rising over the hills well before they reached the entrance the acrid fumes from the open furnaces assailed her senses the smell alone would have told anyone within a mile that gold silver and the other noble metals were being ripped from the earth and burned out of the rocks and minerals that held them about time they saw us coming eskkar said the lazy fools wouldnt have had time to close the gate before we cut them down the group had drawn within a hundred paces of the stout gates fastened to tall beams buried into the hillside before any of the sentries noticed the fifteen heavily armed riders approaching i think theyre more concerned about anyone trying to ride out not in husband trellas effort failed to soothe eskkars annoyance four men he muttered at least one of them should have been keeping an eye on the trail the chagrined sentries scrambled about belatedly the halfhearted challenge died as they recognized akkads king trella heard the muffled chuckles of the hawk clan guards riding behind them like most fighting men they enjoyed the spectacle of some other soldier receiving a tonguelashing for failing to do his duty they knew the king would point out this dereliction to tooraj who in turn would no doubt make the guards lives miserable for a few days eskkar gave the merest nod to acknowledge the salutes as they paced the horses through the gate and into the valley once inside trella wrinkled her nose at the powerful odors of burning wood and molten metal inside the valley more than seventy people labored a mix of men women and children were occupied digging carrying wood or tending the halfdozen smelting fires others worked building mud bricks using the water from the stream and straw that had been carried in by mule carpenters hammered bronze nails into wood raising structures that enabled the slaves to move the heavy sacks of ores work also progressed on new flues and sluices to separate the ores stacks of lumber ordered in prodigious quantities by orodes were scattered about a shaduf worked by three sturdy women handled the heaviest loads its long arm lifting and moving the weight with relative ease all this activity fascinated trella she turned toward eskkar but saw his eyes taking in the guards riding patrol on the hilltops overlooking the valley those crests held three watch stations small shaded towers where a guard could see down into the valley and also anyone trying to gain access to the site from the surrounding hillsides with so much wealth being taken from the earth every possible security measure needed to be taken to prevent thefts the noble metals required too much sweat and labor to wring them from the earth and were guarded accordingly eskkar helped trella down from her horse as orodes approached wiping his hands on a filthy apron that stretched below his knees to trellas eyes the mine master seemed older more mature and filled with confidence orodes had responded well to the responsibility shed given him according to tooraj everyone respected his skills perhaps the time had come to find him a wife to help him settle down and keep him from falling back into his bad habits lord eskkar lady trella welcome to nuzi i didnt know you were coming we didnt want to upset your labors trella spoke quickly to forestall any biting remark from her husband about a surprise inspection were eager to see what youve accomplished ill spend some time with tooraj eskkar said as the leader of nuzis soldiers walked toward them moving as fast as he could without breaking into a run ive seen the mine before her husband might be interested in all the gold and silver the mine could produce but he cared little for how they were obtained trella suspected there might be another reason for his lack of interest eskkar had told her much about his past but some parts of his earlier life remained a mystery he seemed to know more about mining than he cared to admit then orodes can show me around the valley the smile orodes gave her announced that he would like nothing better than to have her undivided attention let me show you where it all began lady trella he said orodes led her to the far end of the valley where the stream flowed from the cliff face stones set in hardened mud now arched the water that spilled into the pool creating a small waterfall this is where i found the first nuggets now all our drinking water comes from this place more stones set in the pool provided easy access to the falling water once the water leaves this pool its directed into the various sluices to separate the ores after that its unfit to drink even the animals need to be kept away trella studied the water watching how the original course of the stream had been divided and diverted into three separate sluices orodes certainly knew his craft she decided those water channels maintained an even flow to each trough and with scarcely any leakage when she lifted her eyes she found him staring intently at her she recognized the look another man smitten by her position yes trella decided orodes definitely needed a wife orodes realized he was staring and dropped his eyes for a moment are you ready for the next step in the process yes and i want you to explain everything to me everything they walked and spoke until darkness fell orodes explained how the raw ores were washed inspected and separated again and again until each particular pile contained a high content of specific minerals then the materials were crushed into smaller chunks sifted again in running water then heated in a furnace sometimes with charcoal or other materials some of which were delivered daily to nuzi when various impurities were burned off the resulting raw metals were examined again some samples were reheated and reprocessed others bagged into sacks for storage or transport she recognized the green of copper ore malachite orodes called it and the reddish tint that signified lead with most of the surface gold already gone orodes went on well have to extract it in smaller quantities from the other processes that yield copper tin and iron once everything is ground down to a fine powder we can wash it again to extract the gold dust though as i expected silver will soon be nuzis most valuable product already i need more toolmakers to fashion hammers and other implements were breaking tools almost every day chiseling our way into the rocks and floor of the valley trella paused and watched laborers hammering a bronze chisel into the rock face until it cracked then levering the small opening until the rocks broke away fire too could be used to heat the stones when they grew hot a bucket of water tossed against the heated surface would split even the hardest rock how many men will you need to bring nuzi to full production not counting the farmers and soldiers just those working in this valley at least a hundred slaves and as many craftsmen with that many laborers and the new process ive established to sift and sieve the ores i think well be able to extract as much of the noble metals as feasible of course ill need a steady supply of firewood with that i can make my own charcoal shed already considered that request soon as many boats as departed from nuzi would be arriving laden down with all the dozens of specialized tools and goods that orodes needed to operate the mine efficiently trella realized it would be up to her to establish and maintain such a flow of materials some from as far away as the northern forests and it would take a good portion of the wealth extracted just to keep the flow of the precious metal coming again and again trella asked orodes to go into more detail at last trella felt she understood every facet of how the mine worked if another goldsmith were needed she would know how to question him orodes youve done well she said after he had finished his tour of the site when you first started you asked for a share of the mines profits after what ive seen today i believe youve earned it from now on one part in fifty of every shipment will be yours my thanks to you lady trella for having faith in me it is more than sufficient by the time nuzi ceased operating orodes would probably be the richest man in akkad as the setting sun signaled the end of the days labors eskkar arrived walking with tooraj her husband would have spent the afternoon discussing ways to stop thieves and raiders ensure the soldiers stayed honest and alert and keep the evergrowing number of slaves under control toorajs labors would be almost as difficult as orodes tooraj would also need to be properly paid she would see to that as well he too could probably use a wife have you finished your inspection husband eskkar couldnt keep the smile off his face as happy for the good news tooraj had given him as for avoiding a long session with orodes what trella found fascinating would have bored her husband to death besides eskkar knew he could trust her to keep orodes in check yes tooraj has everything under control as does orodes he has built a very productive site as im sure tooraj has already informed you the silver from nuzi will flow to akkad and it will be enough to meet our needs for some time she placed her hand on eskkars arm now i think it is time for supper the three men standing facing her all looked guilty none of them had given a single thought to a proper evening meal oh well that would be one more task she would have to perform queen kushanna frowned at the man kneeling before her the guards had made a halfhearted effort to clean him up at the well probably by throwing a few buckets of water over him they knew better than to bring someone filthy into her presence nevertheless the wretch still showed the thick black bands of dirt under the chipped and cracked nails on his hands and feet and no quick scrub with a rag could remove all the grime imbedded into his face his thin arms and legs had almost no flesh on them and the unruly shock of black hair already streaked with gray nearly concealed his face death from either hunger or exhaustion would have taken him soon she realized are you sure this is the one sohrab id hate to think you brought back the wrong man after all this time sohrab had departed nearly a month ago and had returned by boat at dusk yesterday yes queen kushanna it took some time to find him the original buyer sold him to she waved her hand to silence him hand me the whip her chief spy removed the leather lash from his wrist and offered it to kushanna she used the stiffened plaited leather grip to lift the mans head so that she could read his eyes a mans eyes revealed so much about him much more than a womans this ones gaze appeared dull and listless the eyes of one grown accustomed to the brutality of others the ability to think would have been beaten out of him long ago now only fear of the whip could motivate a slave this far gone whats your name slave the man stared at the whip no doubt sohrab had used it often enough on the slaves back almaric mistress the voice was properly humble the brown eyes downcast hed been a slave for more than three years and the gods must have blessed him to keep alive so long at the mine look at me when you speak she commanded where are you from who was your father the eyes blinked as the man struggled to remember his mouth opened but no words came kushanna struck him across the face with the whip not hard enough to break the skin but sharp enough to raise a welt almaric flinched at the pain but knew better than to raise his hands or protest carnax mistress im from carnax he glanced about but saw no mercy from sohrab or the two guards and your father ahhhaaa my father was his brow furrowed as he struggled to recall the past kushanna raised the whip again but before she could strike almaric found the words sargat mistress my father was sargat of carnax advisor to the village elder any imposter or properly coached slave might know those facts kushanna however had spoken at length to drusas the slaver even facing the usual threats hed recalled little about almaric not even the boys name but drusas remembered a wealth of detail about a young girl named trella how she was offered for sale as a virgin who could count and read the symbols even that she possessed the healing knowledge hed sold her to a trader named nicar on his way home to akkad now eskkars chief justice more important drusas recalled having trella kneel naked before him while she read the symbols and counted her numbers tell me about your sister whats her name the question startled almaric but kushanna lifted the whip again trella mistress my sisters name is trella good very good almaric perhaps you would like some water she gestured to the guard who filled a cup from a pitcher and handed it the prisoner almaric gulped the contents down in a few swallows spilling a good portion on his chest and the floor between his knees kushanna forced a smile to her face if a servant had spilled that much water she would have had the unlucky offender whipped now describe your sister to me slave all you know of her the story required many promptings but kushanna only used the whip once more eventually the detail kushanna sought emerged as the brother recalled a small brown mole beneath the sisters left breast drusas had remembered the same mark on the slave girl he sold to nicar no one else would know that fact not even sohrab satisfied at last kushanna handed the whip back to sohrab then turned to the guard take him down to the slaves quarters for now feed him well and give him some ale tell my master steward almaric is not to be whipped except by my order she waited until the guard removed the slave then turned to sohrab youve done well that is indeed trellas brother we were doubly fortunate to find him still alive in his condition im surprised the mines owner didnt have him killed yes queen kushanna he knew the symbols so at the first dig he was put to work helping count the sacks of ore that kept him out of the pits after two years he was sold to a second mine they had no need of a slave who could count or read the symbols so he went down into the mine he would have been dead in a few more months they sold him for a single silver coin and were glad to take advantage of me you could have taken him for nothing kushanna said they would have given him up fast enough at my order i thought it best not to use your name my queen this way no one knows of your interest in such a laborer she smiled at sohrabs ingenuity he was learning to anticipate her commands i see i chose wisely when i sent you to find trellas brother now we have to make use of him his wits are addled but perhaps with rest and good food and plenty of time he may recover the healthier almaric is the more value he will have for now take him to my farm south of sumer see to it that he is given only simple tasks and treated well and watch over his progress if he remembers how to think we will send for him again yes my queen and you think he will be useful in the coming war perhaps he is the only one of trellas kin that remains alive who knows she may care more for him than her husband at the least shell pay well to have him returned to her shall i send such a message to trella of akkad not yet sohrab not yet in due time you can deliver the message yourself eskkar frowned at the wellworn tracks that led to the valley north of bisitun three months ago when he and hathor first visited the place with a dozen ur nammu warriors the ground showed no sign of anyones passage through the land now the pristine emptiness of the hill country had changed from the depth of the tracks he knew horses oxen wagons cattle sheep men women and even children in increasing numbers had followed the same trail over the last three months no doubt all of them bearing burdens of one kind or another probably not a day went by without another group of men or wagonload of supplies arriving still when eskkar crested the last hill a little before sunset and saw the valley below he halted his horse in surprise a walled village grond halted his horse beside that of his captain well i suppose it is not much of a wall though or a village either eskkar let his eyes take in the site below a mudbrick wall just tall enough to keep a horse from jumping over it ambled its way across the entrance to the valley he guessed it to be at least two hundred paces from end to end maybe even more a wide gate near the center provided access beside the gate a lone lookout tower twice the height of the gate rose up its skeletal logs providing little more than a platform where a man or two could stand farther behind the wall huts and tents extended a good distance into the valley and eskkar could see three separate horse pens one of them empty smoke rose from several cooking fires the gray streams curling lazily into the blue sky before following the wind to the east the ringing sound of a bronze hammer pounding on a shaping stone echoed off the valleys walls as he watched an empty wagon pulled by two oxen emerged from the gate no doubt headed back to bisitun to pick up another load of whatever goods hathor and his commanders needed the men conveying cargoes between bisitun and here would be earning plenty of coins for their hard labor all this in only three months while eskkar had seen how well villagers could dig and build during the siege this matched anything hed seen at akkad hathor knows his business grond said you picked the right man to build your cavalry they rode down the hill followed by the ten hawk clan guards who had accompanied eskkar all the way from akkad the lookout guard saw their approach and raised a shout that must have carried halfway up the valley in moments six bowmen appeared from behind the wall readying their weapons efficiently and taking their stations without anyone shouting orders at them eskkar grunted in approval the camps discipline appeared sound by the time he and grond reached the gate the guards had already unstrung their bows and waved them in greeting hathor arrived to join those standing by the gate hands on his hips waiting for them welcome to horse valley lord eskkar hathor had a grin on his face and good to see you again grond eskkar swung down from the horse and the two men clasped each others arms im glad i decided to come it looks like youve built a village here since the last time i was here hathor glanced around and shrugged this is nothing wait until you see the training ground come ive much to tell you he called for his horse and a soldier brought out a fine brown stallion follow me he put his heels to the horse and cantered up into the valley eskkar mounted and rode beside him beyond the horse pens the valley curved and he saw another much smaller wall blocking a cleft into the valleys walls thats where the ur nammu keep their animals hathor gestured with his hand they camp there at night the masons built it for them in three days halfway up the valley hathor halted a long house had been built here along with another corral filled with ten or more horses this is where my commanders and trainers sleep well stay here tonight that will give me time to order up a feast in your honor and prepare the men for tomorrow too late in the day to start a goat roasting but we have some chickens enough to make a good stew well save the goat to celebrate another day eskkar glanced up the valley in the distance he saw a small herd of horses roaming free a feast trella told me you were starving up here well we were for the first month now weve plenty of food and ale too for that matter grain chickens vegetables everything we need comes from bisitun as the women arrived they started building ovens and now they bake bread dozens of loaves each day more than enough for everyone we started giving some to the ur nammu and they started bringing game into camp at days end so everyone is eating well how many men do you have up here hathor had to stop and think about two hundred men and another hundred women and children youll see most of them here tonight when we heard you were arriving in a few days the first two companies of cavalry had just finished the first part of their training so i promised everyone a feast in your honor theyll all want to see and hear their king that meant another speech still hathor and the others had made remarkable progress establishing the training camp eskkar hadnt expected any of the soldiers to have completed their training this soon so they deserved at least a few words of praise unlike the steppe warriors who started riding as small children held in their fathers arms many villagers knew little about horses for them learning to ride and fight from the back of a racing animal meant overcoming their fears real enough considering the size and speed of a horse by the time eskkar grond and his guards took care of their horses and washed off the dust of their journey in the stream the preparations for the feast were well under way soldiers carried armfuls of wood and started new campfires women and children crowded about as curious to see the man who ruled their lands as to do the cooking two grinning soldiers dispensed and guarded the ale supply but provided each man and woman with at least a cup of ale eskkar guessed that a few soldiers would be drunk before dark everyone wanted to talk to the king every soldier every recruit found some excuse to visit hathors little camp even the laborers and craftsmen soon heard about eskkars presence and joined the crowd children some barely able to walk wandered over to stare in openmouthed silence at the darkhaired man though most soon decided that the tall and somber figure looked no different from any other man and they wandered off to play their games many people brought their own food with them content to sit on the grass as close to eskkar and his companions as they could get he wanted to talk to hathor to learn what progress had been made but it proved impossible when fashod chinua and four other smiling ur nammu warriors joined them a shout of welcome rose up eskkar had never seen or heard anything like that before villagers cheering barbarians he still felt it odd that excited people often shouted out his own name with a smile eskkar forced himself to relax the feast would have to come first and from the looks of the ale being poured it would go on for some time i n the morning eskkars head throbbed with pain hed eaten too much food drunk too much ale and in general behaved more like a halfdrunken warrior than a king now he stood outside pissing on the rocks that lay scattered behind the house and sighing in relief the ground in front of the house had been trampled flat but at least none of hathors men lay there in a stupor the egyptian had seen to that making sure everyone got a few cups of ale but no more by now every man aching head or not had returned to his station when eskkar walked back into the house he found grond waiting holding a cup of water that contained only a splash of ale eskkar drank it down without pausing it helped but it took a second cup to quench his thirst and ease the pounding in his head grab some bread captain grond suggested hathors waiting with his commanders eskkar clenched his jaw more embarrassment they had let him sleep while others had gotten up at dawn and gone about their business yesterdays ride to the valley had been long and tiring but probably no worse than the days training many of the men had undergone no doubt everyone believed he was getting old and needed his rest the gloomy thought darkened his brow and he followed grond out to the side of the house where hathor had set up his command post the egyptian greeted them his face had resumed its somber look now that eskkar thought about it last night was the first time hed ever seen hathor laughing or even smiling so much he motioned for eskkar to sit on the ground beside him and grond took his station just slightly behind his king instead of the usual circle seven subcommanders faced their leaders and one look at the ground explained that arrangement a rough model of the valley had been dug into dirt showing the long valley the horse pens and the training grounds well start here lord eskkar hathor began after we explain what weve done well inspect the training grounds and my commanders will give you a demonstration of their mens horsemanship good eskkar tried not to sound impatient though he wanted to see the recruits in action not stare at the dirt still one had to begin somewhere ill start with the horses hathor began the ur nammu still break most of them but a few of my best riders have started helping them with that its a difficult task the men get thrown stepped on and one particularly clumsy fool managed to break his arm eskkar realized that one of the men facing him had his left arm in a sling a few of hathors commanders chuckled at the remark and eskkar saw the sheepish look of the man with the injured arm eskkar nodded in sympathy such accidents happened to everyone sooner or later men were thrown or fell from the horse stepped on scraped against trees and shrubs and even bitten horses that would charge full speed into a battle might take fright at a blowing bush and either bolt or start bucking any such sudden motion could launch their unsuspecting rider through the air and of course these things usually happened just when you thought you had the animal under your control once the animal can be ridden hathor continued we spend most of the morning riding them around the valley and the nearby hills getting horse and rider used to each other the ur nammu showed us their way of caring for their mounts so now each rider cleans grooms and feeds his own horse we even have a few extra mounts for the trainers we rest the animals during midday to save them from the heat while the men train with swords knives lances and bows we dont have enough bows to go around but the bowyers in bisitun are working as fast as they can and the ur nammu have contributed a few more every time they return from their main camp weve a good supply of lances already can our men handle the bow while they ride eskkar had worried about this since he first envisioned using cavalry much the same way as the barbarians did to charge their enemy loosing shafts as they rode before wheeling off and forming up for another attack if fifty men launched five or six arrows during each charge that meant close to three hundred arrows raining down on the enemy force with very little opportunity for them to shoot back barbarians considered this their most important tactic especially when used against dirteaters or in the case of sumeria massed infantry weve less than twenty men learning to use that weapon and their progress is slow hathor admitted but theyre improving and i think it can be done at least for some of the younger and better riders well have to see but their ur nammu teachers expressed satisfaction with their progress those who cant are taught how to throw a lance thats difficult enough to do from horseback but some of our men are getting good at it barbarians such as the ur nammu learned to ride and shoot from a horses back almost from birth eskkar understood that villagers would never achieve a steppe warriors level of skill in a few months if ever he knew he could not do it himself his training with the clan had been interrupted before he had a chance to master the bow from the back of a horse not that he would ever have been very proficient eskkar was too tall to be a good archer from horseback and his large hands lacked the dexterity needed to draw and nock an arrow while riding at a dead run if using a bow cant be done hathor dont waste the mens time id rather have a good rider flinging a lance and swinging a sword than a poor archer fumbling with a bow a lance usually not any taller than a man made for a deadly weapon when thrown from the back of a charging horse with the speed of the animal to add strength to the riders arm a flung lance could pass right through a mans body or impale a horse in the last few months eskkar had spent quite a bit of time practicing with that weapon since he knew he could never shoot a bow on the run the lance gave him the best weapon to strike an enemy at a distance we have many months before we have to make that decision hathor replied and youre right not many will be able to master that kind of archery right now the main thing is to teach the men how to ride and fight from horseback learning to ride well is a difficult and painful task that takes months to master weve had two men killed so far and lost a few horses to broken legs both men had their necks broken after being thrown now as soon as we think a man wont make a good rider we stop his training no need to waste men or horses and ive had to send back a few men those who couldnt control themselves or the horse while swinging a sword more than a few eskkar had heard the reports of those who couldnt master the needed skills still the numbers were fewer than hed expected not everyone had the strength in their legs and back that enabled them to keep their seat while guiding a galloping horse across rough ground with one hand and swinging a sword with the other just as important was each riders sense of balance a man needed to know how and when to lean forward or to the side how to move with the animal striking with a sword required plenty of balancing ability otherwise the rider would crash to the earth with the first blow to use a bow from a fastmoving horse required even more balance since you needed two hands to use the bow and you still had to guide the horse with your legs voice and the halter while snatching another arrow from the quiver and fitting it to the bowstring another task that took plenty of practice hand and leg movements had to guide the horse with precision while the rider kept his balance with the animal racing beneath him hathor waited a moment then continued to train so many horses at the same time requires plenty of work like their riders some horses even after theyre broken arent meant for warfare almost all of the horses we select are about thirteen to fourteen hands high which gives them the size and bulk needed to carry a man and his weapons still some taller animals dont have the endurance and a few smaller ones do as well as their taller brethren though we make sure those mounts are matched with a small rider every barbarian including eskkar preferred to ride his largest and strongest horse into battle and the ur nammu have found enough horses of that size to bring to us yes subutai has his men out riding all the way to the steppes to gather more wild stock at least those animals will know how to fight unlike the tame horses raised in the villagers corrals a horse raised in the wild could be a fearful fighter life in the herd involved biting kicking and banging into other horses stallions fought and often killed to protect their mares and the mares fought to protect their colts those same instincts made for a good warhorse as the sun rose higher in the morning sky hathor explained the rest of his training procedures stopping often to answer eskkars questions twice hathor turned to one or another of his commanders for a more precise answer by then eskkar knew all their names and responsibilities now i think its time to inspect the horses captain and while were doing that my men will prepare for the demonstration were going to have two forces charge each other so you can see how they ride and how they fight eskkar climbed to his feet his head had cleared and he felt rested and refreshed it would be good to feel a horse between his knees again come on grond lets see what these men can do they can ride captain hathor assured him and i think theyll fight well when the time comes then my trip was well worth the effort after your commanders have finished id like to ride with your men and take some practice with a lance i dont always get enough time in akkad hathor nodded then ill join you if i may we can hurl a few dozen lances and see how many targets we can hit and since i saw you practicing your swordsmanship with a lance in your left hand ive been doing it myself i learned that from gatus he has his infantry using their spears in all manner of ways you never know when it might come in handy to have a second weapon lets hope we never need it in a battle hathor said but always better to prepare for trouble than be caught by surprise shulgi lay back in the comfortable bed enjoying the feel of the soft cloth against his naked body the chatter of birds floated through the window as well as the fainter sounds of sumers inhabitants bustling about their morning business dawn had risen some time ago but no one would disturb the warrior king of sumer in his bedchamber all the citys inhabitants envied their king his good fortune to have the voluptuous queen kushanna in his bed no matter what they might think about her strict rule over their lives brother and sister had brought peace and a measure of prosperity to the city and few even remembered their father dead now for over a year the rumors that eridu had died at his sons hand had faded from memory three months had passed since shulgis last return to sumer in all that time hed seldom slept on anything softer than a blanket stretched over hard ground in truth he hadnt spent more than a few months in the city since taking power instead hed ridden up and down the length of the desert chasing the last of the salibs even those who fled deep into the west to escape their destruction had taken longer than hed expected but he felt more than satisfied with the result an army of horsemen at his command before shulgi reluctantly turned his horses head back toward sumer hed conquered another six desert clans and covered more than half the distance to the fabled land of egypt with the elimination of the last of the salibs the mocking title of boy king vanished as well egypt would be his next conquest after hed crushed akkad and forced its people into his new sumerian empire once he had the additional manpower from akkad and the northern lands he would have an army large enough to invade egypt but that effort would have to wait a few more years when he finished conquering akkad shulgi knew he would need at least another year or two to solidify his rule over the remnants of the akkadian lands as well as the other cities of sumeria after shulgi eliminated their petty rulers and installed men loyal only to himself he would reign supreme the only king in the vast land between the rivers first akkad then egypt then only the gods knew how far shulgi could stretch his reach what are your thoughts my brother shanna ran her fingertips down his arm and onto his stomach shulgis thoughts of empire vanished at her touch and his manhood stirred even before her hand closed around it hed taken her twice last night as soon as he returned to sumer and once again this morning no matter how often he possessed her it needed only a word a look the feel of her breast to make him hunger for her body again shulgi wondered how shed learned to arouse such passion in a man perhaps kushanna too was a witch like the queen of akkad he wondered if eskkar felt the same lust for his wife not likely he decided those who had seen both women voiced only disdain for trellas plain looks and simple attire i was thinking how soft your lips are when they touch my body shanna mmm yes such a beautiful body so strong and so fierce a rod since youve ridden to war youve grown even more handsome a true king she tightened her grip and his erection sprang up throbbing taking her time she moved down the bed settled herself comfortably and let her breasts dangle against his thigh she brushed her lips lightly against his staff teasing him until he squirmed under her touch the urge to penetrate her body growing ever more demanding take me in your mouth he commanded unable to restrain himself he used the same voice he would give orders to any soldier oh yes my lord whatever you command still taking her time she closed her mouth over the tip of his member and used her tongue to force a moan of pleasure from his lips slowly she took the full length of his manhood into her mouth her hair now scattered across his loins until her lips touched his hard stomach you are a witch no other woman had ever managed to take the full length of his aroused staff into her mouth she lifted her head and took a breath if im a witch why do i do your bidding before he could reply she began stroking his staff this time using her cheek against the tip waves of pleasure rushed through him hed taken plenty of women while away from sumer but none of them compared to her unable to restrain himself any longer shulgi reached down and pulled her toward him with an easy movement she knelt over him and guided his staff inside her body kushanna sighed in pleasure as she sank down on him she clasped her hands behind her neck and leaned back without moving her hips she used the powerful muscles deep inside her womb to squeeze his rod do you like that my brother oh yes shanna he panted there is no one like you then let me take you to the pleasure of the gods she began to move up and down grinding her hips thrusting herself harder and harder against him keeping him deep inside her he felt the warmth of her body as he gazed upon her breasts swaying above him faster and faster she rode his manhood twisting and pushing against him until with a cry he burst inside her even that did not satisfy her she kept moving squeezing him until he protested and pushed her aside enough any more and i wont be able to ride for days she brushed the tangle of hair from her face and stretched out beside him cradling his head against her breasts tonight you will be strong again for me i promise you his arms encircled her as he lay there scarcely able to move shulgi breathed in the warm musk of her body his eyes closed and he let himself relax within moments the feel of her face against his shoulder lulled him back to sleep when he woke he found shanna dressed and standing beside the bed she wore a soft gown of pure white and her slaves had combed her hair artfully to frame her features a tray of fruit bread and ale rested on the table she leaned over and kissed the sleep from his face its time you woke up my brother sumers noble merchants and traders will assemble here at midday to hear of your latest conquests and you dont want your body to grow weak from too much time in bed shulgi smiled at that the long days spent on the back of a horse had tightened every muscle including it seemed his manhood hed never spent his seed so often and with so much force before for a moment shulgi considered telling her to remove her dress he shook the temptation from his mind and pushed himself into a sitting position she handed him the ale cup and he drained its contents some day he knew shanna might hand him a cup of poison with as much grace and concern but not today and not while there remained so many lands to conquer tell me of the desert her voice had lost its pleasureslave tone the cunning queen of his empire had returned he tore a hunk of bread from the loaf the soursweet taste seemed like nectar after the foulsmelling desert fare the last of the salibs are destroyed except for the lands chief kapturu claims the desert is ours then there will be no more slaves arriving in sumer for the last year captive salibs mostly women and children had paraded through sumers lanes to be sold as slaves throughout sumeria and even as far north as akkad shulgis profits from those sales had nearly equaled the gold and gems taken from the desertdwellers kapturus horsemen still range the desert fringes and will continue to supply slaves though the number will be fewer and the cost higher we need all the gold we can raise shulgi he nodded ive brought another thousand gold pieces with me plus three sacks of gemstones perhaps that will satisfy you for a time she shook her head another month perhaps two but more gold will be needed in the coming year unlike trella in akkad we lack a steady supply of silver the mine at nuzi had flooded the northern lands with the precious metal silver coins with the mark of akkad paid the wages of eskkars soldiers have you exhausted all the gold from sumerias mines it seems you spend my spoils of war as fast as i win them kushanna saw the look of frustration on his face all the established mines within sumers reach had been confiscated months ago and their ores used to pay his own soldiers but the output had always been small and kushannas demands had exhausted most of them hundreds of slaves had died extracting what little remained nuzi was a recent find and could be expected to produce large quantities of gold and silver for some time dont chide me with such a frown brother my agents have been busy on your behalf your captured treasures have bought you support in every sumerian city hundreds of voices throughout the land now clamor for war against akkad your victories in the desert along with the gold weve spread around have won support for your cause larsa uruk isin all the cities are raising troops of their own eager to share in the spoils of akkad conquest just so theyre ready to follow my standard into battle that campaign too is already under way with the tanukhs under your command sumer will field the largest part of any combined army because of that the rest of the cities already accept your leadership willingly or not they understand its best to direct their wrath against akkad than each other the heavy bribes weve paid to their merchants and traders help see to that especially now that they know what happened to the salibs its more than that shulgi sumer continues to grow were now twice as large as nippur and the other cities are even smaller their rulers know they will fall under your sway sooner or later the wise among them will seek to gain as much influence from you as possible and as much gold and power as they can wrest from akkads defeat kushanna had indeed done well shulgi had thought it might take another year or two before all of sumeria acknowledged his leadership instead in less than a single year he had already accomplished far more than his father ever dreamed then its time to issue a call for more of their soldiers to join me in the desert the sooner they learn how to fight under my command the better hundreds from the other cities had already flocked to his standard desperate men searching for loot young men seeking glory petty thieves and outcasts seeking escape from their crimes razrek had accepted them all feeding them into his training camps already many had turned into competent fighters and even subcommanders yes my brother that can be done ill dispatch messengers tomorrow any news from akkad of course i have a dozen agents living there and reports come from every trader who visits eskkar continues to recruit men and train them in the north he shuffles them around from training camp to training camp trying to keep their numbers secret but more than a few have deserted thanks to your gold we know all about his spearmen and cavalry but no matter how hard the barbarian tries he wont be able to raise more than three or four thousand fighters perhaps a little more shulgi already had more than that number in his own camps at the edge of the desert with the hordes of tanukh horse fighters eskkar of akkad was greatly outnumbered kushanna saw the look dont count your victory yet brother eskkar is trying to make up for his smaller force with greater training his force of infantry spearmen is reputed to be fierce and his horsemen grow more proficient every day thanks to those accursed steppe barbarians in the north shulgi knew the remnants of the ur nammu had been assisting the akkadians kushanna had tried to reach out to them offered them gold and trading opportunities but the clan had rebuffed her overtures the ur nammu would deal only with akkad despite her bribes and offers of friendship my men are training each day as well and weve fought a dozen battles with the salibs all to the good shulgi but dont grow overconfident you will need every man from every city in sumeria crush the akkadians with numbers eskkar and his men will not go down easily agreed but with an army that small eskkar knows he can only fight a defensive war he expects us to invade his land and besiege his city he hopes to wear us down until we abandon our attacks ill do that if i have to but i prefer to force him out from behind his walls make him fight on my terms youve a plan for that yes ive been working on it for months with razrek and vanar and the others well bring eskkar out of akkad then destroy him kushanna didnt answer instead she picked up a date and split the skin removing the pit our father tried that shulgi took another mouthful of bread before answering our father was a fool he wanted to defeat eskkar himself the man means nothing to me its his city i want if eskkar wants to keep it well then hell come to me fight me on my terms she waited a moment until she realized he didnt intend to offer any more information be aware that trella continues to raise akkads walls higher and higher she can raise them as high as the mountains for all i care he smiled at her and patted her hand and her spies have you found them all most of them and ive put many others to the torture a smile crossed her face at the memory some have confessed spying for trella but im sure there are still a few within the city shulgi knew that kushanna even as a young girl enjoyed watching men tortured it was one of the few things that excited her how do you know when theyre telling the truth its simple if they use trellas name i know theyre lying saying anything to stop the pain when i hear annoksurs name on their lips then i know we captured a spy clever my sister i see im in good hands with you guarding my city there will always be more spies i know dont worry about such things for now did you learn anything more about her brother kushanna accepted the change of subject oh yes we found him working in the copper mine less than fifty miles from here his name is almaric and he is trellas older brother his wits were almost gone when sohrab brought him here but hes recovering and he may be of some use to us at the very least we can exchange him for some gold or use him to distract trella right before we strike much will depend on how much he recovers youre sure you have the right slave drusas remembers trella all right and how he sold her to nicar of akkad apparently drusas felt himself bested in the exchange she was still a virgin when nicar took possession trellas brother was sold to the minga clan who operated a silver mine about three days journey from sumer after a few years he was sold again to a copper mine shulgi shrugged lets hope we can make use of him he will serve some purpose of that im sure trella knows nothing of her brothers fate it might distract her at the right time shulgi considered that for a moment then dismissed it from his thoughts and what of the alur meriki did you ever reach them yes it was difficult but a meeting place was arranged who can we send to meet with them its far too dangerous for you to go well razrek claims he has dealt with them before im sure hes ready to visit the barbarians again he smiled by now hes had enough of the desert and what better way to prove your courage than to put your head in the lions mouth then all that remains is to be patient shulgi assemble your forces and train your men when the time comes to strike ill have all the supplies and food that will be needed im ready now my sister we could defeat akkad today one more year by then your army will have grown even stronger at the end of next summer as soon as our crops are in you can strike the harvest in sumeria if the gods acted as they normally did would take place ten or twenty days before akkad began to take its crops from the field sumerias warmer climate meant that her farmers would reap their harvest before the akkadians that would leave eskkars men short of food at the start of the campaign still a year seemed such a long time she guessed his thoughts it will come sooner than you think my brother and what will my beautiful queen be doing in the coming year helping you raise your mighty army the other cities must prepare as well they will each need to raise and arm thousands of men and they will need to be trained as well our gold has already bought the support of their kings and ruling nobles when you are ready fighting men will march forth from larsa and every other city to follow your banner i will need to visit each of those cities then see to their training meet with their rulers more than once im sure my brother but when you ride into their strongholds at the head of your cavalry strong and confident all will accept your leadership he nodded kushanna spoke the truth best to wait until victory was certain then i will wait one more year but starting tomorrow we begin i want every city in sumeria to begin recruiting and training more men they will my king they will three months later razrek licked the blood from the corner of his mouth and tried to ignore the pain one of his teeth felt loose he probed it with his tongue and grimaced his hands bound tight behind his back hurt even more than his swollen face all this meant nothing compared to what was likely to come next he lifted his eyes toward the tent where the leaders of the alur meriki had gone to talk very likely deciding his fate at least razrek hadnt given in to his fear not yet he glanced at his two companions brave enough men and willing to accompany him in a meeting with the barbarians both had already given themselves up for dead they shook with fear as they knelt on either side of him tied up as tightly as he was the carefully arranged meeting between sumer and the alur meriki had gone horribly wrong from the beginning razrek had reached the agreed place early enough after two days of waiting a band of twenty warriors had galloped into his campsite just after sunrise razrek held up his empty hands and called out the name hed been given urgo of the alur meriki razrek might just have well shouted out his own name the warriors burst upon the three of them they were knocked to the ground and their weapons taken from them neither razreks protests or curses made any difference a viciouslooking warrior with a thick scar across his face led the group the barbarians called him rethnar a clan leader razrek decided identified by the small copper medallion hanging from his neck after a quick look rethnar shouted a few orders and razrek and his companions were lifted onto their horses and led off a long ride followed that lasted most of the day midafternoon had arrived when they crested a hill and razrek saw the main camp of the alur meriki below him even razreks eyes opened wide in wonder at the vast traveling village hed seen the camps of the tanukhs and salibs but those desert tribesmen didnt compare to the barbarians at least a thousand horses hundreds of wagons and tents small herds of sheep cattle and goats filled a small valley his captors had led their prisoners through the camp until they reached their destination a large tent set somewhat apart from the others razrek caught the word sarum which he knew meant king or leader before the warriors bound his hands and pushed him to his knees along with his men when razrek protested a fist had hammered into his face knocking him to ground keep silent dog the warrior said or ill cut out your tongue razrek had no doubt that the man meant what he said razrek clamped his lips shut he should never have let shulgi talk him into this meeting voices that rose and fell came from the big tent several warriors were having a heated discussion within and razrek felt certain it concerned him the arguing went on and on and the pain from razreks knees began to hurt worse than his hands at long last the tent flap jerked aside and four clan chiefs including rethnar came out the three warriors guarding the tent followed behind not that they were needed razrek decided the clan leaders appeared as hard and powerful as any of the warriors they commanded one warrior wore a copper pendant much larger than those of his companions on his chest that would be the emblem of the alur meriki the sacred medallion that identified their leader thutmosesin the leader of the clans stopped two paces away and stared down for a long moment at his prisoners about forty years old he stood taller than any of his commanders and every muscle on his body might have been chiseled from stone an odd circular scar marked his forehead just above his right eye the rest of his face was untouched though there were scars enough on his arms and chest to attest to his fighting strength the other three men ranged themselves alongside their leader who folded his arms across his chest thutmosesin gave razreks men little more than a dismissive glance but took his time studying the sumerian leader you are the one called razrek a statement not a question razrek found his mouth dry and had to swallow before he could answer yes sarum my name is razrek and ive been youve been sent by the leader of the village called sumer you wish to wage war against the village of orak now called akkad and you want us to join you in your fight why are you not strong enough to fight your own battles razrek knew better than to answer that question either yes or no my lord sarum the people of sumeria are determined to fight eskkar of akkad who is your own sworn enemy my king wishes to offer the mighty alur meriki a chance to join in the spoils of battle akkad is a rich land with much gold and silver large herds and thousands of possible slaves is not the enemy of my enemy my friend the saying meant the same to the barbarians as to the tribes of the desert the alur meriki will fight their enemies at a time of our own choosing thutmosesin said for dirteaters to suggest that we fight alongside them is an insult to our honor sarum i mean no such thing i spoke as one warrior to another rethnar took a step forward and kicked razrek in the chest the savage blow knocked the breath from his body and he toppled over do not dare to compare yourself to true warriors rethnar shouted his face red with anger razrek twisted his body upright and managed to get back on his knees gulping air into his lungs if he were going to die he didnt intend to grovel before these barbarians untie my hands and give me a sword he said and well see who is a warrior and who is a coward rethnar reached for his sword hold your anger rethnar thutmosesin commanded his hand staying his companion he is only a dirteater seeking a quick death do not give him what he wants we did agree to meet with these sumerians another man said he was the oldest of the four clan leaders probably approaching his fiftieth year we should hear his words we can always kill him later as always urgo you give good counsel thutmosesin agreed bring this one into my tent we will hear what he has to say give him some water it seems his mouth is dry the guards untied his hands and handed him a water skin they kept him on his knees while he drank but that was expected no warrior let alone their sarum could admit treating a dirteater as an equal inside the tent the guard pushed razrek back on his knees before leaving the sumerian found himself facing the four clan leaders he explained his purpose for visiting a war was coming a mighty conflict with many thousands of men on each side the purpose of this war was to crush akkad into the dust to leave no stone of the accursed city standing atop another the forces of akkad led by eskkar would find themselves arrayed against the might of all the cities of sumeria the akkadians would be forced to leave their walled city and march south to face the army of sumer that would leave the city almost undefended its walls guarded by old men women and children the time would be ripe to pluck the city razrek spoke until his voice gave out they gave him more water and he went on razrek told them he would have brave men inside the enemys city men who would lower ropes for the alur meriki to scale the walls once inside the citys inhabitants would be no match for the fury of the mighty alur meriki warriors finally razrek had nothing more to say the faces of his captors revealed nothing about what they felt take him outside thutmosesin ordered razrek bowed in his chest he felt relief at least the sarum hadnt ordered him to be tortured not yet t hutmosesin waited until the guards dragged razrek out the four commanders of the alur meriki shifted to face each other sitting crosslegged on the thick blanket with only a small space separating them thutmosesin looked at each man in turn tell us what you think urgo the oldest clan leader shook his head we should not get involved in the affairs of dirteaters akkad is too strong for us to challenge for now in another five or seven years when we have recovered our strength then it will be different this is our best chance to attack akkad rethnar said his voice harsh in the tents confines we need to take our revenge now before the accursed dirteaters grow even more numerous our blood stains the ground around their filthy walls and cries out for vengeance he fingered the scar on his cheek an akkadian arrow had torn his mouth and cheek open during the final battle if fighting on the side of these sumerians gets us over the walls so much the better we can afford to wait urgo replied each year more of our young men become warriors if we strike now if we rely on these sumerians we may risk more than we can gain if youre afraid thutmosesin held up his hand to stop rethnars hot words no one here is afraid but we must do what is best for our clan he turned to the other commander by far the youngest of the group what course would you choose barrack my blood cries out for vengeance against eskkar and his dirteaters my brother lies dead and unburied in some nameless ground ambushed by the renegade eskkar and the cowardly ur nammu since that day ive sworn to take eskkars head from his shoulders but like urgo i do not think we should let ourselves be used by these sumerians rethnar swore under his breath our warriors cry out for revenge and none of you want to fight the young men think their leaders are weak unwilling to fight when they learn that we have let slip an opportunity to strike akkad they will burn with fury he set his gaze on thutmosesin what do you say sarum thutmosesin ignored the hint of insult in the use of his title there was already too much bad blood between rethnar and himself fanned to a redhot heat since the defeat at akkads walls rethnar was right about one thing word of this offer of alliance would get out rethnar would be the first to tell every member of his clan i too want to see the renegade eskkar killed thutmosesin touched the scar on his forehead i fought him the night he burned the wagons and would have killed him if my sword had not shattered one more stroke he shook his head at the grim memory in the years since that battle we have added hundreds of warriors but akkad has grown by thousands and we know they have learned from eskkar the way of a warrior they are no longer simple villagers who can be swept aside theyve trained themselves to fight with bow and sword and lance even if we get into the city the fighting will be fierce if we attempt this we would need to send every warrior we have into the battle anything less will fail even if we win our losses will be heavy and might well doom the alur meriki that is wise urgo said speaking quickly before rethnar said anything to make things worse if we lose too many warriors we may never recover already we face a growing number of enemies but if these sumerians can get us over the wall rethnar said i dont care how many men they have inside the city if the dirteaters are at war we can take advantage of those staying behind once inside we can slaughter thousands burn the city from within if the traitor eskkar is not there to lead them they will be no match for my fighters he glanced at the other commanders i will lead the raid with all the men in my clan if no one else has the courage to fight i will take the help of the sumerians we can deal with them later your three hundred warriors will not be enough urgo said better to not attempt any raid unless you have enough men to be certain of success the alur meriki now counted almost a thousand warriors fit to ride and fight but most were young and inexperienced thutmosesin had more than four hundred under his standard two other clan chiefs both absent on raids controlled another two hundred but all four clan leaders present knew these other leaders wanted no part of a return to akkads walls whatever decision would be made would be made by those present both urgo and rethnar turned toward barrack his clan was the newest of the alur meriki made up of survivors of three other clans that had taken heavy losses in the fight against akkad more than a hundred and fifty warriors rode under barracks banner barrack glanced at thutmosesin and caught the slightest inclination of his head rethnar caught up in his rage didnt notice barrack took but a moment to comprehend what thutmosesin wanted if the sarum approves i will ride with rethnar barrack said between our clans we have enough warriors to punish akkad but if we cannot get over the walls by stealth then i will not waste my warriors lives attacking the city i accept barracks warriors rethnar couldnt hold in the smile of satisfaction we will destroy akkad if we cannot get in barrack repeated then we will raid the countryside and devastate the lands of akkad that will be more than enough to repay us for the risk at least for now thutmosesin looked at urgo it is almost enough urgo said he too had caught the sarums signal i will contribute fifty warriors to fight under barracks orders that will give rethnar at least five hundred men he speaks the truth when he says our warriors need to fight a raid such as this will give them a chance to avenge their honor that many men would constitute a major raid more than enough to destroy the crops and herds of the akkadians no matter what happened at the walls the devastation to the countryside would be crippling to the city thutmosesin nodded in acceptance then the alur meriki will raid the lands of akkad next summer but both of you will safeguard your warriors i do not want lives thrown away rethnar climbed to his feet if he heard the sarums words he didnt bother to agree with them then i will go and speak with this razrek there is much that needs to be discussed but we have nearly a whole season to prepare l ater that evening as most of the vast camp prepared for sleep thutmosesin and barrack walked to the edge of the narrow stream they reached a small boulder and sat down facing each other no others were within a hundred paces you are satisfied with the sumerian rethnar and barrack had spent most of the night working out the details with razrek yes hes brave enough for a dirteater and he has planned out every step that will be needed there will be more meetings in the coming months but if things happen as the sumerian believes we should be able to get into akkad and if not then i will count on you to save as many warriors as you can do not let rethnar throw away the lives of his men or yours remain calm in the heat of battle and think not of the glory of fighting but of winning you do not think this plan will succeed thutmosesin took a deep breath i dont know if it were so certain the sumerians might try it themselves i do know that eskkar is no fool the night my father put his family to death eskkar managed to escape the warriors even though he was but a boy he even killed a man before he fled then instead of dying in the lands of the dirteaters he survived and grew strong now he rules one of their largest cities he will not be defeated easily either by these sumerians or by rethnar still we may win a great victory rethnar is right about one thing our young men grow restless they need a challenge like this if they are to grow strong we lost much honor when we were defeated outside of akkads walls this would regain much of that then i will do my utmost to make sure rethnar succeeds in that case every member of the clan will praise your name barrack he paused for a moment then shrugged i should give you my thanks now because if rethnar destroys akkad then when he returns with his victory he will be clan leader of the alur meriki and i will be dead with each passing month tammuz and enhedu watched in satisfaction as business at the kestrel improved as trade among the sumerian cities picked up traffic on the river had grown boats arrived almost each day from the north venturing down the euphrates and tigris rivers as well as the numerous streams that flowed between them to deliver cargoes to anxious buyers waiting on sumers docks after the boats unloaded their crews sought refreshment from the many inns or simple taverns that sold ale or wine the kestrel now open for business almost a year and a half attracted many of these crewmen most eager to part with a portion of their pay for a chance to drink with their friends and new acquaintances eat a good meal and in many cases obtain relief from their more basic urges tammuz told enhedu that they would soon need another girl to help irkalla and anu enhedus massage business had grown even faster than the kestrel with ninlil paying for a massage every other day more women from the better classes soon enquired after enhedus skills since the wealthy in sumer now included many wives of the senior soldiers women of all classes and ages sought enhedus soothing hands within a few months she earned as much from her massages as tammuz did from the kestrel despite her success enhedu enjoyed her evenings helping tammuz in the alehouse the need to provide massages at night had vanished and except on rare occasions the last massage ended at sundown tonight customers filled every available table and bench in the inn a trading boat from akkad had made port today as well as two from larsa and another from nippur with such a large crowd tammuz and enhedu kept a close watch on the ale while rimaud kept the more boisterous patrons under constant observation alert for any signs of trouble despite their vigilance an occasional fight still broke out but rimauds reputation for flinging any offenders out into the lane lessened the number of such conflicts why fight when there was good ale to be drunk in the company of pleasant companions those with more serious issues resolved them outside in the lane after sundown the cook and her staff departed their work for the day finished anyone still hungry at this hour would have to make do with bread from the basket hanging on the wall behind the ale table when jarud stepped through the open door tammuz waved a greeting and started filling a pitcher most of the ale he purchased each day at the market was of only fair taste but now he could afford to include a few jars of better quality brew that he reserved for his best customers the recently promoted leader of twenty for sumers watch settled into his bench just as tammuz arrived with the ale and a reasonably clean cup four other members of the night watch were already crowded around the table but they made room for their leader hello innkeeper jarud scooped up the fresh cup the moment tammuz placed it on the table ive worked up a thirst tonight two fights already broken up and a thief caught in the act and sent to the work gangs and its still early in the evening greetings jarud are you through for the night no i just stopped in for a cup of ale and to get a bit of rest one of my men is guarding two boatmen from nippur outside if their captains dont want to pay for them in the morning theyll do twenty days labor in the work gang tammuz smiled they always pay dont they not many captains want to pull an oar themselves especially upriver everyone laughed at that only in dire circumstances was a boat captain likely to pick up an oar some boatmen claimed theyd never seen one do any real work that fact helped sumers guards make themselves a few extra coins when desperate ship owners no doubt with a schedule to keep had to purchase their sailors freedom a full house tonight jarud glanced around the inn anyone causing problems here not a one your men have been helping keep the place quiet most of the night well then at least theyre doing something to earn their pay besides sitting on their lazy asses what they should be doing is walking the lanes looking for troublemakers but ill have to take them with me when i leave not all of them tammuz let the dismay sound in his voice except when he was shorthanded jarud could usually be counted on to leave at least one of his men at the kestrel jarud shook his head new commander in charge tonight so we cant afford to look like were loafing on the watch hell be here a few months until he gets a command of his own i thought you just got a new commander that was thirty forty days ago jarud laughed and took another mouthful of ale you need to get out of your tavern more often still kourosh wont be here long hes too good to be wasted guarding sumers fat merchants and lazy shopkeepers he brought a few of his men with him from the desert and they worship him like a god king shulgi is already preparing a command for him sumers king had returned from the desert months ago and immediately started recruiting and training an army supposedly to wage further war against the desert tribes though only a fool believed that desert fighting belonged to those on horseback and king shulgi already had a vast contingent of cavalry now he spent his time visiting the other sumerian cities helping them raise their own forces supposedly for protection against future desert raids tammuz showed no particular interest in jaruds new commander instead tammuz held out his hand one copper for the pitcher i still have to make my living jarud pointed at one of his men pay the innkeeper a worn copper coin appeared and was grudgingly handed over despite the fact that the pitcher had been a large one and contained the best ale in the house in honor of jaruds appearance good luck with your new commander tammuz said after giving the coin a brief inspection sumers night watch came into contact with plenty of fake coins and had little compunction about trying to pass them off come back when your watch is ended ill save some good ale for you you always say that jarud countered and its always the same piss i collect it just for you from the piss pot outside at least its always fresh everyone laughed and tammuz went back to the table where enhedu was busy helping irkalla he stood beside his wife until irkalla left the table to deliver another cup of ale i just heard sumers going to have a new captain of the guard a man named kourosh enhedu nodded those three in the corner table look like trouble ill keep an eye on them he knew that enhedu would remember kouroshs name between the two of them they often picked up bits of information they already knew the names of most of shulgis commanders and their assignments but jaruds few words about the new mans skill were much more interesting a popular leader especially one who knew his trade would rise quickly in sumers military hierarchy men who could lead were always in short supply whether in akkad or sumer such a man would be worth watching and his name would be reported to akkad by the next messenger by then tammuz would know quite a bit more about the man his origins his skills and his strengths and weaknesses enhedu had already collected a wealth of information from the commanders wives most of them eager to talk about what their husband or lover was doing during the first few months tammuz had wondered about the usefulness of what he and enhedu were learning now he saw the value in the reports that went to akkad every month or so in the last year sumers soldiers had regained both their pride and their confidence once again they swaggered through the lanes benefiting from the stern training instituted by king shulgi and vanar his infantry commander border patrols to the east and the desert fighting to the west had toughened them up to tammuz and enhedu the sheer size of the forces being recruited could have only one ultimate objective the city of akkad still life in sumer had grown quite pleasant for them one year and half of another had passed since their arrival the citys population had increased greatly in that time and by now the kestrel and its owners were accepted as if they had lived there all their lives tammuz and enhedu had gathered and dispatched many reports to akkad during that time perhaps tammuz decided it was time to start doing more than just gathering information m ore than thirty days later tammuz glided through sumers darkened lanes as silent as a shadow and attracting as much attention most of the citys inhabitants had secured their doors and settled in for a good nights sleep only those few returning from the ale houses remained up and about and sumers night watch of course prowling about and keeping an eye on things the new moon shed almost no light but tammuz knew the way through all of the city by now since he first heard kouroshs name mentioned as the latest leader of the night watch tammuz had learned much about the increasingly popular commander bits of conversation heard in the kestrel had helped as members of sumers guard offered plenty of praise for their new leader a stern but fair taskmaster kourosh forced recruits and veterans alike to train each day with sword and spear often from dawn to dusk despite the petty grumblings tammuz noticed a hint of pride in these men kourosh knew his trade and more important he knew how to train his men and earn their respect twice in the last ten days tammuz had slipped out of the kestrel late at night and walked the lanes as tonights work ended he had watched kourosh drink with some of his senior men at a tavern he favored one closer to the barracks the new commander of the guard had never visited the kestrel but over the last month tammuz had seen kourosh several times training his men and escorting them to and from the docks a route that often took him past the kestrel now tammuz stood in the shadows at the end of another long day and half of the night no more ale would be sold until the morning and those who had no place to go would sleep in the tavern or find an empty spot in the lane the taverns had already disgorged the last of their customers and started fastening their doors the evenings drinking had ended and both innkeepers and their patrons needed to sleep if they were to work hard the next day kourosh and five soldiers came out of the tavern fifty paces away talking loudly one of the usual effects from too much ale two men departed down the lane but kourosh recognizable by his stocky build and the other two began walking toward tammuz staying in the shadows tammuz slipped away and moved ahead of the three hurrying toward the kings compound where kourosh had his comfortable quarters if the two soldiers accompanying their commander returned to the compound with their leader then tammuz would have wasted another night but if they turned toward the barracks then kourosh would complete the last few hundred steps of his journey alone at this time of night the broad lane leading to the compound should be free of soldiers and passersby tammuz felt his heart racing and tried to restrain his nervousness while he anxiously peered down the lane kourosh should have been only a hundred paces behind but perhaps he had lingered to talk to his men either that or he had decided to sleep in the barracks tonight a single shadow loomed up out of the darkness tammuz gave one last glance to the lane behind him saw that it was empty taking a deep breath he shuffled forward taking short steps and limping a little kouroshs long strides closed the gap between them in moments and the soldier walked straight down the center of the lane tammuz still hobbling along moved to his left as if to yield the center to the approaching soldier at the same time he slipped the knife from its sheath and pressed its length down the back of his leg get out of the way old man kourosh said his tone pleasant enough despite his words yes master tammuz shuffled more to his left then sprang to his right crashing into the soldier before kourosh could react the knife had buried itself in his chest just under the breastbone tammuz driving the blade upwards with all his strength into the heart just as hed been trained kourosh gasped more in surprise than pain his hands seized tammuzs shoulders and he tried to push his attacker aside but by then the knifes blade had already sucked the strength from his arms in a moment tammuz tore free of kouroshs grasp jerked the knife from his body ignoring the spurt of blood that spattered over his arm tammuz struck again this time through the ribs and into the lungs the second blow wrenched a gasp of pain from kourosh and sent him sprawling on his back to the ground tammuz glanced up and down the lane ready to flee if anyone had noticed but he saw no one satisfied he reached down his hands shook and it took three tries before he could cut the soldiers purse free from his belt kourosh wore a short sword and it would be one of quality so tammuz slid that from its sheath shoved it under his left armpit and began trotting down the lane back the way the soldier had come at the first joining of two lanes tammuz turned to his left a hundred paces further was one of the citys wells as he drew near tammuz emptied the contents of the dead mans purse into his hand then dumped the coins into his tunic he scooped some dirt from the lane into the purse and tossed it into the well with luck it would sink to the bottom and never be seen again by now tammuz had reached the poorer quarters and he saw the homeless or drunks sleeping in the lanes he set the sword down near two unconscious forms who reeked of ale with luck theyd awake in the morning find the sword and try to sell it in the market moving with caution tammuz retraced his steps toward the kestrel he stopped twice to make sure that no one was following him and doubled back once just to be certain then he crossed one more lane and in another few hundred paces reached the inn the inns front door would be closed but he turned down the side lane until he reached the narrow door that led into their private chamber the door that was always barred opened silently as tammuz approached and he knew enhedu had watched for him and seen him coming down the lane tammuz slipped inside without making a sound he moved to the edge of their bed and slumped down exhausted more from the tension than from the physical activity he felt himself shivering and couldnt seem to catch his breath hed never killed someone like that in cold blood enhedu took her time securing the doors many bolts and braces working silently so as not to awaken any customers she finished up by moving a sack filled with dirt against the bottom of the entrance with luck that portal wouldnt open again for months then she stood before him take off your tunic she whispered he rose and unbuckled his belt the coins taken from kouroshs purse spilled onto the sandy floor with scarcely a clink of metal on metal enhedu helped pull the tunic over his head she tossed it aside stepped away and returned with a pitcher of water and a piece of cloth taking her time she scrubbed his face neck arms and legs anywhere blood might have spattered it went well husband no need to ask what had happened his shaking hands told the story plain enough nevertheless her voice couldnt conceal how worried shed been yes he never even cried out she continued with her ministrations in the morning she would bathe him again to make sure no bloodstains appeared on him his tunic would be wrapped inside one of her dresses and taken to the river at first light to be scrubbed clean against the rocks any stains that remained would be taken for wine spills an occupational hazard for any innkeeper lie down she whispered as she guided him down onto the bed he started to tell her what happened but she silenced him with her fingers on his lips in the morning tammuz now it is time for you to rest she knelt on the floor beside the bed and began kissing his body for a moment he tried to protest then to his surprise his penis stiffened into rigidity and he felt her long hair brush his stomach as she took him into her mouth his passion raged either from her deft touch or the murder of kourosh he couldnt tell enhedu kept stimulating him driving his lust higher and higher until she felt him throb with desire she moved on top of him he couldnt hold back a gasp of pleasure as he entered her softness but if any of the inns occupants heard that kind of noise they would just roll over and return to their sleep she moved her body against him and within moments his seed burst inside her with a force he found difficult to believe then he slumped back exhausted enhedu took him into her arms and held him tenderly until he fell into a deep and untroubled sleep four months later the priests of marduk after many long nights consultation with the stars finally declared the end of summer most of sumerias farmers had finished their harvests and now offered thanks to the gods as enhedu knew that meant spilling a drop or two of ale on the kestrels floor then gulping down the rest of the cup as fast as possible tonight the tavern would be packed with as many grateful farmers as river men king shulgi had ordered the usual three days of feasting which ended yesterday nevertheless sumers inhabitants continued to relax and enjoy another benefit from the gods the blazing heat of the season had broken as well and balmy days and cooler nights would soon be in store for enhedu the time of feasting brought plenty of customers as the wealthy wives indulged themselves one of the richest women in sumer now sighed contentedly under enhedus ministrations ahhh that feels so good yes mistress bikku enhedu leaned forward her bodys weight helping move the muscles in the womans naked back a pleasant enough body enhedu mused in better shape than many of her customers wives and mistresses of the wealthy tended to possess soft bodies unused to any physical work probably the hardest labor they performed consisted of vigorously satisfying their husbands needs in the bedchamber unlike tammuz whose rod tended to stiffen at enhedus lightest touch sumers merchants even some of the younger ones apparently required long and strenuous efforts to bring them to arousal especially after a long night of feasting and drinking mistress bikku had first summoned enhedu several months ago after hearing many and glowing recommendations from ninlil wife of puzuramurri enhedus first client from sumers upper class since that first precarious start with ninlil enhedus list of wealthy clients had grown to over a dozen the pampered wives both old and young relied more and more on her massage skills to relax and to prepare for their husbands nightly visits her customers paid her as many coins in a few days as the kestrel earned in seven or eight to please her new employers enhedu had purchased two new dresses that showed her rising status no woman of wealth wanted to be visited by someone from the poorer classes no matter what skills she possessed so enhedu dressed like the wife of a prosperous merchant or respected craftsman a porter carried fresh water to the kestrel each morning so that enhedu could wash her body before donning her finery she scented the water with crushed flower petals to create a pleasant scent that lingered in her hair to her surprise tammuz found both the fine clothes and sweetsmelling water exciting and often when she returned from working on one of her customers they would retire to their private chamber to relax and make love all of the welloff women enhedu massaged liked to talk especially to someone of no consequence the fact that her ministrations were probably more enjoyable than what many received from their husbands also helped loosen the womens tongues most of the wealthy merchants and traders cared more about their own pleasures they had little time or interest in satisfying their women who were often relegated to the role of pleasure slave or a symbol of the mans status within the city aside from the usual gossip such women indulged in sooner or later the conversation turned to the talk of the coming war enhedu had picked up many odd facts one here one there that occasionally added up to a significant bit of information which soon found its way to the kestrel and from there to the boats going upriver to akkad and lady trella between the loud banter from the soldiers and other patrons of the kestrel and the giggling gossip of enhedus clients she knew more about the coming war than most of king shulgis soldiers the most important facts however still eluded her when and how the war would begin rumors had predicted the start of the war several times and all had turned out to be false on the bed bikku groaned in pleasure once again your touch is making my loins grow moist enhedu you flatter me mistress enhedu received many such invitations but always managed to deflect them most of them at least thats what she told tammuz when he asked her about such invitations as they whispered at night in their bed im sure im too clumsy for such things a chattering of womens voices rose up outside bikkus very sumptuous bedroom saving enhedu from making further excuses bikku are you not finished yet ninlil her face flushed with excitement entered the room and rushed to the head of the bed your servant says that enhedu has been here for some time she managed to spare enhedu a quick glance dont shout so nevertheless bikku turned her head on the pillow to face her visitor enhedus hands feel so good i never want it to end who else are you inviting for supper tonight ninlil ignored the last comment everyone wants to come and enjoy your table ahhh oh yes enhedu right there bikku had no need to answer ninlils question thats where it feels so tight yes mistress i can see your muscles stretching beneath your beautiful skin this will help you please your husband tonight bikku was seven or eight seasons older than ninlil and first wife to jamshid perhaps sumers most prosperous merchant reputed even wealthier than gemama accompanying her husband bikku had dined at king shulgis table seven or eight times in the last six months queen kushanna favored her company or so bikku related to any and everyone the queen of sumers presence and beauty overawed every other woman in the city and every wife hungered for the chance to dine at shulgis large and impressive residence such invitations now marked those in favor with the king or those who needed to offer more gifts and gold as a sign of loyalty not tonight bikku said in response to ninlils question at least not until much later in the evening only the men are meeting at king shulgis palace no doubt to drink too much wine and talk business long into the night we wives will be dining alone tonight a simple meal but my cook promises no one will go home hungry ninlil laughed and enhedu joined in to the extent of a brief smile she continued her work kneading the womans lower back occasionally adding a drop or two of warm oil by now enhedu could ask the servants to heat the oil before her arrival so that it would help soothe the delicate skin of their mistress tonight bikkus table would be covered from end to end with delicious food of all kinds but the women would only nibble at the cooks grandest efforts none of these women dared allow themselves to grow fat they all needed to please their husbands and lovers at least until theyd delivered a healthy son preferably two which meant as enhedu knew from experience that tonight the household slaves and servants would dine well albeit on cold food and leftovers after the guests departed and bikku finally retired to her bedchamber are they going to talk about the war i am so tired of hearing my puzzi talk about all the gold hes getting for the supplies he delivers of course theyre going to talk about the war you silly girl why else would queen kushanna invite them do you think she cares to hear their tiresome stories of trading and bartering my husband says that tonight they go to learn what new demands king shulgi has in store for them i wish we could be there ninlil said wistfully imagine kushanna will be queen kushanna bikku corrected her younger companion she reserved to herself the right to call kushanna by her name she rules when king shulgi is at war or visiting the camps he returned late last night and soldiers came and went through the lanes until nearly dawn we could hear their loud talk from our window will there really be another war puzzi says it may not be good for his trading business puzzis trade ventures mainly went north on the tigris war with akkad would shut him down at least temporarily yes it will be war its about time those barbarians in akkad learned their place its because of their threats that jamshid is forced to pay so much gold king shulgi intends to wipe them from the earth to avenge the insult to his father enhedu never stopped working but she kept her ears open of course everyone in sumer talked about the coming war but no one knew anything for certain the soldiers in and around sumer had not received the call to arms training continued and recruiters still scoured the countryside but none of the early signs of war she and tammuz watched for each day had occurred no demands for extra cattle to be herded north no movement of grain from the citys wellstocked storage places no large movement of troops out of the camps without these and other preparations war remained only a threat not something real yesterday the messenger from akkad had departed sumer with little more information than what hed carried the month before still in the next day or two enhedu knew she would learn all about king shulgis dinner whatever shulgi and his halfsister said or did was soon whispered throughout the city the conversation between ninlil and bikku turned to a new delivery of fine cloth from the east nothing more was said about the war and soon enhedu finished her massage thanked bikku profusely for the privilege of serving her gathered up her things and departed stopping only to collect her fee of two copper coins from the household steward at least enhedu had finished the morning massage early enough so that she could look forward to breaking the midday fast with tammuz she strolled contentedly through sumers crowded lanes glancing at all the goods displayed in the stalls and on the tables and enjoying the warmth of the sun a t the kestrel she found tammuz standing in the doorway watching the lane though he leaned against the door casually enough she quickened her pace he seldom waited for her return something was wrong when her husband saw her coming he disappeared into the inn when she stepped inside her eyes blinking in the dim light she saw only two skins of ale or wine on the counter there should have been eight or nine enhedu greeted rimaud but went directly to their private quarters whats happened the docks have been closed since midmorning tammuz said he didnt bother to lower his voice soldiers dragged all the boats onto the shore and posted a guard over everything no boats of any kind are allowed on the river nothing has come down the tigris since yesterday i asked the sellers in the marketplace about our goods but they said all ale and wine all food in fact is being taken to the kings warehouses all the women were ordered to bake extra bread almost everything coming into the city now must go straight to the soldiers rimaud and i protested to the guards they knew who we were and slipped each one of us a skin just to keep us quiet but they warned us there wont be any more for some time how long will this go on enhedu was beginning to worry they cant keep the docks closed forever i asked the guards but they really didnt know they thought only a few days but they know less than we do tonight there is a meeting at king shulgis house all the leading merchants and traders are required to attend and without their wives i thought enhedu realized tonights meeting would not be to discuss the coming conflict it would announce to the citys leaders that the war had already started no doubt king shulgi would be telling them more about their future contributions to that effort then its war for certain tammuz said completing her unspoken words we have to get word to akkad somehow there must be some caravans going north an innocuous message delivered to an elderly widow in akkad would warn lady trella that war was imminent if the message ever arrived enhedu knew it would be risky and unreliable to give such a message to a stranger but until the regular messenger from akkad arrived in the next few days they had no other way to get news to lady trella and that assumed his boat actually reached sumer ill visit the caravan camp outside the city enhedu said perhaps well find one leaving soon but she returned by late in the afternoon with only more evil tidings the city is sealed no one can leave not even the local farmers who spent the night all the caravans are guarded soldiers are riding and patrolling every road and trail stopping anyone who tries to leave they say its to protect them from raids by the tanukhs and salibs they say a large force of barbarian horsemen is on the loose raiding north of sumer tammuz shook his head most of the salibs are dead or driven into the desert the tanukhs have been quiet for years especially since king shulgi broke the last resistance of the salibs why would the tanukhs raid here close to shulgis army why would his voice trailed off and enhedu knew his thoughts if it were the tanukhs then sumers cavalry would be mustering to chase them down not sit idly by in their camps outside the city or patrolling the roads the war has begun she said whatever is going on between sumer and akkad is already happening but what can it be most of the army is here in sumer or camped nearby even razreks cavalry maybe the first attack on akkad will come from larsa or one of the other cities not that enhedu believed it the other cities were reluctant allies and not likely to be willing to strike the first blow against akkad they would join the fighting but only after sumer initiated it and when victory seemed likely its a good thing the messenger got out yesterday tammuz said otherwise hed be trapped here like the rest of us this time enhedu shook her head no husband its bad that by chance he avoided the patrols he will carry the news that open war has still not come to sumer at least if he were trapped here those in akkad might wonder why he didnt return i wish we had more ways of getting a message north tammuz and enhedu knew they had become akkads most important spies in sumer so important that only a few in either city knew of their presence there must be some way to get word out tammuz said there has to be something we can do i cant believe we failed to by the time we get word to akkad they will know the worst the war will already be on them now we can only hope that shulgis first blow isnt fatal he clasped her hand and held it tight dont worry akkad is strong yes i know but in her heart enhedu worried after more than two years of living in sumer she realized just how vast an army the city could raise and an army that size might not be denied f rom his balcony shulgi gazed out over the compound beneath him his commanders moved about coming and going or gathering in small groups the orders to start the war had already been issued now the men animals and supplies needed to conquer akkad would be brought together to begin the long journey north even from the balcony shulgi couldnt see much of sumer but the hum of excitement from its inhabitants carried over the walls by now even the dullest would have figured out that sumer was going to war the long awaited day had finally arrived and shulgi would depart the city at dawn to join his army already on the move north any last thoughts my brother kushanna moved to his side her bare feet soundless on the wood floor he put his arm around her shoulders no everything is well begun the messengers departed two days ago to the other cities ordering their armies to join me at kanesh by tomorrow that outpost will have fallen after that the border lands will be swept clean and the crops destroyed then well begin moving north shulgi intended not just to invade the akkadian lands but to build and fortify a half dozen posts along the way occupying the countryside in stages eskkar would have to come out and fight and when he did hed be attacking the entire sumerian army over twenty thousand strong you will take care of yourself my brother trella may send her assassins against you ill take precautions but surrounded by my army ill be safe from the witch queen he kissed the top of her head you just make sure the supplies flow steadily north it will be thirty or forty days before we stand outside akkads walls and then who knows how long it will take to starve them into submission eskkar will challenge you before you reach akkads walls then the north will be conquered even sooner if he fights he loses if he remains behind his walls then he starves be wary of his tricks in the last two years razrek and i have thought of everything eskkar can do well be ready then ill await your return my brother your victorious return just keep my city under control my sister and keep the supplies flowing everything depends on that now book iii battle for empire d aro sat crosslegged near the bow of the boat watching the land flow by as he gazed at the green ribbon of trees and bushes lining the banks of the tigris a flock of small birds burst into flight startled by an approaching hawk that wheeled back up into the sky once its prey took flight too wise to chase after them the birds darted across the water to resume their hunt for food on the opposite shore their latest brush with danger already forgotten the rivers flowing water soothed every spirit man or beast the sun descended closer to the horizon and before long darkness would spread across the river by then the vessel would be tied up alongside the jetty at kanesh and the grinning crew would be well into their first cups of ale inside the walled village once again daro swore at the bad luck that had kept him riding ships up and down the rivers for the last two years it had all started even earlier than that when yavtar sailed to sumer and needed an armed guard to protect both himself and his precious cargo of lapis lazuli a few days earlier daro had made the mistake of telling his commander that he knew something about boats as a boy hed worked a few seasons helping his father row up and down the tigris when yavtar requested an escort who knew something about the river daro happened to be in akkad and found himself volunteered for the duty that trip had gone well and daro thought that would be the last time he sailed up and down the great river instead once safe and secure back in akkad yavtar had requested daro be put in charge of another cargo after a few more such voyages daro grew bored with the task riding the water gave him little time to practice his archery so he asked for a return to duty with his fellow bowmen the next day alexar recently promoted to commander of akkads archers summoned daro to his quarters when he arrived to his surprise daro found yavtar there as well daro knew the boatmaster and alexar remained good friends both had fought together against korthacs forces yavtar heard you want to leave the river alexar began he wants you to stay before daro could protest alexar held up his hand its already been decided much as i could use your help yavtar needs to build a force of archers to defend the trading ships and their cargoes he also has some wild idea about building fighting ships ships that can carry archers and provide a platform for them to fight from in a few years there may be a hundred bowmen guarding and fighting from yavtars new fleet of boats youve more river experience than any of my archers and if you do well you might end up commanding all these men you could soon find yourself a leader of one hundred fighting boats river archers before daro had time to ask a question or utter a protest yavtar spoke well then thats settled the rivermaster placed his arm around daros shoulder come with me lad ive got a lot to tell you later daro learned that yavtar had asked eskkar for daros services after eskkars approval no further discussion seemed necessary at least to yavtar the shipmaster obviously had no qualms about using his position in eskkars inner circle of advisors to obtain what he wanted even then akkads boatmaster didnt tell daro everything but yavtar revealed enough to make daros eyes widen at the prospect of war with sumeria two years had passed since then the war approached and by now daro had made countless trips up and down the rivers months ago hed earned the title of commander of one hundred and his force of river archers continued to grow with the threat of war looming ever closer daro decided to make every third trip down to kanesh to inspect those of his men stationed there the trading outpost would be the first target for sumers army and eskkar had stationed a strong garrison there as the tension between akkad and sumer increased daro wanted to ensure that his archers had prepared themselves and their boats that inspection would take most of tomorrow but tonight he would sip some ale with his men relax in their company and try not to think about what the future might bring once again he let his gaze sweep over the riverbank and the farmland stretching beyond despite the peaceful setting something felt out of place still daro saw nothing unusual a fine evening commander daro turned to see scria the ships master standing beside him scrias face reminded daro of a rat thin and pointed with yellow teeth that protruded from his lips the lank greasy hair added to the resemblance but despite his appearance the man knew the river and could sail his boat well enough yavtar apparently thought as much yes ill be glad when we dock an empty river makes for a fast voyage scria said looking out over the prow and scratching his chest when daro didnt reply scria turned away and began weaving his way back to the stern wait come back now scrias rat face held a frown he didnt like to be ordered about by some soldier even a commander you said the river was empty daro rose to his feet bracing himself against the boats motion and stretching upwards to see downriver how long has it been we havent passed a boat coming upstream since they started out early this morning theyd waved greetings to at least a dozen ships headed north but as the morning turned into afternoon the sightings of ships bound for akkad and other cities upriver had ceased mmm has been a long time this late in the day we should have seen a few unless they decided to stop in kanesh scria scratched his chest again this time in a different place maybe they pulled ashore to rest a stupid answer daro knew no boat captain worth his salt would sit idly on the riverbank while the sun remained in the sky especially with a way station not that far upstream there should be boats something was wrong he glanced at the river then up into the sky he saw no birds heard no sounds other than their own soft passage through the water you men on your feet string your bows daro had brought only two archers with him more than enough to drive off any casual bandits or pirates suddenly he wished hed brought a dozen though that many would have overloaded scrias boat as his men scrambled to their feet daro turned to the boat captain get the boat in the middle of the river away from the bank the man at the steering oar followed the current and at this point in the river that brought them closer to the left bank scarcely fifty paces away why whats the problem daro gripped scrias shoulder and squeezed just do it now he pushed the man away and reached down to grasp his own bow with the ease of years of practice he strung the weapon then slung the quiver over his shoulder letting it hang down to his waist on his left side the boat had already turned into a curve of the river scrias shouts to his steersman brought the bow around and the vessel moved sluggishly toward midstream struggling against the current daro rested his foot on the prow to get a better look a flight of arrows burst from the brush along the rivers left bank they hummed through the air striking the boat the crew and the water on either side one shaft grazed daros arm and two struck the boat on the left side get down daro shouted the order but those who survived the first flight were already ducking as low as possible an archer lay sprawled beside the mast and one of scrias three crewmen had taken two shafts and fallen overboard the boatmaster his voice rising to a hysterical shout had an arrow protruding from his arm as he crawled along the bottom of the vessel daro loosed a shaft at the shore now filled with men emerging from the bushes and splashing into the shallow water some still launching shafts fortunately the crewman steering the boat had survived and he kept the vessel moving toward the center of the river a quick glance at their numbers told daro all he needed to know at least twenty archers had attacked them maybe more he dropped his bow and picked up an oar everyone row a few arrows launched toward the riverbank werent going to accomplish anything moving to the right side of the vessel he took shelter behind some sacks of grain and began pulling as hard as he could thrusting the paddle deep into the river and dragging it through the water his surviving bowman iseo did the same crouching down as low as he could and working the dead crewmans oar the boat moved farther from the left bank slowly passed through the center of the river and glided closer to the opposite shore arrows continued to fall on the ship and splash into the water but by now scrias boat had moved well past the point of the attack we should get to the opposite shore scrias right hand clutched his bloody left arm his voice had lost none of its panic daro lifted his head and let his eyes scan the right bank he saw a party of horsemen at least twenty following the course of the river and matching the pace of the boat many of them had bows in their hands they rode easily as if they didnt care if the boat slipped away from them a third party of perhaps a dozen riders trotted into view on the left bank going down river as well the boat was trapped between the two forces turn the boat around daro shouted he pointed to the horsemen on the right bank we have to go back up river scrias eyes widened we cant go back he screamed were too heavy to pull upstream the boat captain had started with three crewmen one had died another lay on his back an arrow in his shoulder only luck had saved the most important crewman the one steering the boat if hed taken an arrow the ship might have swung broadside and swamped but daro knew they couldnt continue south and both sides of the river appeared to be crawling with who knew how many mounted men keep the boat in the center of the river scria start dumping the cargo iseo help him get the body over the side too hurry scria crouched on his knees remained motionless we cant dump the cargo its worth at least thirty its worth nothing to you if youre dead iseo if he doesnt start helping throw him overboard daro reached down and lifted the first sack lifted it onto the gunwale then pushed it over the side soon the boat was rocking back and forth threatening to capsize at any moment as the three of them tossed sacks bales and clay pitchers overboard he paused to look at the shore the horsemen still kept pace with the boats progress the enemy didnt bother wasting arrows they seemed satisfied as long as the boat went south that meant more enemy would be waiting ahead and likely with some way to force the boat to shore perhaps a vessel of their own filled with armed men daro scrambled back to the rear of the boat the steersman his face white with fear clenched the steering oar with a grip that made the bones in his hand stand out ill take the oar daro snapped you help scria dump the cargo make sure we dont dump what we need for ballast an empty boat would capsize at the least movement in a few more moments the craft rode higher in the water with almost all of the cargo over the side iseo were turning upstream start rowing all of you steersman as soon as we come about get that sail up then stay low and row for all youre worth he pushed hard on the steering oar turning the boat first toward the right bank then swinging it back across the center of the river and turning it upstream as soon as he got the boat headed north the men on shore took notice once again arrows flew through the air splashing into the water thudding into the sides of the boat and a few striking inside the vessel the frightened steersman raised the sail faster than hed ever done in his life the soft breeze didnt help much but it enabled the boat to keep headway against the rivers current as soon as daro had the boat centered in the river and moving north he ordered scria to take the steering oar with his wounded arm the boatmaster would be of more use guiding his boat than trying to row daro scooped up scrias oar and began stroking his powerful arms strengthened from years of archery helped push the boat up the river soon they retraced their way and reached the point of the first attack as he watched a dozen horsemen moved into sight and guided their horses down the slope toward the rivers edge all of them carried bows daro swore dropped his oar and collected his bow the enemy would ride into the stream as far as they could which would bring them into killing range theyd rake the little boat and riddle everyone with arrows iseo keep rowing but the horsemen werent close enough for that yet daro stood aimed and launched his first arrow hed aimed for the nearest rider but the shaft struck the lead horse in the shoulder the animal went mad with pain rearing up and twisting its head to tear at the arrow with its teeth the rider slipped from the animals back and went into the water with a mighty splash the wounded animal kicked out with its hind legs and the next horse panicked as well aim for the horses you fool remember eskkars advice daro shot arrow after arrow as fast as he could nock them to the string the slippery slope leading to the water didnt provide the riders much room forcing the horsemen to bunch together with the animals all taking fright either from their own wounds or hearing the cries of the other horses they dug in their hooves and refused to enter the water a few of the enemy gave up the effort and dismounted trying to find their footing in the slippery mud and continue shooting arrows at the boat but by then the craft had swung by the curve and moved out toward the deeper center channel the moment the curve blocked the enemy from sight daro dropped the bow and picked up his oar stay in the center and row damn you row he kept iseo and the steersman rowing until well after dark matching them stroke for stroke an agonizing effort that sapped every bit of strength he possessed by then everyone was exhausted but the evening breeze had strengthened and allowed the craft to keep moving slowly upstream despite the tiring rowers daro let each man take a turn resting always keeping two men pulling the oars at least they could quench their thirst easily enough scooping water from the river with their burning hands to refresh themselves the moon sent a pale glimmer of light down the water providing just enough light for the steersman to keep the boat in the center of the river they dragged the oars through the water in silence everyone struggling against the pain until even daro thought his heart might burst as midnight approached the boat slid around yet another curve in the river daro the way stations up ahead scrias shout echoed his relief keep your voice down you fool daro lifted his eyes and saw the single rickety jetty protruding from the east bank it looked peaceful enough with one boat tied up at the little dock and another drawn up on the shore no fires burned but any crews pausing here on their way south would be asleep by now he made up his mind daro knew hed never get to akkad with just the men onboard the boat if the breeze died which likely would happen at any moment certainly well before dawn they didnt have the strength to keep the craft moving northward he looked down and saw the gleam of his sword at his feet then took a deep breath akkad akkad the shout floated out over the water and brought a challenge from the soldier on night watch a shadowy figure who sprang to his feet surprised to hear a boat approaching at this time of night theres a boat on the river everyone get up get up at the sentrys loud command other shapes appeared men sat up fumbling for their weapons and trying to shake the sleep from their eyes another voice called out whos there daro leader of one hundred from akkad he let himself relax the guards voice held the accent of someone whod lived in akkad all his life bring us in to shore scria when the boat ground against the sandy bank daro had to concentrate to keep his footing he felt lightheaded and weak as a newborn lamb hands reached out from the darkness and dragged the boat up the sandy bank and out of the rivers grasp commander what are you doing going upriver at night enemy horsemen between here and kanesh the outpost may have been taken by the time daro finished explaining everyone was on their feet the soldiers belting weapons around their waists and the rivermen getting their belongings back into their boats ill take all the soldiers with me in scrias boat six men on each side we should be able to make good time going upriver there wont be anyone to guard the ships a boatmaster daro didnt recognize protested from the darkness doesnt matter the enemy will be here by morning maybe sooner sink one of the ships dump the cargo of the other and double up your crews take the one ship and row for all your worth back to akkad daro climbed back into the boat shouting his words over his shoulder he settled in at the steersmans station with twelve men pulling oars hed be back in akkad by noon if the wind stayed favorable he didnt care what happened to the traders as soon as the last of his men settled in daro gave the order push off and start pulling on those oars i want to be halfway to akkad by dawn adarnar outpost on the sippar river at sunset enkidu made his rounds of the outpost three times each day just after dawn at midday and when the sun touched the western horizon he took his time talking to the guards making sure none had gotten drunk forgot their weapons or failed to take their posts after four months under his command such occurrences seldom happened the nearly thirty soldiers and equal number of craftsmen and their families knew enkidu and his ways by now like every fort on the edge of akkads lands the group of soldiers assigned to the adarnar outpost contained the usual number of fools and dullards slackers and the sharp witted these provided a daily trial to the more professional soldiers enkidu had worked hard training all of them with equal parts firm discipline and helpful encouragement and while some of his men might not be good enough to strut up and down on top of akkads walls they had all become proficient enough for patrolling the border they now took as much pride in their duties as their commander and he in turn felt satisfied with every man under his authority as always pride in their skills proved helpful as adarnar possessed few amenities either for its men or its horses compared to kanesh which lay a good two days march to the west adarnar was scarcely large enough to hold the barracks and corrals for the twentytwo horses the small fortified settlement sat on the northern edge of the sippar river its single dock running along the waters edge just wide enough to berth three ships the boats that sailed along the sippar as well as the occasional caravan following its banks were adarnars main reason for existence all trade and commerce throughout the land had to be protected from bandits if akkad were to continue to grow stronger since taking command of the post enkidu had not lost a single sack of trade goods which was more than most of the other outposts could say the wealthy merchants in akkad often acted as though only the trade on the tigris and euphrates mattered but plenty of goods flowed along the sippar and the other streams that branched off or merged into the two giant rivers with the threat of war making everyone uneasy most boats carried their cargoes only as far as the market at kanesh but that settlement enabled the local farmers and herders to obtain all the goods anyone could buy in akkad or sumer for that matter and usually at cheaper cost for humble farmers struggling to survive places like kanesh and even adarnar provided both security and a convenient place to exchange goods as soon as king eskkar established the protective string of forts along the sippar the adjacent land with its bountiful farms had flourished not that enkidu cared about trade four years ago hed fought at drakiss side in the desperate battle against korthac both of them had nearly died that night in fact most of the men they led in the bloody fight for the citys gates had succumbed to death or taken serious wounds enkidu not only survived but earned his entry into the hawk clan he soon progressed to a leader of twenty then fifty and four months ago alexar and drakis had given enkidu command of the post at adarnar already into his twentysixth season enkidu knew he would command even more soldiers in the coming war in two more months hed return to akkad with half of his besttrained men leaving behind a wellrun garrison for the next commander and the latest batch of raw recruits who would start the process all over again enkidu inspected the last guard on the northern wall found nothing to require his attention and headed back toward his quarters he enjoyed the private room that as commander of the post he shared only with one local farmers daughter who was quite pleased to have caught his eye and grateful for the chance to escape life on the farm enkidus wife and two sons remained in akkad with her family waiting for his return he still hadnt decided if he would bring his concubine with him when he returned to the city the girl pleasured him well each evening but enkidus wife had a sharp temper and he didnt know how she would react to a second wife he shook such thoughts from his mind and thought instead about the evenings pleasure commander south post hurry the voice held urgency mixed with fear and enkidus pleasant thoughts of the future vanished he burst into a run across the outpost reached the wobbly wooden steps and climbed them two at a time the guard had his hand extended toward the river and one glance told enkidu all he needed to know get everyone in the fort close the gates he bellowed the last words but already the other guards were raising their own alarms everyone to their posts prepare for an attack hed given that order many times before but only to train his men never in a real attack enkidu turned back to stare across the river one hundred two hundred perhaps more riders had emerged from the low hills and scattered trees that hugged the far side of the river the lead elements already splashed their way into the sippar churning the calm waters to froth beneath their hooves the river here was wide but shallow and theyd be across in moments with a chill he realized he could do nothing to stop them get men on horseback ride for akkad tell them were under attack hed almost said what he already knew that they were all already dead the marauders now that he could see them better looked like tanukhs but those desertdwellers hadnt raided this far east in many years not since eskkar took command at akkad enkidus second in command a veteran named sargat arrived took one look across the river and swore well never be able to hold them off ready the horses enkidu said ill try to slow them down well have to break out of here that meant abandoning the villagers living in the fort but he couldnt help that enkidu shouted another order and the handful of men on the palisade began shooting arrows at the advancing horde in a futile effort to slow them down enkidu dashed down the steps toward the rear of the fort get everyone into the boats pull for kanesh that place might have already fallen but this could be an isolated raid and if the boats escaped they might find safety at the larger fort or ashore somewhere in between at the corral he saw men moving about throwing halters on the skittish animals theyd reacted to the unfamiliar scent of fear in the men handling them a leader of ten reached the corral at the same moment enkidu grabbed him by the shoulder and shouted in his ear take five men and try to get through before they encircle us fight your way past them if you can and warn akkad the man nodded and began shouting his own orders frightened villagers pushed past him and through the open rear gate heading for the jetty the two boats rocked wildly as panicky men women and children tried to pile into them one ship pushed off already heavily loaded a few villagers jumped into the river to try to swim to safety downstream they knew that drowning would be a better fate than to be taken by the tanukhs anyone captured on shore would die within moments if a worse fate didnt befall them five horses burst out of the gate heading north for a brief moment enkidu felt tempted to take a horse and go after them but he couldnt leave his men with an oath he turned his back on the coral and snatched a bow that one of the departing riders had abandoned fall in with me form a line weve got to hold them off for a few moments enkidu bellowed the words to make himself heard the undulating tanukh war cries floated over the confusion in the fort then the drumming of hooves on hard ground told him the enemy was only moments away six men moved to his side bows in hand another handful of soldiers struggled to catch their horses go ride for akkad they burst out through the gate kicking their horses to a gallop enkidu saw the fear mixed with relief on their faces then the din of screaming tanukhs drowned out everything the enemy horsemen had reached the main gate the first one swung over the top of the now undefended palisade enkidu put an arrow right through his chest but a dozen more pulled themselves up and over the archers beside him loosed their shafts but it only slowed the wave of attackers for a moment get to the horses ride for akkad the rest of his men dropped their bows and dashed for the remaining horses enkidu followed them moving backward and still shooting arrows as fast as he could a handful of the attackers flung open the main gate while dozens more continued to scale the fence and drop from the parapets into the fort screaming their war cries and waving swords another group of soldiers galloped out but the din of exultant war cries and approaching hooves told enkidu that the tanukhs had already reached the rear of the fort women screamed in fear pushing their way toward the water enkidu reached the rear gate still shooting shafts as fast as he could nock them to the bowstring already hed emptied one quiver he snatched up another from the ground the tanukhs shouting in triumph rushed toward him mount up enkidu shouted he continued launching arrows dropping a man with every shot the powerful long bow of akkad deadly at such close range bodies arrows protruding lay scattered over the inside of the fort mixing in death with those villagers too slow to get to the boats enkidu glanced over his shoulder sargat swung up onto his horse and held the halter of the last horse for enkidu an arrow already nocked on his string enkidu drew back his arm loosed the shaft and turned to run instead a burning pain shot through his chest and he saw the point of an arrow protruding from his side he took two steps stumbled and fell to the ground each breath felt like fire too hot to take into his body and the strength drained from his legs he lifted his eyes he knew he wouldnt be able to mount a horse he met sargats eyes go get to akkad he managed to get the words out sargat shook his head in frustration dropped the halter and put his heels to his horse drawing his sword as he galloped out of the fort enkidu heard the clash of bronze as sargat and the last of the akkadians charged into the tanukhs attempting to force their way toward the rear gate enkidu tried to get to his feet his hand fumbling for his sword something knocked him over and he fell against the side of the gate somehow he managed to drag the suddenly heavy sword from its scabbard a tanukh his teeth bared appeared before him the man raised his sword with a grin and swung down enkidu saw the blow descending and managed to raise his weapon but the tanukhs powerful stroke brushed aside his feeble resistance and he felt the blade bite deep into his neck a rush of pain exploded through his body blinding him for a moment before the blackness fell over him the pain vanished and he had time for only one thought before death took him at least hed died a warriors death with a weapon in his hand and facing his enemies there would be no evil voices calling him a coward to haunt his way through the underworld eskkar stood at the entrance to the map room watching trella and ismenne make yet more of the neverending adjustments to the pictorial that depicted all the major landmarks and marking stones between akkad and sumer in the two years since trella had unveiled it the map had changed again and again rebuilt and redrawn countless times to include ever more detail and to take into consideration the steady stream of new information that month by month flowed to the map makers hand trellas walkers had paced off the distances between nearly every village and city from north of bisitun to as far south as sumer discreet landmarks recognizable only to those who knew what to look for marked the most direct paths a man might travel marking stones indicated the length of the journey between various points both horsemen and walkers had trod many of the same routes recorded their travels and confirmed their findings piece by piece ismennes deft fingers added each new bit of information to the map after so many years of effort the layout held a prodigious quantity of information since neither eskkar nor his commanders knew for certain what might end up being useful they tended to add everything they could eskkars doubts about the map rooms benefits had vanished long ago it had already demonstrated its worth and as long as it remained a secret known only to a few it would prove even more useful in the coming war with so many details to represent trella and ismenne had created new symbols to explain the map eskkar and his commanders had memorized these new symbols out of necessity but ismenne still received an occasional question over how to comprehend some of the less familiar markings today ismenne took the lead in the latest adjustments and trella standing at her side deferred to her decisions while his wife could complete almost any task she undertook eskkar knew ismenne understood the map better than anyone in akkad and could interpret its patterns of lines and images without effort when one of the commanders had a question ismenne could convert the scale on the map at a glance and she seldom made even minor mistakes eskkar remembered that not many years ago he had needed trella to explain to him the meaning of the word scale now he could grasp the distances landmarks rivers and paths with ease it helped that he had ridden to and from many of these places on his training visits and had verified much of the information with his own eyes with his experience and that of his commanders routes could be planned difficulties accounted for and the necessary supplies and equipment calculated no one man no leader of any group of fighting men could keep so much information in his head the map however held it all the map maker as everyone called ismenne worked as hard as any soldier sweating in the training camps not that many in the city knew either of her existence or her skills the map rooms master craftswoman seldom left the compound when she did hawk clan soldiers provided an unobtrusive protective guard not only did ismenne know more about the map room than anyone but she had heard every plan every strategy every resource that would be used in the eventual conflict with sumer every fifth day eskkar and any of his commanders whose duties kept them in akkad met in the map room to review the latest information from trella and annoksurs agents in the south and to work on the various plans they would set into motion when the war began this mornings meeting had included some new information from the city of isin king naxos of isin had strengthened his walls yet again and increased the number of men under arms in the nearby camp this report required a slight reworking of the map at isin eskkar and the commanders had discussed the new possibilities until midday when his leaders took a break from the mornings work to return to their homes for the midday meal eskkar had stayed behind waiting for trella to finish her discussion with ismenne he and trella would dine together in the workroom the midday meal often provided the days only opportunity for them to relax in each others company he could have taken his place at the table and started without her but it pleased him to watch his wife work she had come to him as a slave more than four years ago from that humble beginning trella had worked day and night often at his side until the citys inhabitants had raised their voices and demanded that eskkar take power in akkad now trella helped rule the city which she helped create thanks to her guidance the people prospered no one starved to death while others had too much food on their tables the kings judge made sure that the laws of akkad applied to all rich and poor eskkar and his wife set the example for the more wealthy of the city dwellers no one wanted to flaunt their riches while the king lived in more humble surroundings with no public display of his power as a result the prosperous merchants and craftsmen held the respect of those beneath them everyone knew the king and queen of akkad ruled for all their subjects not just those who possessed wealth since the barbarian invasion eskkar and his soldiers had worked hard to keep at bay all of akkads enemies nevertheless many gave as much credit to trellas plans and guidance between husband and wife akkads inhabitants slept peacefully at night the approaching war would change all that from all the stories and tales trickling into akkad eskkar expected the outbreak of hostilities soon the coming conflict made these peaceful moments even more precious at last trella straightened up and eskkar knew that the latest difficulty had been resolved she looked at him surprised to find him standing in the doorway trella was he decided even more beautiful than that night when he saw her for the first time then shed been a young girl but one already past the usual age for marriage now she was a woman grown eskkar had taken her to his bed that night and even that first time he knew she possessed something special that she was unlike any woman he had ever known for her part trella had worked her magic on him facing threats from within and without they learned to help each other soon their lives were bound together first as master and slave then as partners working to save the city next as husband and wife and finally king and queen of akkad they had saved each others lives they had fought together and now they ruled together trella was as the barbarians said a gifted woman eskkar knew that some men grew tired of their women or needed second and third wives while he had taken other women from time to time he remained under trellas spell if that were what it was as much today as when theyd first joined even now he felt the stirrings of desire pass through him as he watched the firm muscles move beneath her simple dress shaking himself from his thoughts eskkar entered the map room strode down the length of the table and placed his arm around trellas shoulder i think its time for you and ismenne to take some food and rest he leaned down and kissed the top of trellas head yes lord eskkar ismenne said as soon as i finish making these changes eat first he couldnt help smiling at the girl or youll be too tired to get through the day not that he believed it of course the young girl had plenty of energy and strength still some fresh air and a bite to eat wouldnt hurt perhaps some day trella would bear him a daughter who might grow up as beautiful and wise as ismenne despite her youth corios daughter and her efforts might yet help win the war with sumer they left the map room ismenne closed the door behind them then disappeared down the stairs to tell the servants to bring food to eskkar and trella before they could sit down shouting erupted from the courtyard below hoof beats drummed on the earth a horse neighed and eskkars own mount always close at hand answered it a guard called out the challenge another problem eskkar muttered and always as we sit down to eat eskkar moved to the stairs and started to descend but before he descended halfway to the common room two men burst through the main entrance and headed for the stairs the first man looked up and saw the king standing there eskkar recognized the leader of twenty who guarded akkads main gate lord eskkar the outpost at adarnar has been attacked guards servants even some tradesmen followed the others into the room bantor and grond whod been taking their meal outside pushed the onlookers aside and followed the messengers their eyes as wide with excitement as the youngest recruit eskkar turned his attention to the second man an older soldier swaying on his feet a bloodstained bandage on his left arm and a large bruise on his cheek flecks of dried blood still stained his neck and tunic come upstairs eskkar ordered everyone else wait outside in the courtyard he found trella standing behind him her expression told him she understood the long dreaded war with sumer might have begun grond had to help the wounded man up the steps eskkar dragged over a stool and the soldier slipped onto it with a long gasp of relief trella handed him a cup of wine then had to help hold it while he sipped despite her efforts his trembling hand spilled half the liquid onto his chest staining the ragged garment as red as the blots of color on the dirty bandage send for a healer trella ordered this bandage needs to be changed her fingertips traced the nearly black bruise on his face his cheekbone may be broken as well whats your name eskkar snapped the words out the man appeared ready to slip into shock and needed the sharp words to keep his focus sargat my lord he coughed then again lifted the cup to his lips second in command to enkidu at adarnar what happened alexar and gatus both breathing hard joined them in the workroom drakis entered a moment later and completed the senior commanders in akkad sargat kept his eyes on the king yesterday no three days ago a little before sunset a band of tanukhs rode across the sippar and attacked the outpost adarnar was overrun in moments we tried there were too many of them hundreds and hundreds we couldnt stop them a barbarian raid eskkar decided but perhaps only an isolated attack how many were there how long did adarnar hold out how did you get away everyone had a question at this rate the mans story would take the rest of the day let sargat tell us what happened eskkar cut in before anyone else could speak take your time start at the beginning and tell us everything that you remember the events at adarnar came out in halting words trella refilled the wine cup this time mixing the strong wine with plenty of water no one said a word while sargat spoke every man in the room knew how the tanukhs fought all of them could visualize exactly what had taken place at the fort the soldiers would have fought to the death rather than let themselves be captured and tortured then would come the villagers turn tortured and killed for their captors amusement the women raped before being murdered after watching their children butchered before their eyes when only the dead remained the tanukhs would have burned the fort to the ground while sargat spoke the healer entered the room put down his heavy box of implements and without a word began attending to the wound the soldier scarcely noticed when the healer used his obsidian knife to cut open the wrapping cleaned the deep cut and applied a fresh bandage around the mans arm at last sargat ended his tale and slumped back in the chair his eyes closed did anyone else get away the soldier needed rest needed more attentions from the healer but eskkar had only two more questions the eyes opened yes lord one other i was the last one out the gate i caught up with the last handful of men to ride out we had to fight our way through the tanukhs only myself and one other soldier managed to get though all the confusion there were so many of them and all trying to get into the fort he was wounded as well and i left him behind at the first place of safety i took his horse and rode for akkad as enkidu wanted how sure are you that these raiders were tanukhs they were tanukhs i saw them and heard them speak enkidu recognized them as well not sumerians pretending to be tribesmen then my thanks to you sargat eskkar reached out and touched the mans shoulder youve done well now get some rest he nodded to the healer take him downstairs and do whatever else you can for him tell the servants to put him in the guest chamber eskkar strode across the room and into the map room bantor grond alexar and gatus tramped after him the floor flexing from their weight trella ismenne and annoksur came in together and closed the door standing over the map eskkar studied the land around the symbol that represented adarnar two or three hundred tanukhs thats a lot of men to slip across the border and travel so far east without being noticed all to attack an insignificant outpost they could have found plenty of farms to raid closer to home on both sides of the sippar they could be halfway to akkad by now gatus mused or they could be on their way back to the desert this doesnt make sense bantor said they would have had to cross over larsas territory they must have been seen we should have gotten word of their passage eskkar turned to trella and annoksur nothing my lord annoksurs voice showed her concern it was her task to gather information in order to prevent such a thing i spoke with a trader yesterday who came from larsa he heard nothing out of the ordinary only the steady preparations for war even to the people of larsa a band of tanukhs would be noticed and talked about unless they crossed over further south eskkar traced the sippar river with his finger its longer but sumer could also have given them passage through part of their lands the tanukhs could then ride north and strike anywhere they wanted more muffled shouting came from the common room below until one voice rose up over everything else lord eskkar i must speak with lord eskkar at once they heard the heavy tread of footsteps on the stairs eskkar had just opened the map room door when a soldier pushed his way into the workroom eskkar recognized daro one of yavtars commanders daro whats wrong the man looked almost as weary as sargat bloody bandages covered both his hands what happened to your hands daro lifted his hands as if seeing them for the first time from working the oar weve been rowing upriver for almost two days he shook his head the enemy has taken kanesh theyve stopped all the traffic on the river no boats are coming north eskkar glanced at gatus then nodded to trella one attack might be just a raid but two that meant hostilities had broken out the same force that attacked adarnar couldnt have reached kanesh so quickly nor would kanesh have fallen so easily with its force of more than ninety defenders eskkar guided daro back to the workroom table and gestured him to the same stool just vacated by sargat sit down and tell me what happened take your time and dont leave anything out w hen daro finished his tale eskkar ordered him to see the healer and remain in the compound now only the commanders remained sitting around the table in the workroom how can this have happened gatus asked the question none of the others wanted to voice we expected to have days of warning plenty of time to reinforce kanesh they had argued over sending more soldiers to kanesh but in the end they decided it might provoke the conflict im sorry gatus trellas voice showed her concern our last reports one arrived only yesterday showed nothing unusual in sumer or larsa the sumerians showed no signs of moving to the attack no increase in the number of men no largescale movement of supplies and yet they took us by surprise captured adarnar kanesh and who knows how many other outposts gatus clenched his fist and rapped it on the table all by using the tanukhs against us now the way is clear for them to ravage all the countryside south and east of akkad how they did it doesnt matter now eskkar said he felt the same anger as gatus but trella had provided them with good and timely information for almost four years somehow the boy king of sumer has struck the first blow by now his infantry forces are on the move marching at top speed toward kanesh theyll be there long before we can muster enough force to recapture the outpost once theyve strengthened kanesh bantor said theyll move north they could be at akkad in five or ten days but theyll never be able to take the city theyll come in force and prepared for a long siege gatus shook his head in frustration well be trapped inside akkad with so many men they could just starve us out while they harvest our crops and herds in the countryside we need more reports on what their strength is eskkar kept his voice calm even with his closest commanders he didnt intend to show any fear or doubt well need strong troops of cavalry to range the countryside learn how many men we face once hathor arrives with all the horsemen and we can dispatch them on patrols well know better what to do we may learn more from our spies in the next few days annoksur waited until all the bad news had sunk in and those fleeing the tanukhs may be able to tell us more meanwhile we should not let the city see how grave this situation is trella said if they see us looking worried the commanders understood that problem if the people living in and around akkad saw doubts and fears on their leaders faces theyd flee the city and the defenders would have even fewer resources to withstand sumers armies we need to do more than that eskkar looked for a moment at each of his commanders we need to tell no show the people that we will not only strike back but that we will defeat sumer we need to remind everyone in akkad that the one who strikes the first blow may not be the one who strikes the last in battle anything can happen our first defense has been broken but weve many more weapons we can bring to bear the people need to know that we will not only avenge the loss of kanesh but punish sumer and the other cities until they beg for peace we need to show more than strength we need our people to understand that we are determined to avenge our losses and that we will win the people already believe it trella said you saved akkad once from certain destruction if we show strength then they will remember that above all else you will protect akkad when i march our spearmen through the citys lanes gatus said the people will believe in our victory and as annoksur says eskkar reminded them well know more in a few days there is no real danger to akkad yet and weve enough time to prepare still were going to need a new plan gatus said almost all of their tactics had relied on kanesh withstanding any attacks at least for a few days until help could arrive or an orderly retreat set in motion now ninety good fighting men were dead or captured in kanesh and another thirty in adarnar other outposts along the river had probably met the same fate akkad would be cut off from all information about the borderlands oh yes eskkar answered wondering if his face revealed his own doubts we will most certainly need a new plan a t sunset eskkar and trella dined alone in the workroom neither had much to say she had set aside their usual evening meal eaten outside in the courtyard and always with the company of one or two of eskkars commanders and their wives or a few important tradesmen tonight they needed to be alone with their thoughts eskkar had given all the necessary orders and his commanders had taken over within the city three hundred archers readied themselves for a possible attack messengers galloped off to the north announcing the arrival of war and summoning all the soldiers from the training camps over the last few months in preparation for the call to arms akkads horsemen and spearmen had moved closer to the city shifting in small groups from the northernmost camps to newer ones closer to akkad only a few miles away just across the tigris close to three hundred of hathors besttrained cavalry stood ready to ride at a moments notice and on the east bank of the river less than three miles away five hundred tough spearmen waited for gatuss orders the complete force of akkads army needed only a few more days to reach the city other riders had ridden to the outlying farms and villages warning them to seek protection within akkads high walls in the next few days grain herd animals and other supplies would flood into the city in preparation for a siege of long duration storage rooms would be filled to capacity with everything needed to withstand a siege akkads leaders had prepared as best they could for exactly this event in the coming days weeks or months those preparations would be tested against swords and spears eskkar ate without tasting pushing the warm chicken into his mouth washing it down with wellwatered ale he left untouched the plate of still warm vegetables that he usually enjoyed especially when dipped in oil at last eskkar pushed his plate away and lifted his eyes to find trellas gaze on him the barbarians are coming once again trella said its almost as it was the night before the alur meriki attacked weve done all we can to prepare now we have to fight to learn our fate the sumerians arent barbarians yes they are husband of a different sort but just as eager to destroy what weve built it seems as if mankind is divided into two kinds of people barbarians who want to take from others and those of us who want to make something better for ourselves our friends and our children all the progress weve made in the last few years its all the work of a few good men working together in a way the sumerians are even worse barbarians than the alur meriki at least the steppe people know no other way but sumerias rulers should know better they should work for their own people instead they crave triumphs over their own kind and others they create disaster everywhere they must be stopped eskkar accepted the gentle rebuke trella understood his concerns his worries his fear of failure but she also wanted him to stand strong and do what had to be done not stopped trella they must be crushed beaten down so hard that they never attempt this kind of war again to give passage to the tanukhs the enemy of their own kind everymans enemy so that they can pillage our lands youre right theyre worse than the alur meriki ever could be you are the man to do it eskkar there is no other in akkad who can do what needs to be done it will be a hard fight he reminded her though she as well as anyone understood the ways of war many will die if you do not win everyone in akkad may die remember that eskkar do what you must to make sure this doesnt happen again sargon and i will await your return without realizing it trella had uttered much the same words that every mother in the alur meriki and other barbarian clans spoke when they bid their husbands and sons a final message before departing for war return victorious over your enemies or die bravely only by victory could the women and children left behind be truly safe eskkar reached out and touched her hand then ill return with a victory wife five days later the tanukhs continued raiding the southern countryside but they had not moved as far north as eskkar expected instead they remained close to kanesh and the sippar hundreds of farmers and villagers had fled the desert horsemens advance running in fear to akkad some continuing on to even more distant villages most of the land between the city and kanesh lay empty there would be no harvest this season and crops not burned by tanukhs would wither in the fields only mounted scouts from both sides now ranged the empty land each probing the others strength and gathering what information they could as eskkar predicted the same day the tanukhs attacked kanesh the sumerians summoned their men gathered their forces and moved northward shulgis vast army of soldiers traveled slowly carrying a mountain of food with them and making sure their supply lines remained intact to everyones surprise they halted when they reached kanesh and soon word reached the akkadians that shulgi had begun strengthening the villages defenses with the war now openly proclaimed trellas spies and informers had gleaned the basic thrust of shulgis plan he intended to march to akkad north along the tigris but he also planned to establish half a dozen fortified outposts along the way if that required twenty or thirty days or even longer it didnt matter shulgi intended to ensure that supplies from the south could continue to reach his massive force if attacked by akkads army the sumerians could simply fall back to the nearest outpost and regroup before resuming their northward trek trella had even learned the planned location of the last outpost a mere four miles from akkad from there shulgis men would encircle the city crowded with people the city would have to surrender in a few months when the food ran out eskkar spent half the morning with his commanders discussing the latest reports though they added little to what he already knew when he had heard all the evil tidings he could stomach he dismissed his men now only he and trella remained in the map room except for ismenne eskkar wanted her there in case anything in the maps terrain affected his plan he closed the door ive decided on a way to defeat shulgis forces before i tell gatus and the others i wanted to share it with you both i need to know if it can work ismennes eyes darted back and forth but trella merely looked curious she knew eskkar had spent most of the night alone in the map room whatever way we can help husband he put his hand on the map beside the city of akkad step by step he went through what he wanted to do what he would need at each step of the way and how he expected the sumerians to react when eskkar finished he stood at the foot of the table and his hand rested on the city of sumer ismennes eyes were wide with astonishment trella merely nodded a dangerous plan eskkar but what else would i expect from you come ismenne let us see what we can do to help eskkar we must think of everything that may go wrong as well and at every stage they returned to the head of the table and started there one by one eskkar worked through trellas suggestions and objections until they again reached the end of the table at last eskkar felt satisfied with what he would propose to his commanders its the only way to win he said better to risk much to win everything trella said the danger is great but no worse than staying here its the only way to end this war and the map he added the plan could not be done without it speed will be your only ally then its time to tell gatus and the others my thanks to you ismenne with the decision came a certain peace of mind the last few days had taxed even his strength tonight eskkar knew he would sleep well for the first time since word of the fall of kanesh reached akkad he left the map room and descended to the courtyard the sun had passed midafternoon eskkar hadnt realized how much time hed spent talking to trella he found grond waiting for him feet up on the table dozing in the shade of the house his bodyguard had learned to sleep when and where he could wake up grond dispatch runners to the commanders tell them i want them all here tonight for a meeting in the map room then get your sword i need to feel the weight of a blade in my hand yes captain gronds feet hit the ground and a broad smile covered his face its about time we got down to business eskkar spent the remainder of the afternoon practicing his swordplay against grond first with wooden swords then beating two training poles into splinters with his bronze blade when they had finished eskkar felt satisfied and glad to have accomplished something if only a good swordpractice session he washed up at the well and returned to the workroom just as the commanders began to arrive all of the senior men were there gatus yavtar bantor hathor mitrac klexor drakis alexar and even shappa the commander of the slingers hathor had arrived two days ago with the last of the cavalry the remaining spearmen and archers had reached akkad only that morning yavtars boats and fighting crews waited at rebbas farm trying to stay out of sight of shulgis spies trella annoksur and ismenne completed the group ismenne closed the door when the last man filed through they took their positions behind the map they knew what faced them the decisions they would make this day would seal the fate of akkad for good or evil theyre digging in at kanesh gatus started the session rapping one of the wooden pointers on the table for emphasis the last of shulgis infantry arrived along with a huge supply caravan a few more days work fortifying kanesh and well never retake it it will be a secure base for all of shulgis forces the sumerians still have to come to akkad alexar said well meet them halfway and attack we know the ground and can pick a favorable site for our spearmen if were defeated well have no other course of action but to hold out in akkad bantor argued we might as well just wait for them here were still getting all the supplies we need from the north enough the single word brought everyones attention to eskkar we have been over all this before no need to repeat it again he stationed himself midway down the table with larsa within easy reach our situation is grave eskkar began without preamble shulgi has moved with caution and has left us with few options we can either stay within the walls or march down to kanesh and fight if we fight him there well be outnumbered four or five to one with the outpost under his control he can take a defensive position and wait for us to attack by the time we get to kanesh shulgi will have fortified it against any assault even assuming we can cut through his army to reach it eskkar took a sip from his water cup and let his eyes touch each of his commanders he could see it on their faces no matter how willing to fight their grim demeanors already hinted at eventual defeat he went on softening his voice as if speaking about the weather if we stay here in the next few days ten or fifteen at most shulgi will begin moving north taking his time and protecting his rear in a month or so hell trap us inside akkad cut the river supply lines strengthen his position surrounding us and starve us into submission two or three months after that our food will run out while hell feed his men with akkads grain taken from our croplands no one said anything as eskkar said they had been over this before so i propose to carry the fight to him tomorrow well begin the march south well leave behind just enough force for bantor to hold the city thats what shulgi expects us to do gatus countered hell be waiting im going with you bantor said im not staying behind you have to stay eskkar made his words final youve been preparing the citys defenses for two years you know better than anyone how to hold this place every man within akkad knows and trusts you its likely that youll end up facing the full force of sumers attack no one in this room can defend the city better after youve been defeated at kanesh bantor couldnt conceal his anger i dont intend to be defeated at kanesh eskkar said in fact i dont intend to fight at all at least not yet and certainly not at kanesh they stared at him some smiling for the first time others surprised at the hint of a new strategy gatus laughed his coarse guffaw breaking the tension so youve come up with some new harebrained idea to get us all killed ive been expecting some strange barbarian tactic to pop out of your mouth its dangerous enough gatus eskkar said but youre the one who made it possible so if anything goes wrong it will be as much your fault as mine now do you want to complain or would you rather hear what ive got to say he went through the plan for the second time that day explaining every task he expected to complete and the role each of them would play eskkar plotted each days position on the map laid out his forces and their objectives he spoke slowly covering every essential point men horses boats supplies weapons eskkar explained how he intended to use each of them slowly his commanders began to nod their heads in agreement nevertheless every one of them had a half dozen objections and as many suggestions eskkar answered them all one by one and in as much detail as he could then gatus started answering the questions followed by hathor by then eskkar could lean against the map room wall and watch he turned to trella and saw the slight movement of her eyes that meant approval eskkars commanders had accepted his plan and soon they would make it their own gatus had the last question and he directed it not at eskkar but trella and you think this can work ismenne agrees with this annoksur we see no other way to win gatus trella answered every other course of action merely delays our defeat eskkars plan is not something shulgi will expect it is dangerous to be sure but no more dangerous than remaining inside akkad and waiting for the end and well be on the offensive gatus snorted offensive is that what youre calling it well i always said your husband would get us all killed one of these days i just never expected anything like this still i do like it better than hiding behind akkads walls and waiting doing that once was enough he glanced around the table when do we march tomorrow eskkar glanced up at the narrow windows and saw only grayness dusk had fallen youve got the rest of the night to prepare your men all of you t he next morning just before dawn eskkar rode out of the compound grond at his side twenty picked warriors from the hawk clan waited in the lane outside his personal guard ten rode in advance and ten followed close behind eskkars horse the horsemen kept their eyes moving and their hands on their swords war had come to akkad and treachery could strike at any moment and from any direction the city always held a good number of strangers and even annoksurs army of women couldnt watch all of them all the time a single arrow shot from a rooftop could bring down even eskkar but the lanes of akkad remained almost empty of life and the few sleepy tradesmen who happened to be up and about shrank in fear against the nearest wall or ducked back into the first doorway they could reach as the grim riders trotted by eskkars guards never slowed and they soon reached the citys main gate which creaked open just in time to let the king and his guards ride through without breaking the pace they followed the wellpacked dirt of the road until it forked then took the southern route toward the first assembly point about six miles away in the last few days eskkars commanders had assembled the army in four such camps each a few miles apart with such a large number of soldiers under arms eskkar didnt want the men wandering loose in akkad with its numerous temptations for women wine and gambling not to mention any possible spies from sumer or even traders who might talk too much about what theyd seen or heard and so the men had said their farewells days ago and now waited for the order to march eskkar had said his goodbye to trella last night when they held each other tight they had never endured a parting such as this often enough eskkar had ridden off to do battle but this time he went to wage war on the land of sumeria and for this conflict there would be many battles to be fought both of them knew that this might be the last time they could cling to each other even eskkars final words had acknowledged the risk watch over sargon our son train him well a poor choice of words eskkar decided in the light of dawn almost as if he expected to fall in battle he felt no such premonitions no hint from the gods that this time his luck might desert him but only a fool tempted fate with such words the one sensation he experienced was relief more than two years of preparation had created a welltrained and superbly equipped army now would come the true test of all that time and training the sooner he closed with shulgis invaders the quicker the war would end at the first camp hathor waited with three hundred horsemen mounted and ready to ride in addition to their weapons each man carried a water skin and a sack bulging with food twenty pack animals brought up the rear each burdened with a cooking pot and as much bread and grain as it could carry no fires burned and only a few women and boys stood watching in silence many with tears streaming down their faces as their menfolk rode off to war eskkar and his guards fell in beside the egyptian who gave the command that started the entire force moving in a double column any problems the two leaders rode close together feet almost touching as they cantered along at an easy pace none captain not even a horse going lame the men are eager to ride lets hope they feel that when they see razreks cavalry hathor laughed one battle at a time isnt that what you keep saying this time it was eskkar who laughed my father used to say dont count the number of your enemies just kill the man in front of you your father must have been a great and wise warrior he was something in eskkars words told hathor not to pursue the subject not many knew about eskkars early years and his wanderings before coming to akkad he preferred to keep that part of his life a wellguarded secret they reached the second camp without speaking further klexor pulled himself onto his horse as they approached and swung in beside eskkar and hathor who slowed their pace but didnt halt the men good morning captain my men are ready to ride well done klexor eskkar reached out and placed his hand on the mans shoulder as the original column rode past klexors five hundred and thirty riders fell into place behind them by the time they gathered in the scouts on patrol and the ur nammu riders there would be close to eight hundred and fifty horsemen the third camp stood ready when they arrived gatus wearing a widebrimmed reed hat to shade his bald head from the sun sat astride a gentle mare at least for this campaign the old soldier had decided to admit his age gatus had promised his men that he would march and fight on foot beside them but they had protested until he agreed to use the mare to keep pace with his men now he waited at the head of twentyeight hundred spearmen eskkar halted the horsemen and waved toward gatus who ordered his men to move out marching them four abreast and taking the lead except for those riding patrols around the main force the horsemen would follow in their path leaving the way free of horse droppings for the foot soldiers the bowmen slingers and the remaining men waited at the fourth camp eskkar could see a few of them still taking target practice as his men approached when they saw eskkar approaching at the head of the army alexar and mitrac summoned their men back into ranks and they fell in behind gatus and his spearmen the city of akkad was going to war with a mighty army larger than anything eskkar had ever imagined counting everyone the army numbered just over five thousand an incredible number of fighting men he knew they were good men many had trained for this day for over two years and even the least experienced man among them had at least six months to learn his trade those with less experience remained in akkad to continue their training and defend the citys walls under bantors command eskkars most loyal commander bantor had protested his assignment most of the night finally gatus ended the argument were leaving our women and children in your care because youre the best man to protect them so follow your orders and stop complaining just because you cant go off and get killed with the rest of us eskkar had smiled at that in reality he had wanted to leave gatus behind as well but he knew all the spearmen would fight better under gatuss eye besides he would never have obeyed such an order as they marched south eskkar studied the men the soldiers training had been arduous even brutal at times but as eskkar and every barbarian knew from childhood you trained long and hard so that the actual fighting would be easy not easy but at least something familiar to each man he had to remind himself that more than half of these men had never raised a weapon in anger for many of them real battle would be something new and frightening something beyond anything theyd ever dreamed of fortunately the sumerian soldiers were much the same at least as far as battle experience but what the sumerians lacked in experience they made up in numbers trellas spies had come up with all kinds of numbers but they all agreed on one thing at least fifteen thousand men were under arms controlled by king shulgi other estimates had placed the number of akkadian enemies at as much as twentyfive thousand a number so vast that eskkar had trouble grasping it six cities plus the halfbarbarian scum that lived and raided along the western desert now served under shulgis banner the sumerian king might be little more than a boy but somehow in two short years he had assembled and trained the largest army the world had ever seen and now he intended to use it against akkad eskkar understood what risks lay ahead of him if he faced shulgi in battle and were defeated it might mean the end of akkad even if eskkar and part of his army survived and managed to retreat behind akkads walls such a huge enemy force could take its time and starve the city until it surrendered and these new besiegers would not repeat the mistakes of the alur meriki the sumerians would establish their resupply lines and take their time until the city was ripe for the taking eskkar frowned at the thought the idea of someone other than himself and trella ruling akkads people and lands was unbearable worried about something captain hathors words brought eskkar back to the present he straightened up and pushed the dark thoughts from his mind just thinking about whats ahead of us shulgi has raised a powerful force but our men are better trained and hes young and lacks experience as long as as long as we dont fight him on his terms eskkar laughed well lets hope our plan for that works it will captain it will the army of akkad marched south at an easy pace they stayed close to the tigris both for access to fresh water and to be resupplied by yavtars boats for the last two years while eskkar worked and trained with his commanders yavtar and trella had planned ways to supply the army in preparation they established eight temporary docks and way stations between akkad and the border outpost of kanesh as soon as the army commenced moving south a steady stream of boats loaded up their cargo and pushed away from akkads jetties trellas supply clerks many of them women had planned each march of the campaign and knew what particular supplies would be needed at every step those cargoes would make sure eskkars forces traveled light and fast the army would stop briefly at each way station on their journey south and yavtars fleet of boats would bring grain for the horses and fresh bread for the soldiers eskkar knew that trella would keep the cooking ovens in akkad burning from dawn until well into the night and that supplies and even a few extra men would be ready for him at every stage of his march shulgis army also relied on the river for food and supplies but if trellas spies knew their business the sumerians had less than fifty boats working the river yavtar meanwhile commanded over sixty supply vessels plus ten ships fitted specifically for battle each warship carried at least sixteen to twenty archers in addition to the regular crew of sailors and rowers these ships would provide protection for the supply ships the sumerians had captured the trading post at kanesh established two years ago to facilitate trade between akkad and the sumerian cities located at the juncture of the tigris and the sippar the post had little value except as a place to store goods being shipped north or south and to provide travelers and traders a safe place to meet and haggle over prices nevertheless almost a hundred archers and swordsmen had been stationed there and the villagers dwelling within had increased that number to well over three hundred eskkar had hoped when the inevitable war broke out to either reinforce the outpost or get the soldiers guarding it out in time but kanesh had fallen in a single morning cut off and taken by a heavy force of tanukh horsemen before the first rumor of war arrived from the south all the supplies awaiting shipment in kanesh had been taken intact the defenders now all dead or enslaved probably had no time even to destroy the goods now all of shulgis army had camped there digging in and waiting for eskkar to march south and meet them in battle the idea of sumerians enjoying akkads supplies while they waited to crush his army rankled eskkar more than he showed as the men marched eskkar rode up and down alongside the men observing their faces looking for signs of fear or doubt after the first of these inspections the soldiers stopped being nervous about his passage they smiled or waved showing no more concern for their fate than if they were on yet one more of gatuss strenuous training marches eskkars careful scrutiny of his men impressed all the leaders of ten twenty fifty and one hundred the idea that the king of akkad might find fault with some equipment or even the careless handling of their weapons made every man in the army conscious of their duty he did the same reviews at least three or four per day on the cavalry archers and especially the slingers their relative youthfulness made it hard for them to restrain their excitement from their looks and gestures they might have been rushing back to akkad to fill the local taverns for a night of feasting five days after departing akkad at midmorning eskkar saw three riders returning at a gallop the leader of the scouts raced down the column of soldiers until he reached gatus and eskkar who recognized the man tarok another veteran who had fought in the battle to recapture akkad from the egyptian korthac tarok pulled up and guided his horse alongside the akkadian leaders we saw the sumerians tarok couldnt keep the excitement from his voice its a great force spread out on the plain just north of kanesh their cavalry drove us off how many eskkar surrounded by his commanders waited to hear taroks estimate we saw at least two or three thousand horses tarok said his eyes wide with wonder at the number we didnt have time to take a better count eskkar heard the murmur spread up and down the column at the news well then im glad you got away no sense in fighting such a large force with just the three of you everyone laughed and the tension was broken youve done well report to hathor meanwhile well keep moving according to our plan eskkar and his commanders had known of the size of the enemys cavalry taroks sighting merely confirmed it in a few hours well reach the tigris and obtain supplies from yavtars boats theyll be expecting us to do battle in the morning gatus said they know we cant just march down here and then turn back without a fight even more likely the sumerians will expect us to launch a surprise attack tonight the easiest way for a smaller force to defeat a larger one was to attack at night catching the enemy asleep and unprepared well give them a surprise all right eskkar said but not the one theyre expecting push on to the river the army continued its movement turning slightly westward to reach the tigris before nightfall about two miles north of kanesh they made camp along the river and gatus made certain that a strong force of pickets and skirmishers patrolled the land by then razreks scouts had drawn ever closer ranging up and down the column galloping every which way and trying to entice their enemy into giving chase the akkadians kept a wary eye on their enemy but otherwise ignored them the soldiers might have grown nervous at the sight of the sumerians but they saw their commanders unconcern and drew strength from that before dusk fell eight boats carrying supplies from akkad slid ashore draelin another of yavtars leaders splashed ashore even before the first boat ground its bottom against the riverbank take me to lord eskkar he commanded moments later draelin stood before eskkar grond gatus hathor and the other commanders all of them crowding around the messenger lord i bring word from bantor a large force of barbarians has been sighted to the east riding hard bantor thinks they may not be tanukhs but alur meriki they might be coming to strike at akkad eskkar swore at the news a grimace on his face how soon before they reach the city another three or four days draelin answered no more than that any word on how many draelin shook his head hundreds a thousand no one knows well if its alur meriki they dont have a thousand warriors gatus said if they mustered every fighter that can sit on a horse they might have half that number eskkar nodded for almost five years hed waited knowing that some day when the alur meriki had recovered their strength they would return to akkad to settle their blood debt but trellas spies had not neglected the eastern lands where the alur meriki had gone and he had a rough idea of the forces they could muster if they send a raiding party even a large one it wont be more than two or three hundred men thats not enough to take akkad gatus said why would they risk provoking us making us come after them unless unless they knew all our fighters had gone south to fight sumeria eskkar shook his head this is another of shulgis plots demons take the boy king he must have allied himself with the alur meriki or at least warned them of his plans so they decided this is the time to strike to take their revenge three or four hundred barbarians on horses arent going to scale akkads new walls gatus said our men there can hold them off eskkar had left four hundred and fifty fighters in akkad to defend the city barely enough to guard the walls properly many of those left behind were considered to be too old or too young for a vigorous campaign in the south the citys inhabitants would have to join in the defense as well and bantors men had been training them too many had taken part in the defense of the city during the alur meriki siege and would supplement the soldiers and with so many people crowding into the city seeking safety there should be more than enough to withstand any attacks at least for the next few weeks the alur meriki raiders would terrorize the countryside but they couldnt do any real damage to akkad itself gone were the days when its inhabitants trembled at the name of the dreaded barbarian horsemen unless theyre betrayed from within eskkar turned to draelin youre going back on the river at once double up the crew and get back there as fast as you can tell bantor to be wary of treachery some plot to open the gates or scale the wall somehow i was hoping to stay with you lord eskkar and join the fight here i think youll find all the fighting you want back in akkad take my message to bantor and trella go now yes lord draelin turned and ran off back toward the river damn the alur meriki eskkar said id hoped we were done with them for a few more years may they all rot in the demons pits gatus said not caring that eskkar had once belonged to that clan you think shulgi has men inside akkad we have men inside their cities some of trellas deeplaid plans over the last two years were still to be put to the test but shulgi and kushanna were just as crafty if the sumerians have been talking to the alur meriki they must have talked about some way to get inside we can send some men back to the city hathor said a few hundred horsemen ought to be enough to drive them off no thats what shulgi wants for us to try and defend the city if we send men back we wont have enough to fight the sumerians we need every man we have eskkar took a deep breath akkad will have to hold out by itself draelin should be back before the alur meriki arrive gatus said its only going to take him a day or so to get upriver trella will be watching for any treachery as soon as she heard of the alur merikis approach shell know what to do i could send some horsemen in case draelin doesnt get through hathor suggested no were already surrounded by razreks fighters youd never get a man through on horseback only the river is safe now then we continue on we continue make sure the men get as much rest and sleep as possible i want us to be well on our way before daybreak this may be their last good nights sleep for quite a while you know what to do make sure everything is ready eskkar strode away to try and get some sleep if he could he had forced himself to sound confident before his men but worries about trella and little sargons safety would be with him for the next few days no one wanted to return to akkad more than he did but he had to trust in trella and her instincts she would know what to do and bantor would heed her advice between the two of them akkad would be well defended when eskkar did finally fall asleep he dreamt of the days when he stood on oraks walls defending the village from the ravaging alur meriki the rest of the akkadians settled in for the night nearly a quarter of the men remained awake and alert and even those who slept kept their weapons at hand torches burned all night lit by oil delivered as part of the boats cargo just for that purpose he slept uneasily waking often once eskkar roused himself enough to speak to some of the guards all of whom urged him to return to sleep when grond finally woke him eskkar glanced up at the sky the waning moon indicated dawn was still far off but that made no difference in moments he was wide awake slinging his sword over his shoulder is everything ready eskkar knew that grond would have awakened even earlier and would have checked on gatus and hathors preparations yes captain gatus will be ready to move out in a few moments eskkar strode among his men stepping in and out of the light cast by the flickering torches faces turned toward his and for the first time he saw a hint of fear and nervousness on their faces the night held its own terrors and made even brave men afraid he found hathor klexor and fashod together making their final preparations at the last moment fashod of the ur nammu had decided to join the expedition and take command of the forty warriors who had volunteered to fight akkads enemies most of them were young and looking forward to their first battle all three men faced him as he approached and in the flickering torchlight he saw no signs of doubt or concern on anyones face were ready to begin captain your men are going to be surprised that they will klexor said half of them will piss themselves with fright when they finally learn of the plan and the other half will be too scared to piss eskkar answered the old adage never more true than now good hunting to you all ill see you on the twelfth day on the twelfth day well be there captain for a moment eskkar felt tempted to go over the plan once again but he caught himself in time both hathor and klexor knew what to do their subcommanders would learn the news once the sun had risen and the horsemen were safely out on their way then get your men moving make sure my way is clear until dawn at the next campfire he found gatus and alexar waiting for him to arrive both of them ready to move out its time to go eskkar well then gatus lead them out eskkar glanced behind him and saw the first column of hathors riders on the move everything had been discussed and planned and readied for this moment once the horsemen moved out eskkar his commanders everyone would be committed if he had misjudged their enemy or something unforeseen cropped up they might all be dead by midday grond approached leading two horses and eskkar took boys halter hed named his favorite warhorse after the fine stallion hed ridden many years ago boy stood even taller than his namesake and eskkar had worked with him until the two of them merged into a single fighter well boy todays the day you earn all that grain youve been eating all these years he swung up onto boys back the stallion bucked once just to show his spirit and then settled in the sun edged over the horizon casting a rosy glow into the sky the soldiers shoved the torches into the earth and gathered up their weapons gatus started the spearmen moving south screened by horsemen on either side the men walked in a column four abreast every man grunting under the heavy load of food and bulging water skins they carried along with their weapons shouts echoed from the darkness all around them the sumerian sentries heard the activity had probably crept up close enough to see what was going on that didnt matter as long as they didnt try to contest the passage which wasnt likely shulgi and razrek had probably expected a night attack when that had failed to materialize the sumerians would assume an attack at dawn they would expect the akkadians to move toward them would be waiting for them when dawn broke indeed eskkar felt certain king shulgi and his sumerian allies had prepared well for any assault on his position they were going to be surprised indeed when the sun rose by midmorning a crowd of soldiers milled about near king shulgis command post blocking the path cleared and marked so that scouts and other messengers could bring messages to their leader swearing at the stupidity of villagers turned soldiers who couldnt seem to remember the simplest of orders razrek rode his gray stallion to within fifty paces of his destination before he swung down from his horse he pushed his way through a group of laughing soldiers knocking one man aside and sending another stumbling to the ground the offended soldier rose with a curse that died on his lips when he saw razreks scowling face even before the man recognized the sumerian armys second in command king shulgi seated on a stool before a narrow table scarcely larger than the map that covered its surface glanced up at razreks approach shulgis handsome face looked grim either from lack of sleep or the failure of eskkar to attack where is the barbarian thousands of lips had mouthed the same question since well before the dawn the sumerians had remained awake all night catching what rest they could while they stood at their posts expecting an attack from the akkadians before sunrise word spread that eskkars forces were on the move and every sumerian forgot their weariness snatched up their weapons and again prepared to meet his attack but the dawn revealed nothing but an empty plain facing the alert and ready sumerian force the soldiers had breathed a sigh of relief when they realized that there might be no battle today and fallen back into their careless habits hes not coming shulgi razreks voice sounded as harsh as the expression on his face eskkars moving to the south with his infantry and the cavalry theyve ridden off in another direction as soon as it was light the akkadian cavalry galloped upstream about ten miles then crossed over the tigris before my men could catch them i sent a thousand horsemen after them as soon i learned they were riding out our men stopped when they reached the river and sent word back shulgis fist slammed onto the table your riders should have followed them crossed the river after them attacked them instead you let them get away without even a skirmish perhaps but why waste the men the scouts say eskkar is with his spearmen if hes fool enough to send his horse fighters back to akkad to defend the city or off on some raid so much the better for us if they were going back to akkad why cross the river razrek shrugged maybe they wanted to slow down our pursuit or they didnt want to take a chance encountering the alur meriki the akkadians must have gotten word about them by now forget his cavalry we should go after eskkar if hes stupid enough to go south we can catch up with him block his path and crush him hes only got a few dozen horsemen with him im not moving my men until i know where eskkar is if we break camp and take up the pursuit he could double back and attack us while were spread out maybe destroy the vanguard it took a whole day to get the men prepared to face him here and all our supplies are here shulgi unclenched the fist that rested on the map where will he go and why south and why divide his men hes already outnumbered almost five to one shulgi had over twentyone thousand men with him with more trickling in each day his spies told him the akkadians could scarcely muster five thousand what does it matter the thought of looting an entire city especially one as rich as akkad brought a grin to razreks face now we can march on akkad capture his city while hes away and end the war with a single stroke and what will eskkar be doing all that time it will take us at least a week to march to akkad and who knows how long to fight our way inside akkads walls are thick and high the akkadians have had plenty of time to prepare for our attack it might take months to capture the city and even longer to starve them out in that much time the barbarian would ravage all of sumeria he could force the other cities to submit or even change sides he might end up camped in front of sumer akkads new walls and mighty gates were the envy of every other city in the land with a new and even deeper ditch carved beneath them it would take plenty of resources and preparation to surmount them more important it would take time days months no one knew for certain the city may have already fallen to the alur meriki razrek hadnt lost his desire to go north if not our men are still inside they might still open the gates for us if thats true then the city will wait shulgi said we need to destroy eskkar and his infantry before he destroys us i think hes going to larsa hes going to try and take the city and cut off our supplies nearly every wagonload of food and grain needed by shulgis army passed through larsa boats and pack trains stretched all the way back to sumer and the other cities all with larsa as their first destination ships and their cargoes stopped there too shulgis men consumed enormous quantities of food far more than could easily be obtained from the countryside and the horses needed grain it would take eight or ten days to send word south and direct the supply caravans to a new destination with so many mouths to feed food for the men was already in short supply the nearby farms had been stripped clean days ago all the more reason to march on akkad theres plenty of food up north if larsa falls isin and uruk might be tempted to ally themselves with eskkar and his men even worse they could demand the return of their forces weakening us when we need them most razrek rested his hand on the table and leaned over larsas walls are strong they can hold out for weeks maybe longer it will take eskkar five or six days to march his foot soldiers there i can have five hundred horsemen there in three days with that many extra men to strengthen the defenses larsa can laugh at eskkars puny force send eight hundred shulgi ordered and i want them moving today i dont care if they dont eat or drink until they reach larsa or their horses drop dead from exhaustion after they arrive and use the rest of your men to slow eskkar down engage him in battle harry his flanks attack his rear anything you can think of and what will you be doing my king while im sacrificing my men by attacking akkadian bowmen and infantry by dawn tomorrow as soon as were certain he isnt doubling back im coming after him you just have to buy me time to catch up with him slow him down while we give larsa time to prepare hopefully well finish him off outside the gates of larsa catch him between our forces and the citys walls all right ill send mattaki and no you go yourself take the eight hundred i want you inside larsa if eskkar ever reaches there hes liable to get there faster than you think leave mattaki in charge of the remaining horsemen let him nip at eskkars heels and once youre inside the gates make sure the citys elders dont decide to change sides or fail to mount a real defense cut off a few heads if you have to but make sure you can hold out until i arrive razrek considered his orders at least he could take his ease in the city while waiting for shulgi and larsas merchants were rumored to have plenty of gold as you command lord shulgi ill be on my way by midday even if eskkar reaches the city hell not get in shulgis eyes returned to the map make sure that he doesnt k ushanna flung the cup clattering across the room the water it contained splashing over the polished wood floor rage suffused her face her lips narrowing in anger at sohrabs words are you sure you conveyed my message exactly as i gave it to you you left nothing out added nothing sohrab quailed before her wrath i delivered your words with care my queen i added nothing i swear it hed expected her to be angry but not like this someone would pay for this tonight sohrab just hoped it wouldnt be him tell me again what she said every word every gesture sohrab took a moment to compose himself a messenger who couldnt deliver a precise message soon found himself out of work trained almost from birth he could memorize and recount even a long conversation between several participants lady trella told me to give you this reply she made me repeat it twice to make sure i wouldnt forget he closed his eyes for a moment to return his thoughts to the meeting with lady trella sohrab would echo every intonation of trellas words she said queen kushanna of sumer i thank you for discovering my brother almaric and removing him from the mines that mercy will be returned to you please tell almaric of my love and that i expect to see him soon but the ransom you request of eight hundred pieces of silver for his delivery to akkad is not possible in this time of war between our cities i will however pay twenty silver coins for his quick and safe return that is more than twice the price for a young and healthy male slave in akkads market if that price is not acceptable to you please hold my brother safe until my husband eskkar reaches sumer at that time you can make whatever arrangements you can with him she dares to threaten me when her husband reaches sumer i should have cut off the slaves ears and had you take them with you sohrab winced at the thought handing over almarics ears to the queen of akkad would likely have been fatal sohrab lowered his eyes and kept silent anything he said would only enrage kushanna further kushanna wasnt finished that mercy will be returned to you when eskkar reaches sumer the little slave bitch is trying to frighten me with her barbarian husband ill have her brothers eyes cut out and sent to her in a box kushanna stepped across the room to the table and snatched up another cup this one she filled with wine and what of the kings army has he encountered the akkadians yet anything to change the subject sohrab decided not yet my queen eskkar and his army had marched out of akkad three days before i met with trella by now king shulgi may have already met and defeated the barbarians forces queen kushanna shook her head ive received no reports of a battle yet in another day or two well know she lifted the cup and drank the strong wine helped her regain her composure shall i go and remove the slaves eyes no not yet when trella is captured and kneeling at my feet ill do more than pull out his eyes ill cut her brothers balls off and make her eat them that will repay her for the insult kushanna smiled as if imagining the sight go to the farm have the slave beaten i want him whipped so hard that he cant stand yes my queen anything for an excuse to get out of the room would you like me to bring him here in the morning and have him whipped in your courtyard she considered that for a moment no that can wait go with a deep bow sohrab scurried from the chamber kushanna grimaced and stepped onto the balcony an akkadian trader hung by his hands from the punishment post she stared at him while she thought trella seemed confident enough of victory to send such an insulting message of course that was to be expected until shulgi destroyed eskkars army then trella would send a different message a message begging for her own life killing the brother now wouldnt help kushanna decided alive he might still be useful not that she expected eskkar would ever show up at sumers gates but in war as everyone said anything could happen no she would wait to avenge the insult that would make it even more pleasurable but for now she called out to one of the soldiers standing guard below guard guard have the prisoner whipped until hes dead yes queen kushanna he trotted off to do her bidding soon the sounds of the mans agony would fill the courtyard that would be some small satisfaction at least until she had trella in her power day even as razrek delivered his report to king shulgi eskkar and his infantry splashed their way across the sippar river the invasion of sumeria had begun the akkadians had marched south at a rapid pace swinging wide of the post at kanesh to avoid confrontation with the enemy eskkars men despite struggling under the extra food and water they carried had still managed to flank the sumerian infantry with ease a few hundred sumerian horsemen had shadowed eskkars forces but they hadnt come close no doubt respecting the accuracy of the akkadian bowmen who now ringed the spearmen if shulgi had managed to get a few thousand of his men in position to block the akkadian crossing eskkar would have had to fight his way through fortunately that hadnt happened the akkadian force had halted as soon as they crossed the stream eskkar gathered his commanders gatus alexar mitrac drakis shappa grond and chinua around him chinua of the ur nammu commanded the fifteen ur nammu warriors the youngest and wildest of the barbarians who had decided to ride and fight with eskkars army fashod had taken the rest of the ur nammu with hathor as soon as the men have eaten and drunk their fill call them to assembly i want to talk to them all of them its time they knew what they faced might as well its too late for any of them to run back to akkad gatus said a grin on his face as word spread that eskkar wished to speak to them the bowmen spearmen slingers even the supply men and ur nammu warriors crowded around their leader eskkar climbed to the top of a mansized boulder and waited until the soldiers had gathered around him jammed together shoulder to shoulder and filling every space at last they quieted down more than four thousand men surrounded him most of them still pushing and shoving so they could get a step closer to better hear his words for once eskkar had no qualms about talking these were soldiers after all not traders or merchants who might hide their smiles at his way of speaking or his stillstrong accent he knew many of these soldiers and all of them knew and trusted him soldiers of akkad youve trained and marched for this day some of you have been cursing gatus and myself for more than two years eskkar waited until the ripple of laughter rose and fell now all that hard work will be put to the test our enemy outnumbers us but they cant fight as well as you and i know they cant march as fast as you can the sumerians have drawn men from all the cities of the south and even the outcast clans of the western desert they have no love for each other and no common cause to fight for they fight only because king shulgi commands them such words came easily to him now he knew what he wanted to say and understood what they needed to hear we fight because we are all brothers all akkadians like myself most of you were not born in akkad but by taking up our cause we have all become akkadians we fight for our families our homes our future now we will march to larsa the first of the six cities of sumer we will take larsa and punish its leaders for raiding our lands and its spoils will be ours a ragged cheer arose at the mention of spoils most of the soldiers owned little more than the clothes on their backs theyd come to akkad to better themselves to leave the hardships of the farm and countryside behind and most had joined the army to fill their bellies and earn a few copper coins each month few of them understood the lifeordeath situation that akkad and its leaders faced a chance for the spoils of battle meant more to some of these soldiers than any cause and if they had to kill a few sumerians to get at them then they would fight all the harder eskkar waited until the cheering had faded away the sumerian infantry will try to follow us but theyll be too slow to keep pace their cavalry will try to hold us back but our bowmen will keep them at bay all you have to do now is march march and march again until your legs are too weary to keep you standing until youre cursing gatus and me as youve never done before until we reach larsa we cannot will not waste a moment meanwhile obey your commanders stay together and we will defeat the sumerians another cheer went up in a single swift motion eskkar drew his sword and raised it over his head a roar from over four thousand throats rose up at the gesture he kept the blade pointed to the sky and filled his lungs with air march for akkad march for revenge march for gold are you with me akkadians an even louder clamor echoed out over the river startling birds and even the sumerian horsemen observing them from across the stream the pandemonium went on and on as every man raised his sword spear bow or fist in the air akkad akkad akkad the outcry continued until the mens voices grew hoarse eskkar lowered his sword then pointed it toward the southwest the direction that would lead them to larsa then march show these sumerian scum that youre not a bunch of old women commanders get this pitiful excuse for an army moving more laughter swept through the men they surged away from eskkar returning to their places gathering up their supplies and weapons jostling their way back into formation even before everyone was ready gatus gave the command to move out and the invasion of sumeria began in earnest g atus organized the column into three groups the spearmen formed the core of the marching formation with the supply men builders even eskkars two clerks directly behind them bowmen and slingers surrounded them on all sides the archers would keep any enemy horsemen at a distance eskkar had only twenty horsemen with him in addition to the dozen or so ur nammu warriors these supported by groups of slingers who acted as skirmishers would scout the land and act as messengers if needed the sumerian cavalry from what eskkar had seen of them didnt possess many bows and those who did carried the smaller kind meant for use on horseback the akkadian longbows had almost twice the reach if the sumerians charged his archers and tried to overrun them the spearmen and slingers would be ready and waiting to deal with them those who survived the hail of arrows would find themselves impaled on a wall of spears gatus led the formation riding his mare and wearing his battered reed hat grond and the other commanders had insisted eskkar march with the spearmen out of range of any arrow launched high into the air he didnt mind it gave him a chance to talk to the men and he moved up and down the ranks they traveled speaking to many answering questions or even listening to stories the soldiers told about other battles they kept a fast pace but the akkadians halted often taking short breaks that never seemed to last long enough to rest the sacks each man carried gradually grew lighter as the bread cheese and dates were consumed better to carry the food in your belly than on your shoulder by midafternoon the scouts galloped back to report a large force of cavalry was coming up behind them driving hard how many seven hundred eight hundred perhaps a thousand the scout replied his eyes still wide with excitement not enough to attack us gatus said he had one leg swung over the mares neck probably reinforcements for larsa eskkar knew how hard it was to count moving horsemen but the number seemed about right the rest will be at our heels soon enough theyll try to slow us down well see about that alexar said our bowmen have been waiting for a chance to test their weapons keep the men ready for anything an attack an ambush anything eskkar didnt fear the horsemen no horse that ever lived would charge a bristling line of spears no matter how hard its rider urged it forward archers could be ridden down if the enemy were willing to take the losses but men armed with shields and spears were a different matter if the sumerian horse attacked the archers theyd find themselves crushed by the spearmen and even the sumerians didnt have enough cavalry to dare a true frontal attack as long as eskkar stayed away from shulgis infantry his force of akkadians would be safe at least that was what he told himself several times each day the akkadian army kept moving the tactics and marching orders used in months and years of training now proved their worth the odd commands and alignments which once had made the men shake their heads at their leaders apparent stupidity now provided a safe zone for all his men almost none of the soldiers were aware that todays formation had been planned months and years ago only eskkars most trusted commanders knew the whole story darkness had fallen before gatus gave the order to halt near a small stream that provided fresh water weary men dropped their sacks and shields but there was no time yet for rest the commanders marked out a square camp with the slingers archers horses and supplies in the center the spearmen surrounding them after objections from eskkar gatus had come up with the idea of the night camp the men need a place to sleep while on the march he declared if we provide a secure place each night theyll sleep better and march farther the next day or would you rather be attacked while you sleep and wake up with your throat slit eskkar had thrown up his hands and given in the idea of spearmen infantry belonged to gatus if having the men fortify a camp each night appeased the old soldier eskkar would go along that night gatus and eskkar walked the camp inspecting the preparations only when gatus declared himself satisfied with their preparations to repel any attack during the night did the men receive the command to rest fires were soon burning but most of the soldiers ate a simple dry meal of bread and dates and whatever else they had to hand within moments those not on guard duty were snoring away loud enough to be heard back in akkad at least it seemed that way to eskkar he and his commanders sat huddled in the center of the camp hunched over a cloth map spread out in the dirt trellas agents had started mapping this entire area years ago now eskkar could see the location of every stream well and landmark between kanesh and larsa with the route they were to take stitched out in red threads it took longer than we expected to reach this place and we had no opposition tomorrows march will be even longer and if razreks horsemen attack the men will be carrying less weight tomorrow gatus said and well start moving at first light well make up the time eskkar decided there was no sense in arguing about it tomorrows march would tell the tale gatus leaned over and studied the map how far did we come today about twentytwo miles eskkar said checking the map though by now he had little need of it hed memorized it months ago tomorrow we need to do twentyfour almost twentyfive miles if we want to reach fresh water even as trellas spies had mapped the land they had also measured the distances for two years a dozen men had mapped and paced off much of the land of sumeria hopefully no one in the southern lands had noticed any of this activity eskkar thought it quite remarkable to know in advance the exact distance one had to walk or ride to reach a destination and even more remarkable to know approximately how long such a journey would take these spearmen are tough gatus said theyll make the march theyve done it often enough in training once again eskkar kept silent the men were carrying more weight now than they usually did in training no one else answered gatuss comment but every commander knew that training had ended and that this was real war and the spearmen had the most equipment to carry an archer could travel fairly well carrying a bow two quivers full of arrows and a short sword the slingers carried even less but a spear and shield were both heavy and cumbersome to carry and spearmen wore helmets of bronze as well which were usually tied to a mans waist as they walked with all those items of warfare attached to his body a spearman needed to press hard to keep up with the archers im going to get some sleep gatus stood and stretched ignoring the silence regarding tomorrows march i suggest you do the same he strode off to throw his body down on the ground beside his subcommanders well well know where we are tomorrow night eskkar said lets hope gatus is right meanwhile make sure everyone gets some rest were going to need all the sleep we can get uvela sat crosslegged on the ground with only a thin blanket to soften the hard earth beneath her to make herself more comfortable and catch a bit of shade from the midday sun she leaned back against akkads outer river wall before her lay a sunbleached linen cloth upon which rested an assortment of leather straps necklaces carved figures of ishtar as well as the other various spirits that brought luck or long life or fertility or strength to a mans rod every so often an idle laborer or visitor from the surrounding farms would wander by let his eyes glance over her wares and move on few of uvelas wares would attract a second look by custom such a prime location close to the docks and the river gate should have been occupied by a reputable seller of more valuable goods but though she managed to sell one or two items every few days no one asked uvela to give up her station not even the more aggressive merchants eager for additional selling space bothered to complain about her presence uvelas station included the younger woman who sat beside her tending the small cooking fire burning in a thick clay pot a battered bronze kettle full of stew hung suspended over the low flames occasionally a boatman or even one of akkads dockside guards would offer a copper coin for the kettles contents a more than fair price for such basic fare both mother and daughter were known to the citys guards who made sure that no ignorant farmer or foolish vendor disturbed their places trinkets or even themselves from where uvela sat she could see everyone entering akkad through the river gate for more than two years shed watched an assortment of people step on or off the docks coming and going and by now she could read their faces almost as well as lady trella most strangers entering the city for the first time looked about them in awe impressed by the high walls surprised by the size of the docks overwhelmed by the dozens of craftsmen selling everything conceivable gangs of laborers from the market loaded or unloaded the steady stream of boats adding to the confusion gawking newcomers their mouths open and clutching most of their few worldly goods would walk slowly into the city jostled about by those whose regular business brought them in and out of the gate usually at a hurried pace some people their eyes downcast arrived wearied or troubled by some anguish or misfortune that brought them to akkad these usually wore ragged clothes and carried all their possessions in a simple sack slung around their necks uvela could guess their stories how bandits or sumerians had ventured across the border to harass and plunder those weaker than themselves with their homes destroyed and their crops burned these desperate folk hungered for a new life in akkad since the outbreak of war with sumer their numbers had swelled as everyone sought the safety of the citys high walls after years of such observation uvela knew families could usually be ignored as could the very young and very old that left only a few who caught her eye but when someone did she stared at them carefully none of them ever noticed her gaze with her lank gray hair practically covering her face her eyes could scarcely be seen if they did happen to gaze at her they saw only an insignificant old woman whose patched and faded shift hung loosely over her thin shoulders and marked her status as one of those who often needed to beg for food to supplement their meager earnings now two men walking off the docks and toward the gate attracted uvelas attention their poor clothing couldnt conceal the strong muscles that lay beneath the worn garments they strode up the slight incline with ease despite each carrying a heavy sack almost as large as the ones used by a merchants porters as they transported goods from city to city the new arrivals gave the citys walls the briefest of glances then moved forward letting the crowd carry them through the wide open double gate only a few paces away from where uvela sat have you see those two before uvela rose to her feet as she spoke determined to have a second look her daughter sitting beside her didnt raise her head or her voice she too knew how to use her eyes never ill follow them uvela pulled a scarf from a pocket in her dress and swept it over her head and across her neck the gray hair vanished in an instant meanwhile her daughter removed her own hat a large reed affair that would cover both head and scarf if need be and handed it to her mother uvela moved quickly through the gate the guard there gave her a glance but said nothing no one questioned or even spoke to one of annoksur or lady trellas women when they went about their business in fact the guards made sure that no one else disturbed them either by accident or on purpose in moments uvela caught sight of the two men moving deeper into the city she slowed her step staying about twenty paces behind them the usual crowd of men and women filling the lane between them the men glanced around from time to time but a ragged older woman blended into the throng almost unseen and beneath notice in any event nevertheless uvela kept well behind the two as they moved closer to the center of the city they stopped only once to ask directions from a vendor before they continued on until they reached the spotted owl a tavern often used by travelers this time both men glanced around before they entered the dwelling but if they saw a woman wearing a large reed hat they never noticed uvela found a place to stand and waited the spotted owl while not one of akkads finest provided good food and decent ale at reasonable prices after a river journey it was only natural for travelers who could afford the price to want to partake of some ale and food she settled in the scarf and hat held out of sight behind her back expecting to wait some time while the two men quenched their thirst but before long one of the men came out and turned up the lane away from where uvela sat she moved to her feet prepared to follow the stranger but before shed taken more than a few steps he ducked under a low doorway and disappeared into one of the endless huts whose uneven walls formed the lane retracing her steps uvela returned to her vantage point with a little stretching she could see both tavern and hut from where she stood and her slight stature made her almost invisible as she leaned against the wall before long the second man stepped out of the tavern glanced up and down the lane and followed his companions steps to the same house by now her interest was more than idle curiosity even before the outbreak of hostilities with sumer annoksurs network of spies and informers had kept their eyes open for any suspicious strangers with the armies of akkad and sumer marching toward each other uvela and others like herself had heightened their activities any stranger boatman merchant or uncouth farmer could be a spy for sumer even a possible assassin before lady trella became queen of akkad or even eskkars wife she had nearly succumbed to an assassins knife now trella rarely left the compound and when she did venture forth a compliment of hawk clan soldiers guarded her person as zealously as they protected the kings and although eskkar had marched south with gatus and the army there were still other possible targets for hired killers within akkad an attractive young girl her hips moving suggestively strolled down the lane smiling at potential customers and trying to talk to the any of the passersby who showed the slightest interest her shift cut low revealed much of her breasts as she drew close to the spot where uvela waited she gestured casually and the girl approached good day uvela and good day to you martana are you busy right now no only one customer so far today and that took but a few moments she laughed at the memory he had to rush back to his wife and four children uvela smiled at the story then perhaps you can do some work for me she told martana about the two men and described them in detail including where they seemed to be staying see what you can find out about them from the people in the tavern she reached inside her dress and handed the girl a copper coin youll earn a silver coin if you discover anything useful but be careful dont arouse any suspicions they could be dangerous martana tossed her head everyone knows im curious about men will you be here long no ill be up the lane where i can watch the house better and where she could send a message to annoksur to ask for help but there was no need to tell martana that uvela waited until the girl disappeared inside the tavern then moved up the lane just another old woman beneath the notice of most men in the city a street vendor uvela knew was happy to dispatch one of her daughters to carry word to annoksur and just as eager to provide a doorway from which uvela could keep a close eye on the strangers hut she settled in for a long wait but at least she knew she would soon have plenty of help t he next day just after dusk trella annoksur and uvela sat at the table in the workroom their heads almost touching though the room provided plenty of privacy bantor and a few of his commanders lingered in the map room so the three women kept their voices low out of habit as much as for any other reason successful women learned almost from childhood to keep their thoughts and conversations to themselves lest what they think or say upset or anger the men in their lives theyve settled in for the night uvela said she had just arrived from her post in the lane where three other women now kept watch on the strange men staying at the spotted owl it seems theyve joined up with seven or eight others whove been hanging around the inn some are staying at a house just up the lane this morning the two newcomers split up and spent most of the day wandering around the city each accompanied by one of those whod been living here none of them appeared interested in seeking work or buying anything but food and ale they dont look or act like laborers they might be just thieves or assassins annoksur said bantor or even trella could be their target trella frowned and you think one of those who arrived yesterday is the leader yes the others seem to defer to him jovarik is his name and hes also a little older no one knows if this is his first visit to akkad we followed him around today he walked all over the city and spent some time near each of the gates if the others who have been here longer trella said have also learned what they want about the gates and its guards jovarik may not need to see much more we could bring in the innkeeper annoksur said he might be able to tell us more about them no if hes in league with them they would be warned and weve nothing from martana or the other prostitutes no nothing uvela said martana serviced two of them this afternoon but always with one or two of the others watching they said nothing except that theyre in akkad seeking work last night four of them took another girl back to the house but even after pleasuring all of them she heard nothing suspicious they say little when anyone is nearby it seems we need to overhear their conversations annoksur suggested perhaps one of your girls can get close enough without being seen no i dont think so uvela said after pausing a few moments to consider the possibility those staying at the spotted owl say little and the ones living in the house would be suspicious if they thought someone was trying to spy on them they always keep someone at the door and they even watch the smoke hole every so often perhaps we should just have bantors men take them into custody annoksur said some time with the torturers would tell us what we want to know eskkar and the soldiers have been gone for five days trella said and we know that enemy horsemen are approaching the city from the east those marauders must have some plan in mind some way they think they can get into the city unless they just want to raid the countryside uvela hitched her stool a bit closer thats happened many times in the past no i dont think so trella said the war with sumeria started suddenly we had no hint of the threat how is it then that the barbarians arrive on our doorstep at the same time that seems too much of a coincidence then we should have these strangers arrested brought before bantors questioners thats what eskkar would do yes that would be his first reaction trella agreed but that wouldnt stop the horsemen from raiding our lands and they might devastate the countryside destroy all our crops if eskkar remains in the south more than a few weeks there might be nothing left when he returns neither annoksur nor uvela said anything eskkar and the army might never return or if they did they might arrive on the run a broken force with the sumerian hounds right behind them trella read their silence such thoughts while never voiced were no doubt often on the minds of those who knew the true situation i want to know what these men are planning we need to get someone close to them someone who can hear their words any women in the inn would attract attention uvela said others like martana would likely learn nothing i agree trella said i think there may be another way send for wakannh hes good at finding people f rom the shadows wakannh studied the small tavern up the lane not really much of a tavern more like a hovel whose owner sold some overpriced and watereddown ale in the evenings to half a dozen drunks and thieves not that there was much to see just a dim outline of a low doorway is that the place what would someone at the compound want with any of that rabble shut your face wakannh said as a leader of ten in akkads guard he commanded this little group of four men tonight annoksur had given him the information that the thief sargat might be found within the tavern but wakannh didnt intend to share annoksurs name with any of his men let alone a recruit of less than a hundred days sargat is one of the quickest thieves in akkad wakannh said so heres what well do ill go in the front you two go around to the next lane theres probably a secret way out to the back and you he grabbed the talkative recruit by the shoulder look agile enough you get up on the roof if sargat tries to get away make sure you stop him and so help me if you make a sound up there and give us away youll be digging latrines for the rest of your miserable life yes commander the recruit said fingering his sword in the darkness ill be quiet better give me your sword wakannh said it will only get in your way on the roof and i want sargat alive remember that all of you the folks in the compound cant talk to a dead man now get going all of you regretfully the recruit handed over his sword his leader of ten always seemed to take particular satisfaction in picking on him wakannh waited while his men moved into position he couldnt see them in the next lane but they were veterans who would do what they were ordered without asking stupid questions or trying to do any thinking on their own when he saw a darker shadow appear and disappear on the rooftop wakannh started down the lane at the entrance the smell of fresh urine greeted his nose even stronger than the usual night odors to be expected a greasy blanket hanging at an angle halfcovered the doorway a fire burned inside its light leaking out from around the edge of the door covering he pushed it aside ducked under the door stile and took a quick glance around the room a single candle burned adding its flickering light to that of the fire a quick count showed eight men within all of whom looked up as he entered the sight of one of akkads guards stopped all conversations annoksur had described sargat so wakannhs eyes searched the little gathering soon eliminating all but two of the group i want to talk to sargat which one the figure farthest away from the doorway burst into motion before wakannh could react sargat had sprung to his feet two quick steps and he launched himself at the ladder that led to the roof his foot landing unerringly on the third tread before the slowreacting wakannh started moving sargats legs had almost disappeared up the ladder before the ceiling shook and rattled the thiefs body came tumbling down to crash onto the earthen floor with a thud to wakannhs astonishment the fall hardly slowed the man down sargat twisted to one side and leapt to his feet but by then wakannh had barreled his way through the patrons knocking two men aside he shot out his hand caught sargat by the hair and jerked him back with all the strength of his bowmans arm this time the thief landed flat on his back and wakannh planted a knee on sargats chest and the tip of his sword on his neck going somewhere with a quick flip of his wrist the swords pommel struck down on sargats forehead stunning the man i dont think so scum i got him good didnt i commander the recruit had swung down from the roof and now stood beside his commander wakannh opened his mouth to bark at the recruit but changed his mind instead if sargat could move that fast he might have slipped past a less alert guard even one waiting on the roof yes you did for once good job now go get the others within moments the four guardsmen had sargats hands bound behind his back and his legs hobbled together so that he wouldnt try running away wakannh didnt intend to take any chances with someone who moved that fast where are you taking me sargat had regained his wits quick enough to the compound and if you open your mouth again ill deliver you with your balls cut off and shoved down your throat he turned to the still smiling recruit busy massaging his right fist put a sack over his head the less he sees and hears the better sargats fingers dug into the wall and he swung himself onto the ledge taking care to keep his silhouette as inconspicuous as possible once on the inner side of the ledge he settled in and remained motionless over the years hed learned many things about climbing about on other peoples rooftops but the most important lesson was to fade into the shadows and avoid the slightest movement many times the creaking of a ceiling beam or rustling of cut branches had caused a head to pop up from the smoke hole and look around thick shadows dark clothing and the absence of the slightest motion tended to render him unseen another lesson well learned was patience hed reached the roof adjoining the hut that held jovarik and his companions now he needed to assure himself that anyone below who might have heard something became reassured until whatever sound from the sagging roof faded from memory while sargat waited he thought about what had happened earlier the guards had caught him easily enough sargat hadnt thought anyone even knew hed returned to akkad hed only slipped into the city twenty days ago in that time hed robbed only three houses descending through the smoke holes taking what he could and disappearing into the night as silently as hed come he would have sworn that no one had seen him despite all his care the guards had come straight to the tavern someone had planned his capture with care to ensure that he didnt escape and vanish once again into akkads criminal underworld he soon learned who that was when his captors removed the sack covering his head he found himself sitting across the table from annoksur lady trella sat just outside of the candlelight a halfstep behind the older woman when he glanced around sargat realized he was in the kings compound the socalled workroom where lady trella dispatched her agents to spy on akkads troublemakers which included him sargat decided as his eyes grew accustomed to the light from the single candle he realized that no guards or servants stood nearby they would be within call of course still their absence meant that something private needed to be discussed annoksurs hands remained below the table and he guessed a weapon would be in her hand ready should he make any sudden movement toward either of them his own hands remained bound but the rope looped about his ankles had been removed before they had escorted him up the stairs and not replaced welcome to the lady trellas house annoksur said do you know who i am yes still trying to collect his wits he didnt trust himself to say more the less he spoke the harder it would be for the witchqueen of akkad to read his thoughts or so he hoped good we only learned of your return to the city a few days ago you should know that guards are waiting in the courtyard to bring you before the kings justice i expect that youll be found guilty of enough crimes to warrant you being sentenced to the slave gang for the rest of your life sargat heard the threat but they hadnt brought him here in the night to remind him of his fate sentenced to the labor gang meant that they would break his legs first so that he couldnt run then when he had recovered hed work for the rest of his life he put that thought out of his mind they wanted something from him but what of course you may be able to avoid the work gang and earn a few silver coins in the bargain if youre interested that is his eyes flickered to lady trella but the shadows hid her eyes and he couldnt read anything from her expression whatever she wanted and it must be something important to warrant her presence hed find out soon enough what can i do for you and lady trella there are some men in akkad who may be plotting with our enemies annoksur continued we want you to discover what it is that they plan you would need to get close enough to hear what theyre saying and if i do that if you learn what theyre plotting you can go free and youll have ten silver coins as a reward another glance toward the still silent lady trella obviously they wanted to use his skills as a thief to gather the information they wanted sargat knew how to play that game hed dealt with men whod hired his services for such tasks before but never a woman let alone the one in charge of the citys spies and informers and if i cant learn anything then i fear you will have to face the kings justice of course if the men discover you youll probably be killed outright death or mutilation and slavery for the rest of his life for ten silver coins i would be happy to help you promise them anything he decided the minute he was on his own sargat would be over the roofs and gone they wouldnt catch him again and he knew of several ways to slip out of the city undetected what do you want me to do annoksur told him about jovarik and his companions and the place where they were staying he knew the lane but didnt remember that particular rathole still it was familiar enough ground for him and you need this information tonight if possible they are still eating their supper and sipping ale and there is plenty of night remaining before they sleep if you dont succeed tonight you may not have the chance to try again the haggling began he asked for more coins more assurances of protection more promises of safe passage while in akkad annoksur had agreed to them all sargat let himself relax the tiniest bit all those tales he had heard of annoksur and her power now sounded foolish she was just another woman one willing to believe whatever she was told then i should go and see what i can learn annoksur smiled but turned to lady trella by now he had nearly forgotten her presence how many seasons do you have sargat lady trellas odd question surprised him and despite the soft tone of her voice he felt a hint of his prior nervousness return i have eighteen seasons lady trella you shouldnt lie to us sargat you have only sixteen seasons he started to protest but she held up a slim hand that doesnt matter of course but lying about helping us when instead you plan to just disappear again that is something we cannot tolerate you may be a very agile thief but your eyes your face all show your lies lady trella i be silent she raised her voice wakannh the door opened at once and wakannh stepped inside the room in one hand he carried a large block of wood in the other a small bronze axe the block sargat noticed appeared stained a darker color the penalty for lying to us is to have your tongue removed trella leaned closer for a moment and sargat caught a glimpse of her brown eyes fixed on his own as if staring into his heart the penalty for being a thief is to have your right hand cut off which of these would you prefer to have done to you first she uttered the words in the same soft voice a woman would use with her lover but sargat felt a chill pass through him he glanced back at wakannh standing there patiently waiting for the order to begin suddenly he realized that she would as easily give that order as not i lady trella you had a friend named tammuz once do you remember him he befriended you many times even saved your life once by hiding you from the guard you undertook a similar mission for him once just before korthac seized control of the city sargat felt his heart racing how did she know about these things events that happened years ago hed told no one and only tammuz knew yes i remember him lady trella but tammuz left the city years ago and i know where he went before he left tammuz told me you could be trusted was he wrong or would you let akkads enemies capture the city and put everyone to the sword yourself included sargat remembered that tammuz had fought against korthac when the king recaptured the city sargat had thought that a foolish risk at the time but now he realized that even then tammuz must have been working for lady trella that meant what did any of this mean i i will do as you ask lady trella i swear it on marduks no need for that sargat just your word as a thief and you will be rewarded and i will be able to tell tammuz how well you served both him and his city if you try to escape you will find no one will help you no hiding hole so deep that i cannot find you and if you give away your presence to our enemies then you will spend many days with the paingivers before you repay your crimes so think carefully before you speak again will you learn what these strangers want in akkad and will you bring that information back to me if for no other reason than it would give honor to your friendship with tammuz sargat found his throat dry and had to swallow before he could answer i will not fail you lady trella if you speak for tammuz then i will do what you ask she kept her gaze on him for a moment as if searching for the truth in his words wakannh take sargat to where the strangers are staying give him whatever help he needs and when he is finished bring him back to me yes lady trella sargat saw the guard bow but caught a glimpse of disappointment on his face no doubt the man would have preferred to use his axe all that had transpired not long ago now sargat lay stretched along the roof of the adjoining hut his weight spread out over as many roof poles as possible the poles had creaked a little when he settled in unless one kept to the edges of the mudbrick walls a little noise was unavoidable sargat had squirmed and wriggled his way over the tops of peoples heads for more than ten of his sixteen years victims hed learned might wake at any little sound but if they then heard nothing they were likely to fall back asleep or attribute what theyd heard to some bird cat or rodent moving about this roof was scarcely two body lengths from end to end he picked his way across taking his time and always letting part of his weight settle before he moved the rest when he reached the small ledge that separated the two huts he heard movement on the other side either someone was sleeping on the roof or a guard was keeping station gradually he lifted his head moving so slowly that even if the guard happened to be looking in that direction he might not notice the tiny change in the ledges silhouette when sargats right eye cleared the top he saw a man laying on his back staring upwards his hands behind his head the relaxed position told sargat that the sentry didnt expect anyone to disturb his rest sargat settled back down and considered his choices despite all of annoksur and wakannhs warnings sargat hadnt expected to find anyone up on the roof at worst hed expected the thieves or whatever they were to stick their heads up occasionally through the smoke hole and look around that was usually enough to ensure privacy for those below but the guards presence ended most of sargats easy plans it also confirmed that these strangers were up to no good and were probably dangerous he took another glance over the wall studying the prone form of the man less than four good paces away before sargat ascended to the nearby roof wakannh had sketched the layout of the two chambers that formed the structure below twice as long as wide the men were likely gathered near the back end of the house that meant that sargat could hear whatever conversations were being held below without coming too close to the smoke hole if he could get across the ledge and take up a position directly behind the guard he might lie there unnoticed even if the sentry should glance around with nothing breaking the line of the roof sargat knew the guards eye would skip over the darkness and search only for the contrast lines where dark and light met ordinarily this would be foolhardy and sargat had never been a fool but the chance for plenty of silver not to mention placing lady trella in his debt made the risk worthwhile besides if the guard did notice sargats presence he would be up and running over the rooftops to where wakannh and his men waited despite what lady trella had said he didnt think theyd kill him if the strangers detected his presence the decision made sargat rose up and began climbing over the dividing ledge moving each of his limbs one at a time he resembled a spider more than a man the sentry never moved the man remained relaxed and at rest lost in his thoughts the idea that someone might try to creep up beside him on the roof never entered his head sargat kept his eyes focused on the guard the slight creaks that his slow movements created were not what was important those down below would attribute any noises to the guard shifting about as long as the sentry didnt decide to turn his head and study carefully the rooftop behind him sargat kept moving forward at last he reached his position about an arms length from the back of the guards head turning his eyes downward he eased his face against the roof poles his weight spread out over as wide an area as possible he didnt worry about the poles giving way under his slight weight since those who dwelt inside would be used to sleeping on the roof during the hot weather and most families added more trimmed branches than they really needed beneath him he could see almost nothing vague shadows outlined heads and he guessed about five or six men were in the main chamber wakannh had made the same estimate so at least none of the strangers had slipped away no candles burned and only a little moonlight filtered down through the smoke hole at least now he could hear them talking actually make out what they were saying but the men spoke about women ale even the warm weather one complained that he preferred the ocean breezes of sumeria the desultory conversation went on and on without sargat hearing anything of use to anyone it looked as if he would have to remain where he was until they decided to fall asleep even sargat started relaxing despite the presence of the guard less than an arms length away then another voice broke into the conversation one that sargat hadnt heard before he realized that another man had entered the hut and joined the group all the idle talk ceased and the men shifted about as if preparing themselves rattaki you awake up there the newcomers low voice sounded harsh the voice of someone used to giving orders the sentry jumped at the words and shifted his body to lean over the smoke hole yes im awake think i can sleep up here without a blanket stay alert then you can listen from up there the sentry shifted his position twisting his body and swiveling his head and sargat knew the mans gaze had swept over sargats prone figure but the man saw what he expected to see which was nothing sargat lowered his gaze so that the whites of his eyes didnt show the rest of you pay attention ive gotten word back from the horsemen theyll rush the wall tomorrow night when the moon reaches its highest point it should give us enough light and most of the guards will be half asleep by then all we have to do is kill a few sentries and get the ropes over the wall then the eight of us will hold the akkadians off until the barbarians mount the wall each of us will wear a strip of cloth tied around the right elbow otherwise these bastards are as likely to kill us as anyone else inside the city tomorrow night if barbarians captured the city sargats own plans would be disrupted the barbarian horsemen would put everyone to the sword men and women honest men and thieves alike and theyd be trapping everyone inside the city to make sure no one escaped with anything of value how many will be coming luroc a new name one that annoksur and her agents hadnt learned sargat decided that this luroc was staying somewhere else away from his men he peered down through the branches he couldnt see much of lurocs features but the man possessed a barrellike body and a thick beard that concealed much of his face how should i know five hundred a thousand theyve got a dozen ladders prepared and theyll head for the gate as soon as enough of them are over the wall more than enough to brush aside these old men and new recruits sargat concentrated on lurocs voice he possessed a strong accent marking him as a man from the southernmost lands of sumeria youre sure they know where to attack can they find theyve already marked the tanners lane luroc said theyll be able to find it even if clouds hide the moon and our gold when do we get paid as soon as we get back to sumer a boat will be waiting to take us south and well be there in four or five days queen kushanna will be eager to hear of our victory and youll take onboard whatever loot we can pick up when the barbarians overrun the city so just keep your mouths shut for another day that means no drinking no women and no talking stay in the house as much as possible and no one goes anywhere alone ill cut the heart out of anyone who even thinks about doing or saying anything stupid luroc answered a few more questions until he grew annoyed with the process sargat decided that all these things had been discussed before probably more than once luroc had come only to inform his men about the date and time of the attack and go over the plan one final time he would slip back into whatever hideout he had prepared for himself one where his name would not be luroc at last the men grew silent enough then ill meet you at the wall just before the moon reaches its peak with one last word of warning to keep quiet and out of trouble luroc left the room the sentry on the roof swung his legs over the smoke hole and skimmed down the ladder his eyes focused only on his descent sargat waited until the first snore wafted up through the hole then one by one he stretched his muscles for the first time making sure he could move without any problem taking his time he retraced his movements back to the ledge this time he used the ledge to travel across the back of the huts until he reached a place where he could drop lightly down to the ground a dozen paces away wakannh and one of his men waited but neither of them heard or saw sargats approach until he stepped out of the shadows demons below wakannh swore where did you come from did you see someone enter and leave sargat couldnt keep the excitement from his voice we saw a man enter but didnt see anyone come out thought it was just one of the men returning from taking a piss why never mind take me back to the compound i need to talk to annoksur and lady trella its the middle of the night are you sure im sure now lets get moving before any more time slips by l ady trella sat across the table from bantor his face framed by the two thick candles burning at either side despite the lateness of the night hed just arrived from the barracks at trellas summons annoksur sat next to trella as she usually did an excited sargat accompanied by wakannh had just completed the second recitation of what hed heard for bantors benefit before leaving akkads leaders alone and sargat is convinced the attack will come tomorrow bantors face showed his concern theres been no word of any horsemen loose in the countryside at least not anywhere near here our scouts have reported nothing so close according to them the barbarians are still many miles away thats what he heard them say lady trella said and i believe him if we had any word of barbarians drawing near you would have doubled the sentries on our gates and walls shulgi must have prepared this attack the same way he plotted the assault on kanesh a sudden strike by horsemen without any hint of their movements food for the riders and grain for the horses could have been hidden along their way awaiting their arrival it is possible isnt it annoksur leaned forward if they wanted only to attack akkad and not raid the countryside could they reach here without any word trella saw bantor clench his fist on the table hed brought the news of the alur meriki raiding to the east and coming this way and he didnt like the idea that his outriders might have failed to detect their close approach but despite what he lacked in imagination he was no fool when the possibility of danger to akkad arose he knew the alur meriki could travel vast distances when necessary if they swung to the northeast then rode straight in theyd have to cover a lot of ground at night at least fifty miles from daybreak to midnight thats a lot of riding in the dark skilled riders with extra horses carrying torches and a wellmarked trail prepared in advance trella kept her voice persuasive bad enough bantor had to deal with his wifes authority from time to time weve done such things ourselves weve no reason to believe alur meriki cant do such things even more efficiently he gave in to their pressure i guess they could manage it but theres only one direction they could take to make this work i can have riders out in the morning as soon as we see them coming well have plenty of time to prepare he glanced up at the window to gauge the progress of the moon plenty of time left tonight to round up the sumerians it wont take much to make them tell us who their leader is and where hes hiding trella took her time replying in the interval since sargat had completed his story and bantors arrival shed thought long and hard about the choices facing her the easiest and safest solution was to do as bantor said capture the sumerians put them to the torture even if they didnt know where their leader was they knew enough of the plan to confirm sargats story and once confirmed the city could prepare itself no force of horsemen no matter how fierce or numerous could scale akkads high walls once they were properly defended nevertheless that solution left her unsatisfied like everyone else she wondered what eskkar would do faced with the same facts unlike bantor and the other commanders eskkar would seek to gain some opportunity from this information to turn the enemy attack into a defeat she knew he would not enjoy sitting idly behind akkads walls while raiders foiled in their attempt to slip into the city terrorized the countryside is there something else you would consider trella annoksur realized the time for a quick reply had long passed i dont want these horsemen destroying the farms and crops trella began still working out the idea in her head eskkar always had his battle experience to guide him but she had lived and fought beside him for over four years and in that time shed insisted he relate every tale every adventure every fight that hed even been in and not just once but time and again asking him to explain each choice and the reasons behind it and the likely consequences were another thirty or so horsemen coming down from bisitun bantor said they can patrol the countryside around the city she made up her mind no i dont want these men driven away i want these barbarians destroyed or at least defeated otherwise theyll do as much damage to the crops as shulgi and his whole army between them theyll destroy almost every farm supplying akkad bantor shook his head they wont attack in force once they see were ready for them i know trella let the smallest hint of authority strengthen her words so perhaps we should let them into the city even annoksur looked askance what are you saying let them in remember during the alur meriki siege when eskkar proposed the same thing he had a plan to let them over the walls then attack them bantor snorted i remember that idea gatus and the rest of us didnt care for it then eskkar likes to gamble but we all thought the plan too risky and we had a larger force of bowmen at our command than we do now ah but then we didnt have the leader of the sumerians to help us invite them in as she spoke trella felt her own conviction increasing not only was this the right choice it was what eskkar would do if he were here and the risk to akkad could be managed with luroc helping us i think we can make it work she went over the ideas sketched out in her mind during the night annoksur sought to find weakness in the plan improving on some of trellas suggestions by then bantor either half convinced or unwilling to argue with both his wife and trella decided that it might just might be done without too much risk good trella stood and placed her hand on annoksurs shoulder now all you have to do is find where this luroc is hiding and bring him here bantor youll have to prepare what we need and all without telling anyone except your most trusted subcommanders what were planning b antor got no sleep for the rest of the night nor did his wife while bantor summoned those men he felt certain he could trust for the coming days work annoksur started the search for luroc by dawn more than twenty women walked akkads lanes whispering lurocs vague description to dozens of other women who in their turn spoke to others in this way every hut tavern shop and residence in the city came under their scrutiny but without arousing suspicion nevertheless midday came and went without any sign of the elusive sumerian for a man whod been in akkad for several days hed managed to stay out of sight as the day grew short and they ran out of places to search trella suggested another possibility namely that luroc might be staying at the home of some akkadian merchant with that in mind annoksur turned her attention to the upperclass traders and merchants she soon discovered that only one merchant ramalsul had departed the city that morning by boat heading north to bisitun and he had taken his family with him leaving his servants in charge of the household with that fact bantor gathered some men then he went to ramalsuls house and knocked on the door when the servant opened it bantor asked to speak with the masters guest and the servant had duly let bantor into the inner courtyard luroc sitting comfortably on a shady bench took one look at akkads captain of the guard and reached for his sword dont do anything foolish luroc bantor said holding up his hands the house is surrounded and there are men on the rooftops we know all about your plan for tonight so its not like you have to betray any secrets bantor spoke quickly he wanted luroc to know the situation before he attempted anything foolish my men could have taken you prisoner any time in the last few days even last night after you gave your men their final instructions and left their hideout or i could have entered the house with a dozen men and rushed you before you knew we were there instead ive come to offer you an arrangement lady trella wishes to speak with you im to bring you to her who betrayed me the gruff voice held more disgust than anger bantor leaned carefully against the courtyards entrance he didnt intend to get any closer to a desperate man with a sword in his hand i really dont know does it matter luroc the sword in his hand shook his head bantor saw the man preparing himself for a death fight if you want to live i suggest you come quietly and listen to what lady trella has to say youll find she can be quite generous otherwise best fall on your own sword before luroc could decide what to do the captain of the guard turned and left the room leaving luroc standing there still holding his naked blade luroc took only moments to make up his mind perhaps assisted by the sight of two armed men who appeared on the roof of the house peering down into the inner courtyard one man carried a bow with a shaft already nocked to the string stepping out of ramalsuls front doorway a few moments later luroc found bantor and two guards waiting there the sumerians sword rested in its scabbard the soldiers looked competent and bantor was known to be a powerful fighter no need to worry luroc bantor said walk beside me as two old friends would do together they walked the lanes of akkad crossing half the city before they reached eskkars house at bantors approach the guards opened the gate and the little group passed inside annoksur waited just outside the entrance to the house please give bantor your sword luroc only the hawk clan is permitted to carry weapons in lady trellas presence for a moment bantor thought the man would try something stupid but luroc kept control of his emotions he reached for his blade and bantors two men moved in closer just in case luroc decide to start hacking at everyone using his fingers he drew the sword from its scabbard and handed it to bantor annoksur led luroc into the house and up the stairs to where trella waited for them at the big table in the workroom another guard stood beside her in case the sumerian decided to leap across the table bantor remained just behind their guest please sit down luroc lady trella began i imagine you could use some wine or ale if you prefer annoksur moved around the table to stand beside trella annoksur reached down and filled a cup with watered wine which she handed to luroc the man took it with both hands as he slid into the seat across the wide table by now the shock of his capture had started to sink in and he looked like a man who knew he would soon be dead as bantor may have told you trella said we know of your plot to help the barbarians slip into the city since that will not succeed you may want to consider another option how much gold did king shulgi promise you lady trellas pleasant voice contrasted sharply with the harder tones of queen kushanna nevertheless both women expected to be obeyed when they spoke twenty gold coins to prepare the men he took another gulp from the wine cup fifty more if the attack succeeded the king of sumeria is generous but i am willing to exceed that price i will give you safe passage to one of the northern cities and seventyfive akkadian gold coins if you are willing to help us with that much gold you should be able to find a place of safety far from this war lurocs eyes widened at the sum and he decided the wild stories of akkads gold mine at nuzi were true with that much gold he would never need to work again how can i help you by making sure the barbarians enter the city of course the citys guard is even now collecting your men theyll be sentenced to the labor gangs for the rest of their lives bantors men will replace them and you will be on the wall at tanners lane tonight to bring the barbarians into the city you want the barbarians to cross over your walls yes our men will be waiting for them of course theyll capture your city even if they dont theyll kill so many of your soldiers you wont be able to resist shulgis army when it gets here perhaps but that will not concern you you will have your gold and be on a boat going north unless you prefer the alternative luroc glanced behind him bantor still stood there but now his right hand rested on the hilt of his sword the guard standing just beside lady trella had not taken his eyes off luroc for a moment luroc wet his lips then realized he still held the wine cup another mouthful seemed to ease his choice how do i know you will keep your part of the bargain the word of lady trella has never been broken annoksur said if you do as we ask you will not be harmed you and the gold will be free to leave at sunup several boats will be departing to the north or you can even return to sumeria if you wish returning to queen kushannas presence without the destruction of akkad to report didnt appeal to luroc trella gave him a moment to work things through then she nodded i give you my word you will not be harmed luroc drained the wine cup and pushed it toward the center of the table like any good gambler he knew when he was beaten i dont think ill be going back to sumer what do you want me to do t he long day had finally given way to dusk then darkness since luroc decided to change his allegiance if indeed the mercenary ever had any trella had remained with bantor most of the day she and annoksur questioned the spy at length obtaining the names of all his men and ascertaining that no other sumerian agents remained in akkad bantor had dispatched wakannh who had been present at last nights meeting to gather up all eight sumerians and they now languished in a single room at the barracks guarded by a dozen men trella insisted that bantor go over every part of the plan she knew the way her husbands mind worked and shed watched him in enough planning sessions over the last five years to know how he would proceed every step every part had to be discussed responsibility assigned every commander and his second in command had to fully grasp and understand the role he would play the carpenters had to be summoned and given their instructions the rest of the city had to remain guarded as well throughout the night as the barbarians might have more than one plot no soldiers would be sleeping tonight those not involved at tanners lane would be manning akkads walls alert for any attack at the barracks behind its closed gates the soldiers prepared torches and poles readied shields and spears while archers tested their bows and changed to new bowstrings the handful of spearmen remaining in the city prepared themselves for this new way of fighting even food and water had to be readied to make sure that no one lacked for anything all this needed to be accomplished before sundown tonight trella wanted everything in akkad to appear as normal as the night before only when the city lay cloaked in darkness were the men and equipment quietly assembled brought together in small groups and taken to their stations the waiting began trella leaned against a wall a hundred paces from tanners lane annoksur had wanted her to remain in the compound but trella insisted on being there bantor protested as well but gave way when he saw her determination i must be there she said i know how eskkar would think and act tonight you will think of me as you would of him but if it fails you may be in danger if i am sending men to fight and die then they need to see me there standing beside them would eskkar do any less no amount of words changed her mind before midnight she arrived at tanners lane accompanied by her four hawk clan guards she wore the short sword eskkar had given her belted around her waist he had taught her how to use it after korthacs defeat near one of the watch fires bantor and luroc waited together for her arrival even in the flickering light she saw the worry on bantors face the men are ready lady trella at least bantor knew better than to argue with her in front of the sumerian nothing was said about me being tied to a rope lurocs words though spoken just above a whisper sounded bitter luroc had been forced to remove his tunic and a slim but stout rope was fastened around his waist then fed out through a hole cut in the back of the garment wakannh had the other end of the rope fastened around his body thats just in case you decide to slip over the wall and rejoin your companions trella said though theyd probably kill you anyway at the first alarm she had been the one who suggested the rope to bantor wakannh will stand next to you at all times as if one of your trusted men if you try to escape or give us away youll find yourself hanging over the fire pit in the morning ill keep my end of the bargain then all will be well for both of us she answered the waiting began the moon still climbed upward in the heavens slower than it usually did it seemed to those watching but at last the moon reached its zenith clear the wall bantor ordered in a low voice one by one the sentries on the wall ducked below the wall then dropped to the ground below or moved rapidly but silently down the parapets steps the barbarians if indeed they were out there would have been waiting for the guards to be taken out luroc with wakannh at his side moved to the top of the wall now empty of sentries luroc leaned over and waved a bit of white cloth neither man could see much but then luroc stiffened wakannh saw them too and his hand tightened on the rope the ground beyond the ditch seemed to be alive like a field covered with locusts as crouched men moved quickly and silently over the empty ground in moments a wave of men dropped down into the ditch bent low they raced to the base of the wall it took only moments to locate the two ropes bantors men had thrown over the edge the ropes tightened as men started the climb ladders bumped softly against the wall as well then a figure swung up over the top glanced around and saw the two men standing there the whites of the barbarians eyes shone in the moonlight he swung over the wall his hand on his sword wait luroc whispered just loud enough to be heard im luroc the way is clear without waiting for a reply luroc turned away and he and wakannh moved to the steps and raced down the steps they disappeared into the shadows at the entrance to the lane bantor waited for them there he could hear the small sounds of bodies scraping and slipping over the wall soon he saw the barbarians their number swelling readying weapons from the shadows a few steps away trella watched the parapet fill with the enemy more and more kept coming helped up and over by their companions she heard the faint rasp of swords being drawn from scabbards and noted the silhouette of one or two bows behind her the soldiers shifted their breathing coming faster as they tensed up for the coming struggle but their small sounds were masked by those on the wall in the faint moonlight trella saw that everyone had moved to their assigned places at last she heard the sound of wood scraping against wood as the barricades moved into position blocking off the parapet if the barbarians detected them they made no outcry its time bantors whisper sounded harsh trella moved silently across the open space at the end of the lane behind her the soldiers formed up in silence looking up she saw the wall now swarmed with men some began to drop down off the parapet others found the steps and ran down and still more heads and shoulders crawled over the wall into the city wakannhs voice boomed out over the lane hoist the torches the alur meriki froze in place as the first torch flared into being and was pushed out over the lane from the rooftop every eye watched as the long pole extended its flaming contents over the intruders joined quickly by another and another until five torches sputtered and blazed on each side of the open space and the barbarians could see the line of bowmen facing them with another line of spearmen kneeling just in front of them lances extended upwards the alur meriki had time for that one glance loose bantors voiced echoed off the walls for a brief moment the barbarians didnt move not until the first wave of forty arrows crashed into their midst warriors dropped like stones screaming in pain as the arrows struck them but the arrow storm unleashed the fury of men who suddenly realized theyd been lured into a trap in the torchlight they could clearly see that every house and stall in the lane was boarded up giving them no place to go but into the arrows ahead of them bantor drew his sword the leader of the bowmen continued to call the cadence and another flight of arrows aimed low struck at the invaders those barbarians still standing rushed forward screaming their war cries as they charged at the forty men in front of them other alur meriki reinforcements continued to climb over the wall eager to join the fighting and as yet unaware of what was happening bantors third wave of shafts included shafts from other archers on the rooftops as bowmen climbed into position and added their own arrows to the carnage below them the barbarians had only to cover about thirty paces to come to grips with their opponents but the shafts flew again and this time the charge broke the warriors had brought few bows of their own certain that swords would be the most useful weapon once inside the walls instead they found themselves attacked by bowmen under the blaze of torches that lit the scene all too clearly some tried to tear down the boards that blocked entry to the houses but the archers on the opposite roof turned their arrows on them others tried to move along the parapet but the heavy wooden barricades positioned to extend out over the parapets edge blocked that path too behind those barricades stood villagers and soldiers with spears who thrust at every head or hand that tried to climb over or swing around them a few alur meriki managed to leap up and grasp two of the torches and dash them out but it made no difference even two or three torches would have provided enough light for the archers suddenly the alur meriki began moving back jamming the steps or pulling themselves up to the parapet with no other thought in their minds but to get back over the wall the archers shafts continued to find them bantor shouted another order and the bowmen moved slowly forward shooting together under command shooting again and again until they reached the base of the parapet by then nothing moved not even the wounded at their feet who died from a quick spear thrust shouting continued from the walls as archers kept shooting at the surviving barbarians as they fled back across the ditch bantor bellowed out a command to secure the wall and soldiers began clearing the dead off the steps and parapet trella knew the fight here had finished she turned to find annoksur at her side a short sword gleaming in the torchlight a cheer went up from the men the volume increasing until everyone had joined in shouts of victory mixed with laughter at the barbarians who had carefully planned their assault yet still stumbled into a deadly trap trella found herself surrounded by gleeful soldiers and villagers as she turned away from the carnage and headed back to the compound that should send them running back to their clan annoksur said it looks like weve killed more than half of them im sure the cavalry from bisitun will hunt down any stragglers in the morning trella agreed i think those who escape will have little inclination to raid our lands you planned this as well as eskkar lets hope he has as much good fortune in the south send word in the morning it will be one less worry for eskkar and what should i do with luroc pay him and let him go trella said hes not likely to trouble us again besides once word of this gets out the sumerians will think he betrayed them annoksur put her arm around trellas shoulders lets hope the sumerians fare as badly against your husband as these barbarians trellas satisfaction at the victory lessened at the thought of her husbands danger tell yavtars men to get word to eskkar as soon as possible the last thing he needs is to be worrying about akkad day the soldiers plodded through the heat every strap rubbed the skin raw and many men had taken off their sandals to insure that they didnt wear out and to save them for combat the sun grew hotter as they moved south especially to men unaccustomed to it the sumerians had that advantage most of them were born and raised in the dry lands and could withstand the sun and wind better than the men from the north the soldiers wiped the sweat from their eyes and kept walking though at every stop to rest men drank as much water as they could hold fortunately they splashed across several of the numerous streams that eventually found their way into the great sea the sumerians kept horsemen at their rear and flanks but only small bands to keep track of where the akkadians marched so far the enemy hadnt tried to launch any attacks just before midday while the men were resting one of the guards called out riders to the rear eskkar swung up on his mount to get a better look in moments the land behind him began to fill with horses the large band of sumerian cavalry that had followed them yesterday was coming closer but not as eskkar realized coming straight at them they would pass the akkadians on their left these men were not tanukhs but they rode easy in their mounts and eskkar had to admire their training these horsemen might be the pick of sumerias horse fighters theyre passing us grond shaded his eyes with his hand probably headed to larsa as the enemy came abreast of the akkadians gatus gave the order that got the men back on their feet and into marching position stop gawking at that scum youd think you never saw a horse before enemy horsemen or not gatus got the men moving he wanted to make camp tonight where they planned and he was determined that his spearmen would lead the way even if they collapsed when they reached the destination theyre going to larsa all right eskkar said theyll be waiting for us when we get there gatus came over to join them think theyll try anything not this bunch eskkar said ill bet that razrek is leading them hell be glad to take some comfort in larsa for a few days then the people of larsa may be happy to see us when we arrive gatus said not entirely in jest razrek with that many men accompanying him will be a demanding guest eskkar grunted in agreement a large force of men and horses might not be too welcome in larsa they would eat and drink and chase the citys women and if all the tales told about razrek were true his men would pay not a copper coin to the citys inhabitants before long the riders disappeared in the distance well tomorrow well see the rest of the cavalry eskkar said well have some fighting before tomorrows march ends good gatus didnt sound concerned the men need to be blooded anyway so the sooner the better the more fighting they do the better theyll get at it he pulled himself up onto the mare and cantered to the front of the column where he shouted orders for the men to pick up the pace bloodthirsty old bastard grond commented that he is eskkar said laughing but more than that he wants to see his training in action for that hes willing to ride an old mare wear a foolish hat and sleep on the ground and thats why he refused to stay in akkad where he belongs well lets hope that it isnt us who get bloodied as grond made the wish he spat on the ground for good luck the forced march continued with the men stretching their legs in earnest they had a long way to go but gatus and his men didnt disappoint during the long day they made their distance reaching the tiny stream just a little before sunset that gave the men time to gather some firewood and start a few fires burning the more ambitious men had collected some sheep and cattle during the days march and soon the smell of burning flesh floated in the air the akkadians had taken everything useful from the few farms they passed stripping the land of anything edible if they could have ranged out they could have taken more but the enemy horsemen shadowing their march were waiting for just that occurrence eskkar knew he had to keep his force close together if they spread out the sumerian cavalry would cut them to shreds no doubt razreks horsemen were doing an even more efficient looting of the countryside theyd grown so used to terrorizing those living within akkads borders that they had no qualms about looting sumerias own people most of the farmers in their path had fled at word of the akkadians approach but a few animals were still to be found and they provided a bit of fresh food to stretch the now stale bread that filled a mans stomach but didnt satisfy hunger a handful of redfaced men had discovered a skin of wine hidden somewhere along the march and drained its contents in moments before the rest of their companions even knew what theyd found the food sacks contained less weight by now and would be even lighter after the men washed down their evening bread with water most would rip the loaf in half and soak the stale bread in the stream to make it easier to chew everyone settled in for the night groaning in relief at the opportunity to stretch out and give their tired legs a rest behind them the sumerian cavalrys camp fires glowed in the distance and eskkar saw that the number of horsemen pursuing them had increased trellas estimates of sumers horse fighters had ranged between thirtyfive hundred and four thousand and except for those who had ridden on to larsa eskkar guessed that the remainder were camping little more than a mile from his own campsite gatus posted even more guards tonight than yesterday eskkar and the rest of the commanders were waiting for him when he returned the sentries are out and alert gatus said as he squatted down beside the fire stretching his back with a sigh of satisfaction i warned them to be especially alert for any sumerians sneaking up on them in the night either to slit their throats or launch a few arrows at us from the darkness two can play at that game eskkar said ive asked chinua and shappa to join the commanders from now on were going to need their skills for the next few days shappa still short of his sixteenth birthday seemed in awe of the men gathered around eskkar the slingers shappa had helped train were attached in groups to sections of the archers and spearmen so until now no single leader to speak for all of them had been needed eskkar however had wanted some men to act as pickets and skirmishers men or boys short in stature and quick on their feet shappa had picked out twenty such men during the long months of training and he kept command of that group they had trained to creep out into the darkness gathering knowledge of the enemys position killing any enemy sentries they could and protecting the akkadian camp during the training many of the older soldiers had laughed at the need for such men but eskkar ignored them hed slipped up on enough sleeping enemy encampments to know what could happen and he didnt intend to take such a risk with his own camp shappa i want your slingers out there beyond the sentries its likely the enemy will be sending bowmen against us during the night trying to pick off our guards or just trying to shoot a few arrows into the camp we need to kill or drive them off otherwise well be dodging arrows all night while the men are trying to sleep yes lord eskkar shappas voice cracked at the words and the rest of the group smiled most of shappas slingers were short and slim and their weapon made almost no noise when it launched a stone a bows sharp outline could often be seen against the night sky and its twang heard for this sort of action the skirmishers had practiced using another way to cast a stone whirling the missile around their heads it wasnt as accurate a way to launch a missile but it could be done while hugging the ground and at close range was almost as effective collect your men eskkar went on and get them ready i want them out in the darkness tonight he turned to chinua i know the ur nammu can move silently in the darkness do you think a few of your men could reach the enemy camp mindful of the warriors pride eskkar had taken pains not to give them a direct order better to tell them what was needed and let them offer to help chinua had said little to anyone during the last few days and the rest of the akkadians had left him and his warriors alone i can take three or four men out into the night he said speaking slowly to make sure everyone understood him we can hunt those the enemy will send against you that would be good perhaps you and your men might even get close enough to loose a few shafts at their herds a stampede would slow them down the warrior took his time before answering and eskkar had almost decided to drop the matter when chinua spoke i will speak to my warriors after we have killed anyone approaching us the way should be clear to reach their camp eskkar drew his knife and scratched out an outline of the camp in the dirt shappa you will take your men out here and here this path he indicated a line that led directly toward the nearest sumerians will be for the ur nammu the rest of your warriors chinua should guard that path so that your men are not attacked when they depart and return shappa darted off to find his slingers while eskkar and the commanders made sure everyone knew what was happening he didnt want fifty archers launching arrows into the darkness while some of his men were out there the akkadians were settling down for the night snoring loud enough to wake the spirits soon drowned out all other sounds meanwhile chinua and five men slipped away in the darkness and soon afterward shappa took two groups of five into the night you think the sumerians will come grond sat at eskkars side alert as always for any danger to his commander and friend they have to do something eskkar said otherwise shulgi is wasting his time having them follow us when he knows where were going they may wait until we reach larsa then they can attack us from behind perhaps still i think theyll try and worry us tonight theyll do something more direct tomorrow eskkar said remember theyre just trying to slow us down so that shulgi can get to us gatus laughed if that boy can march his army fifty miles in two days ill give him my hat when i see him by the time we reach larsa hell be at least three or four days behind us if there were no delays in the march and if the men could keep up the pace in spite of any sumerian attacks eskkar expected to reach larsa in less than two more days but something always went wrong he reminded himself battles were often little more than a collection of mistakes with victory going to the side that made the least which was why he and trella had worked so long preparing the men and equipment needed to fight this war lets hope we can take the city before shulgi arrives eskkar said and that will depend on trellas people she knows whats needed as long as your luck holds out barbarian well take the city eskkar grunted the gods who controlled mens fates could change a mans fortune in a heartbeat then youd better offer some extra prayers gatus i think were going to need more than luck for the next few days day in the predawn darkness eskkar rubbed the sleep out of his eyes not that hed gotten much rest during the night he woke at every odd noise and walked the camp talking to the sentries and worrying about the skirmishers and ur nammu if the slingers were killed or captured it would be a small loss nothing they knew could change the battle plan but if too many of the ur nammu were lost then the rest of chinuas fighters might just decide theyd had enough of eskkars war pull out and head back home none of the men hed sent out last night had returned yet but he really wasnt expecting them before dawn the sentries gatus posted had kept a sharp lookout for anyone trying to creep up to the akkadians during the night odd noises out in the land between the rival camps kept every sentry on edge just before midnight a few arrows had come flying into the camp and one sleeping soldier in the middle of the camp had taken an arrow in the leg but the arrows stopped almost as soon as they had started and never restarted nevertheless eskkar greeted the dawn at the camp perimeter watching anxiously for his men as the sun rose he saw them crouched over and moving quickly toward the camp as they drew closer the returning skirmishers broke into a run waving their hands and they raced back as swift as a young horse to the camps safety eskkar saw that two of them had blood on their tunics shappa out of breath but grinning like hed just taken his first woman jogged over to where eskkar stood captain we killed three of them and drove the rest off did any get through eskkar had taken a quick count and saw that all of shappas men had returned no only a few arrows launched from a distance one man was wounded the slinger glanced around and the warriors did they make it back we glimpsed them moving toward the enemy camp one of the sentries gave a shout and eskkar looked out to see a small herd of horses galloping toward the camp urged on by the war cries of the ur nammu warriors ill be damned gatus said yawning as he walked over to join them i thought you told them to stampede the horses not steal them eskkar shook his head you cant send warriors near horses its a sign of weakness not to try and steal a few i should have known they would try something like this well no thanks to you but now weve got another ten spare horses to use as pack animals i can put the wounded man on one another fool sprained his ankle so he can ride too instead of tiring out his friends eskkar had seen the man during the march fighting the pain and supported on either side by his comrades while others struggled under the extra weight of the mans gear chinua rode up his body drawn up to its full height head held high and proud of his mens accomplishments hail lord eskkar we killed six men and captured ten horses eskkar bowed in recognition of the ur nammus success he saw that one of the returning warriors had a bloody arm the horses are yours of course chinua but if my men may have the use of them we will be in your debt for the animals chinua turned to his men speaking rapidly in their own tongue explaining the arrangement get the men moving gatus eskkar raised his voice at least weve taught the sumerians not to try and sneak up on us during the night now its time to march they broke camp quickly the men were used to eating as they walked and it took little time to gather weapons and begin moving your skirmishers did well gatus said when eskkar guided his horse alongside the old soldier and not a man lost eskkar agreed now well see what they can do at larsa gatus drove the men hard the rest of the morning they complained and groaned at the pace but their legs kept moving drawing closer to larsa with each step and no one dropped out the archers slingers and the rest of the company dared not complain since they all carried less weight than gatuss men instead they matched the spearmens pace and covered the ground with long strides that ate up the miles the akkadians soon had their usual escort of enemy horsemen at their flanks and rear by now seeing so many of the enemy close no longer worried the infantry it didnt matter how many sumerian horsemen surrounded them as long as the archers protected the spearmen both were safe from razreks cavalry the enemy hadnt tried to stop them yet but eskkar expected that to happen soon enough once the sumerian horsemen on eskkars left drew a little too close eskkar called out to mitrac who noticed the same encroachment and with a few swift orders prepared his men when the enemy drifted a little closer mitrac barked out an order one hundred archers stopped strung their bows and launched five arrows each many of the shafts fell short and the riders turned and ran as soon as they saw the first flight of arrows but at least half a dozen horses and men went down caught by surprise by the rain of arrows it wasnt much of an exchange for the five hundred arrows launched but it would teach the sumerians not to come too close in moments the archers jogged back to their place in their ranks and the moving column hadnt even slowed its pace but just before noon the scouts riding a few hundred paces in advance halted as they crested a low hill eskkar put his heels to his horse and rode out to join them hundreds of sumerians waited about eight hundred paces ahead theyd built up a low breastwork of dirt and a few trees and now stood behind the makeshift barrier all the ones in the front had bows and more men some on foot others on horseback took position behind them eskkar glanced at the sumerian horsemen whod been shadowing them and saw they had formed lines and moved in closer they would attack if the akkadians ranks stretched too thin and if he decided to avoid this encounter his men would waste valuable time it didnt matter before eskkar had finished studying the enemy formation gatus took charge spearmen gatuss voice rose up over the excited soldiers take battle positions his subcommanders shifted the men quickly from the column into a wider front the spearmen three deep they shrugged off their sacks pulled bronze helmets onto their heads and readied their shields and spears slingers gatuss bellow could be heard by every akkadian form up behind the spearmen the slingers even more excited than the spearmen took their position this was their first test they would have to provide support for the spearmen when they charged alexar position the archers at the rear and flanks keep the horsemen at bay eskkar gave the command but alexar knew what had to be done and had already dispatched his subcommanders every bow was strung and arrows nocked to the string gatus wheeled his horse from in front of the spearmen prepare to advance at a walk he waited while the command was echoed down the line by the subcommanders advance every left foot took the first step and the line of spearmen strode confidently toward the sumerians they carried their heavy wooden spears low in the right hand to conserve strength while holding their shields high to protect the face and upper body the second third and fourth ranks when they were in range of the enemy arrows would raise their shields up to cover their heads the whole shift from a marching column to battle formation took only moments and to the sumerians it must have looked as if the akkadians had hardly slowed their march eskkar took position with his horsemen pacing along behind the slingers when the sumerians broke his small group of akkadian and ur nammu riders would charge into the enemy rear gatus had dismounted and handed his mare over to one of the camp boys he walked just ahead of the slingers guarded by two spearmen on either side mitrac bow in hand led the archers only a few paces behind the slingers a few more steps and the enemy position was within their range archers prepare to shoot he too waited a moment for the command to travel up and down the line shoot keep shooting seven hundred archers stretched in a line three deep behind him without breaking stride they raised their bows and launched the first volley at the entrenched sumerians another was on its way before the first landed and a third a moment later almost two thousand arrows struck the sumerians with devastating effect and before their own bows could even reach the approaching spearmen but the enemys first flight of arrows flew toward the advancing line most fell short but a few struck the shields one man went down an arrow in his leg more enemy arrows flew toward steadily advancing infantry who now presented a shield wall to the front and overhead the sumerians could manage only a jagged volley that showed the nervousness of their archers daunted by the sheer volume of shafts raining down on them eskkar saw their faces turning to the left and right looking for the first man to turn and run all of them hesitant now to stand in place against their akkadian counterparts while the frightening line of spears moved steadily toward them by now the spearmen had covered half the distance ready weapons gatus had to bellow the command this time as the noise and din of a battlefield began to grow as if it were a single movement the spears were raised and held above the right shoulder the second and third ranks moved even closer to the front the raised shields now covering almost every part of the ranks charge the spearmen broke into a run but kept the line even and their shields held out before them for the first time they voiced their war cries as they charged toward the enemy akkad burst from twentyeight hundred lungs as they charged eskkar saw the first of the sumerians turn and run fear spread quickly and more men abandoned their position the akkadians closed the gap in moments arrows continued to rain down on the fleeing sumerians and now stones from the slingers whizzed through the air striking with a loud thud when they struck a shield or with the softer sound of crushing flesh almost none of the enemy stood their ground and the few that did accomplished nothing by their bravery but their deaths with shouts of akkad still ringing out over the ground the spearmen smashed into the now abandoned barrier scrambled over it and kept going at a run the sumerians caught by surprise at the rapid and deadly advance turned to escape but due to the speed of the attack confusion reigned as sumerians bumped into each other as they tried to reach their horses stones from the slingers arched up into the sky before raining down on the confused mass sending horses bucking and tossing riders from their backs the archers followed but they held their arrows until they climbed atop of what was left of the breastwork that gave them a slight height advantage and they stopped and began shooting the spearmen closed with those sumerians still surging backwards most had thrown down their bows and now struggled to catch and mount their horses escape their only thought eskkar never heard who gave the order but the first rank of spearmen had reached within forty paces they cast their long spears drew their swords and closed with the enemy the ur nammu without waiting for the order charged sweeping around to the right where a narrow piece of empty ground let them bypass the exultant spearmen the rest of the akkadian horses followed as eskkar reached the crest he pulled up and turned to see the rear the sumerians at their rear and flanks had hardly tried to approach the remaining archers staying close behind the charging ranks had kept them at bay by the time he returned his gaze to what remained of the sumerian position the carnage had ended bodies littered the ground horses and men victims of arrows stones spears swords the sumerians were still fleeing as fast as their horses could gallop and more than a few were on foot and running for their lives trying to reach the safety of their stillmounted brethren before the shouting ur nammu shooting arrows as they rode ran them down gatus finally halted the advance he gave the men a few moments rest which they used to loot the dead of anything valuable the ur nammu too broke off the pursuit and devoted their time to collecting another two dozen horses drakis strode up to eskkar gatus took the count captain fortysix enemy dead probably as many again wounded one of our men was killed struck in the eye by an arrow five more wounded eskkar grunted in satisfaction the results more favorable than he had expected not many enemy dead but only because the sumerians had fled before the spearmen reached them a good exchange get the wounded on horses and tell gatus to get the men moving again he glanced up at the sun weve wasted enough time here before eskkars order could reach him gatus and his commanders started regrouping the men getting them into formation and resuming the march t hat evening after the men had eaten eskkar gathered his commanders around him today the men proved themselves as did their commanders you all fought bravely there was no confusion no doubt no fear the men followed gatuss orders and went forward without hesitation watching the sumerians run like rabbits will give our men confidence meanwhile the sumerian cavalry will spread the word of their defeat i doubt theyll be willing to face us again the smiles on their faces showed they agreed with his words now well face the next test tomorrow well reach larsa the sumerians will be in the city and the cavalry will still be nipping at our flanks at every opportunity were probably three or four days ahead of shulgis army but we wont have any time to waste we need to take larsa quickly if we let shulgi get too close he might decided to sacrifice his horsemen just to slow us down razrek wont go along with that gatus said not from what weve heard razrek will do whatever hes told eskkar said provided theres enough gold in it for him i dont want to take the chance remember shulgi will do what he thinks is needed to win for him victory makes up for any losses no matter how steep if he doesnt win and soon his soldiers may begin to wonder about their leaders plan then well make sure they all have plenty to worry about that we will gatus now lets get the men to stop boasting about what they did today and have them get some sleep tomorrow is going to be another long day with maybe a hard fight facing them they may not have a chance to get much sleep again day just after midafternoon the akkadian army rounded a bend in the tigris and saw the city of larsa about two miles ahead a ragged cheer arose at the sight and eskkar didnt know if his men were just glad to stop marching or if they looked forward to coming to grips with their enemy without any distractions from the sumerians either last night or today eskkar and his soldiers made good time and reached the outskirts of the city with plenty of daylight left gatus had pushed the men so hard that even the strongest complained by now the army had been marching at top speed every day for nine days and some of the men whod traveled down from the north even longer their legs might be tired but muscles rippled on every limb yet all the mutterings ceased as soon as the men caught a glimpse of their destination in four days the akkadians unprotected by cavalry had marched almost one hundred miles a distance that eskkar would not have believed possible two years ago his men had accomplished something never before done and he felt proud of them is that the farm gatus had ridden up to join eskkar and grond atop a little hillock that gave them a better view of the citys outskirts yes the one with three willow trees eskkar had just identified it from trellas description hed visited larsa twice before in his wanderings but never paid any attention to the countless farms scattered over the landscape this particular farm was about a mile from the city and had the slight distinction of possessing two rickety jetties extending a few paces from the riverbank into the tigris lets hope that yavtar can find the place gatus said he will eskkar had complete confidence in the master sailor who long ago had memorized every turn and twist in the mighty river now lets get there and make camp so the men can get some rest gatus shouted to his commanders and pointed the way forward the akkadians soon covered the last mile of their journey eskkar and grond swung down from their horses in front of the humble house the farms owners had abandoned it as soon as they caught sight of the approaching soldiers and eskkar could still see the family running toward the city carrying a few possessions and driving three cows before them as they fled a good sign he decided that meant that word of their arrival hadnt yet reached every part of the countryside or that his akkadians had moved faster than anyone expected the soldiers settled in around the farm and started building their night camp as soon as that task got under way gatus released the men in shifts so that they could splash and bathe in the river soak their feet and clean themselves and their clothes for the first time in days eskkar decided not to waste any daylight bring the prisoners the akkadian horsemen had rounded up fourteen men and women during the last half of the mornings march all farmers except for one trader and his three porters caught before they could scurry their way into larsa every one of them looked terrified not knowing what fate awaited them escorted into eskkars presence he saw the trembling in their limbs and fear on their faces no matter how well they tried to mask it one or two seemed hardly able to stand so great was their fright instead of death or torture eskkar greeted them with a smile i am eskkar king of akkad i want you to forget what tales youve been told about me and my men you are all free to go to larsa but i want you to carry a message for me to king naran you are to tell him to surrender his city to me by sundown tell him i offer the people of larsa this one chance to save their homes and their lives if king naran does not surrender i will destroy it and all those who resist silence greeted his words at first then quick smiles as they realized they might not be killed or enslaved eskkar made them repeat the message twice to make sure they wouldnt forget it and sent them on their way they kept glancing behind them as they stumbled out of the camp as if still expecting to be slaughtered i never understood why men like that fear death so much grond said we all die sooner or later any chance of larsa surrendering eskkar shook his head no not with razrek and his men inside the walls he knows he only has to hold out for a few days until shulgi catches up with us even if king naran were willing to take a chance on our mercy razrek is the real power in larsa by now but i had to give them the chance its something they and others will remember later good id rather see this place torn down anyway its been a thorn in our side for years when do we attack if yavtar arrives by sundown we attack tonight if he doesnt come well go tomorrow with or without him do you want me to send some scouts up the river no we dont want to call any attention to it yet the sumerians might try to intercept the ships and we need those cargoes eskkar stepped into the farmholds main house then climbed up the rickety ladder to the roof it gave him a good view of the camp bustling with activity and he could even see upriver a little way when eskkar turned his gaze to the south he enjoyed a good view of larsas walls rising up over the swells of land hed kept his worries to himself at least as best he could but the moment of truth had nearly arrived if they couldnt captured larsa which meant take it before shulgis vast army arrived the akkadians would be trapped between the two forces in that case eskkar and his men would have to ford the tigris and try to battle their way north back to akkad his entire battle plan in ruins if he failed here his commanders every man in the army would know the truth and he would see it in their eyes he shook his head and forced the gloomy thought from his mind eskkar had a powerful army at his disposal and the enemy behind larsas gates would be fearing disaster the citys inhabitants had been told that all the battles would take place in the north that no akkadians would ever step foot on larsas countryside now they knew that shulgi had failed to deliver on his promised protection few would be resting comfortably in larsa tonight despite razreks reinforcements below the farmhouse eskkar saw the orderly preparations of his men they were ready for the coming battle and as yet they had no doubts of success most of the soldiers believed in eskkars good fortune his ability to snatch victory from any desperate encounter no matter what the odds that belief had served him well but it needed only one setback to shatter the aura of invincibility and luck they all believed in no sense worrying about defeat now eskkar resolved he considered descending the roof and helping organize the men but decided not to gatus and the others knew what needed to be done instead eskkar stretched out flung his arm over his face and closed his eyes he wasnt as tired as most of his men and the sun still shone brightly down on the land still he knew he needed to get as much rest as he could because there would be no sleep for him tonight despite the noise and bustle surrounding the farmhouse he fell asleep hoping his luck would hold for one more day inside the city of larsa late afternoon a spy should not be such a pathetic creature at least thats what dragan told himself often enough still being a cripple made him beneath notice almost invisible and today of all days he needed that dragan eased his way through the crowded lanes trying to keep his balance until he reached a nook where two huts joined and he could watch larsas main gate without getting trampled on nearly every step he took brought a burning pain that traveled the length of his right leg and up his back the faster dragan tried to move the worse the spasm almost as bad as those times when he stumbled and fell or someone bumped into him and upset his balance most days he managed to control the affliction but todays hurried movements made his leg hurt even more than usual and he forced himself to ignore the searing agony instead he studied the crowd of people congregating near the gate in the last two days farmers and herders filled the city bringing their families and even their animals they had all abandoned their homes and sought refuge within larsas walls desperate to avoid the dreaded akkadians rumored to be coming toward them larsa had never held so many people before two days ago razrek and his eight hundred haughty horse fighters had arrived bringing word of king eskkars rapid approach the sumerian cavalry filled the city most of them drunk within moments of stabling their horses often within the homes of the inhabitants who protested futilely to king naran the citys guards outnumbered by razreks men could do nothing to stop the drunkenness fighting and the assaults on larsas women which often took place in the lanes while the crowd watched the sumerian horsemen turned into gangs of heavily armed men who roamed the city and knocked down anyone who tried to stand in their way at least a dozen men had died killed for one reason or another by the sumerians and their murderers remained unavenged with the addition of those fleeing the countryside the citys normal routine had collapsed unable to sustain such numbers boisterous soldiers filled the shops and common areas while their horses causing almost as much trouble as their riders were stabled in the marketplace and every open area no one tried or could restrain razreks sumerians larsas regular guards refused to leave their barracks and not even king naran in his fine house could keep razreks men in check even assuming he had the slightest interest in doing so dragan cared nothing about larsas discomforts he leaned against the house wall and took the weight off his leg easing the pain somewhat a hundred paces away the big gates that sealed larsas main entrance began to close a dozen men straining to push the thick beams into position one last handful of people screaming in fright at the thought of finding themselves locked out and left to the mercy of the akkadians squirmed through the narrowing opening to fall to the ground exhausted but the two parts of the gate joined at last and the gatekeepers grunted under the effort to bar the entry two goodsized logs rose into the air hefted upward by more than a dozen arms and were dropped into place the men breathing heavily from the effort the head gatekeeper then hammered the four wooden blocks into place jamming the restraining beams to prevent them from moving shut fast larsa awaited the coming attack of the akkadians theyd been promised that the relief forces of king shulgi would soon arrive to destroy the invaders but the king of the sumerians had also promised that their city would never face the wrath of the akkadians led by the barbarian demon eskkar with the enemy without and razreks men within no one in larsa felt safe satisfied with the security of the gates its keepers returned to their posts within the watchtowers that rose up on either side of the entrance dragan waited until he was sure that nothing further would be done to seal the gate then he straightened up and limped painfully back to his home between the press of the crowd and his leg dusk had settled in by the time he reached the singleroom dwelling that sheltered him and his brother ibisin they closed the gate early i could hear a few wretched people left outside pleading to be let in dragan sighed in relief as he let himself slip to the ground extending his twisted right leg laying flat on the dirt floor gave him the most comfort the tiny room held only a stool for furniture and a carrying box that contained their tools a pile of moldy leather skins rested in a corner and spread out on piece of hide were the leather goods dragan and ibisin made and sold to stay alive wrist straps arm protectors for the archers rings laces and plaited leather bands to hold back a man or womans hair and a few other trinkets nothing more just closed it ibisin sank onto the stool a leather patch covered his left eye almost three years ago a horse fighter from larsa had smashed the eye into jelly with the hilt of his sword and ibisin kept it covered to keep out the dust a fleck of dirt lodged in the eye caused great irritation and required immediate washing to hold down the pain just closed it thank the gods at least they didnt nail it shut now we just have to wait until the akkadians come either tonight or tomorrow they wont dare to wait any longer ibisin lowered his voice even more then well have our revenge perhaps if the gods approve dragan glanced at the open door to the house covered only by a ragged blanket youll have to go out and listen for the signal ill go now it feels good to be doing something at last after so long be careful little brother dragan said he watched his brother leave the blanket swaying from his passage one of them always remained in the room to guard against thieves who might slip in and steal anything they could get their hands on in this poorer section of larsa none of the dwellings boasted a door and each owner or tenant made sure a wife or child stood guard over their property every day fortunately their poverty and wretched existence provided a measure of protection from the sumerian horsemen who would otherwise have pushed their way in and taken whatever they wished razreks men wanted women ale or gold not humbly made leather trinkets just as the raiders had done to his familys farm dragan remembered almost four years ago soldiers from larsa had ridden across the sippar and pushed north looting farms and murdering their inhabitants the evil raids had continued until king eskkar drove them back across the river but by then dragans mother and father were dead his two sisters raped and carried off to some unknown fate ibisin had been knocked unconscious which had saved his life even though it cost him an eye dragan had tried to run but one of larsas archers put a shaft into his leg dragan managed to crawl into the wheat field and hide in the tall stalks and fortunately the archer had no interest in following after his wounded victim not when women and loot waited for the taking dragan had passed out from loss of blood and ibisin holding a bloody rag over his face had finally found him half a day after the raiders had departed both brothers had nearly died but next day after the raiders had gone their uncle who had a nearby farm arrived and managed to nurse them back to health but with so many mouths to feed the injured brothers could only impose on their kinsmen for so long their uncle with his crops and house destroyed decided to move north to a farm given him by the akkadians at any rate he had little extra food to share with two cripples as soon as the brothers could walk like many others whose families had been murdered or driven off they plodded north to akkad it took them almost a month to make the painful journey dragan and ibisin found akkad crowded with other refugees from the south as well as those seeking something beyond long hours laboring on their families farm since the brothers wounds prevented them from doing manual labor they became beggars in the lane pleading with passersby for food then one day a woman had stopped before their begging bowl looking them over before she dropped a copper coin into the bowl may the gods send you blessings honored mother dragan said gratefully a copper coin meant a good meal for them both tonight my name is uvela the woman said you are from the borderlands yes mistress uvela my brother ibisin and i were farmers there until the raiders from larsa came and killed our family to dragans surprise uvela squatted beside them tell me what happened no one had ever asked for their story before they told uvela what evil fate had fallen on their family answering every question about the hated raiders from larsa by then dragan guessed that uvela was one of those women who worked for lady trella wife of king eskkar when he finished the last of their sad tale uvela offered her sympathy and left after that she would stop by once or twice a week giving them a copper coin each time but never staying to talk the days passed slowly and dragan and his brother grew weaker food might be plentiful in akkad but if one wanted to eat well one had to work to earn it almost two months slipped by and dragan knew he and his brother were going to starve to death then uvela returned but this time she dropped no coin in their bowl would you like to earn some copper of course mistress dragan answered anything we can do anything then follow me she said but not too closely its best that no one knows our business with the two brothers trailing a dozen paces behind she led the way to a small house near the river gate another woman was there and food was spread out on a blanket dragan and ibisin dropped to their knees and devoured bread cheese dates and the first ale theyd had in many days when they finally finished eating the other woman spoke to them my name is annoksur would you like a chance to strike back at larsa for killing your family three months later dragan and ibisin had regained much of their health and strength during that time a tanner had come by each evening to teach them how to work with leather tools the most valuable things the brothers had ever owned and for which an apprentice might work two years to obtain were provided as well annoksur told them what they needed to do how they needed to act what tale they would tell while living in larsa when their training and instruction ended a boat had taken them downriver dropping them off at night a mile from larsas gate annoksurs coins enabled them to enter the city and rent the hovel there that they now called home for almost two years they lived in larsa every month or so a man stopped by to give them a few more copper coins the man who never gave his name listened to what theyd learned and told them what they needed to do he even gave them weapons two long copper knives like those dragan had seen for sale in larsas market those weapons wrapped in a sack and buried beneath the floor of the hut had waited for over a year until the day when they would be used annoksurs caution and their long preparation had succeeded since the war had broken out king narans men had scoured the city searching for any strangers or spies who might be in the pay of akkad narans agents collected every ablebodied newcomer to larsa and set them to work in the slave gangs to make sure no one tried to betray the city from within but dragan and his brother had lived for so long in the city that they were beneath notice not that any soldier would pay the slightest attention to two cripples as soon as dragan learned of king eskkars army camped on the plain outside of larsa he knew that today or tomorrow would be that day the day when he and his brother would take their revenge against king naran and his murderers w ake up captain gronds head poked up through the hole in the roof when the sleeping man didnt move grond reached over and shook eskkars leg eskkar lifted his head his hand already on his knife what is it his voice sounded heavy with sleep and he knew hed slept well though not long enough boats are coming down the river i think its yavtar by the time eskkar reached the riverbank a whole fleet of approaching riverboats were strung out like jewels on a necklace he counted twelve boats more than he had expected the first craft angled its way toward the shore swung smartly against the current and slid alongside the jetty in a moment yavtar jumped onto the little dock as one by one the other vessels birthed themselves on the riverbank where eager hands pulled them up onto the shore good to see you again captain yavtar clasped his arms around eskkars shoulders you brought more ships than we expected bisitun sent two more ships and the builders just finished two more i had to scrape akkads docks to find crews but were here now with everything you need including a dozen ladders food and the firearrows yes along with twentyfive jars of oil and plenty of bread and meat at least you wont be fighting on an empty belly gatus and alexar strode up to the tiny jetty and exchanged greetings with the boatmaster hes brought the firearrows eskkar said lets get them off the boats first if we can well attack tonight he turned back to yavtar did you see any sign of shulgi on the way down yes and he saw us too we tried to slip by at night but some sentry taking a piss spotted us and gave the alarm there was nothing they could do except shoot a few arrows at us but we were well away from shore and the light was poor his horsemen caught up with us the next day and followed us along the river we shot a few arrows at them just to give the archers some target practice this far south the tigris flowed wide and deep without boats of their own the sumerians had no way to intercept the vessels and two of yavtars boats were fighting ships they carried little cargo but plenty of archers how far back is their main force at least two days yavtar said maybe three if he gets here any sooner his men will be too tired to walk let alone fight i dont intend to give him the chance eskkar said make sure everything gets unloaded it will be dark soon enough and ive a few wounded men you can take back plus some loot the men have picked up alexar shouted some orders and the dock burst into activity it didnt take long for two hundred men to empty the twelve boats distributing the food and weapons other soldiers filled sacks with sand and dirt to ballast the boats for their return voyage upriver in what seemed like no time at all yavtar and his boats were being pushed back into the water their crews cursing at the clumsy soldiers whose excess zeal threatened to swamp the boats then oars bit into the river and they headed upriver not to akkad but a resupply point halfway between the city and kanesh only one boat remained a small but fast craft to carry word upriver of the armys success or failure at larsa as soon as the last boat departed eskkar grond gatus alexar and the other commanders sat around a campfire wolfing down bread only a few days old and sharing a small cask of ale the first since theyd left akkad eskkar paused between mouthfuls get everyone into position well have to bring the archers and spearmen close to the wall in case the horsemen try to attack our rear mitrac you know where to direct the arrows gatus and his spearmen will protect your rear and flanks along with alexar and the rest of the archers if nothing works drakis and his men will attempt to scale the wall grond and i will hold three hundred spearmen and a hundred archers in readiness in case the gate opens you should let someone else lead the way eskkar gatus said his men had argued about that before but eskkar refused to stand around and do nothing no thats been decided he finished his bread and stood grond send the signal if the gate doesnt open well use the ladders alexar sounded confident his men had practiced scaling walls in the dark and under the covering arrows of the archers grond walked off into the darkness before long a drum began to sound five slow beats struck with full strength on the widest drum the akkadians carried then a long pause before the drummer repeated the same five beats each stroke on the drum brought forth a powerful boom that echoed through the twilight loud enough to carry all the way to the citys walls that sound would be heard through larsa and men there would ponder its meaning eskkar intended to keep the drum going until the assault began meanwhile the commanders positioned the troops checking their equipment to make sure no man forgot his sword or second quiver of arrows which had already happened enough times when the men got excited once in training a spearman had forgotten his tunic and gatus insisted he stay naked all day at last eskkar moved to where his force of men were assembled and nodded in satisfaction the battle for larsa had begun i bisin returned to the hut his brother sat at the back of the chamber waiting they gave the signal dragan nodded the movement unseen in the dark i heard it even here watch the door while i dig he took his time making as little noise as possible now would not be the time to alert any neighbors or soldiers passing by it was slow work as the three sacks were buried deep and the weight of their bodies had packed down the earth firmly over the months but eventually dragan pried loose the first sack from the earth and handed it to ibisin the next two took longer as they were much bulkier and heavy but at last all three had been removed from where theyd been buried for so long the knives were removed from one sack and unwrapped from their covering cloths ibisin loosened the simple fastening on the other two but didnt open them each contained a thick rope knotted at every arm length and long enough to stretch twenty paces the section of the wall they had chosen wasnt that high but the rope needed to be fastened securely across the parapet dragan put his arm on his brothers shoulder my heart is racing ibisin i know mine too im afraid not of dying but of failing we wont fail brother now we just have to wait it wont be long king eskkar moves quickly against his enemies t he brothers sat in the darkness of their hut waiting outside the citys walls the akkadian army was on the march toward larsa its dark mass illuminated only by the moon and a few torches that bobbed about in the slight breeze the entire force or so it appeared to the nervous sentries on the walls moved across the main entrance to larsa and marched toward the south side of the citys wall larsas defenders moved with them shifting most of their men to the southern wall to prepare for the akkadian assault weapons were readied torches lit along the wall as men pushed and shoved their way into position driven by their cursing commanders beneath the parapets the citys inhabitants shouted or wailed everyone in dread of the coming attack outside the city gatus directed the men toward the southern gate one of the three entrances into larsa a hundred soldiers carried the same number of torches delivered by yavtars boats one by one each torch was lighted until they all burned in the night illuminating the akkadian army as it moved into its attack position the akkadian archers halted first stopping just out of effective range of the archers on the citys walls mitrac lined up two hundred of his archers behind them more bowmen waited their turn and behind them pots of the oil that burns were opened and made ready for use the torches were driven into the ground one between every pair of archers the firearrows were laid out in easy access each firearrow had been carefully crafted in akkad a bit longer than the usual shafts the extra distance between the point and the bow was wrapped tightly with thin cloth wound over and over and then fastened tightly with threads the many layers of cloth would absorb the oil sustaining the flame until it reached its target alexar ranged his men to protect mitracs bowmen guarding their rear and flanks and held other archers ready to replace any man killed or wounded by shafts from the wall mitrac strode up and down the line directing the men where to aim he had studied the maps trella had created in akkad and knew the general layout of larsa more important he knew the most likely locations where razrek would be stabling his horses those places were to receive the bulk of the arrow storm ready the line he gave the command to start the battle men dipped the shafts in the oil and waited a few moments to let the thick liquid soak into the cotton then stepped forward to where the torches waited light your shafts shoot two hundred shafts flew up into the night fleeting flecks of flame marking their flight almost every shaft carried over the walls to land where the gods directed larsas wall stood crowded with men its archers firing back at the akkadians but the range was great and for this work mitrac had selected his strongest bowmen using the most powerful bows a second volley flew up into the night then a third mitrac didnt try to keep the volley shooting better to let the men take plenty of care with the oil and fire and shoot whenever they were ready mitrac had eight thousand arrows ready but he didnt plan on using them all thirty arrows per man or six thousand flaming arrows should be enough to put larsa to the torch f rom the wall razrek watched the arrows arching over his head while in flight they showed only the slightest trace of light but when they struck something they turned into a finger of flame that licked at anything within reach many burned out uselessly striking mud walls or the dirt of the lanes others were snatched up and smothered by those standing nearby still plenty burned long enough to set something alight damn these akkadians and their barbarian king razrek hadnt expected firearrows and no one had expected a night attack especially tonight eskkars men should be exhausted by the long march besides being short on food and sleep they were supposed to attack tomorrow at dawn or during the day not tonight tomorrow half of razreks men had to be rounded up from the ale houses and brothels mattaki stood beside his commander shifting from one foot to the other in his excitement once mattaki realized his cavalry wasnt going to slow down the akkadians he had ridden on ahead to warn razrek theyre shooting hundreds of arrows at us where did they get so many thousands not hundreds razrek corrected all brought downriver by those miserable boats marduk curse them all why didnt shulgi stop them those ships made the attack possible sondar realized they must have carried the firearrows the oil even the ladders he could see out there as well as the food that gave the akkadians strength for tonights attack the city is going to burn mattaki said those arrows will set enough fires let the city burn the walls will remain upright another of razreks men dashed up the steps to the parapet razrek the akkadians are targeting the marketplace the stables everyplace weve put the horses theyve killed dozens already and the rest are panicking out of control the fires are driving them wild with fear with a start razrek realized the implications a good horse was more valuable than any fighter without the horses there would be no escape from those cursed akkadians if they ever got over the walls get the horses inside the huts make sure theyve got something over their heads to protect them throw people out of their houses if you have to even as razrek gave the order he knew it wouldnt work dragging a skittish horse into a hut through a low doorway wasnt an easy task the houses were burning too while most of the city was made from mud bricks all the roofs and awnings were wood usually bundles of sticks or wrapped cloth stretched over the open roofs all dried to the bone by a long summer of blazing sun king naran had done nothing to prepare for a fire attack no water jars stood ready to put out fires no piles of dirt to smother flames no lines of women and children helping to fight the blaze larsa was going to burn all right king naran rushed up the steps a sword at his hip and a gleaming bronze helmet on his head razrek do something have your men put out the fires before the city burns to the ground no weve got to keep the men on the walls the akkadians are waiting for us to weaken our strength then theyll rush the walls but well have nothing left nothing razrek grabbed the king and pushed him to the wall look out there you fool see those spearmen with ladders theyll be coming soon enough if you want to fight the fires use your own men smother all the fires get your women and children to work carrying water he glanced back at the akkadians moving and shifting behind the lines of archers from what he could see the entire force was mustered before the south wall they would be coming soon enough what about all your men behind the akkadians king naran gestured out into the darkness where he knew the rest of the sumerian horsemen were watching the assault why arent they attacking are they cowards razrek ignored the kings words mattaki get every man who can fight on the wall forget the fires king naran shook himself free of razreks grip damn you razrek you said you came to protect larsa his voice rose shrilly over the parapet you and your filthy horsemen have brought this down on our heads razrek jerked his knife from his belt and shoved the point against narans throat talk to me like that again and ill kill you now get off the wall he shoved the king away naran stumbled backwards and fell almost toppling off the parapet he scrambled to his feet his hand clutching his throat he looked aghast as blood seeped through his fingers from where razreks knife had nicked him and fled calling out for his guards to protect him do you think our men will attack their rear mattaki kept his voice low so that the other men crowded on the wall couldnt hear razrek stared at the akkadians no theyre not coming this caught them by surprise and theyll use that as an excuse not to attack they wont want to risk the horses in the darkness and theyre not going to face the spearmen on foot were on our own may the gods help us forget the gods razrek ordered just keep the men on the walls l arsas north side had no gate the main entrance was on the east the other two gates faced the south and the river to the west from the doorway of an abandoned hut a hundred and fifty paces away from the city drakis lay on his belly and watched the north wall he had no trouble making out the sentries on guard the fires burning in the city behind them provided enough light to outline the dark forms moving about at present the sentries didnt concern him drakis had his gaze fixed on a point midway between the wall and the ruined huts that king naran had carelessly allowed to intrude so close to larsas walls one of drakiss men had crawled to that halfway point to get close enough to the wall to discern the signal should it come the man would relay the signal to drakis and his forty men now bunched up behind him all keeping low and hopefully out of sight from the guards pacing the wall the men waiting patiently behind him were a mixed lot slingers archers swordsmen and even two men who carried no weapon except for a large hammer apiece drakis had trained them for this operation months ago up in bisitun now lady trella and king eskkars foresight would be put to the test and eskkars luck of course that would be needed too see anything his friend and subcommander tarok sat with his back to the crumbling wall nothing yet how long do we wait until we see wait something was moving out there the shadow midway between drakis and the wall had lifted its arm and waved thats the signal send out the slingers tarok pulled himself to his feet and whispered the necessary orders drakis kept his eyes on the wall plenty could still go wrong but the next few moments might give him and his men the chance to be the first akkadians to enter larsa d ragan and ibisin walked toward the north wall each carried a heavy sack over their left shoulder both were too tense to say anything that curious mixture of fear and excitement that often accompanies men when they go into battle magnified as always by those with no real experience in fighting dragan understood that a trained soldier might face an enemy but he and his brother were farmers and with little knowledge or skill in fighting and killing with his injured leg dragan couldnt walk too fast especially when carrying the heavy rope but they finally reached their destination guards lined the wall every twenty paces but the open space beneath the parapet was empty of life every man that could be spared had been summoned to defend the south wall where the akkadians were massing or to put out fires the brothers reached the foot of the steps but before they could start the climb a sharp voice halted them what are you doing here dragan took his foot off the first step and faced one of the guards striding toward them we were told to bring bread to the sentries on the walls each sack did contain a single loaf of bread in case anyone wanted to glance inside dragan kept his voice low and properly subservient the men who made up larsas soldiers were known for their brutality even toward their own inhabitants we can leave it here and you can take it up if let me see what youve got in there the guard stepped closer and dragan struck bringing his hand up from alongside his leg and plunging the knife in the mans stomach a moment later ibisins knife flashed into the mans neck the guard fell to the ground legs thrashing a low gurgling the only sound he could make a noise that went unheard against the shouts of those fighting the flames burning throughout the city they wiped their hands and blades on the dying mans tunic as theyd been taught gathered the sacks and made their way up the parapet once on top they took only a few paces before another guard moved away from the wall to see what they wanted bread master dragan said your commander said to give each man a loaf the sentry scarcely gave them a glance about time half the men have deserted their posts ive been up here for half the night with nothing to the man died before he could finish his words struck down by dragans fierce thrust one of akkads soldiers had taught him how to make that move driving the blade quickly up into the mans ribs with all his strength it was dragan realized easier the second time the unexpected attack made even less noise and that too was easily drowned out by the tumult coming from the south ibisin shoved the second guards body close to the wall where it might escape notice they moved down the wall to the next sentry he died as quietly as the others that gave them over forty paces of wall to themselves ibisin pulled open the sacks and dumped the heavy rope a support beam projected out over the ground beneath the parapet and he looped one end of the rope around the beam and fastened the knot just as hed been trained on akkads own walls ten paces away dragan did the same before he had finished ibisin leaned over the wall clutching a long strip of white cloth and waving his arms neither brother could see anything in the darkness but he hoped akkadians were out there and watching what do we do now ibisins whisper sounded excited we wait until there someones coming a crouching shape rose up out of the earth like a spirit and flitted toward the wall suddenly the rope went taut and in moments faster than dragan thought anyone could climb up the wall a boy slid over the top at least he looked like a boy to dragan he carried no weapons just another rope slung around his neck he ducked his head and shrugged the rope off his shoulder take this he handed the third rope to ibisin and pulled something from his tunic help them up both ropes went taut again and two more men pulled themselves up and over the wall shappa the first akkadian to breach larsas walls ignored them he dropped a stone in his sling and waited the guards were visible enough but most of them were facing inwards watching the city burn smoke hung in the air stinging the eyes rasping the throat and already carrying the stench of burning flesh throughout the city firearrows continued to rise and fall through the sky but fewer now that most of the fires had taken root the first six men up the ropes were slingers and they knelt against the wall staying in the shadows shappa walked along the parapet forcing himself to move slowly and purposefully as if he belonged he carried the sling in his left hand his left hand was as his right and he could use his sling almost as well with either hand his right hand held a long copper knife concealed behind his leg the next sentry never saw the knife that flashed into his stomach shappa pressed his sling against the mans mouth to muffle any cries but the man went down without a sound within a few heartbeats the rest of the slingers followed soon two more ropes were being fastened to the parapet supports shappa returned to find dragan and ibisin still helping men up and over the wall archers their bows strung and looped over their shoulders were pulling themselves into the city the bowmen fanned out along the wall and tarok led them toward the ramparts steps guards guards akkadians on the walls theyre inside the city someone had noticed the mass of men slithering over the wall and sounded the alarm drakis almost the last man to scale the wall pulled himself up over the edge his white teeth showing either a grin or a grimace as the enemy sentries sounded the alarm along the north wall too late now fools the noise echoed down into the city but it didnt matter with four ropes providing access the last of drakiss men pulled themselves up and over lets go drakis commanded forty men raced down the steps and into larsa pounding through the lanes heading for the main gate dragan and ibisin watched them rush off hard men intent on a single purpose in a moment they had the parapet to themselves what shall we do now i dont know ibisin but wed better get off this wall before someone notices us d rakis had taken a good look toward the main gate before he descended the steps he knew the way from studying ismennes map but in the darkness nothing looked familiar the lanes twisted and turned even more confusing than those in the older parts of akkad some of the houses were burning and his men pushed and shoved through crowds of people frantically trying to put out fires save their possessions or escape the flames no one seemed to recognize them as akkadians or if they did had any inclination to try and stop them just as he thought hed taken a wrong turn the lane turned into a wider passage and drakis knew the gate lay just ahead this way archers take to the roofs he led the men in a wild charge straight at the gate two houses burned along one side and a watchfire burned along the top of the wall sentries continued to sound the alarm and now drakis heard the panic in their voices an arrow struck the ground beside him and skittered off into the darkness the sentries on the wall had finally grasped the situation but drakis and his men were moving too quickly to stop and too fast to hit they made it to the foot of the gate before they encountered any opposition two guards died trying to stop them and the others backed into the towers that led upwards drakis didnt care about them get that gate open the two men with the hammers went to work as soon as the first stroke pounded on the brace the gate shook and everyone knew what was happening the citys guards started shooting arrows at anything that moved including the citys inhabitants and a group of soldiers who had collected themselves to ready a counterattack but by then the twenty akkadian archers had reached the roofs now akkadian arrows as well as stones from the slingers began to fly from the darkness first striking down anyone who seemed in command then searching out anyone with a bow that stopped the counterattack against drakis and his twenty swordsmen the first wedge broke free then the second a moment later get the beam out drakiss voice cut through the chaos some of his men dropped their swords and moved to the gate four men lifted the top beam grunting as they shoved it up over their heads then they had to move it aside one man went down with an arrow in his chest and the log sagged dangerously before the remaining trio could hurl it aside letting it roll off into the darkness they had to get it far enough away from the gate so as to not hinder it swinging open the hammers kept pounding behind them and drakis glanced back to see the last wedge splinter into fragments he slid his sword into the scabbard and helped his men shoulder the second and lower beam they had to stoop down to grasp it an arrow slammed into the gate a hands width from drakiss head but it didnt matter now with a grunt the beam rose up scraping along the wood and drakis moved away from the gate his feet stumbling in the dirt trying to maintain his footing the soldier with the hammer began pounding on the gate with all his might the signal to those waiting outside throw it drakis gave the command and the men heaved the beam to the side behind them the gate burst open and the first man through was eskkar at the head of a wave of two hundred and fifty spearmen and fifty archers he recognized drakis drakis stay here make sure the gate stays open until the rest of the men arrive that didnt take long soon the entire force of spearmen jogged through the gate breathing hard the first part of eskkars army was pouring into larsa and nothing could stop it now e skkar carrying a shield like any of his infantry led the initial force straight down the widest lane he remembered to count his strides and when he reached eighty a lane appeared on his left and he led the men that way fires burned everywhere and the people shrank out of their way frightened by the river of fierce men all wearing bronze helmets that glowed bloodred in the flickering light and carrying shields and long spears whose tips glinted as they reflected the flames another two hundred paces and the house of king naran appeared an imposing structure surrounded by a wall taller than the height of a man four soldiers swords in hand guarded the gate but they took one glance at the charging akkadians and fled two ran up the lane and the other two ducked inside the gate open that gate eskkar dashed up the lane his personal guards and the spearmen trying to catch up with their leader he heard a bar snap into place as he reached the entrance but no gate this small would stop him now he raised his shield and flung his weight against the gate a moment later four more bodies hit it and more hands reached out to push against it something snapped and the gate burst open eskkar stumbled through the opening falling to his knees from the press of men behind him grond caught him by the arm and jerked him upright akkadian soldiers shouting war cries rushed into the grounds brandishing spears or swords any who resisted were slain those who tried to flee were caught and slammed to the ground the spearmen fanned out filling the spacious grounds and moving to the rear of the courtyard in moments the kings house was taken eskkar strode through the open door stepping over a body two torches burned in the long common room but it was devoid of life a broad flight of steps led upstairs marked by a bloody trail eskkar pointed with his sword and his men rushed up the steps another barred door held the soldiers up for a few moments before they ripped it from its hinges and poured into the upper chamber eskkar mounted the steps and entered the room two thick candles mounted on the walls illuminated the first of the three rooms he knew to comprise the houses second story women were dragged from the other rooms and soon a dozen stood crammed together in the corner eskkar looked at the terrified women shaking in their fear clutching each other in their panic one older than the others wore a rich gown a pearl necklace hung from her neck two younger women likely her daughters clung to her arms as eskkar moved to face her she tried to shrink back but there was no place to go eskkar studied her for a moment king naran had several wives but his first wife had given him two daughters you are narans wife no the woman lifted her chin and held her daughters tight against her body then youre of no use to me he turned to grond kill her and the two with her grond his powerful frame as frightening as any man alive drew his sword from its scabbard and stepped forward raising the blade over his head wait stop the older of the two girls holding their mother upright shouted the words my mother is first wife to my father king naran where is he eskkars voice rasped into the older womans face she hesitated i dont know her voice quivered as she spoke narans wife had courage but the daughter would tell him what he wanted eskkar reached out caught the mothers hair and twisted it back making her gasp with pain thats twice youve lied to me woman next time ill cut out your tongue where is he grond grabbed her by the face pushing his thick fingers into the sides of her jaw forcing it open he shoved the sharp blade into her mouth and a trickle of blood formed in the corner inside inside the bed chamber the same girl sobbing now pointed to the way eskkar released his hold on narans wife bring them he entered the second chamber a comfortable room where naran no doubt took his pleasure a large chest rested against the wall the only concealment possible grond went to it placed his foot against one side and shoved the chest slid aside revealing an opening cut into the wall get him out grond would have to bend over double to squeeze inside the dark hiding hole and he knew better than to do that instead he took a spear from one of the grinning soldiers and thrust it into the darkness stop im coming out on his hands and knees king naran emerged from the hidden chamber his bronze helmet still on his head if he had a sword hed left it behind a soldier arrived with a torch shoved it inside and inspected the hiding hole its empty lord eskkar dont take any chances tear the wall down there might be another hole concealed within this one check all the rooms break open every wall there will be more hiding places for his gold grond jerked the helmet from narans head turned him around and began tying his hands behind his back guard him and his women well grond ill be back for them later t he moment razrek heard the alarm about akkadians entering the city he knew it was time to go already the mass of soldiers outside the city had begun abandoning their position and started jogging toward the main gate the threat against the south wall had been a ruse damn that demon eskkar razrek shook his head in frustration summon our men to the river gate and get them mounted weve only moments before these bastards seal us in he raced down the steps and ran as fast as he could toward larsas river gate fires burned everywhere and the heat from the flames would have given him pause at any other time with swords in their hands razrek mattaki and his men rushed down the lane forcing their way through the terrified mob of people pushing and shoving in every direction use your swords on the rabble razrek shouted clear the way to the corrals mattaki shouted orders to every horseman they passed and soon hundreds of men milled about in the stable area razrek reached the house where hed stabled his horse and those of his commanders some were already there others arriving breathless pausing only long enough to fit a halter over their horses head frantic soldiers tore loose the gates fastenings and flung it open men kicked their horses hard and burst through the opening riding south along the river toward safety razrek saw a few arrows reach out from the darkness and strike down several of his men the shafts didnt descend in force but he knew that would soon change as more archers reached the rear of the city razrek finally fitted the halter to his nervous mounts tossing head he swung onto his stallion and hunched over his horses shoulder as he urged the big animal forward with a thunder of hooves razrek and the rest of his men fled into the darkness away from the walls and burning debris behind him came hundreds of the citys inhabitants desperate to escape before the akkadians sealed them in shouting and pushing they forced their way through the gate running for their lives the akkadian bowmen slowed down by the tangle of broken huts that littered the ground finally pushed their way toward the river gate trying to seal off the most likely escape route but only a few arrived before razrek and hundreds of his men galloped out arrows flew at them but the leader of the first group of breathless archers didnt have enough men to contest their escape he shot arrows at anything that moved and emptied his quiver with the last shaft launched into the darkness more archers kept arriving and now razreks stragglers were cut down arrows killing horses and riders driving them back into the city when men and horses littered the space just outside the gate the exodus stopped a few defenders tried to close the portal but eskkars spearmen arrived and took control the last escape route out of larsa had been closed a mile downriver razrek halted in an open field he and mattaki bellowed commands stopping the panicky gallop men and horses were breathing hard from the desperate dash through the night and it took a long time under the moons feeble light before razrek finally collected all his men and took a count damn those akkadians he shouted at mattakis white face only two out of every three of razreks horsemen got away before the akkadians sealed the city hed lost valuable horses men and weapons not to mention the city of larsa shulgi would not be pleased day eskkar woke to find the morning sun in his eyes something felt odd until he realized he hadnt slept on hard ground for the first time in almost ten days he remembered dragging the remains of narans bed close to the window so that dawns first light would wake him by then eskkar felt as tired as if hed fought a dozen fights midnight had come and gone before he managed to snatch some sleep throwing himself down on the kings fancy blankets exhausted by the long days march and the night attack on larsa now the sun shone brightly well above the horizon and eskkar realized hed slept right through sunrise throughout the city his men were up and about while he slept in comfort on a thick spread of rich cloth that until last night had no doubt pampered the soft flesh of king naran his wives and concubines for a moment eskkar lay there thinking about last nights events ignoring the sounds of activity in the courtyard below his mouth felt dry and his head ached as if hed been drinking all night instead of capturing his first city he was he decided getting too old for this kind of warfare grond entered the room carrying an ornate carved tray in both hands everythings under control captain leave it to grond to make sure his commander knew the situation first theres fresh water bread hot chicken and some dates and a cup of narans finest ale grond set the tray down on a low table beside the bed we d better drink as much of that as we can probably wont see anything as good as this again eskkar pushed himself up the smell of smoke still lingered in the air and every breeze brought more of the acrid smell inside most of the fires from the attack would have burned themselves out by now but the charred embers would linger for some time despite the small amount of sleep he felt rested he grasped the cup of ale drank half of it then filled it again with water this time he emptied the cup demons thats good ale youre sure everythings under control oh yes the citys still burning here and there but our men and supplies are all inside the walls the sumerian horsemen have moved in closer to watch us but theyre not going to attack a walled city useless fools shulgi should have known better im sure he knows by now grond sat down on the bed which sagged under their combined weight no sign of razrek that wolf must have gotten away before they closed the river gate how many men did we lose the commanders are still counting but not many less than fifty id guess another forty or fifty wounded half the men are still busy chasing women or looting the wounded will thank the gods for yavtar and his boats a quick river trip back to akkad if they can get through by the time they recover the war will be over or well all be dead nevertheless eskkar had a smile on his face and narans gold piled up in the next room under guard we found the third hiding place after you went to bed very small but stuffed with fine jewels and precious stones the homes of the leading merchants are still being searched torn down actually its faster than trying to torture the information out of them last night under the threat of torture naran had revealed two hiding places where he kept his hoard of gold and other valuables but despite his protestations the king of larsa had given them up too easily and eskkar had suspected there would be a third he stood tossing the remains of the bread on the floor are the commanders here waiting in the courtyard then its time to begin before leaving the upper chambers eskkar stopped to see naran and his three wives four daughters two young sons and three concubines all of them spent the night huddled together in the adjacent chamber eskkar hadnt heard any sounds of weeping or wailing the guards must have threatened to cut the tongue out of anyone who disturbed the king of akkads rest now the royal prisoners stared up in fear when they saw eskkar standing in the doorway the chamber was just large enough to hold all of them two hawk clan soldiers both looking tired but still alert guarded the former king of larsa and his women both guards held bread in their hands eskkar nodded a greeting and let them return to their own breakfasts narans house had a private well of course and eskkar drank his fill of fresh water then stripped and rinsed out his tunic while he washed his face and hands by the time he had finished his commanders had gathered at a small table awaiting the days orders one empty seat awaited him before he took his place he looked at each of his men tired but grinning faces greeted him probably none of them had snatched more than a few moments of sleep since the night before my thanks to all of you your bravery has let us take larsa and now its food and supplies will sustain us not shulgi he turned to gatus yawning at the opposite end of the table how long before shulgi arrives at least a day and a half probably two and half whenever he gets here i doubt if his army will be in any condition to fight that day so weve probably got three days before we have to worry good that gives us more than enough time the first thing we need to do is move all the supplies across the river a few boats got away last night yavtar said but we captured nine that had been pulled from the river and taken inside the walls ill put them all to good use when our own boats return today or tomorrow we should be able to ferry everyone across the river in a single day meanwhile ill send three or four ships north with the wounded and the spoils move the supplies first eskkar said then regretted his words he hated giving useless orders about trivial details his leaders knew what needed to be done eskkar decided his head must still be stuffed with sleep anything we can use goes across he corrected himself everything else is to be burned or tossed in the river what about the people alexar looked as weary as gatus are we going to let them go many of them slipped out through the gates before we could close them off others went over the walls turn all the women and children out of the city first that may get our men to stop chasing them any men too old or infirm for work can leave too make sure they take nothing of value with them including their clothes have our men collect all the loot and turn it over to yavtar what about the men the ablebodied men and boys will help us move the supplies then use them to help burn down the rest of the city what wont burn is to be torn down after that well let the prisoners go free that will be more mouths to feed when shulgi arrives since hes got thousands of soldiers from larsa in his army he wont be able to just ignore them hell have to share some of his supplies with them but when shulgi gets here i dont want him finding anything he can use or seeing one stone standing atop another larsa will teach the sumerians a lesson they will remember for a long time terror as trella reminded him can be a useful weapon eskkar intended to use it to the fullest on larsa he studied his commanders faces none of them showed the slightest sympathy for larsa or its inhabitants too many raids over too many years most launched from and supported by larsa had long ago hardened the akkadians against the city and its rapacious rulers larsas raiders had terrorized akkadian lands now they would be repaid in full meanwhile weve accomplished two of our goals our army marched unscathed to larsa and we captured the city now weve plenty of time to destroy it by sunset tomorrow our men can rest in safety across the river then well resume the march heads nodded approval his commanders knew what to do and how best to accomplish their tasks i wonder how hathor is doing gatus voiced the question though he knew that no one knew anything about the akkadian cavalry eskkar had almost forgotten about the egyptian and his mission lets hope hes as lucky as weve been s urrounded by a dozen hawk clan guards eskkar spent the rest of the morning walking the city making sure the detachments of soldiers knew and understood what he wanted done his men started gathering the women and children and herding them toward the west gate that at least put a stop to the raping the akkadians had been in no mood for mercy the city had resisted them and its women were fair game eskkar couldnt have stopped the men even if hed wanted to and as a commander he knew better than to give foolish orders that couldnt be enforced by midmorning the last of the sobbing women and crying children were streaming across the countryside everyone had passed through the river gate soldiers searched them for jewels even making them open their mouths and examining their hair their clothing ripped from their bodies by force if necessary had to be checked as well as there had been enough time for jewels or coins to be sewn into the garments only then and as naked as the day they were born were the women children and elderly allowed to pass through the gate many still feared for their lives though eskkars commanders had told them again and again they would not be harmed once they left many wailed at their fate most of them had been raped some many times now they had to leave their husbands and family behind almost all of them headed south as eskkars soldiers had ordered them but a few ran to the north or east meanwhile alexar took charge of the citys destruction about nine hundred of the citys inhabitants remained none of them resisted as the akkadians greatly outnumbered them those who had tried to fight for their women or possessions had died during the night the survivors had no strength or will to continue a hopeless battle their wives and children were either safe in the countryside as promised or dead now they only worried about their own existence dividing the men into two groups alexar set five hundred of them to tearing down the houses starting with those of the wealthy merchants and tradesmen everything that could burn clothing furniture leather even baskets was collected and tossed onto the embers of last nights fires every clay pot was smashed fresh smoke broiled up into the sky anything of military value weapons or food went to the docks everything else went into the flames the houses made of the usual mud brick wouldnt burn but men wielding hammers chisels and any other tool that could be used to dislodge the bricks knocked them down thick logs were also used to smash down walls the soldiers worked their prisoners hard eskkars men learned that the people of larsa had celebrated with a feast when kanesh fell and every akkadian soon knew the story the remaining four hundred prisoners began emptying the city of anything edible all food grain wine ale livestock captured horses anything that could be eaten or useful to the akkadians were carried down to the river and ferried across boat load by boat load soon a mound of supplies began to arise on the western bank of the tigris when gatus and yavtar complained that they had more food than the akkadians could possibly eat alexar ordered the prisoners to start dumping the remaining food stocks into the river shulgi when he arrived would have to do something to prevent the starvation of the citys inhabitants but eskkar had no sympathy either for them or shulgi the destruction went on all day and by dusk only the citys gates remained intact and narans house was the only one still standing rubble from the houses around it stretched all the way to the courtyard walls and thick clouds of dust hung in the air drawn toward the flames or blown about by the evening breeze off the river when eskkar returned to narans house drakis and two men waited for him in the courtyard eskkar headed toward the well a thick coat of dust and dirt had accumulated on his tunic and it stank with the odors of burning wood and animal flesh taking his time he washed his body grond had found a clean garment somewhere suitable for eskkars stature so he kicked the old one aside and slipped the clean one over his frame inside the house the commonroom table was covered with platters of food and pitchers of wine and ale more than enough for eskkar and his commanders the food tempted him but eskkar wanted to get one last task over with with grond at his side he climbed the stairs followed by drakis and his companions and entered the room where naran and his women still awaited their fate now the once spotless chamber stank of urine and worse no one bothered to empty the chamber pots any wealth the room might have contained had disappeared as well curtains bedding garments and sandals had been tossed through the window and burned along with all the other goods from the house narans hoard of gold and precious stones had departed at midday by now well on its way to trellas vaults naran his swollen hands still bound lifted his eyes when eskkar entered he stopped two paces away and stared down at larsas king for a moment i wanted you to know your city is in ruins naran it will be many many years before anyone tries to build on this site again larsa will suffer the same fate that you plotted for akkad what are you going to do with me the former ruler of larsa looked haggard his hair hanging limp on his shoulders hed soiled himself probably more than once his hands shook and his lips quivered from fear the fate of his city meant nothing to him now only his own life do with you nothing but your wives and children are going to akkad theyll be slaves there for the rest of their lives unless anyone bothers to ransom them at least theyll be alive a gasp came from the women as they heard their fate but no one cried out they had emptied themselves of tears during the night what about me naran had to pause to get the words out youve taken all my gold theres nothing left here to pay a ransom but my sons might be able to raise enough eskkar ignored the words naran had two grown sons no doubt leading larsas contingent under shulgi instead eskkar glanced behind him to where drakis who had stopped just outside the chamber waited come in drakis and bring our friends i want them to meet naran king of larsa he turned to naran do you know these two men naran squinted at the two poorly dressed men who shuffled slowly into the room no ive never seen them this is dragan and his brother ibisin come closer naran cant hurt you now the two stepped forward one limping his hand on the others arm for support these men are the ones who risked their lives to lower ropes to my men without their help i might not have gotten inside larsa so easily i told them to help themselves to whatever they wanted from your gold but they said they wanted only one thing best you tell him dragan still leaning on his brothers arm dragan moved closer your men killed my family king naran one of your sons led the raid ten days ago i watched him leave the city he rode proudly to fight with king shulgis army but i will pray to the gods that king eskkar kills him in battle your men raped and killed my sisters murdered our parents blinded ibisin in one eye and wounded me in the leg so badly that to this day i cannot walk without pain they did all this to us for no reason we were farmers without any weapons we had done no harm to anyone when king eskkar asked me what i wanted i told him i wanted you so that i could take my revenge for my family narans eyes had widened in horror at dragans words and i told dragan he could have you naran eskkar added since i first came to akkad years ago ive heard many such tales how you sent your riders north across the sippar time after time to kill and loot those who placed themselves under my protection you should have surrendered your city yesterday when i gave you the chance i would have kept my word would have let you go but this is better your death will be a warning to the other kings of sumeria they will hear of larsas fall and your death at the hands of those you murdered they will learn to stay south of the river no please king eskkar please spare my life i have relatives in sumer they can pay too late for that naran eskkar called to the guards outside take the women to the docks give them to yavtar a boat will be leaving as soon as its dark the room erupted in screaming and wailing naran fell to the floor his hands outstretched his eyes wide with fright the waiting guards had already prepared ropes and they quickly bound the crying women and led them away when they were gone naran looked around at the empty room his eyes wide as if searching for his followers his possessions anything that might save him he lifted his head tears streaming down his face and held up his bound hands piteously mercy king eskkar i plead for my life i can raise more gold i will pay whatever ransom you wish eskkar didnt bother to reply he turned to the brothers hes yours dragan ibisin but you must not take too long yavtars boat will be leaving soon and you must be at the docks so you can return to akkad dragan shrugged off his brothers arm it will not take long he drew his knife from his belt come ibisin you may strike first holding onto his brothers arm they stepped forward together as eskkar left the chamber the first scream erupted behind him he touched drakiss arm stay with them when theyre finished make sure naran is dead and bring me his head then give dragan and his brother two sacks of gold and get them to the boat outside the sun was touching the western horizon a hundred prisoners sat on the ground in the fading light awaiting the command to destroy narans house exhaustion and despair covered every face and they barely raised their eyes at the sight of the akkadian king an equal number of soldiers guarded them there are three men still inside as soon as they come out destroy the compound leave nothing standing and burn everything he saw the two large pots of oil that the prisoners had prepared eskkar gazed about him in satisfaction naran and his fine house would soon be turned into rubble like the rest of larsa now it was time to go he strode through the compounds gate after a short walk through the debris that filled the lane he reached the main gate fifty of alexars men waited there guarding about a hundred slaves tear down the gates feed them to the fire with his guards eskkar walked one last time through the ruined city trying to ignore the stench of death and dust that lingered everywhere the docks were a frenzied scene of chaos and confusion slaves were busy tearing them apart piling the wood up for yet one more gigantic bonfire the last pots of oil in larsa would feed those flames eskkar watched the final preparations most of his men had already crossed the river and by now were busy setting up camp with a loud snapping sound the river gates came crashing down and men with axes broke the logs apart hewing through the ropes and staves that held the logs together soon those logs were added to the growing piles of what remained of the dock and flames again leaped and twisted high into the sky one of drakiss men arrived escorting dragan and ibisin their hands were clean no doubt washed in narans well but blood still clung to their clothing they would travel north on the same boat that held narans women with all the gold eskkar had given them theyd never have to work again when you reach akkad eskkar said tell trella everything that happened she will make sure you are taken care of he wasnt sure that dragan even heard him but the brothers climbed into the boat each clutching a sack to their body theyd help row the craft upriver and that would take their minds off the horror they had left behind from within the city fresh flames climbed into the darkening sky and eskkar knew the two other gates had been set afire two hundred slaves who had helped destroy the last of larsa were marched up and the final embarkation began eskkar planned to bring them across the river boats were waiting for them and soon prisoners and their guards were ferrying across the darkening water the rest of the prisoners were abandoned left to fend for themselves as best they could among the wreckage of the city with grond eskkar boarded the last boat they put off from the dock but a rope held them a few paces from the riverbank he watched his men tear up the remaining dock then saturate everything with the oil they scrambled through the water and the last man tossed a torch onto the dock it erupted in flame a wave of fire sweeping back to the inferno that had marked the remains of the gate the man swam to the ship and waiting hands pulled him aboard the captain gave the order the rope was slipped from its fastening and hauled aboard the boat swung with the current for a moment then the men worked the oars and the vessel began its journey across the tigris eskkar remained in the stern facing the gathering dusk and watching larsa burn this was war war the way barbarians waged it devastation destruction and terror larsa would likely never be rebuilt and when men sailed the river or led caravans past the ruins they would tell the tale of the citys destruction as a penalty for bringing war to akkads lands he hoped the lesson would linger for a hundred years but eskkar knew how quickly men can forget nevertheless when shulgi arrived he would find nothing useful not even a roof to cover his head meanwhile thousands of people roamed the land begging for something to eat all the crops in the nearby fields had been burned no food weapons supplies of any kind remained in the ruins the dead hundreds of bodies had been dumped in the citys wells they would poison the water for months maybe longer the citys gold and valuables would travel to akkad trella would sell them to help pay for the war larsa had ceased to exist no one would organize raids to the north from this place again eskkar nodded in satisfaction and turned to the west tomorrow would be the sixth day and then there would be only six more days remaining to defeat shulgis army until today he hadnt spared much thought for hathor he wondered how his horse commander was faring everything would now depend on him day shulgi razrek vanar and the rest of sumers commanders rode up to what was left of larsas wall two hundred horsemen following behind and another hundred leading the way all of them alert for any possibility of an ambush the sun drifted down toward the horizon in the west but shulgi wanted to see the damage for himself before it grew dark the rest of his army remained half a days march behind and wouldnt arrive at larsa until midday tomorrow a rage burned in shulgis chest at the sight of larsas devastation the stench of death mixed with the acrid smell of burnt wood uncountable flies buzzed about feasting on the rotting flesh of men and animals shulgi wanted to rail at razrek once again but he had already done that bitterly accusing the cavalry commander of cowardice and of failing to defend larsa the two had nearly come to blows and shulgi knew he couldnt afford that luxury yet he still needed razrek and his horsemen theyre still across the river razrek remarked breaking the silence that lasted far too long shulgi didnt answer but he lifted his eyes from the smoking ruins on the other side of the tigris part of the akkadian camp showed atop the bluff no death odors up there only clean breezes blowing off the river at the base more than a dozen boats lined the west bank the camp looked peaceful no ranks of warriors no line of sentries stared at the riders approaching larsa the akkadians didnt care about shulgis army at least not today all the sumerians understood the humiliating situation king shulgis men had no way to cross the river larsa had always boasted the easiest crossing for miles in either direction thats why the city had sprung up here to take advantage of the easy crossing but while its current might flow slowly the tigris remained too wide and deep for horses or men to swim across boats and rafts would be needed to get the soldiers and supplies across and any crossing would be vulnerable to attack until enough soldiers were established on the far side i can ride north razreks voice seemed loud in the stillness that hung over shulgis commanders theres a village ten or twelve miles from here where we can get some horsemen over no well cross here shulgi had already made his decision have the men scour the countryside well build the rafts just above larsa why cross the river at all we can reach sumer just as quickly from this side of the river if we want to close with eskkar we need to cross here the akkadians will stop us from those bluffs they could pour arrows down on us they wont be here to stop us shulgi said they havent bothered to establish outposts or watchtowers i think theyll soon be on the march once again tomorrow or the next day heading to sumer shulgis advance force had encountered dozens of naked survivors most of them women and children and all of them exhausted hungry and full of despair the akkadians had driven them out of the city with nothing and the dazed inhabitants had begged shulgis men for food and water eskkars men had poisoned every well with dead bodies man and beast that now rotted in the warm water shulgi understood the trap eskkar had set for him if he ignored the wretched survivors left them to starve his troops would begin muttering against him if he ordered his men to share their own meager food with them his soldiers would be forced to do with less and his entire army would be slowed down in the process gritting his teeth shulgi acceded to the need to share his supplies almost all who had survived the citys fall repeated that the akkadians planned to march on sumer shulgi wasnt so sure the further south eskkar went the greater the danger to the akkadians increased even if he reached sumer the city wasnt likely to fall overnight like larsa shulgi had already dispatched a company of horsemen to warn kushanna that the akkadian army might be on the march toward them and to take extra precautions and with every step farther southward the akkadian supply line would be stretched thinner and thinner shulgi already had men working to stop the infernal boats that carried men and supplies to eskkars forces none of these thoughts gave shulgi any satisfaction he had to cross the river somewhere and the easiest route to eskkars army lay across the river if shulgi moved to some other crossing he would waste another day marching and still have to find or build boats better to do it here where the abandoned men of larsa could at least provide a labor force razrek set up the camp over there away from the stink of larsa the horses sensed the odor of death too and pawed the ground nervously unwilling to move closer to its source the gagging smell would last for days perhaps longer as soon as the camp is started send riders up and down the river looking for boats wood ropes anything we can use to build rafts he turned his horse away and trotted back to where he ordered his command tent erected for once the servants and soldiers doing his bidding had nothing to say everyone avoided his gaze shulgi handed off his horse and sat crosslegged just outside the tent flap he spread a map out before him and stared at its symbols he hadnt moved when razrek returned ive sent fifty horsemen up and down the river searching for boats razrek squatted down across the map from shulgi we should be able to start crossing as soon as the army arrives that is if eskkars men are gone though i still think its a waste of time to cross if were going back to sumer shulgi lifted his gaze from the map eskkar has no intention of marching to sumer hes going to isin he wants us to dash off toward sumer to give him more time to take the city razrek glanced at the map why isin why not sumer its not that much further have you wondered where eskkars cavalry is not lately razrek shrugged no one has seen any sign of them as long as theyre not a threat who cares where theyve gone shulgi bit off the cutting reply razrek had his uses but strategy wasnt one of them eskkar cares i think hes sent them out into the desert theyve ridden north circled around lagash and are probably attacking nippur right now unless theyre headed to uruk uruk theyd have to ride halfway across the desert and the tanukhs still have plenty of men there to stop them and they wouldnt have any supplies unless there were more of those cursed boats coming down the euphrates to resupply them theres no way not by boat lagash sits on the euphrates if that many boats tried to run past them wed have heard about it these maps dont show every stream and creek in sumeria and the euphrates has more than one branch going south i spoke with several men from lagash they say theres a goodsized stream that bypasses lagash before running down to uruk even if eskkars horsemen did reach uruk they would never be able to take the city they have no archers theres not enough of them to force an attack true unless they rode in from the west unexpectedly and stormed the city at night or if eskkar has more agents in uruk to open the gates for him larsa fell almost as soon as he arrived remember that that citys survivors had related the story of men climbing unhindered over the wall razrek licked his lips the less he heard about larsa the better we should send a warning to uruk and nippur and lagash too let them know its too late for that shulgi shook his head i should have thought of this earlier the akkadian cavalry rode off six days ago it would take us three days to get a rider to lagash and at least two to reach uruk from here probably two and a half days there are two wide rivers to cross remember if eskkars cavalry is going to lagash theyre already there if theyre going to uruk theyll be there the day after tomorrow theyll be spotted lagash will send word down the river to warn the other cities unless eskkars horsemen ride deeper into the desert this hathor that commands them they say he came to akkad across that very desert that he knows much about desert fighting and the tanukhs would be caught offguard with the salibs destroyed they have no enemies to raid them razrek grimaced hathor is a renegade egyptian who begged for his life and was saved from the torture by eskkars witchwife no one knows why but even if hathor knows the desert it still makes for hard traveling he would need supplies hay for the horses food for his men all of which could have been prepared and stored months ago or theres an even easier way the villages of the tanukhs have plenty of food and fodder in them especially now even razrek knew enough to glance around to make sure no tanukhs could hear the conversation the tanukh horsemen made up almost a third of razreks cavalry they retained their own leaders and fought only for gold and the chance to loot their enemies razrek had unleashed them on the akkadian farmlands but they somehow managed to devastate and pillage almost as many sumerian farmers in the process brutal and cunning they were like jackals they struck only when their enemy appeared weak and stole anything and everything they could get their hands on against a strong enemy they were as likely to turn and run if the tanukhs think that akkad has horsemen raiding their lands razrek said theyll race home as fast as they can ride it might almost be worth it for all the trouble theyve caused the tanukhs had created more problems for razrek and the rest of the sumerian army than any other group everyone hated them they had only joined the sumerian cause because of shulgis gold and the promise of more loot from akkad when the city fell if they left they would keep eskkars cavalry off our backs shulgi shook his head even if they stayed together the tanukhs wouldnt number much more than the akkadians theyd never face eskkars horsemen in battle hathor would ride right through them if they tried to stop him no better to keep them here where they can be useful well what are we going to do were not going to tell anyone about our suspicions of where eskkars cavalry might be were going to need every horseman we have even the tanukhs when we come to grips with the akkadians you think eskkar will stand and fight when hes ready hell attack us he intends to wear us down weaken us by marching up and down sumeria wait until our supplies are low then hell attack razrek wasnt convinced you think eskkar has planned all this out in advance it would have taken days months yes i think he has the barbarian or perhaps his witchwife trella has prepared for this war for at least a year maybe longer we thought we had given him only two choices to march south and fight us at kanesh or wait for us to come to akkad instead hes devised another way and unless we start outthinking him eskkar may end up nailing our hides to akkads gate but he doesnt have enough men razrek protested hell never face us in battle i underestimated eskkar once shulgi said and now larsa is gone along with most of our supplies im not doing it again were going to make him fight us when were ready how will we do that hes already proven he can outmarch our men and we dont have enough horsemen to stop his army first we have to make sure isin holds if he captures that city he can march in any direction south toward sumer or north to lagash and nippur whichever way we march hell move in the opposite direction isins been warned eskkar wont be able to take it not before we can reach him naxos is not some merchant who can be brushed aside like naran im telling you eskkar already has a plan to take the city just like he did at larsa the best way to stop him is to send all the soldiers and horsemen from isin back to their city weve got three thousand men from isin in our ranks and a third of them are cavalry send as many as you can get on horseback at once they should be able to reach the city before eskkars foot soldiers get there and if they cant if they arrive too late tell them to ride the horses to death whatever it takes to save their city send any horsemen from larsa too theyll understand what losing isin means meanwhile im going to stop these boats that have been resupplying eskkars forces without them he cant move as fast or as far if isin can hold out for a few days well catch up with him and crush him there what about our own supplies the mountain of supplies that had been laboriously transported to kanesh now languished there shulgi knew it would take more than a few days to get even a portion of those goods moving south again ive already sent word to sumer theyll load every boat they can find and send it upriver to isin your horsemen will have to make sure that we get those supplies not the akkadians and you can do that while you find and finish the akkadian cavalry when theyre finished with lagash or more likely uruk theyll head east to rejoin eskkar once theyre reunited thats when theyll be ready for the final battle and if youre wrong if eskkar marches toward sumer then sumer will have to hold out but even if it falls the barbarian will have no way to escape you dont care about your own city shulgi the city can always be rebuilt razrek if eskkar is dead and his army smashed we can take akkad at our leisure and win the war a few cities lost along the way are a small price to build an empire now get moving and get those men on their way to isin by tomorrow i want them well on their way day well after dawn eskkar and grond rode to the top of the bluff overlooking the tigris across the river lay the ruins of what had been larsa where a few fires still smoldered and sent wisps of smoke into the air the advance elements of shulgis army had arrived yesterday afternoon and established a camp just beyond the ruined walls before long scouting parties rode north and south no doubt looking for anything they could use to get men across the river today would see the rest of the sumerians march into view shulgi must have decided to cross here which meant he wouldnt waste any time going north toward akkad or south to defend sumer eskkar hadnt expected that and frowned at the implications hes going to stick to our heels well you couldnt expect shulgi to keep making mistakes sooner or later he had to do something right the sumerian king had lost the tactical advantage twice once when he let the akkadians slip past him at kanesh and again when he let hathors cavalry ride off uncontested perhaps even a third time when he wasted razreks horsemen trying to save larsa i almost wish we had the means to send a raiding party back across the water with some luck they might catch shulgi off guard his death would go a long way to ending the war no doubt shulgi has the same ideas about you neither force could cross the river for now shortly after the sumerians were sighted the boats that had ferried the akkadians across the river were dragged onto the riverbank broken up and burned without boats neither side could harm the other instead the tired sumerian cavalry would now have to search up and down the river looking for boats or anything else that would float to help them ferry their soldiers across meanwhile eskkars soldiers rested in their camp while he and grond stared across the tigris watching the weary enemy straggle into camp the sumerians arrived in ragged groups the result of their rush to larsa which had spread their force as the bettertrained and conditioned elements moved faster than those slower of foot nevertheless the entire sumerian army would be at larsa by midday joining with those who had ridden in yesterday eskkar watched as the enemy soldiers no doubt as soon as their commanders dismissed them moved toward the river to get a better view of the ruins of the city he remembered a saying of his clan a sword can cut two ways according to trellas spies the sumerians had begun this war with high spirits eager for conquest and glory now those same soldiers had learned a grim lesson war had come to their land and struck down their own kind as mercilessly as they had killed the farmers and villagers living along the akkadian border even more important shulgi and his commanders had learned that same lesson the sumerians had captured a few outposts and destroyed crops outposts could be rebuilt and new seeds planted meanwhile eskkar had overwhelmed and destroyed one of their cities that loss would not be replaced easily as new supply lines and depots would have to be established a lengthy and laborious process eskkar had ridden to the bluff so that the enemy could see him just out of reach of shulgis vast army some of the sumerians would be angry and eager to strike a blow in revenge but others would be worrying about losing their own lives or their own city when men ride to war the sword indeed can cut two ways they dont look very happy grond remarked the sumerians had noticed the little party of akkadians watching them from the bluffs a distant muttering of angry voices floated across the river and eskkar saw men jumping up and down in anger unable to control their rage at the akkadians who had burned their city voices couldnt carry over such a distance but a few began to bang their swords against their shields unable to do anything more many of those soldiers are from larsa eskkar said theyre wondering what happened to their families their wives whether they are alive or dead some will go off looking for their kin i expect shulgi wont allow that none of them dare come closer to the ruins if he lets even one of larsas soldiers depart theyll all desert and we just stay here all day our men need to rest and we might as well do it here as anywhere besides this way we can use up most of the food we took from larsa it will be that much less to carry shulgis soldiers will be tightening their belts tonight theyll find little to eat but what they carried with them and you think shulgi will cross here and follow us to isin if not here then somewhere nearby he must know where we intend to go by now i just hope he hasnt figured out where hathor has gone even if shulgi does hathor will be fine he knows grond moved his eyes to the north theres a boat coming down the river eskkar gazed up the expanse of the tigris lined on both sides with small trees and rushes the height of the bluff about a hundred paces provided a good vantage point a faint blur of white showed a ship under sail taking advantage of a favorable breeze to race down the waterway were not expecting any more of yavtars ships it could be sumerian the last of the river craft had set out yesterday for akkad no more boats would be linking up with eskkars army until he reached his next destination i dont think thats its moving too fast to be sumerian grond said it must be one of yavtars messenger boats built for speed the small but trim craft carried a taller sail and more than enough rowers to race a boat up or downriver by now eskkars eyes picked up more detail definitely a messenger boat piloted by a fearless master to sail his craft right toward the heart of the sumerian army lets get down to the water before shulgi finds some way to sink the boat they wheeled their horses around and cantered away from the edge of the bluff it took a few moments to reach the bottom they rode along the back of the hill until they reached the opening that led to what had been the western side docks for the city of larsa when they reached the waters edge they found themselves joining a growing crowd of akkadian soldiers other eyes had spotted the boat and come to the same conclusion every man in the army wanted to know what news it carried eskkar didnt have to wait long the boat moved towards them six rowers on each side propelling the craft through the calm waters when the ship drew closer the sail came down eskkar saw the oarsmen slow their strokes and lean back letting the steersman guide the vessel through the currents a man stood in the prow of the boat its draelin someone with keen eyes recognized one of daros subcommanders a moment later the craft hissed onto the sandy riverbank before it stopped moving draelin leapt off the bow and splashed his way through the mud ignoring those soldiers helping pull the boat up on the shore instead he headed straight for the king eskkar swung down from his horse just as draelin arrived whatever news the soldier carried it couldnt be bad not with a grin that broad on his face lord eskkar draelin began but words failed him he threw his arms around eskkar and hugged him tight some of the soldiers standing around laughed at the sight before eskkar could react draelin pushed away lord eskkar i bring you a powerful voice from one of the boat crew spoiled whatever speech draelin had prepared we won we defeated the barbarians and drove them from the walls the words echoed off the cliff and out over the river in a heartbeat the soldiers broke out in a cheer by now more akkadians had wandered down to the river they took up the cry everyone shouting and pounding their companions on the back we won akkad is safe the city is safe like a raging hillside fire the word swept through the camp soldiers ceased whatever task occupied them and rushed to the rivers edge in moments every akkadian fighter joined in the celebration the cheers and cries of five thousand voices swelled and soared over the river a jubilation of pure joy mixed with relief since leaving kanesh six days ago the men of akkad had worried about the dangers facing their city by unspoken agreement no one had said anything about the threat to their family and friends left behind but every man had struggled to keep the dark thoughts from his lips across the river the sumerians clenched their fists in rage theyd seen the ship come sailing down the tigris unafraid of their vast army the enemy knew of the other ships that plied the river with the same impunity carrying food and supplies to eskkars army and the sumerians knew that only some great victory would have occasioned such an outburst and that whatever good fortune cheered the akkadians would bring only anger and gloom to their own cause and hearts by now eskkar had regained his composure men from the boat had jumped ashore each one shouting news about the attack draelin couldnt be heard above the din so eskkar swung back up on his horse then leaned down and grabbed draelin by the arm with one powerful swing eskkar pulled the messenger up behind him a touch of eskkars heels sent the horse in motion clearing a way through the still growing crowd of happy soldiers with grond following eskkar finally broke free of the soldiers he guided the horse back up the bluff leaving the thousands of milling soldiers still celebrating beneath them when he eased the horse to a stop the cheering had started to die down at least we can talk up here eskkar said as draelin slid down from the horse eskkar followed and with grond accompanying them they moved to the edge of the bluff where they could see the camps of the sumerians now tell me what happened draelins smile had returned he told the story of trellas victory how she had unearthed the plot and lured the alur meriki into the city where the archers had riddled them with arrows in the morning we counted over seventy dead and wounded that included another dozen cut down in the ditch as they fled horsemen from bisitun arrived and even though they were outnumbered they chased after the fleeing barbarians and killed a few more the alur meriki didnt even stop to attack or loot the outlying farms by then they had no stomach for facing our fighters as draelins story unfolded eskkar felt a vast weight ease from his shoulders like his men he had refused to think about akkad and the danger to trella now that burden could be set aside with shulgis army here instead of ravaging akkads lands and storming its walls trella and little sargon would be safe the countryside and the allimportant crops would be protected and no matter what happened to eskkar it would be many months before sumer could mount another assault on the northern lands another emotion grew in his breast the sumerians had made a pact with their hated enemy the common enemy of all city and villagedwellers shulgi sought to unleash the fury of the alur meriki eskkar determined to turn that same fury against the sumerians he made draelin tell the story again and again each time dragging a bit more information from the messenger at last he could think of no more details to add lady trella asked me to give you this message she said to tell you that the city is safe and wellstocked with provisions another cargo of silver just arrived from nuzi and all the soldiers received their pay she wished you good fortune in your attack on larsa by now the boats that had departed after the capture of larsa would have carried word of the citys destruction to the north youll stay the night with us draelin eskkar said theres enough wine to celebrate trellas victory draelin stared at the ruins across the river i stopped in larsa only a few months ago people spat at me in the lanes when they heard i was from akkad he shook his head its hard to believe its all gone now they brought it on themselves grond said now i think we should take advantage of the wine before the men drink it all ill drink a cup to your victory lord eskkar but as soon as darkness falls well push off for akkad shulgi is positioning men all along the river to stop our boats its best to get as far north under cover of darkness as possible with so many crewmen the little craft could row all night even against the current then a good journey to you draelin eskkar said and tell trella that well be home soon yes only a few more battles to go grond added he took one last look at the vast sumerian army camped across the river and shook his head the great western desert hathor hated the desert had always hated it even when he lived in egypt where the desert sands lapped ever closer as one moved away from the nile growing up along the mighty rivers banks hathor never experienced the cruel heat and burning sands of the desert until his fifteenth season when his parents were killed to fill his belly and seek revenge against their murderers he joined korthacs marauders and fought against korthacs enemies for the next nineteen years in time he became a feared and powerful subcommander most of those years he lived on the border of what the egyptians called the eastern desert cursing the fate that brought him there the akkadians called it the great western desert but it remained the same sand dust and searing rocks that spread from the land between the rivers almost to egypts border but korthac despite his cunning had lost his great battle to seize control of all egypt his army almost completely destroyed and his enemies burning with a desire for revenge closing in on him korthac and a few surviving followers fled into the great desert for months korthac led the remnants of his men through this dry and useless land watching them die one by one the living feeding on the bodies of those too weak to defend themselves the survivors had crawled out of the desert just in time to avoid dying of thirst hathor still remembered lying on his stomach his face buried in a muddy irrigation ditch drinking the sweetest water hed ever tasted in his life now once again hathor found himself challenging the hot sands he might well end up dead on this journey but at least this time it wouldnt be the desert that killed him death would more likely come from a tanukh arrow or sumerian spear but despite his distaste for these barren and arid lands no man in akkad knew more about fighting in this environment than he did so hathor had volunteered to lead the cavalry with klexor and seven hundred and fifty horsemen hathor had ridden north after separating from eskkar and bypassing kanesh taking a littleused trail that bypassed most villages that day they covered almost forty miles and reached the first of their supply points yavtars bobbing boats waited for hathors arrival riding low in the water with extra food for the men and grain for the horses another thirty horses waited there as well guarded by a dozen akkadians who had herded them across the river and down to meet the cavalry the spare mounts all of them battle trained would carry food and weapons but their main function would be as reserves for any animals lost on the long journey before them akkads defenders would sorely miss the mounts the decision to send them to hathor would weaken the city and only trellas resolve and support had overridden bantors objections a few more mounted riders wont save the city trella said but they may make the difference between hathors success or failure he wished the men who delivered the mounts could accompany him but they needed to return to akkad as quickly as possible the city would be in danger and craved every man who could swing a sword in its defense eskkars war plan had much that could go wrong and not least was the possibility that akkad might fall while her army struggled in the south hathor had observed korthac take many a desperate gamble but never one such as this that required so much from so many the blessings of the gods or eskkars famous luck would be stretched to the limit with hathors horses and men resupplied his cavalry started their journey at dawn the next morning this time he led the way northwest they had to get far enough away from anyone who might report a large body of horsemen moving toward the desert or the vicinity of lagash if king shulgi learned of their position or even their general direction it wouldnt be difficult to guess their destination once that happened the warning would flash down the rivers and akkads enemies would be alerted to a new danger all those worries mattered little now hathor and his force were as committed as eskkars own if the akkadian cavalry reached their destination and found a wellarmed and wellprepared foe waiting for them they would just have to deal with the situation as best they could attack if possible or extricate themselves from whatever trap the enemy might have set that day passed without incident the following day just before sunset the akkadian cavalry splashed across the euphrates river two hundred miles north of lagash their course however continued westward as they needed to swing wide of the city so as to avoid detection every horse and pack animal now labored under the need to carry extra water wells and streams would grow fewer and smaller as they rode west and those sources of water would likely be in camps or villages settled by tanukh or the few salib survivors that had escaped king shulgis wrath as the sun rose and set hathor grunted with satisfaction at his mens progress the rare travelers they did encounter fled at first sight and never came close enough to identify hathors men as akkadians in this part of the countryside any larger band of horsemen would more likely be either barbarians from the north or desertdwellers at least eskkar had assured him that was the likely assumption now it became hathors fervent hope and he muttered a prayer for protection to the egyptian gods he no longer believed in and who if they even existed likely had no power this far from the nile each morning they rose before dawn gulped down a mouthful or two of stale bread watered the horses and continued their journey they rode hard but always with an eye to caring for their mounts hathor couldnt afford to exhaust his valuable and welltrained animals whenever and wherever this journey ended the horses would need all their strength for whatever fighting awaited them another day passed without incident and he decided that his cavalry had slipped past lagash without encountering any of its patrols a good omen late in the afternoon on the third day hathor lay on his belly and looked down into a vast desert basin where he saw the first tanukh village a drearylooking place named margan at this distance he couldnt make out individual tents but saw many had fires already lit in preparation for the evening meal hathor took his time counting and guessed that a hundred or so tents comprised margan more than hed expected this far north three rope corrals held about the same number of horses he saw few warriors though an encampment that size should have at least three hundred men of fighting age maybe more no doubt many of these tanukhs had flocked to shulgis army drawn by the promise of gold and the chance to loot the lands of akkad klexor and fashod lay on hathors left and muta once a farmer whose family lived just west of the euphrates crouched on his right how many warriors able to fight remain not much more than a hundred muta said probably less than a hundred and fifty and many will be boys and old men hathor took one last look at the camp ive seen enough he glanced up at the sun weve just enough time before sunset lets go he pushed himself backwards from the crest of the hill then led the way down to where the rest of the men waited tending to their horses and weapons squatting down hathor used his knife to draw a crude map in the dirt while his subcommanders crowded around to learn what they would face it didnt take long to give the few orders needed they had trained for such an attack before and mutas knowledge of the land had prepared them for this moment even before they started out from akkad remember we must make sure none escape hathor looked at each of his subcommanders in turn if any do get away it must be to the west into the desert this village is only two days ride from lagash and word of our presence must not reach them until we are well to the south klexor commanding a third of the cavalry led his men out first they would swing to the south and make sure no one fled eastward toward lagash muta took another third and led them to the west deeper into the desert when both his subcommanders were in position hathor would start the attack from the north and the akkadians would strike from three directions with any luck they would trap all the tanukhs between them as soon as his commanders departed hathor returned to the crest of the hill to study the camp nothing had changed and if the tanukhs had patrols guarding the village they had all returned for the night from so far away he couldnt detect any sentries but the village would surely have a few in place when he saw that klexor and muta had nearly reached their positions hathor descended the hilltop and gave the order to advance in moments he and his men rode up and over the top of the low hill that had concealed them they moved at a steady trot the usual pace for desert horsemen trying to conserve their mounts and one that kept their dust trail low to the earth they rode in no particular order just a straggling column of riders that took some doing as both the men and horses tended to want to form the usual column that they had trained for over the last year or two so the leaders of ten and twenty kept up a constant stream of orders mixed with a good amount of curses at men who either couldnt or forgot to control their mounts hathor hoped anyone noticing them would think for a few precious moments that they were a band of returning tanukh horsemen the twenty two ur nammu warriors under fashod rode in the rear where their different clothing and weapons might alert the villagers the ur nammu all rode powerful mounts the best in hathors force and could run down almost any horse and rider the akkadians covered nearly half the distance before they were detected and managed another few hundred paces before those in the camp heard and understood the alarm hathor didnt bother giving an order as soon as he saw men scrambling about he touched his horses flanks with his heels and the big stallion jumped into a gallop in moments nearly three hundred men thundered in a wild charge at the tanukh camp a large cloud of dust erupting up into the air behind them the ur nammu warriors at last free of the restriction that kept them in the rear pounded past hathor angling their horses to the right their frightening war cries rose above the pounding of the horses hooves they would ride around or through the edge of the village to prevent any from escaping to the west and south by now hathor could see the confusion and panic in the camp women fled in all directions some men struggled to string bows others readied their weapons while most rushed to get to their horses but the tanukhs had no time to prepare a defense as soon as they saw the great number of the approaching horsemen most abandoned any hope of resistance and tried to flee by then it was much too late the akkadians greatly outnumbered the tanukhs hathors men launched their first flight of arrow as soon as they were in range about two hundred paces two more flights followed before the akkadian cavalry tore past the first tent any resistance had vanished men fled abandoning their wives and children desperate to reach their horses and escape but muta and klexors forces arrived right after hathors slamming into the village from either side and sealing the villages fate pulling hard on the halter hathor slowed his horse near the center of the village his eyes searching for any resistance the trap had been well sprung and all he saw was death and slaughter his men most of whom had felt the wrath of the tanukhs or knew of those who had now offered no mercy to the desertdwellers they had raided and pillaged akkadian lands for too many years and now they would be repaid for that blood debt every one of the tanukhs died in the assault men women children the young the old all were killed the akkadians had thoughts only of vengeance for the savage attacks on kanesh and the border outposts even before the fighting ended the women were shoved to the ground and raped most more than once then they too were slain hathor watched it all without showing any emotion they all had to die so that none remained who could give warning of the akkadian presence better a thousand tanukh deaths than the loss of a single one of his own force the same brutal tactics used by the tanukhs would be turned on them only with even more ruthless efficiency terror indeed was a twoedged sword when the screams ended and the blood stopped flowing the task of rounding up the tanukh horses started other men emptied the tents of grain food or anything of value and the herd animals were butchered to provide fresh meat for the akkadians they rinsed and refilled their water skins from the well then the destruction began his men torn down every tent and piled them together along with everything else that would burn as the flames took hold throughout the camp hathor gave orders to dump all the dead bodies both men and animals into the well a horrifying symbol for any desertdweller he intended to make sure the water source would be poisoned for many months so that the tanukhs could not return and reestablish the village akkad wanted no more raids originating from this part of the desert survivors if any remained hiding in the sand must be left to die from thirst and hunger the akkadians would have no need to return this way they would live or die along another route out of the desert hathor had delivered eskkar and trellas first message of terror to the tanukhs those who ride to war against akkad and its people will be destroyed h athor established his night camp five hundred paces from the still smoldering village his men grinning and laughing at their easy victory today ate well and the horses had plenty of grain margans fires burned and smoked with the stench of death long into the night as hathor knew they would hed waged this kind of war before and that knowledge ensured that the devastation would be complete soon word of margans destruction would spread and fear and apprehension would travel across the desert in akkad lady trellas comprehension of the use of terror had surprised hathor she understood in some ways even better than her husband how such a massive raid would keep the tanukhs in check for many years always eager for knowledge trella had spoken to hathor many times about his days with korthac and his brutal ways terror she explained once to answer his question was merely another way to defend akkad and keep its enemies offbalance both our friends and enemies must know that it will not be used first she declared but if provoked then terror would be employed to punish akkads attackers tanukh raids into akkadian lands must stop once and for all in hathors eyes lady trella was more than just a keen mind as he soon discovered she also understood the many ways to use power the first six months had been difficult for hathor first his wounds had taken longer to heal than expected when he grew strong enough to hobble about he encountered many akkadians who had suffered from korthacs short rule and now only hathor remained alive to remind them of those unhappy days but gradually the rancor had faded as eskkar trusted hathor with more and more responsibilities the populace started to change their minds about the dour egyptian about that time trella had summoned him to meet her when hathor arrived he found her speaking with another woman cnari who not long before had lost her husband of eight years now in her early twenties cnari stood tall and slim as a willow with fine features long brown hair and the slightly darker skin that like lady trella marked her as being born in the lands of sumeria trella introduced them then found a reason to leave the chamber cnari appeared nervous and hathor realized this was no chance encounter that trella must have prepared cnari for his arrival for his part he spoke haltingly afraid to say much and certain that his appearance and grim visage would frighten any akkadian woman later he learned that trella had softened that initial impression by relating to cnari the story of how trella first met eskkar and the fear and doubts she had experienced that night trella didnt return to her chamber for some time and hathor and cnari spoke awkwardly about meaningless things when trella rejoined them cnari took her leave but before she departed she favored hathor with a brief smile that enhanced her fine features he stared at the doorway aware for the first time of the scent cnari used still lingering in the air what do you think of cnari trellas words brought hathor out of his reverie she is a good woman but she needs a strong man to protect her and its not fit that one of eskkars commanders does not have a woman of his own i can think of no better man in akkad for her than you hathor had not had a woman of his own for almost two years since he left his family in egypt to fight with korthac he hadnt thought of them in months and felt no particular sense of loss at their absence here in akkad the women turned their eyes from him remembering the horror korthac had brought to the city cnari is too beautiful lady trella for a man like me all the men of akkad will want her and that has frightened her she has no family of her own no children no one to guide her so she came to me for protection and help in finding a new husband trella had arranged dozens of marriages in the last few years her skill at matching men and women had proved as good as everything else she undertook and men as well as women often sought her guidance you honor me lady trella but i am not sure she needs a man with more skills than a mere soldier perhaps you should ask eskkar about that trella said with a smile for now cnari is living downstairs if you wish call on her speak to her listen to her if you find she is not to your choosing i will try to find you another there are many women in akkad who would now look with favor on you hathor doubted the truth of that statement trella said nothing more about the matter and when hathor departed he decided to avoid cnari but at eskkars table that evening chance seated cnari beside him they began to talk and soon were ignoring the rest of the guests the next evening after he completed his duties hathor took a long swim in the river then he called on her and they sat in trellas garden at the back of the house talking long into the night just as much as the day trella spared his life that evening changed his fortune once again when hathor returned to his quarters all he could think about was cnari her hair her eyes the hand she placed on his arm for a fleeting moment while they spoke a few days later they went to lady trella and asked to be wed in the temple of ishtar that had been over a year ago and now she had become part of his life she had clung to him the morning the army marched to war tears streaming down her cheeks and he could scarcely free himself from her grasp no woman had ever cried over him before and to his surprise hathor had had to bite back his own tears cnari was heavy with her first child would probably give birth while he was fighting in sumeria but for the gift of cnaris love that trella had given him to both of them hathor would fight a dozen battles for her and lord eskkar tonight he put aside his thoughts of cnari and the child that was to come no matter what happened he would have a son to carry on his line or at least a daughter to hold his memory now was the time to make war to destroy akkads enemies and to ensure that no danger ever threatened either trella or cnari and her child again in the morning hathor mounted and led the men south they left the smoking remains of margan behind them fit only for the flies and scavengers already boldly foraging for food among its dead two days later hathor and his men swept down on the next tanukh village in their path they had ridden hard pushing the horses as much as they dared and hoping to outrun any news of their approach tibra the next tanukh encampment was much larger than margan situated beside a fairsized oasis bordered with willow and palm trees over two hundred tents ringed the glistening greenencircled waterhole tibra also boasted several fields irrigated by channels dug out of the sand slaves had done the digging hathor knew from hearing mutas tales such labor was beneath a tanukhs dignity the camp lay in the center of a wide basin with no way to draw near without being seen this is the village where i was enslaved mutas harsh words sounded different from his usual tone my brother died here then today you will take your revenge for your brother hathor gave the order to advance the akkadians formed a wide line of riders and cantered toward the tanukh village his men readying their weapons just dont get yourself killed taking your revenge hathor shouted over the drumming hooves to muta we need you alive mutas parents had been killed and he and his brother taken as slaves brutalized and beaten almost every day for five years he and the other slaves had carried supplies from one tanukh village to another mere beasts of burden treated worse than the weakest pack animal by the evergrasping tanukh traders his brother had died under the overseers lash after falling sick from hunger and exhaustion the desert had as little pity on the slaves as did their tanukh masters one day muta was sold to a sumerian trader who needed extra slaves to carry his goods a year later muta was left for dead after he collapsed from exhaustion under his burden certain of his propertys demise mutas latest master hadnt even bothered to cut mutas throat or give him the hammer stroke to the temple but muta recovered and somehow made his way to orak arriving a few months before the great siege eskkar and gatus desperate for men to defend the village cared nothing about mutas past life as a slave they needed strong and willing men to fight the barbarians and so for the first time in his life muta learned the trade of war trained as an archer he fought on the wall against all the alur meriki attacks two years later after king eskkar defeated king eridu in the first sumerian war gatus had sent muta to meet with hathor that foresight now benefited hathor muta had not only lived in those lands but had labored on caravans moving from village to village he had walked most of the desert trails and knew the location of watering holes hathors horsemen shifted to a gallop and widened their front the orderly formations used for traveling and training vanished replaced by the need to get as many horsemen into the tanukh camp as fast as possible no need for silence or stealth no force of this size could be anything but the enemy of the tanukhs nevertheless hathor had hoped to overwhelm tibra before any could escape but before his men had closed to within five hundred paces he saw horsemen streaming out of the village lashing their mounts and scattering in all directions this camp might not have had any advance warning but they had reacted swiftly the moment they caught sight of hathors cavalry bearing down on them more tanukhs reached the corrals wrenching open the gates and catching the first horse they could the tanukh menfolk felt no compunction about sacrificing their women and children as long as they could save themselves and their horses in a way hathor was glad to see them run two or three hundred tanukh warriors wouldnt have presented much difficulty but there still would have been many akkadian casualties with no guarantee that word of hathors cavalry would not be spread far and wide his eight hundred men swept through the camp ignoring the few arrows fired at them by the defenders the inhabitants of tibra were hunted down and slain as mercilessly as those of margan those who could reach a horse galloped away safe for the moment from hathors tired horses those who couldnt escape on horseback mostly women and children fled into the desert running for their lives each desperately hoping someone else would be hunted down and killed in moments the akkadians had swept through the camp hathor heard klexor shouting to his men to collect the remaining horses the more mounts the akkadians could capture the weaker their enemy would be at the same time the burning started one running man with a torch could set a great deal of fires and soon flames from every tent sent a wall of heat up into the sky this time hathor gave his men little time to enjoy their victims food and grain were loaded onto captured horses the oasis water fouled with the bodies of the dead and anything that would burn was heaped in piles and set afire only one life was spared hathor found the old man standing before his burning tent a sword in his hand that he barely had the strength to raise hathor rode up just as one of his men was about to kill the tanukh wait let this one live hathor glanced around him this trembling old man might be the only tanukh still alive within the camp find muta tell him to come here hathor swung down from his horse and stared at the old one the man made no move to attack just stood there his mouth flecked with saliva his chest rising and falling with his fear muta his sword and right arm splattered with blood walked over a wide grin on his face is this one the only one left tell him who we are and why we came muta took two steps toward the tanukh with a sudden movement he struck the sword from the old mans trembling hand both sword and man went to the ground muta put his sword to the mans throat when your cowardly men return tell them the soldiers of akkad have destroyed your village as a warning tell them that if they ever raid the lands claimed by akkad again we will return and kill every one of you no matter where you hide remember what i say and tell your leaders do you understand the old man nodded unable to speak muta spat in his face dont forget hathor grunted with approval now lets get our men on the move weve still a long way to go today before the sun had moved much more than a hands breath across the sky hathor and his men departed tibra behind them fires burned and smoke slid high into the cloudless sky before disappearing hathor felt as much satisfaction as any of his men two tanukh camps had been destroyed but now the akkadians presence in these lands was known he had to continue to move and to strike and strike again as quickly as possible before the tanukhs had time to combine their scattered forces against him at least the akkadians had plenty of food and water as they rode south by midmorning of the next day hathors scouts spotted a band of tanukh horsemen following them they stayed far out of bowshot but hung on hathors trail most of the day when the akkadians camped for the night a stronger than usual guard had to be posted hathor expected that the tanukhs would try to steal back their horses or perhaps attack the sleeping soldiers throughout the night two hundred soldiers guarded the camp every man taking his turn until the morning sun lifted above the horizon and showed an empty landscape after eating and drinking their fill the akkadians started moving again hathor pressed for all possible speed the quicker they could move through this land the less likely the tanukhs would be able to muster enough horsemen to dispute their passage hathors cavalry rode south continuing straight into the desert by now frantic tanukh messengers leading extra mounts would be racing around his force desperate to warn the villages and camps that lay before these new invaders that night the tanukhs crept up as close as they dared and launched arrows from out of the darkness the shafts were intended not only to kill akkadians but to stampede the horses all night long the attacks continued sometimes only an arrow or two other times a dozen at a time it took all the akkadians skill to restrain the horses and prevent them from bursting through the rope corrals none of the akkadians got much sleep nevertheless hathors men took it as a point of honor to deny the tanukhs any chance to get at the horses and each man hung on to two or three mounts most of the night when the sun rose hathor had lost two men killed and nine wounded but none of the horses had broken free or been stolen and they found the bodies of seven dead tanukhs scattered around the camp killed by fashods men who hunted the tanukhs in the darkness and took extra pleasure in the killing get the men moving klexor hathor shouted the men were just as eager to leave this place the tanukhs their number increasing resumed their shadowing of the akkadians but only once did they venture close muta wheeled suddenly with a hundred riders and charged toward the tanukhs they turned and fled but not before muta and fashods warriors drew close enough to launch three flights of arrows shooting them at a dead run just as they had been trained by the ur nammu four tanukhs died and as many horses while the rest fled for their lives after that the desert dwellers kept their distance h athor pressed on only one more village remained between him and his destination when they camped for the night they were able to find suitable ground between two low hills it gave them a place to hold the horses and surround them with guards once again hathor let the fashod and his ur nammu warriors patrol the darkness whether due to the defendable location or fashods men no arrows reached the akkadians that night hathor and his commanders sat in the shadows and made their plans for the coming day grateful for the chance to get some rest i n the predawn of the eighth day since leaving eskkar hathor moved through the camp making one last check of his men everyone had to know their mission and be prepared to move as fast as possible he led the way out at first light still heading south he pushed the pace today they had to cover a great distance and the horses would get little rest until tomorrow another tanukh village lay to the southwest about a days ride and hathor wanted to give the enemy shadowing his movements the impression that it remained his destination a little after dawn hathor spotted a dozen tanukh horsemen riding at full speed and leading spare mounts intending to warn the village of his approach no doubt the main force of tanukhs assembling to attack him had headed in the same direction at midmorning muta whod been leading the men slipped back to hathors side were here they had just ridden to the crest of a hill and its height gave hathor a good view of the desert before him he gave the order to halt and let his eyes scan the empty landscape before him taking his time and searching the land from horizon and back no landmarks not even a trail showed on the shifting sands and rocks as he finished klexor rode up to join them this is the place muta nodded from here we turn east the trail is unmarked and its a long dry march for men on foot at least two days but it leads to uruk on horseback we should be able to make it in a single day once we reach the river well need some luck crossing over but the river shouldnt be too high at this time of year hathor knew they had to ride almost fifty miles then cross a branch of the euphrates if they could manage that they would reach uruk just before the sun went down with luck no word would have reached the city of the presence of a large force of akkadian cavalry driving toward them if hathor hoped to take the city by surprise his men would have to cover nearly eighty miles from dawn to dusk there was only one way to find out if the horses could maintain that pace such an opportunity to appear out of the desert without warning would give him a real chance to strike uruk hard even if he couldnt gain entry to the city hathor could ravage the countryside destroy crops and herds and break uruks ability to support the war for some time he glanced up at the sun which appeared to have jumped higher in the sky in the last few moments hathor raised his voice and let his bellow cover the entire column mount up we turn east here today we show the sumerians the danger of attacking akkad we ride for uruk the men gave a cheer they had had enough of the desert and its heat and each step eastward would bring them closer to the fertile lands of sumeria hathor tugged on the halter and turned the animals head toward the east he and his commanders had trained these men for years and now the long months of training would be put to the test like a long sword pointed at an unsuspecting foe the column cantered toward the lands of sumeria the horses responded well moving easily as strong and well conditioned as their riders even the pack animals and spare mounts had no trouble keeping pace with luck the akkadians would attack from a direction the unsuspecting enemy least expected the long ride began with such a great distance to cover they rested only briefly to ease the strain on their mounts hathor periodically swung down from his horses back and ran beside the animal his men followed of course no horse fighter would ever admit that the old man commanding them could perform any feat of horsemanship or physical effort that they couldnt match and they knew that today of all days the akkadian cavalry had to outrace the sun run damn you lazy bastards hathor shouted again and again you can rest tomorrow in uruk scouts moved out ahead and to the flank the tanukhs would not be expecting a turn eastward after two attacks on their own camps they had no reason to think the akkadians would suddenly turn their attention toward uruk nor would they likely be too concerned about such a move even if they knew if the akkadians moved out of their lands so much the better let the sumerian city with its thick walls deal with this new enemy at least that remained hathors earnest hope they rode and ran beside their mounts every man giving his utmost running and riding the miles passing swiftly beneath them before long each step became easier as they gradually left the sandy wastelands behind and moved onto firmer ground they crossed a riverbed nearly dry now at the height of the summer pausing only long enough for horse and rider to drink the brackish liquid and refill the water skins they resumed the punishing ride racing the sun now at their backs mile after mile passed and hathors feet burned and stung with every step he ran until he could no longer draw a breath then pulled himself onto his horses back every time he glanced up the sun moved lower across the sky moving ever faster toward the horizon suddenly one of the scouts riding point halted waving his arms and shouting that the euphrates lay ahead a few moments later hathor crested a low rise and saw the wide ribbon of brown water in the distance by now every riders dry throat burned with thirst and the horses necks and chest were covered with dried froth every water skin had gone dry long ago hathor had pushed every man and beast to the limit but now that the horses caught the scent of water ahead they renewed their own strength pressing on until the akkadians cantered right into the river before halting men slipped from their mounts and fell into the water shouting in delight and relief horse and rider drank together the cool water refreshed them all and man and beast drank and drank until every belly was stretched to its limit the water soothed hathors feet washing some of the pain away after a brief rest the men walked their reluctant horses across the river the horses would be more likely to stumble and injure themselves carrying a mans weight through the water the euphrates was wide here but moved slowly only near the center did they need to cling to their mounts and swim for a few dozen paces when they emerged they rested again on the east bank according to muta uruk lay about ten miles due south hathor took one last look at the horizons nothing moved not even a farmer tending his fields the scouts had seen no one which meant their presence might yet be unknown klexor you take command of the main force muta and i will ride ahead with the picked men hathor accompanied by muta and thirty men prepared themselves hathor inspected every mount to make sure it was fit to ride then he and his troop gathered the weapons and tools they needed and cantered off the rest of the akkadians fanned out to follow their commander at a somewhat slower pace and to block the route of anyone who might see them all the horses were weary now after a long day and hathor could feel his mount starting to tire nevertheless uruk drew closer with each stride the sun sank nearer to the horizon but now that worked in the akkadians favor on the main trail to the city they encountered few travelers this late in the day and those they did meet were all on foot farmers and traders shrank away at their approach and none would be able to outrun them to uruk the citys gates would be closing at sundown hathor wanted to reach the city just before then finally the citys walls rose up at this distance hathor had to rely on one of his mens eyesight he couldnt tell if the gate were open or closed if word of their approach had reached uruk the gate would be closed and the wall bristling with armed men if it remained open it would mean that uruk had not yet learned of the presence of the akkadian force within their heartland he knew a little about the history of uruk supposedly the oldest city in the land between the rivers farming and trade had flourished here long before anyone began working the land around akkad for a while or so its inhabitants claimed uruk had stood above the other villages but in the last few generations sumer and the other cities with their emphasis on trade had surpassed it uruks walls reflected its status raised in the last few years they were just high enough to keep out the occasional desert raiders hathor halted his men for one last brief rest and to allow them a few moments to ready themselves the riders swung down from their horses twenty men already dressed to look like slaves wrapped ropes around their wrists as if bound they would complete the journey on foot weapons were placed in sacks and tied on the backs of the horses the change over took little time because the men had prepared for it last night leading the way hathor rode slowly toward uruks northern gate with muta at his side behind them came the twenty slaves trailed by ten mounted men leading the rest of the horses the riders wore rope whips fastened to their wrists the usual means to keep slaves in order a single rider brought up the rear leading two pack animals hathors pace kept the supposed slaves staggering to keep up he heard them cursing at the effort but slaves often were pushed to the limits of their endurance and beyond no one cared about a few slaves staggering along or falling down from exhaustion more important hathor didnt want to find the gate slammed in his face just as they drew near this close to the city he couldnt see any extra guards appeared on the walls and step by step the little caravan moved closer weve done it muta they havent heard about us if the uruks had been warned and the city on alert hathors orders were to raid the countryside and cause as much damage and confusion as possible but if they could get into the city they will soon enough muta couldnt conceal the excitement in his voice just a few moments longer hathor wanted to see if klexor and the rest of the akkadians had closed up the gap behind them but didnt dare to turn around and draw the guards attention to their rear at last only a hundred paces lay between hathor and the gate then they were within hailing distance who are you the words came from the guard tower on the right answer him muta hathor tried to look unconcerned muta of margan bringing slaves and horses for uruks market hurry then the guard called down were about to the close the gate for the night another forty paces and hathors horse stepped its way through the open gate a half dozen slaves stood there ready to close the heavy panels that would secure the city for the night he slid off his horse and moved aside where are you from i dont recognize you hathor turned to find the same guard who had hailed him approaching he wore some emblem of rank on his tunic and appeared in charge of the soldiers at uruks main entrance by now the first of the slaves had trudged through the opening shoved along by their overseers my master doesnt speak your language muta said moving beside hathor we come from the desert to the west of margan a cry went up from one of the guards on the tower commander i see horsemen hundreds of them approaching close the gate the commander shouted then turned to hathor get your men inside the mans slow wits hadnt connected hathors party with those approaching at a canter hathors sword flashed from its sheath and he drove the point into the mans stomach the gatekeepers eyes showed surprise and understanding in the brief moment before life fled his body shouts echoed across the towers and along the walls hathors men were already casting off their ropes and seizing their weapons bows and quivers were scooped up from the packs men raced into the towers to climb the steps and kill the guards the slaves about to close the gate fled down the nearest lane two akkadians had a different role each carried a hammer and a thick stake and each was already hammering the stakes into the ground a few mighty swings and the sharpened stakes penetrated deep into the earth preventing the gates from closing an arrow struck the wall just behind hathor he ducked into the doorway of the nearest tower soldiers from inside the city were rushing to the walls but they had to fight their way through those inhabitants trying to get as far away from the gate as possible hathors men took their station inside the towers shooting arrows at anyone attempting to drive them out arrows from the defenders rained down on the gate from the walls but the gates remained open until the stakes were removed a task that would take several men some time the gates could not be closed leaving his men at the base of the tower hathor rushed up the steps bodies were strewn about the top of the tower including a few of his own men keep down a voice shouted defenders from along the wall on either side were targeting the akkadians nevertheless hathor risked a quick glimpse over the wall klexor and his men were only a few hundred paces away screaming their war cries and kicking their exhausted horses at a dead run nothing could stop them now hathor dashed back down the steps by the time he reached the bottom over seven hundred heavily armed men were riding through all shouting war cries at the tops of their lungs they split into three groups one heading for the barracks one for the marketplace and one for the main stables uruk had close to four thousand people living within its walls but many of its fighting men had joined shulgis army the city probably only had three or four hundred armed men capable of mounting a resistance and these were scattered throughout the city their days work ended leaderless they tried to resist to gather themselves into units but soon hundreds of people were streaming toward the south and east gates escape the only thought in the minds a few of the defending soldiers had the same thought and the citys defense collapsed before it could even get organized flames sprang up as akkadians found torches and oil and set fires as much to panic the inhabitants as to light the city against the gathering darkness women wailed and men shouted all of them rushing about trying to save themselves hathor had never seen anything like this before the entire population of a large city thrust into a complete panic within moments most had no idea who had attacked them he heard the word tanukhs again and again despite the akkadians using their citys name as their war cry it seemed like everyone within the walls was screaming in terror by the time hathor reached the south gate the sun had started its descent below the horizon as far as he could see and in every direction people streamed away from the already burning city carrying their children or whatever possessions they had managed to snatch up they would run and run until they collapsed in exhaustion klexor rode up we captured the stables and many horses before they could escape ive told our men not to pursue those running away otherwise any who resist are to be killed keep the fires burning hathor had to shout to be heard over the din burn everything and make sure the horses we dont need are slaughtered too there must not be any pursuit after the akkadians had left his men knew what needed to be done one by one as they found no foe to face them they put down their bloody weapons and began heaping the fires doors corrals clothing anything that would catch fire was put to the torch the sun slipped below the horizon but the light from the fires that had sprung up everywhere made the city as bright as day uruk would burn through the night this city like the camps in the desert would pay the price for helping recruit and arm the tanukhs so they could wage war on akkad day i n the morning the stench of burning wood and flesh both human and animal hung in the air hathors commanders counted at least two hundred bodies mostly men who had died either fighting or trying to escape the rest had abandoned their homes and fled the countryside would be full of people running or trying to hide hathor give his tired men no rest during the night guarding the captured horses loading supplies and water skins and even collecting loot all had to wait until his men gathered everything that would burn and set it afire twice he rode through the wreckage of uruk pointing out huts or corrals still standing that his men had overlooked his soldiers cursed and swore at him as they labored covered with sweat dust and soot from the fires nevertheless every man took satisfaction in the destruction uruk had provided men and supplies to both sumer and the tanukhs and now terror had come upon them just before midmorning hathor swung himself onto his horse and led his men out of the north gate the akkadian cavalry now resembled a vast caravan with over a hundred captured horses loaded down with loot the spoils of an entire city behind them they left an empty shell inhabited only by the dead and possibly a handful who might have saved themselves by concealing themselves in their hiding holes hathor had even ordered the captured women some still crying after being raped driven out of the city some would return but they would find little to sustain them the supply animals forced the akkadians to travel slowly the horses had a nights rest but they were still weary from the great distance they had traveled yesterday still hathor knew he had to balance his mens need for rest with the need to keep moving by now word of his raid would be spreading throughout the land and every city and village would be scrambling to assemble a force large enough to hunt him down this deep into enemy territory anything could happen given enough time the sumerians could raise enough men to trap him hathor led his men back up the euphrates to the place where he had crossed only yesterday they pitched camp there and set up picket lines not only was the crossing a good place to camp with plenty of fresh water but they could see a good way in every direction which meant no enemy could surprise them everyone not on guard duty slumped to the ground to fall asleep within moments hathor wanted to do the same but he forced himself to remain awake letting klexor and muta get some rest first that would ensure that at least one of the senior commanders stayed awake and alert when they woke hathor the sun was falling toward the horizon commander boats are approaching it must be yavtar hathor accepted the soldiers hand and pulled himself to his feet by the time he reached the river six boats were heading for the shore three of which were yavtars fighting ships hathor recognized maralla the commander of this little fleet he stood in the prow of the lead boat then jumped into the river and splashed his way to where hathor stood welcome maralla hathor clasped the mans shoulder welcome hathor we saw the smoke and knew uruk was burning we were fortunate they had no idea any akkadians were within two hundred miles of uruk did you lose many men about twenty dead and thirtysix wounded can you take all of them yes and whatever loot you want us to carry as soon as we unload the grain food and arrows you may need more boats my men brought plenty of valuables with them and the horses need the grain we didnt have time to take much food from uruk well stay here and rest for a day or two before moving east as soon as weve exchanged cargoes i want to be out of here maralla glanced up and down the river as if expecting a fleet of enemy ships at any moment its a long haul upriver and well need to stay off the main branch of the euphrates until were past lagash if we row through the night we may slip past anyone watching for us maralla had come down from the north bypassing lagash but word of his passage would have been dispatched and no doubt foes would soon be waiting for him on his return the sooner he got out of sumeria the better well be moving out tomorrow as well one day of rest is all we can risk this far south hathor gave the orders and soon the wounded were carried to the shore and handed down into the boats the men returning with whatever cargo they were handed it didnt take long to empty the boats but it was well past dusk when maralla and the last of the ships pushed off and headed north their small sails catching a breeze that helped the rowers i hope they make it klexor said its a long way home the mention of home brought cnari back to hathors thoughts for the first time in his life hathor wished he too were home he took a breath and put his wife out of his mind even if they dont theyve fulfilled their task our horses will be well fed the men rested and weve plenty of arrows lets hope we dont need to use them until we rejoin eskkars forces day a fter a day and a night of rest hathors forces moved out with the dawn if he were to keep his rendezvous with eskkar he had two days to reach isin a journey of over one hundred miles hathor would have preferred to depart yesterday but the horses needed rest and a chance to stuff their bellies with grain it would be of little benefit if either his men or their mounts were unable to fight when they joined eskkars forces they traveled light carrying only enough food for the twoday journey the water skins stayed empty as there would be at least a dozen streams to cross between uruk and isin the horses had already devoured all the grain carried on marallas ships and for the next few days would have to forage as they traveled to make that easier hathor spread his men out over a wide front he stayed in the center of the line with klexor on the right and muta commanding on the left the temptation to burn and kill everything in his path was strong but he knew he had no time to waste and so the countryside was spared the worst they stopped at midday after crossing over a small stream i wish we knew how eskkar is doing klexor had ridden in from the flank well know when we get to isin hathor had asked himself the same question but refused to let his men see that he shared their concerns not even his commanders if they reached isin and didnt find eskkar waiting they would probably all end up dead if hes not there well have a hard time getting back north if eskkar isnt there word will still come down the river hathor didnt really believe it if eskkar wasnt there it meant hed been defeated in battle and if we meet razreks cavalry then well have a good fight before we get home he clasped his hand on klexors shoulder the two men had become good friends during the last year training side by side now we just need to get to isin tell the men to start moving weve still got a long ride ahead of us day eskkar and his commanders crested a low hill at midmorning and caught their first glimpse of isin less than two miles away the akkadian army had approached the city from the north and as soon as they reached the euphrates yavtars boats had joined them like akkad isin nestled in a gentle curve of the river and like akkad it had three gates eskkar had visited this city several years ago but it was good to match what he remembered against the actual sight isin boasted a good anchorage and he could see a dozen river boats crowded against each other high walls ringed the city and a fresh scar in the earth showed that the surrounding ditch had only recently been dug out expanded and deepened wont be easy to get in there gatus said his eyes scanning the possible field of battle not with the reinforcements they got yesterday over a thousand horsemen had ridden past eskkars infantry yesterday just after midday the sumerians hadnt bothered to avoid akkadian scrutiny and eskkar frowned when he saw that these men were not the rabble tanukhs or regular sumerian cavalry shulgi had no doubt sent men to isin who could be expected to stand and fight its not likely trellas spies will be able to help us this time eskkars eyes told him there would be no easy way into isin theyll keep a better watch over the walls after what happened at larsa too bad there was no time to dig the tunnel one of the many plans discussed at the war table was the digging of a tunnel under the citys walls but such a task proved too daunting for the few men inside isin working for trella the last report eskkar had received from akkads spies within isin was that king naxos had retained four to five hundred fighting men within the city with the reinforcements sent by shulgi at least fifteen hundred fighting men would be preparing to defend the city i never believed they could dig a tunnel without getting caught eskkar said if shulgi hadnt sent those horsemen we could have taken the city despite the losses but now wed lose too many men and even then might not break through the defense lets hope that corios plan works the master builder who had erected akkads walls had dispatched his son alcinor to each of the six sumerian cities last year ostensibly on trading missions his bodyguards for that journey were veteran soldiers who focused their attention on the forces defending the cities and to the quality and quantity of men and weapons alcinor who already equaled or possibly surpassed his fathers skill as a master builder had returned with much good information on the sumerian cities their strengths and weaknesses and how and where they could best be attacked isin however had one feature that made it unique taking advantage of that alcinor and his father had come up with a dubious plan for taking the city in many ways isin appeared the strongest of the six cities its walls while not as high or as thick as akkads stood tall enough to require the construction of ramps for scaling no easy approaches would provide any cover even if it could be taken by direct assault eskkar didnt dare risk losing half his army king shulgi would finish them off with ease after that well have to give corios scheme a try if it fails well look like bigger fools eskkar took a deep breath and let it out best to get started on the preparations i dont think king naxos will scare too easily the name of the king of isin always awoke memories in eskkar his long travails toward the kingship of akkad had begun when he had slain a man named naxos who had received orders to kill eskkar from one of the ruling nobles trellas insight had provided eskkar with enough warning and naxos had died with eskkars sword in his belly a slow and painful death the death of naxos precipitated eskkars decision to stay and fight against the barbarians now another man named naxos ruled in isin unlike merchants such as eridu or naran who bought their way into power naxos was a true warrior and he had won his kingship by fighting for it the lands around isin were some of the most fertile in sumeria and never failed to produce good harvests palm trees provided shade and numerous streams bordered with willows made irrigating the crops even easier than at akkad the people of isin had grown prosperous in the warmth of the sumerian sun the bountiful land with its warm climate had not made them soft or lazy eskkar knew that it was not only the hard lands that bred strong and ferocious fighters all isins neighbors coveted the land that isin claimed and naxos had built a strong fighting force to keep the other cities at bay the citys inhabitants knew that their land and families remained safe only because of the weight of their soldiers swords some of the strongest and besttrained forces that shulgi would array against the akkadians would have come from the levies that isin provided though eskkar had never mentioned it to anyone except trella ten years ago he had briefly fought with the forces of isin against an invasion from nippur his respect for the fighting skills that naxos possessed was based on that experience but eskkar had never crossed paths with naxos who had also risen from nothing to assume control of the city what he had fought so hard to take naxos would not relinquish without a hard struggle the citys sentries had spotted eskkar and his company the north rampart now thronged with soldiers and even at this distance eskkar could see them waving bows and spears in defiance eskkar ignored them lets get busy gatus we only have two days possibly three before shulgi arrives with his army he turned his horse aside and rode back to the camp gatus and the others following by the time eskkar reached the river the last of the seven boats was being unloaded grain for the horses bread and fruit for the men made up the bulk of the cargo in addition to another three thousand firearrows a hundred torches and twenty jugs of the oil that burns but alcinors plan required something else and two of the boats had carried nothing but shovels six hundred in all the men unloading that odd cargo stared at the digging tools with quizzical looks already spreading rumors about tunneling their way into isin eskkar smiled at the sight his men would soon have plenty of experience handling a shovel good morning lord eskkar he turned to find alcinor standing there you came i thought that your father was sending another to join me tall and earnestlooking the young man shook his head he wanted to but i insisted on coming this is too important to delegate to someone else it was my idea and i wanted to be sure it was carried out properly corio would not have relished the idea of risking the life of his eldest and ablest son by sending him into a battle in eskkars eyes alcinor had already proved his valor by challenging his fathers decision and risking his life by coming downriver to join the akkadian forces then you can take charge of the men just tell grond what you need and he will inform the commanders but we must make haste alcinor your plan seems to be more of a dream now that were here than it did in akkad its no dream lord eskkar it will work eskkar still had his doubts but he gave alcinor an encouraging smile then your name will surpass your fathers but i think youd better start now and work through the night we may not have much time g atus established a camp strong enough to stop any of razreks horsemen from attacking even if reinforced by soldiers from within isin protected by the river at their backs the men took their positions facing outward while the horsemen and archers patrolled the outskirts of the encampment to make sure no spies from isin drew close eskkar wanted no word of what his men were doing to find its way into isin the low hills blocked sight of the camp and its activity from isins walls under alcinors direction grond soon had a thousand men stretched out along the river the shovels distributed among them some would dig others would shift the loosened sand and dirt anything that could be used to dig or carry was pressed into service the sacks used for ballast in the riverboats were utilized filled with dirt they were hauled away to be emptied and returned to carry another load eventually most of them fell apart from the heavy loads which forced the soldiers to work even harder eskkar knew there would be little sleep for any of his men tonight and plenty of hard labor the soldiers complained of course loudly and often theyd marched all day and had hoped for at least a night of rest gatus ignored their comments what would you rather do he shouted again and again dig or fight before long they were shouting back at him fight wed rather fight than dig but gatus had an answer for that too youll all be fighting soon enough keep digging day eskkar watched the work progress until almost midnight finally after gronds repeated suggestions eskkar took the hint and decided to get some rest when he woke the sun was well above the horizon but he felt as rested as if hed slept all night with a handful of bread he mounted and rode toward the river the progress in the ditch surprised him working in shifts the soldiersturneddiggers had moved an enormous quantity of earth grond who had slept only briefly through the night professed both alcinor and himself well satisfied with the mens labors nevertheless the work continued there was still much more dirt to be moved now as impressed as any of his men eskkar decided that this whole scheme might just possibly work at midday eskkar studied the three men standing before him simple farmers theyd been unlucky enough to be taken prisoner during the march to isin all of them showed fear either on their faces or by their trembling limbs eskkar selected the one who trembled the least and whose eyes showed a hint of steady wits he moved to stand directly before the man whats your name harno noble one look at me when you speak harno unlike your sumerian rulers i like to see a mans face when he talks to me not the top of his head eskkar towered over the man who appeared to have about thirty seasons do as i say and you wont be harmed i want you to take a message to king naxos tell him i wish to meet him tell him to bring his master builder with him but no others i will meet him alone save for my clerk well meet in the open halfway between the hills and the walls tell him to come at once if he wishes to save his city can you remember all that harno yes lord but if he does not come you will be safe inside isins walls at least for a little while my brother harno gestured toward one of the other captives what will happen to him ah your brother well his life will depend on how well you convince naxos to meet me make sure your king knows that there is only this one chance to save his city remind him that i gave the same offer to king naran of larsa before i destroyed that city if naxos fails to meet me youll find your brother floating in the river without his head and make sure naxos brings his master builder with him thats as important as the king coming himself yes noble one ill give him the message eskkar made harno repeat the message three more times until he felt certain the man could remember everything eskkar had said at least until he reached isins walls then he and grond escorted the man to the edge of the camp harno there is something else i want you to give this to king naxos as a gift eskkar turned to grond who unwrapped a bundle he carried a lustrous sword with a carved hilt embedded with jewels glinted in the sun this was the sword of the king of larsa he doesnt need it any more so im giving it to naxos as a gift give it to none but the king hell know what it means grond rewrapped the sword and handed the weapon to the messenger whose unsteady hands nearly dropped it the sword should convince the guards to take you to the king make sure no one takes it away from you no matter who demands you speak to them tell your message only to king naxos remember that others will try to learn what words you carry do not heed them and call out as you approach the walls that you bear a message from eskkar of akkad for king naxos go harno holding the bundle awkwardly with both hands had to be pushed on his way eskkar and grond watched the man stumble his way down the hill and break into an unsteady trot toward the city walls do you think naxos will come eskkar shrugged perhaps hes a warrior so hell understand what the sword means i dont think hell be afraid but he might suspect a trap if he doesnt come he should at least send someone else out to talk to us lets hope some eager subcommander doesnt force the message from harnos lips and twist its meaning well see soon enough either way they remained on the crest of the hill until harno reached the citys gate for a long moment nothing happened then one portal of the gate opened a trifle and harno disappeared inside the city well at least they let him in i was half expecting theyd riddle him with arrows bring my horse grond and tell alcinor its time eskkar and alcinor rode down the hill and moved out of bowshot from the crest they stopped a little less than half a mile from the citys walls just out of range of any bows eskkar dismounted tied his horse to a scraggly bush and sat on a small boulder to wait the land part of a grain field lay empty after the recent harvest only a flat expanse of short grass remained that should make it clear to naxos that there would be no attempt to capture him the sun crawled across the sky and started its descent when the rock grew too hard to sit eskkar slid to the earth and stretched out his long legs on the ground with his back to the boulder and closed his eyes alcinor too nervous to remain in one place paced back and forth his eyes wide as he stared at the city unable to control his excitement your messenger has been gone a long time lord eskkar more than enough time for them to hear your message and act on it hes a king alcinor he cant appear to run when someone calls besides the longer he takes the closer your men get nevertheless sun had traveled a good distance across the sky at last eskkar decided that naxos wasnt coming he stood and stretched just then the gate opened and twelve men rode out they rode leisurely toward eskkars position he loosened the sword in its scabbard and moved toward his horse if the men kept coming he and alcinor would ride back up the hill mitrac and fifty archers waited there in case they were needed but ten of the men halted halfway while two continued to ride eskkar checked the fastening that tethered his mount then studied the men approaching one was old and thickwaisted even at this distance eskkar could see the mans wispy gray hair floating around a mostly bald pate isins master builder rode awkwardly on an old brown horse that looked more suited to pulling a plow than to carrying a man naxos rode a rangy red stallion bigger than eskkars tall and broad naxos wore a bronze helmet and breastplate thick legs kept the horse under firm control and a sword hung from his left hip he stopped about fifty paces from eskkar and looked around taking his time and checking for any possible ambush naxoss nose like eskkars had encountered something solid in his youth then naxos turned his gaze to alcinor for a few moments before giving his attention to eskkar eskkar said nothing anything he could say now any words or assurances would mean little to naxos the sword had brought isins king out from behind his walls but the man still needed to make up his own mind and eskkar knew there was no need to rush him naxos made his decision he said something to his companion tapped his horses flank and stepped his horse closer his master builder following with obvious reluctance when naxos halted again he was only ten paces away youre eskkar it wasnt a question just a statement i am youre as men have described you naxos of isin what do you have to say in a moment is this your master builder naxos snorted in disgust one of them the other was too frightened to come he fell to his knees and couldnt stop shaking he thought you would cut out his heart and eat it before his eyes eskkar grunted hed seen such stupidity before he turned to alcinor take isins master builder what is your name the man had to lick his lips and clear his throat before he could get the words out sardos king eskkar he gave a fearful glance not to eskkar but to his king to see if naxos approved of the use of eskkars title well sardos of isin i want you to go with alcinor here to the top of the hill theres something you need to see nothing will happen to you and when you get there make sure there are no soldiers lurking about king naxos will want to know that sardos turned to naxos licking his lips in fear lord do i have to go get going you fool or i will cut your heart out myself do you think hes lured me out of isin just to take your fool head alcinor who appeared almost as nervous as sardos gingerly mounted his horse and started trotting up the hill naxos slapped the rump of sardoss horse to send him along naxos watched as the two rode slowly up the hill then turned his gaze to eskkar you know im tempted to kill you right here he let his left hand drop to the scabbard of his sword the weapon would slide easily when held that way shulgi thinks that killing you would end the war in one stroke eskkar met naxoss gaze dont you want to hear what i have to say your death scream would tell me all i need to know bigger and better men than you have tried to take my head eskkar kept his voice calm with no trace of emotion as all barbarians did when they faced their foe before battle but if you think youre good enough think how happy shulgi would be im sure he would give you a suitable reward or perhaps he would be even more satisfied if i killed you im sure i can deal with your successor just as well naxos tightened his lips at the taunt eskkar could see the man considering his chances he was on horseback facing a man on foot it should be easy enough to ride him down one quick slash of his blade but naxos took his hand off the hilt of his sword damn you eskkar and damn shulgi even more ill not do his dirty work for him at least not yet what is that old fool doing up there that last was directed toward the top of the hill eskkar turned to stare upwards alcinor and sardos had reached the crest and now the two were exchanging words alcinor pointed to the north moving his hands for emphasis in a moment sardoss highpitched voice floated down the hill but not his words both men continued talking and the discussion went on and on every few moments sardos gestured impatiently even eskkar grew tired of watching them alcinor is showing your man sardos how were going to destroy isin i thought it best to have it explained to a builder who can understand such things the idea is hard to grasp i didnt believe it possible myself but alcinor and my other builders kept assuring me it would work naxos stared up the hill unimpressed by eskkars comment the conversation between the two builders ceased but sardos continued to keep his gaze fixed to the north finally he dragged his horses head around and started coming cautiously back down the hill alcinor following well here they come eskkars eyes followed the two as they approached one good look at sardoss face and wide eyes told eskkar what he needed to know after youve heard what they say you might want to see for yourself sardos managed to pull his horse to a stop facing his king his back to eskkar apparently the man no longer feared that the akkadian would murder him lord naxos the akkadians have dug a channel from the river to just beyond this hill its almost completed theyre preparing to flood the city flood the city what kind of fool are you the citys a half a mile away more even sardos shook his head the ditch is nearly complete once they break through the last few paces of earth to breach the riverbank the force of the water will widen the opening and deepen the channel since the river runs higher here than at isin the breach will continue to widen the whole river the course of the river will change it will flood the basin isin will be surrounded by the river naxoss brow furrowed in anger and his words came more rapidly than before so so let the water come it wont reach the top of the walls eskkar laughed and both men turned toward him ah im not laughing at you naxos thats what i said when i first heard it explained he moved toward his horse but as akkads builders explained to me the water will quickly wash away the loose soil surrounding the citys walls then the base of the walls will begin to weaken the bricks are mostly mud after all and as soon as they get too wet theyll simply start to crumble under the weight from above once the foundation is loosened the walls will come down and the city will be under water how high will it get alcinor about the height of a man lord eskkar maybe a little higher and how long will this take once we open the breach it will take less than half a day to surround isin with water perhaps sooner another half day should see the walls crumble and start to collapse no longer than that i think naxos glanced at eskkar then fixed his gaze on sardos is this true so help me if theyre trying to trick you ill cut your balls off and make you eat them myself lord sardos had to lick his lips again i think it will happen as alcinor and king eskkar say go see for yourself what they have done come naxos eskkar unfastened his horse use your own eyes then well talk about how you can save your city damn you all naxos didnt bother to wait for eskkar he kicked his horse and galloped up the hill alone taking his time eskkar followed him when he reached the crest naxos was still staring in amazement since they had made camp yesterday gatus grond and alexar had over three thousand men working in shifts digging out a channel that already stretched more than a quarter mile the soldiers still labored moving dirt widening the channel the site impressed eskkar almost as much as it did naxos neither had ever seen so many men working together on such a task after one look even someone untrained in the force of the river could imagine what would happen when the riverbank collapsed and likely naxos knew more about the flow of water than most of those living in his city isin like akkad depended on the river to survive and naxos would understand the rivers strength when the riverbank was breached the water would flow through the channel widening it on the downriver side as more and more of the bank was washed away the unchecked water pushed by hundreds of miles of river behind it would flow out over the plain and engulf isin not in a fury of rushing water but in a slow but powerful force that would make what remained of the city an island alcinor and sardos had rejoined them alcinor pointed out how the water would move while sardos explained the effects eskkar soon saw that both were wasting their words a merchant might buy his way into a kingship with gold but a fighting man needed to know how to think on his feet to accomplish the same goal come naxos i think youve seen enough lets ride back down the hill before your men waiting out there decide to do something foolish then well talk without waiting for a reply eskkar turned his horse around and started down you can return to camp alcinor make sure everything is ready eskkar stopped at the same boulder dismounted and fastened his horse send sardos back to your men i dont think we need our master builders anymore naxos jerked his head get back to the city start making preparations to hold back the water put every man and woman in isin to work on it he swung down from his horse and tied it to the same bush as eskkars all right damn you now lets talk then ill decide whether or not to kill you why did you join forces with shulgi the question caught naxos by surprise why not he had plenty of gold and too many of my men were eager to fight its always the fools who know nothing about battle that want to rush out and fight the most why didnt you go with him he didnt ask me like his father i suppose he didnt want to share the glory of destroying akkad besides he trusts his own commanders and he has a few good ones his war has already cost sumeria two of its cities first larsa and now uruk uruk how did you my cavalry slipped away from shulgi crossed over the desert and took uruk by surprise from the west i just received word before i sent the messenger to you my horsemen will be here by sundown then ill be ready to face shulgi hell smash your forces horsemen or not he outnumbers you five maybe six to one perhaps but if i win ill move south to take sumer then return here to finish you isin will be isolated ill cut your supply lines and starve you out if i have to or ill just drown you and your city there are other places where the river can be breached and you wont be able to guard them all youll have to come out and fight to stop me from unleashing the river and this time youll be outnumbered four or five to one eskkar paused for a moment to let that sink in unless youre willing to consider another way naxos frowned again what other way stay out of the battle dont try to join forces with shulgi or attack my rear if you do that you can save your city and if shulgi defeats you then you can say you were trapped by my threats against isin forced to remain behind your walls i dont think shulgi knows about uruk not yet if shulgi wins then your troubles are over if akkad wins then you and isin will be the most important city in sumeria sumer always profits more from the river trade than we do not after i tear it down or better yet if i directed that all goods coming downriver from akkad and the north go not to sumer but cross over to isin that would make your city the center of river trading in sumeria with all the merchants and goods passing through your gates king naxos of isin would soon make the decisions for sumeria not shulgi naxos considered that for a moment as long as shulgi lives sumeria will do his bidding the boys young but hes no fool even now his sister rules in sumer in his name of course she is promised to me as a prize after the victory over akkad shes a cunning bitch who will probably poison you in your sleep on your wedding night since she and shulgi took power ive learned much about her kushanna belongs to shulgi apparently by choice for many years he might give her up for a few months to lull you into relaxing your guard but not longer by telling you this ive probably saved your life besides your marriage wedding bed will likely be empty with any luck shes already dead by now i have spies in sumer prepared to strike her down eskkar doubted that was true but naxos had no way of knowing if she were alive or dead how never mind her and all i have to do to save my city and reap these new trade routes is stay inside isin i know many of razreks men are with you is he inside with you too no he sent mattaki one of his commanders most of the men he brought are from isin good without razrek his men will be easier to deal with still theyll want to leave isin to attack my rear since i cant trust them i want all their horses and yours too driven out of the city my men will scatter them so that it will take days before they can be recaptured i want all your spears and shields carried outside the gate and burned and i want five thousand bowstrings handed over if you meet those terms you can keep your city dry why the bowstrings i dont have five thousand anyway every archer has at least two or three and im sure you have another thousand or two stored somewhere within isin without them and without spears and shields and with no horses i wont have to worry about your men attacking my rear anytime soon i need those weapons to defend isin shields and spears wont help you on the walls naxos nor will the horses not once the water begins to rise naxos considered that for a moment shulgi wont be happy if i do as you say you did what was needed to save your city besides if he wins hell be willing to overlook your actions with larsa and uruk gone hell need isin even more is larsa really destroyed everything except the walls was torn down and burned the inhabitants those that survived were stripped naked and driven from the city i turned naran over to those he tortured over the years everything of value went north to akkad by riverboat there will be no more raids north from larsa it will be five maybe ten years before anyone even thinks about rebuilding anywhere near the place by then it will be an insignificant village unimportant to the river trade isin will be the first to benefit from larsas destruction some of razreks men will resist giving up their horses those words told eskkar that naxos had made his decision eskkar shrugged make them most of the fighting men in isin are loyal to you how you convince the others is your problem put a sword to mattakis throat if need be from what ive heard of him hes not likely to sacrifice himself for razrek or even shulgi for that matter how do i know youll keep your word that after i make my city defenseless you wont still breach the river because i give you my word on my honor as a warrior that might not be enough for shulgi or razrek but it should be enough for you a steppe warrior has honor or he has nothing even a sumerian bandit like you should know that eskkar knew that naxos had started his rise to power by raiding villages up and down the euphrates when he took power in isin the first thing he did to restore order was drive off all the other bandits including many of his former companions naxos stared at him by now they stood only a few paces apart he swallowed both his anger and his pride all right ill do it but if the river is breached ill hunt you down and kill you if its the last thing i do ill send men for the horses and bowstrings make sure no one shoots any arrows at them from the wall and if i see one rider on a horse leave isin one boat go upriver or down ill loose the last bit of riverbank myself even one rider naxos remember that youre a fool eskkar to let yourself be trapped like this between shulgis army and isin the mans no fool and he knows how to move his men perhaps but better to fight him here than outside akkad even if i lose my city will hold out another army will be raised against him this is a war shulgi cant win he was foolish to even start it even more foolish than his father but you can still end up dead eskkar perhaps if not you can come visit me in akkad one day i think trella would enjoy your company if im victorious ill send word to you in a few months i think youll find akkad a better friend to isin than sumer ever was or will be think about that for the next few days eskkar jerked the halter loose from the bush meanwhile stay in isin until the battle is over after that youd better send men out to fill in the ditch the river might be stronger than alcinor thinks he swung up onto the horse and cantered away without looking back satisfied that he had rendered helpless one of his enemies and struck terror to an entire city sardos would have blurted the threat at the top of his lungs to everyone he met all this accomplished and all without losing a man trella would be pleased day t he next day hathor crossed the euphrates ten miles south of isin just after midday he and his men rode north at an easy pace both men and animals were tired after two days of hard riding since leaving uruk and he wanted to conserve their strength no patrols or force from isin appeared to challenge his presence but he kept a wary eye on his flanks until his men had moved north of the city and he saw eskkars camp cheers broke out from the soldiers when they saw hathors riders approaching he sent a messenger on ahead and found eskkar and gatus waiting for him when he rode up welcome hathor eskkar smiled for the first time all day your wild ride through sumeria will be talked about for many years we had plenty of luck in the desert and at uruk we might have been here sooner but we had to rest the horses after taking the city and theyre weary again weve boatloads of grain waiting for them gatus said but youd better hurry were moving north soon hathor gave the orders to klexor and muta then swung down from his horse wheres shulgi not far now half a days march maybe less his scouts are already nearby keeping an eye on us theyve been watching us all day and isin their horses are scattered and the gates remain closed naxos wouldnt even open them for shulgis messengers they had to shout their messages to those on the wall im sure shulgi wont be pleased when he learns about it hathor laughed at the idea any problems just yavtar he and his ships should have been here this morning shulgi may have found a way to block the river what was he carrying food mostly and the bronze stones for the slingers we already have most of the weapons and youve picked the battleground yes its not ideal but it will have to do theres not enough food for another days march shulgis probably as short of supplies as we are he hasnt been able to move much of what he stored at kanesh yavtars boats have been raiding his ships so our battle will be tomorrow and only the victor will get a decent meal then i can get a good nights rest hathor stretched my ass is sore from twelve days of hard riding eskkar smiled in sympathy ive ridden hard many a time in my life but never for so long well next time you can lead the cavalry and ill stroll along with the infantry agreed but now listen to gatus we need to get moving once again t he akkadian army foot soldiers and horsemen broke camp before the sun touched the horizon they didnt have far to go a mere three miles but eskkar wanted to secure the battle site before shulgis forces reached it the sumerians had shifted a bit north as they drew near isin to make sure they stood between eskkar and any escape route back to the north and akkad they neednt have bothered eskkar had no intention of trying to escape even if he could somehow manage it without food and surrounded by enemies he had to fight gatus left fifty men behind including three on horseback to keep watch on isin and the rest ready with shovels to open the riverbank at the first sign of treachery from naxos the army moved north traveling at a steady pace even as dusk settled over the land they reached the location eskkar had scouted yesterday just as the last of the days light faded from the sky as the akkadians settled in to make camp for the night they saw the first of shulgis fires glowing in the north the sumerians had finally caught up with eskkars forces and now they camped less than three miles away the time for battle had nearly arrived one way or the other tomorrow would decide which city ruled in the land between the rivers day shulgi and razrek sat side by side on the ground hunched over the map spread before them vanar and the other commanders craned over their shoulders to get a better view a fire crackled and hissed nearby shedding its flickering light over the sumerian leaders hell attack tonight probably just before dawn shulgi tapped the map with his dagger thats why hes marched north to get closer to our camp otherwise he would have stayed where he was and tried to fortify his position why would he attack at night he cant use his cavalry very well and his archers will be shooting blindly the barbarian always seems to do what we least expect shulgi said move the men into battle order and have them sleep in shifts in their positions our men and horses are tired and hungry theyll be even more weary if theyre up half the night and if eskkar attacks while were sleeping how weary will they be then the men can sleep tomorrow after weve driven the last of the akkadians into the river and watched them drown razrek hesitated then shrugged in resignation shulgi had been right about eskkars movements and even about uruk and razrek didnt have any good reason to challenge the kings orders especially since word of uruks fall had arrived delivered by a single exhausted rider who had trailed the akkadian force halfway across sumeria they had only heard about the sacking of that city as they ceased the days march to razreks surprise shulgi didnt seemed too concerned about uruk if he doesnt come at night hell dig in in the morning well have to attack him the ground here is as favorable to us as to him shulgi said the river will protect our right flank and he doesnt have enough men to flank us that is assuming your precious cavalry can finally start earning their pay razrek ignored the insult theyd been over that argument at least once a day for the last ten days well brush aside his horsemen assuming you can keep his archers occupied as soon as you do send a few hundred to isin if the akkadians dont flood the city your men can do it ill teach naxos to keep a thousand good men out of the battle despite both naxos and eskkars efforts word of isins plight had reached the sumerians shulgi had flown into a rage when he heard of naxoss refusal to join the fight and for once razrek couldnt blame him somehow the barbarian had managed to pin naxos of all people inside his own walls without shooting a single arrow eskkar will have some tricks for us tomorrow yes im sure he will shulgi agreed were not going to fall for any of them when the battle starts well march straight at his center all you have to do is keep his horsemen off our flank and ill finish eskkars spearmen once theyre gone the rest of his men will turn and run shulgi turned to the rest of his commanders you know your positions tomorrow there will only be one command to close with the enemy as soon as i give the order weve cut off eskkars supply ships and now hes as short of food as we are once were finished with him isin will provide all the food we need or ill have naxoss head on a spear right next to eskkars otherwise ill flood the city myself a few hours fighting tomorrow and the spoils of akkad will be ours just keep the men alert tonight shulgi glanced at his commanders heads nodded in agreement even razreks the akkadian was trapped against the river with no way to cross outnumbered and short of food and supplies tomorrow would see the end of akkads barbarian leader a s the darkness fell some soldiers built a fire near eskkars command post despite the mild summer evening no one had ordered them to do it but they did it anyway to help their leader meet with his men one by one his commanders joined him to report on their men review their orders for tomorrow and take into account any new instructions they formed a tight circle around him some kneeling so that as many could see the map as possible while eskkar waited for the last of his subordinates to arrive he studied the map on the ground before him though its frayed edges and grimy appearance showed how often eskkar and his commanders had consulted it during the last eleven days this map depicted the land around isin and had first been detailed by trellas map makers back in akkad almost a year ago it had proved its use already by determining where to dig the canal to threaten isin but trellas map makers had done more than just identify the landscape they had walked this land studying possible battle sites just as they had done in and around larsa and even sumer itself finding likely places for two armies to clash wasnt as difficult as it first appeared troops from both sides needed water and supplies which kept everyone close to the rivers and streams commanders needed to communicate with their respective cities as well as their own garrisons which suggested other likely trails for troops to move and establish camp all in all nearly a dozen such sites had been studied around the city of isin and eskkars clerks carried maps of all of them sitting crosslegged on the ground he studied the map in silence though by now he knew every line and symbol gatus arrived and took his place beside his captain along with drakis they would lead the spearmen in tomorrows attack and face the brunt of shulgis forces hathor sat on eskkars right with klexor and muta they commanded the cavalry alexar and mitrac would lead the bowmen in support of gatus and shappa and nivar commanded the slingers who would follow hathor yavtar and daro would command the riverboats and their archers the smallest force was that of the ur nammu warriors led by fashod and chinua grond completed the circle facing his friend and commander across the fire of all those present only he had no need to see the map gronds place would be wherever eskkar was when they had all taken their places eskkar turned the map over one of his clerks could sketch and draw eskkar and gatus had spoken to the artist the day before yesterday when they traversed what appeared to be the most likely battleground the man had created a new drawing that showed in detail where eskkar wanted to place his men and where he expected the sumerians to place theirs nothing fancy just blocks with a single symbol within to identify the particular force and its position every head craned forward to get a closer look each commander intent on studying the battleground while they examined the map eskkar lifted his eyes and studied the men surrounding the camp fire hundreds of soldiers had jammed themselves in as close as they dared to hear the words of their leaders they made no sound didnt even talk among themselves and eskkar wondered if some of them werent holding their breath no doubt they expected to be ordered away but eskkar didnt mind the more his men knew about what they would face the easier it would be in the morning with that in mind he raised his voice so that as many as could would hear his words the last report from trellas agents estimates that shulgi had about twentytwo thousand men with him when he left larsa almost a thousand of those are now behind us in isin i expect king naxos will keep them there but our men are still watching isin and guarding the ditch in case those in the city try anything tonight he looked around the circle of commanders so in the morning well face at least twenty one thousand men perhaps more well be outnumbered more than four to one he paused to let the numbers sink in better they heard about the enemys strength tonight than when they first saw the enemy host in the daylight but many of the men shulgi commands are unproven theyve been drawn from all over sumeria and they fight only for the prospect of loot or because theyve been ordered to war by their leaders almost ten thousand are nothing more than men carrying swords most have never fought a battle just as important most of them have little loyalty to shulgi their cavalry is well trained and theyve had plenty of experience fighting the desert tribes altogether shulgi still has at least three thousand horsemen but almost half that number is drawn from the rabble of tanukh desertdwellers that scum of the desert fight like jackals attacking only when they have the advantage fashod has fought them in the past even hunted them for sport hathor and his men have swept through two of their villages he saw tanukh men abandon their wives and children to flee with their horses tell them what you saw eyes turned toward hathor its true they left their women old men and boys behind to die defending their honor and tents very few stood and fought and most of those only because we caught them before they could escape only a coward would leave his family to face death the rest of shulgis army is little better eskkar went on our men have trained for this fight some for as long as two years weve outmarched the sumerians in the last eleven days weve destroyed larsa burned uruk and forced isin to abandon its support for shulgis cause even this place of battle is known to us and the ground will favor our fighters shulgi will have only one tactic to close with us as quickly as possible and try to overwhelm us with their numbers we have prepared even for that again eskkar looked out at the men standing behind the commanders circle he saw no fear no doubts tomorrow we will do what the sumerians least expect they expect us to dig in and wait for their assault instead we will attack them our cavalry will strike their rear like a hammer while our infantry will attack their front lines an anvil of unbreakable strength the sumerians will be caught between the anvil and the hammer and they will be crushed he paused to look around the circle once again now it is time for the commanders to speak if any of you have questions or doubts speak now eskkar had learned long ago to let the most junior commander speak first so as not to be intimidated by the more experienced leaders but this time he turned to gatus as the senior commander we could still attack at night gatus said catch them off guard my spearmen have practiced for a night battle earlier eskkar had asked gatus to speak of a night attack eskkar wanted the men to hear and understand all the reasons for the decision not to try and fight at night no eskkar put all the firmness into the single word that he could the sumerians wait even now for us to attack they are prepared for it and if we attack now they will fight because there is no place to run in the darkness as the night passes they will grow even more certain that we will come if not during the night than at first light their soldiers will get little sleep tonight and tomorrow their legs will be weak in the morning the sumerians will be weary they will see us advancing on their position doubt and fear will fill their throats weaken their knees what courage they have will fade away they will look for any excuse to turn and run and that excuse what will it be gatuss rehearsed words sounded a bit awkward but eskkar doubted any of the soldiers listening nearby with open mouths would notice we are going to strike at the head of the sumerians shulgi is all that holds them together when they see him fall or turn to flee the battle will be over he has only fought against the desert horsemen never fought a real battle so i will take the fight to him let us see if he is willing to face me one by one he spoke to each commander listened to what they had to say answered any questions none he saw with satisfaction needed any reassurance all of them wanted to close with the enemy as much as he did when everyone had had their say eskkar stood make no mistake shulgi is a strong leader and his men will fight hard but he lacks experience and we will take advantage of that weve trained for this battle for months tomorrow is the day we will win it commanders repeat my words to those who could not be close enough to hear our voices i want every man to know what hell face and what to do then tell them to get as much rest as they can he picked up the map and tossed it to his clerk who had stood nearby openmouthed during eskkars speech the map wouldnt be needed any more all of you will lead your men bravely i know our soldiers have already proven themselves they like you will know what to do and tell them that i am proud to lead them into battle and after we win the spoils of sumer will be ours good hunting to all of us tomorrow the fire had nearly burned out and this time no one thought to replenish it eskkar strode into the darkness but not to try and rest instead he walked through the camp talking to the men repeating parts of what hed said earlier again and again he spoke each time with a hundred or more men clustered about him more than a few reaching out to touch his arm many were in awe of him of his reputation he used that trust now he had to rely on them tomorrow and they needed to know that as trella had told him time after time win the loyalty of your men and they will follow you wherever you lead long ago she had foretold him that that someday a thousand men or more would follow him into battle no matter what the odds at the time he thought she spoke without thinking or more likely without understanding how hard it would be to command so many men but as hed often found with trella she always chose her words with care and meant what she said tomorrow her prophecy would come true eskkar intended to lead akkads soldiers against a mighty host and he knew how much risk they all faced at last grond who had stayed at eskkars side as he moved throughout the camp put his arm around his friends shoulder its past midnight captain youve spoken to enough of our men theyll spread your words time to get some rest or youll be too tired to stand in the morning let alone fight they returned to the camp fire one of the few that still burned this late into the night eskkar threw himself down on his blanket the stars shone overhead and he remembered another night watching the stars cross the heavens and knowing a fight to the death waited in the morning balthazar an old shepherd had taught him about the mysteries of the starry heavens that night eskkar wondered if the old man had found the peaceful life that he sought surrounded by his kin balthazar might even still be alive when this battle was over if eskkar survived he decided he would send word to the shepherd perhaps invite him to come visit akkad he was after all a companion in arms one of the few who had fought at eskkars side in the old days tired as eskkar felt sleep would not come he knew that many of his men would be lying there staring at the same heavens and wondering if they would live to see the sun set once again or wondering if they could face the enemy with courage tonight they would think about death and dying about pain and blackness tomorrow they would stare into the eyes of their enemies each man would fight not for akkad not for eskkar but to hold the respect of the men who stood beside him his friends and companions these men had trained together for months or even longer and now the bonds of brotherhood would hold them fast side by side in the face of the enemy he knew one thing for certain tomorrow a lot of men were going to die his soldiers would follow him because he would lead and they would show no fear but deep down inside their bowels they would be afraid nonetheless eskkar had experienced fear before but never felt the battle dread nor the fear that sometimes gripped men the night before a battle banishing sleep but he worried nevertheless the fate of akkad might be decided tomorrow even trellas life and that of his son determined by the deaths of thousands of men he would lead into battle he looked again at the sky the stars seemed so peaceful as they moved across the night but the priests claimed that the tiny sparks of light could foretell a mans future eskkar wished he knew more about them enough to read the ending to tomorrows battle that meant more than his own fate as long as akkad defeated the sumerians he would be satisfied finally he decided there was no use lying there that he might as well be up and about instead he closed his eyes for one last moment of rest and fell into a troubled sleep g rond stretched out beside his friend saw his captains body relax and heard the soft snoring thank the gods he thought his friend would need all his strength in the morning grond let his own eyes close though he slept lightly through the darkness waking often and making sure each time that all was well and that eskkars restless sleep continued without interruption day it seemed to eskkar that he had just closed his eyes when grond awoke him eskkar jerked himself upright sounds of men moving about were all around him not the loud morning sounds of men yawning and complaining themselves awake but the softer sound of men rising and preparing for battle and trying to do it with as little noise as possible when he got to his feet eskkar realized that everyone else was already fully awake a quick glance at the fading moon told him dawn approached nothing to see yet captain grond held a heavy sack in his hand gatus is moving the men in shifts down to the river and back telling them to drink all they can hold every water skin will be filled grond dropped the sack and eskkar heard a clanking noise from within a gift from trella grond said as he untied the cord that held the sack closed he lifted a bronze breastplate she says youre to wear this when you ride to battle yavtars been lugging this up and down the tigris and euphrates for days says hes glad to finally be rid of it i think he was afraid someone would steal it eskkar started to protest but grond cut him off dont argue captain youll need this today every archer will be aiming at your heart and we cant afford to lose you at least until the battles won trella told me not to give it to you until just before the battle so that you wouldnt have a chance to lose it naxos had one like that eskkar had never worn a breastplate they were difficult to make and cost a great deal of gold will it even fit me well see hold this grond handed eskkar the breastplate picked up the back protector and began lacing the two parts together across eskkars shoulders a few quick tugs and it slid into place the two pieces fit perfectly and eskkar suddenly remembered trella a few months ago spending what seemed like half a morning measuring him for a new tunic grond fastened the sides together just above eskkars waist and the breastplate settled onto his chest eskkar took a deep breath half expecting to find some excuse to avoid wearing the armor he felt the weight of the bronze but it moved smoothly and didnt seem to affect his breathing nor did it seem that heavy with its weight distributed over his shoulders at least for now gatus strode over about time you were up thought you were going to sleep right through the fight did he give you any trouble about the bronze gatus wore armor himself but made of thick leather no gatus i think i caught him before he fully woke he hardly protested well then thats taken care of i had half a dozen men waiting to force him into it gatus laughed at the thought and eskkar wasnt sure if he meant it or not with gatus you never knew for certain the last of the food has been handed out and the men are swelling their bellies with water everyones pissing like mad either from too much to drink or because theyre scared to death watch where you step theres shit everywhere i swear theres not a tight bowel in any of them even i dropped a good load always a good sign with the reminder the strong odors of urine and shit caught eskkars attention the urge to relieve himself became urgent and he too decided to walk down to the river it was going to be a long and hot day he splashed into the cool water and washed his face and hands then drank until he could hold no more forcing himself to swallow long after his thirst was satisfied until his belly protested it could hold no more his commanders were moving everyone into position when he returned grond waited there holding eskkars horse the first rays of the sun were starting to lighten the eastern sky and soon the sun would lift itself above the land of sumeria if the sumerians planned to attack at dawn they would find the akkadians ready and waiting grond handed eskkar a loaf of bread eskkar saw there was only one loaf and broke it in two giving half back to his bodyguard dont argue youll need your strength today too he swung up onto the horse boy snorted and pawed the earth sensing the excitement in the air to eskkars surprise he felt relief for two years he dreaded the coming of this day even hoped it would never come now there was nothing left to think about he recalled his fathers words just kill the man in front of you and dont worry about anything else well father today well see how well youve taught me the edge of the sun cleared the horizon and flooded the land with the days first light everyone searched the landscape but no enemy moved toward them though in the distance eskkar could see plenty of movement from the enemy camp sumerian commanders would be moving their men into position as well though he doubted the task would be done as smoothly as the akkadians move the men out gatus and good hunting to you today the old soldier had replaced his usual widebrimmed hat with a bronze helmet that covered his forehead and protected the back of his neck almost to his shoulders but he kept the hat with him hanging by a loop from his belt eskkar understood the battle might not start for some time and the bronze helmet would heat quickly in the sun with the first rays of the sun the mens spirits rose throughout the camp men shouted orders heard them repeated and expanded leaders of ten cursed their slowmoving men pushing the laggards still brushing the sleep from their eyes into position the spearmen moved out first leading the way they marched in a threedeep formation the archers wearing their leather caps and vests fell into place behind them eskkar and grond guided their horses out of their way and joined hathor and fashod shappa and nivar followed the horsemen striding along behind them well weve given them the first surprise hathor jerked his head toward the sumerian camp i dont think they expected us to be marching toward them lets hope thats not all they dont expect fashod your men are ready ready i can scarcely keep them in check the thought of killing so many dirteaters at one time is more than they can stand eskkar smiled at the ur nammu warriors words he hadnt used the term dirteater for months now out of politeness to his allies just keep them under control until i give the signal hathor youd better take your place as well good hunting to you and to you my king no mere title of courtesy sufficed this day the akkadians kept moving taking their time the spearmen marched with their left flank against the euphrates they carried their spears loosely dangling them at arms length in their right hands each spear now showed a thick wrapping just behind the center of the shaft to provide a better grip bronze helmets glinted in the rising sun as they stepped forward eskkar heard the subcommanders keeping order making sure the line moved as one even today or maybe today of all days discipline had to be maintained and a united front presented to their enemies leaders of ten and twenty gave their own commands to keep each group in its proper place and position just as they were trained eskkar thought watching the familiar spectacle of men moving in formation hed seen gatus march his men out a hundred maybe two hundred times before well the routine orders would keep everyones mind off the enemy waiting for them eskkar knew that the sumerians would be sweating already despite their greater numbers they knew they would face a determined force eskkar reached his position at the spearmens right flank he kept the horse at a slow walk to stay even with the infantry from his right nearly eight hundred akkadian cavalry extended out in a line also falling into three ranks grond moved his horse to eskkars left while fashod and chinua rode on eskkars right behind them rode the forty ur nammu warriors they had argued and fought for the honor of riding with eskkar into battle and he had finally agreed as long as they promised to follow orders for them allowing dirteaters to lead the way into battle was almost unthinkable to their sense of honor especially against other dirteaters but they had promised to wait until eskkar gave the signal to attack they sat their horses with ease showing none of the tension or stress that betrayed itself with the slight and nervous movements that the other cavalrymen displayed while most men dreaded battle these warriors lived for it the small signs of nervousness didnt concern eskkar he knew the cavalry would follow where he and hathor led them these men had just raided across sumerian lands and already proved their valor eskkar saw hathor take his station a third of the way down the line of horsemen some of the horses showed as much excitement as their riders the animals tossing heads and pawing the ground sensed the oncoming danger and relied on their riders to reassure them for some of the more nervous riders controlling their mounts now occupied all their attention to the soft swearing of the companions on either side the first third of the cavalry would follow eskkar hathor would lead the next third to deliver the first blow from the hammer klexor and muta had the next position with the last third ready to deliver the second hopefully fatal hammer blow drakis commanded the spearmen on eskkars left expected to be the most dangerous position today he not only had to lead his men but ensure that the sumerian horse fighters didnt flank him to attack from behind by now every infantry man every horse and rider settled into their proper place the akkadians despite moving at a slow pace had traversed almost half the distance to the sumerians demons below look at them grond spoke just loud enough to be heard at eskkars side how many men did you say shulgi had eskkar too had his eyes fixed on the enemy he needed to grasp their positions and notice their leaders more than enough but shulgis the key to this battle its him that we have to kill no matter what happens you make sure he ends up dead lets just hope he isnt thinking the same thing about us s hulgi and razrek had finally readied their weary men once again the cursed akkadians had failed to attack during the night the stakefilled ditch the sumerians had dug to entrap the attackers remained empty another wasted effort when dawn showed an empty expanse between the two forces shulgi had been ready to give the order to advance until he saw eskkars forces on the move coming straight toward him spread out in a line the infantry along the river on shulgis right the cavalry on his left theyre going to attack us razrek couldnt believe his eyes theyre bigger fools than i thought they dont have enough men well flank them and take them from the rear shulgi saw the same thing his line of spearmen and infantry four and five deep stretched from the riverbank across the akkadian spearmen and reached past almost half of eskkars cavalry razreks horsemen shulgis left flank extended far to the east well beyond eskkars line of horsemen get to your men shulgi said when i give the signal charge straight at him and let your left flank swing around and attack his rear are you going to attack first no if they want to come to us well wait here for them behind the stakes shulgi examined his forces looking up and down the line his men were regaining their courage now that they saw how few were the numbers of their enemy no matter how strong the akkadians might be it would only be a matter of time before razreks forces turned their flank and delivered the death blow to their rear no line of spearmen could fight both front and rear i dont see any reserves razrek stretched upright on his horse nothing to protect their rear good then all we need to do is flank them or punch one hole in their line and theyre finished now get moving and i dont care how many men you lose just get behind them g atus halted the men halfway across the empty grassland that separated the two forces the akkadian line rippled and shifted as the men stopped advancing sunlight glinted from the bronze helmets and spear tips the men gulped from their water skins more than a few had to piss again but now they had to remain in place and try not to spray the legs of the man in front of them when they had finished taking care of their needs they rested the butts of their spears on the earth and waited for the next order the two armies were less than a mile apart eskkar glanced to his left just as gatus gave the order to resume the slow advance the initial stage of the attack depended on gatus getting his men into the proper position so the old soldier had command of the first portion of the advance the akkadian spearmen resumed moving forward matched by the cavalry and gradually closed the gap between the two forces this march didnt need to cover much distance and gatus stopped the spearmen for the second time just out of bowshot from the sumerian archers about a quarter of a mile separated the two forces but eskkar guessed that mitracs men might have the range to put a few shafts into the enemy ranks eskkar twisted on his horse and saw that mitrac had his hand to his mouth calling out something to gatus meanwhile the sumerians started shouting at their enemies daring them to come closer they waved their weapons in the air and called curses down on the akkadians eskkar couldnt quite make out the words but he had no doubt what was being said gatuss men remained silent only women and boys talk before a fight gatus had reminded them often enough one of the ur nammu warriors a young man named teadosso disobeyed orders and moved his horse a dozen paces out in front of the first rank before eskkar or anyone could order him back teadosso stood up and balanced himself on his horses back both feet pointed the same direction as he guided the animal down the line of akkadian horsemen at an easy canter at the same time he lifted his tunic and waved his bare backside toward the sumerian cavalry eskkar caught by surprise as much as any of his men couldnt help laughing at the sight teadosso galloped his horse to the end of hathors riders then still standing astride the animal skillfully turned it around and headed back toward eskkars position at the other end of the line as the horse reversed itself teadosso changed his position so as to keep his rear facing the enemy more curses from the sumerians filled the air but even the enemy probably had to admire a good bit of horsemanship everyone was laughing now teadosso returned to eskkars end of the line get back to your place you fool fashod ordered but his tone softened the rebuke teadosso dropped down onto the horses back and guided his mount back to its original position and two or three of his grinning companions clapped him on the shoulder in approval eskkar turned toward gatus a few hundred paces away the old soldier rode just behind his men he waved his sword toward eskkar its time eskkar took a deep breath drew his own sword and held it high then pointed it not toward the enemy but toward hathor move your men out nice and slow his heart beat strongly in his chest as he gave the order and he felt that familiar mix of fear and exhilaration that preceded a battle but it didnt matter now eskkar had committed his men to this battle plan and there was no way to turn back they could only go forward to victory or death hathor repeated the signal and at the last part of the line klexor saw the waving sword he repeated the signal to muta who sat on his horse alone at the far end of the line when he saw the signal muta turned his horse to the flank and started walking eastward as slow as he could make his mount move horse by horse and always remaining in the threeabreast formation the whole line of akkadian cavalry faced to the east and plodded after muta screened by the slowmoving cavalry the slingers walked east as well always keeping the horsemen between themselves and the enemy eskkar and his ur nammu guards were the last to move now he was at the rear of the cavalry which was now being led by muta at the other end behind them they left the right flank of the spearmen exposed but two hundred archers moved up to form a double column not a line along the infantrys right flank when razreks cavalry arrived to turn gatuss flank these archers would have to hold them off f rom behind his infantry shulgi stared in surprise as he watched the akkadian cavalry they were moving east the horses plodding along slowly almost as if they were leaving the scene of the battle as the line extended a gap appeared between the akkadian infantry and the cavalry as shulgi watched that gap began to widen razrek galloped up beside him is he trying to flank us the fools dont have enough men shulgi ignored razreks excited utterance and studied the battleground the akkadian infantry wasnt moving every spear still pointed toward the sky either eskkar was abandoning his spearmen and leaving the field of battle or he intended to try and position himself to ride around the end of razreks horsemen and launch an attack at their rear i can see men behind his cavalry shulgi said i dont see them carrying bows are they the boy slingers hes brought with him hes going to turn our flank and attack from there razrek said ignoring the comments about the slingers your bowmen and infantry wont be of any help if he attacks from that direction theyll be too far away let me attack now shulgi had already considered that option if he let razrek attack without support the akkadian cavalry might be able to deliver a powerful blow to his own horsemen while keeping their infantry intact and if he moved to the attack with his infantry shulgis forces would be giving up their strengthened position behind the row of stakes but if eskkars spearmen retreated shulgis forces would have to chase after them as long as he kept his forces together eskkars men couldnt attack him effectively he decided on a third course of action stop your whining razrek get back to your men keep your horsemen in front of eskkars dont let him flank you no matter what match his movement but stay in line with our infantry whatever trick eskkar might be planning shulgi intended to counter it with overwhelming force razrek whirled his horse around and galloped back to the center of his men form a column and move to the east keep the akkadians in front of you the jeers and curses had all disappeared now replaced by grim expressions word spread through the ranks of the sumerians that king eskkar was trying one of his usual cunning tricks razreks horsemen began to move to their left trying to stay even with eskkars slowmoving cavalry force it took longer for the larger mass of razreks horsemen to wheel to their left but once it did the entire sumerian cavalry began to shift along with the akkadians g atus seated astride his faithful mare behind his lines of spearmen watched the sumerian ranks in front of him as they stared at eskkars movement to the east it was obvious that shulgi intended to remain behind his stakes nevertheless gatus could see the heads of the sumerian spearmen following the movement of their cavalry without raising a sword eskkar had sown some confusion in the enemys ranks mitrac came over to stand beside him his longbow held easily in one hand the archer carried two quivers slung over his shoulder whats happening gatus had the advantage of the horses height to give him a better view the rest of the archers standing behind the front ranks couldnt see much lots of movement in the lines but theyre holding firm theyre sure eskkar is up to something but they dont know what but dont worry about him well be busy soon enough eskkar had given him the most dangerous and difficult assignment gatus had to not only hold off the sumerian infantry he also had to distract them to give eskkar enough time to make his plan work and the time to begin that distraction had arrived alexar drakis move the men forward and keep it slow he turned to mitrac now its up to you orders were barked and the line of spearmen rippled and shifted spears lowered once again to the marching position then the three ranks began to move taking their time as the formation moved ever closer to shulgis forces waiting behind their line of stakes the akkadians moved slowly across the gap mitrac trotted a dozen paces away from gatus to keep a better view of his own men now mitrac had to worry more about the disposition of his bowmen than anything else he was the one who would decide when to halt the formation far enough gatus mitrac had both hands to the sides of his mouth as he shouted the words weve a bit of a breeze behind us halt gatus bellowed the command repeated by his commanders and subcommanders the advancing spearmen stopped moving the line almost as straight and smooth as if they were practicing back in akkads barracks according to gatuss count they had advanced a little more than a hundred and twenty paces mitrac shouted another command and his seven hundred bowmen halted braced their feet wide apart and put shafts to the bowstrings the master archer paused to glance up and down the line of archers everyone appeared ready his was the command that would start the actual fighting draw your shafts loose shoot at will gatus watched the first flight of arrows whistle high into the sky level off and begin its descent before they reached the highest part of their flight another seven hundred shafts were launched a third wave of arrows flew upwards even as the first wave descended on the enemy at first gatus thought mitracs bowmen had stopped too soon but then gatus saw the arrows strike the enemy shield wall many shafts fell short but most rained down on the upraised shields the arrows sounded a soft drumming note when they struck but gatus also heard men screaming as a few shafts found crevices and gaps between shields keep shooting mitrac bellowed the commands even as he worked his own bow pull every shaft to the ear get them up in the air the sumerian archers fired their own weapons but almost all the arrows landed twenty or thirty paces short of the akkadians a small enough distance gatus realized a shift of the wind to the opposite direction could bring the enemy bowmen within range but for now at least most of the sumerian weapons did not have the same reach the akkadian archers needed months of practice to build up their strength so as to draw the heavy bows to the maximum some of these men had trained with their weapons for as many as four years had fought from the wall against the alur meriki horsemen gatus whirled the mare around and glanced at his rear a steady stream of men trotted from the waters edge each carrying four quivers of arrows in their arms six of yavtars supply boats had managed to reach eskkars forces just after midnight along with three fighting ships yavtars force had encountered king shulgis boats and archers almost twenty miles upriver and it had taken a hard battle before the akkadian ships broke through at the cost of losing five boats now the surviving vessels crept along the river behind the marching soldiers carrying thousands of extra shafts and stones for the slingers as well although those werent needed yet gatus raised his eyes to the horizon and saw nothing eskkar had assured him that naxos wouldnt come out of his city but gatus hadnt been so sure but the land behind them lay empty not even any of razreks men had attempted to swing around behind them yet turning the horse back toward the sumerians gatus glanced to his right eskkar and the cavalry had ever so slowly opened a gap of about two hundred paces between the two halves of the akkadian army that gap would tempt the sumerians soon enough the bowmen kept launching shafts into the sky grunting now with the effort to pull each arrow back to the ear before releasing empty quivers littered the ground beneath them each archer had already emptied one quiver and their second would be exhausted soon those arrows already more than twenty thousand would be taking their toll on the enemy despite the sumerian shields no more carefully timed volleys now better to have the arrows arrive continually gatus knew so that every enemy would be afraid to show his face many arrows fell short but most reached the enemy position the sumerian infantry had their shields raised up to cover their heads but a few shafts here and there would slip over or under the protection wounding or killing when they did a shield couldnt cover every part of the soldiers body not unless the man hunched himself down like a dog behind it the sumerian archers returned the volleys supposedly sumer had two thousand archers more than twice the number of akkadian bowmen but as gatus knew giving a man a bow didnt make him a bowman he turned to his right to see eskkar still moving slowly away from the akkadian spearmen at least eskkar and his horsemen wouldnt be under attack by shulgis archers gatus knew they had reached the most dangerous time of the battle the arrows raining down on the sumerians would make it difficult to get their infantry moving but if shulgi sent his men charging toward the akkadians spearmen they would likely be overwhelmed by sheer force of numbers nevertheless the sumerians remained behind their line of stakes they wouldnt want to give up that position readily and the odd movement of the akkadian cavalry would be proving a distraction eskkar and gatus had to give young shulgi the chance to make a mistake and making him worry about bowmen on the one side and eskkars odd maneuvering on the other just might do the trick gatus turned his mare to the side and trotted over to where mitrac stood just behind his double line of bowmen the young master archer was using his own bow but gatus saw that he kept his eyes on his men as well its up to you mitrac gatus shouted youll have to loosen that position mitrac nodded we will their archers cant reach our men we can keep shooting all day if we have to they cant stand up to this for long even as mitrac said the words another handful of panting men arrived carrying fresh bundles of arrows that they distributed to replace those already launched thanks to yavtars boats the akkadians had plenty of shafts the old sailor had delivered thousands of arrows with the last of his boats gatus wondered how many arrows shulgis archers had with them theyd likely lugged those arrows from sumer to kanesh to larsa and now to isin the sumerians would get their first surprise soon enough theyd be expecting the number of akkadian arrows to diminish as the archers shot most of their shafts but with yavtars last cargo that wasnt going to happen not for some time the akkadian bowmen continued their assault on the sumerian lines gatus could see men going down despite the shields and many of the shafts were falling behind the line of spears no doubt striking at the sumerian archers who had to be as close as possible to their front line to have even a hope of reaching the akkadians the enemy would be growing nervous fearful aware that death could strike at any moment from the sky thousands of arrows had already been loosed with only a few sumerian shafts able to reach gatuss men again gatus stretched himself upright on his horse hed seen movement in the sumerian ranks the center where the enemy cavalry butted against the infantry had started to thin gatus snorted perhaps eskkars luck might hold up one more time he knew eskkar and the cavalry would begin their charge any moment now was the moment to give shulgi something else to think about he filled his lungs with air spearmen ready your weapons prepare to advance gatus looked up and down the line to make sure every commander stood ready advance the battle cry akkad roared from more than three thousand warriors the first sound theyd uttered today the spearmen began marching toward the sumerians the front rank holding their shields to the front the second and third ranks holding their shields high to protect against descending arrows that would soon be arriving in greater numbers as they closed within range of their enemy behind the spearmen mitrac issued his own orders seven hundred bowmen continued their shooting arcing their shafts up into the air to fall on the crowded sumerian ranks of infantry and archers the akkadian archers moved forward as they shot their shafts spread out in a ragged line and staying just far enough behind the spearmen so that they could launch their arrows without shields the only protection the bowmen had came from the spearmen and the fact that the sumerian archers were now directing their arrows at the advancing infantry to stop the akkadian advance spearmen halt gatus gave the order before the men had moved another hundred paces his soldiers expected the command so they maintained their ranks he waited until all the forward movement had ceased spearmen retreat the subcommanders and leaders of ten repeated the command and the spearmen began backing up moving with care since they had to keep their shields up and maintain their ranks mitracs bowmen retreated also but they kept loosing shafts as they moved maintaining their position just behind the spearmen for the sumerians this must seem a strange sight to see their enemy first advancing then retreating in good order and all the while maintaining their shield wall gatuss men had trained for months to execute such a maneuver it was an infantry movement he doubted the sumerians could duplicate when the men had returned almost to their starting point gatus called a halt a few bodies lay scattered on the ground in front of his men so the sumerians had caused some damage he saw that mitrac too had lost a few bowmen dead or wounded they had little protection just their leather helmets and vests that might stop a shaft at this range but not if the distance diminished but the archers kept firing and arrows kept leaping off their bows to rise into the sky and descend on the enemy already the front wall of sumerian shields appeared to be covered with arrows something had to break soon he knew shulgi should be getting rattled by now at least thats what gatus hoped on the river yavtar watched the soldiers form up and move northward as soon as they moved out he issued orders and his own three fighting boats pushed away from the riverbank just after dawn three of the cargo ships had departed in the middle of the night carrying wounded men and sacks of loot intended for akkad yavtar had wished the boat captains good luck and guessed they would need it for them the first stage of the slow passage upriver might be more dangerous today than fighting shulgis army yavtar had hoped to have five or six of the big war boats here today but shulgis blockade had left him with only three at least he had some of the rowers and archers from the lost boats so each craft had more than its usual compliment of bowmen his three vessels would deliver a deadly sting to the sumerian army but whether any of them would survive the encounter remained an unanswered question no one at least as far as he knew had ever used boats as floating platforms for archers or contemplated using them against a massive land army with his three craft well away from shore they rowed up river already struggling to keep station with gatuss spearmen whose easy strides covered the ground faster than his boat crews could row each ship had raised its sail but the linen squares hung limp in the still air later in the morning yavtar expected a slight breeze from the south that might help but this early in the day such winds seldom appeared the boat crews had to row hard just to keep from being shoved downriver by the current since the boats carried extra men the heavily laden vessels handled even worse than usual each craft carrying more than twenty archers and a dozen rowers his men struggled with the oars thrusting them deep into the brown waters of the euphrates and pushing with all their strength forcing the craft forward against the current the archers provided some assistance they used the few extra paddles to help drive the boats yavtar had intended to take the lead but another craft slid easier through the water despite yavtars steady cursing at his own rowers and until finally he waved the other boatmaster ahead settling into the second position daro in command of all the archers also directed the bowmen on yavtars craft daro kept moving up and down the line making sure the broad shields sat firmly in their place and that every man had plenty of arrows and extra bowstrings at hand pull you dogs yavtars bellow carried across the water to all three craft gatus is moving ahead damn you pull a few men had enough breath to laugh at their commanders eagerness to get into battle stroke by stroke the ships clawed their way upriver until they rode alongside gatus and his spearmen only a hundred paces away keep rowing we need to be ahead of them when the spearmen launched their real attack theyd be running as fast as they could cover the ground the sooner the infantry could close the distance the less time the enemy archers would have to launch shafts at them that meant yavtar needed to be well ahead of gatuss infantry fortunately the river widened a bit and the boats began to move faster through the water slowly drawing ahead of gatus and his spearmen as soon as yavtar saw that hed be in position he took a moment to study the enemy his eyes widened at the sight of so many men no one had ever assembled such a host before he could scarcely believe what he saw yavtar had heard the estimates seen the numbers but to actually face so many their upright spears glinting in the sun he wondered how eskkar could maintain his steadfastness of purpose let alone his belief in victory even more yavtar wondered how the soldiers marching forward maintained their trust in their commander eskkars reputation had much to do with that of course but most of all eskkar believed in himself and the men sensed and shared in that belief the king had once remarked that every battle hed ever fought hed been outnumbered did you ever think of run not fighting yavtar had corrected himself just in time every time eskkar replied smiling at his friend seeing the enemy host yavtar wondered what thoughts might be tempting the king today what a sight daro finished checking his bowmen and joined yavtar at the rear of the boat just ahead of the steering oar he stared in amazement at the enemy army two crewmen crouched right behind yavtar one holding the steering oar and the other ready to take his place should an arrow take him a larger than usual shield gave them good protection but under no conditions did yavtar want to end up with his boat beached on the riverbank due to the loss of the steersman i think im glad to be on the water yavtar said following daros gaze to the shore if disaster struck the akkadians the boats would have a chance to escape though they would still have to maneuver past the narrow bend in the river a few miles from here yesterday shulgi had spread his boats and men across the water and caused the sinking of half a dozen boats before yavtar could break free but the sumerians might have abandoned that place once the battle started its a long way back to akkad daro strung his own bow then tested the pull thumbring and wrist gauntlet were already in place lets hope we dont have to row all the way there look there goes the cavalry yavtar couldnt keep the excitement from his voice eskkars horsemen were on the move walking slowly away from the spearmen gatus had already halted his men the boat crews caught their breath now they just had to hold their position until the next advance my bowmen are ready to fight daro said theyd rather shoot arrows than row any time good luck and good hunting to you daro and to you yavtar remember to keep low and stay behind the shields i think were going to have thousands of arrows launched at us the idea of a thousand arrows striking the boat made yavtars mouth go dry the archers would be behind shields but they would still have to expose part of their bodies to launch their shafts and his crew would still have to work the boat despite the enemys missiles many on board were going to die yavtar reached down and scooped up a water skin half hidden beneath the steering bench better take one last drink before we start he took a few swallows then handed the skin to daro while the archer drank yavtar retrieved another skin from a deeper recess and a few swallows of wine cant hurt either deciding there would always be plenty of water from over the side to drink yavtar took a deep pull from the wine skin then handed it to daro daro accepted that skin as well to victory he lifted the skin as if it were a cup and drank deep yavtar took another look at shulgis army ill drink to that ill even drink to having a drink tomorrow night if were still alive he took back the wine skin and swallowed as much of the strong liquid as he could force down his throat its going to be a long day he explained and i dont want to get thirsty later from the shore gatuss spearmen gave their battle cry and began moving forward the men maintaining their position it appeared as though a solid block of shields and spear points were on the move its time daro moved forward to his place in the center of the boat pull for all your worth yavtar shouted he tossed the wine skin to the two men behind him might as well finish that were going to need it once again the three ships slowly gathered way against the current for the first time in anyones memory boats were going to be in the thick of a land battle yavtar checked his sword for the tenth time and moved toward the bow of the vessel soon theyd be far enough upriver to see what lay behind the enemy lines gatuss infantry halted for the second time but yavtar continued moving forward and soon his three little boats had drawn almost even with the enemy ranks so far no one had loosed an arrow at them but yavtar knew that would soon change once they saw how powerful a sting rode the river daros voice rose up echoing out over the calm water bowmen loose at will after the training volleys that yavtar had seen in akkads training ground or the northern camps the few shafts from daros archers seemed puny indeed but soon more than sixty bowmen spread out over three ships were launching shafts at shulgis right flank many fell short but yavtar knew that would change in a few moments as the range shortened as the ships continued making headway against the river the archers were on their fifth or sixth shaft before the sumerians returned the first volley daro shouted a warning and yavtar looked up to see a cloud of shafts arch up into the sky then begin to fall toward his ship for a moment it seemed as if every single arrow were aimed right at him he ducked down behind the shield practically shoving his face into the bilge water just as the shafts struck home in a moment the ship was riddled with shafts protruding from every surface as the arrows struck the wooden hull or shields a loud drumming came from the wood as if each shaft were a hammer blow to yavtars surprise not a bowmen went down under the first volley he picked up his own round shield and held it between his head and shore so he could see what was happening the lead ship was shooting arrows as well already in range to reach targets well back from the river to his rear yavtar saw that the third boat had turned away from the shore for a moment then righted its course once again a body fell into the water but its archers continued to launch their arrows a quick glance toward shore saw that gatuss spearmen continued moving slowly toward the sumerian line but as they drew within a quarter mile or so they halted the front rank had its shields held up while the second and third ranks raised them over their heads behind them he saw mitracs archers begin shooting yavtar can you get us a little closer to the shore daros bellow shook yavtar out of his fascination with the battle on shore yavtar took a quick glance at the water flowing beside the hull then at the riverbank the water would be deep enough and the current about the same it seemed madness to draw closer to the enemy bowmen but today no one worried about that he scrambled back to the rear of the craft hunched over the whole way he found himself muttering prayers to the god of the rivers and hoping an arrow wouldnt find his backside as he wriggled past the grunting archers and sweating rowers move us in closer about twenty paces the steersmans face went a shade whiter at the order hurry daro wants a closer shot the man nodded his understanding and he pushed on the oar with hands that shook more from fear than the force of the river the craft responded well turning slightly and edging closer to the shore yavtar glanced at the other boats hopefully they would remember their orders to take station wherever yavtars vessel went daro shouted orders to his men soon arrows from sixty archers again began striking the partially exposed right flank of the sumerian spearmen the enemy had their shields raised up for protection against mitracs shafts and daros arrows werent a numbing volley but even yavtars hurried glimpses over the side of the boat showed the attacks effect the sumerian spearmen anchoring shulgis right flank had to shift some shields to protect their exposed right sides meanwhile arrows from the akkadian archers behind the ranks of gatuss spearmen continued to fall on them daros men had an unheard of opportunity to loose their shafts down the solid mass of the enemys main battle line even shafts that glanced off an upraised shield might strike another target before they came to rest no infantry expected to be under continual fire like that from two directions especially not at such close range if the sumerians could have mounted even a brief charge the akkadian bowmen would be slaughtered but at least seventyfive paces of water remained between the boats and the river bank and daros archers were as much out of reach as if they were on the other side of the river unless shulgi wanted to order swimmers into the river to try and board the boats he could do nothing except have his archers shoot back at them by now the sides of the boat and the shields were riddled with arrows at least two of daros men were down one wounded in the leg and out of the fight another dead with an arrow in his throat but the akkadian shafts continued to fly at the sumerian ranks each boat had pushed away from shore that morning with two hundred and fifty shafts for every archer an enormous reserve of arrows and more than enough to allow a steady fire and yavtar knew these bowmen could do it shooting shaft after shaft drawing each feather to the cheek before releasing the arrow the bowmen ignored the bellowed threats and curses from the shore yavtars shouting of orders that passed up and down the length of the boat and even the harsh breaths and grunts each man made as he released his missile the snapping of bowstrings mixed with the steady drumming of sumerian arrows striking every wooden surface on the boat added to the din yavtar had fought before but nothing compared to this frenzy of conflicting noise on the shore shulgis commanders soon recognized the danger in the boats attacking them an entire company of sumerian bowmen shifted their position and started launching arrows at the three vessels that lay just out of reach bowmen daros voice boomed out over the battle din maximum range aim for their leaders aim for the red banner yavtar risked another glance but couldnt see any banner daro must have caught sight of a worthy target perhaps shulgi himself or one of his commanders yavtar saw the bowmen elevate their weapons even higher sending the shafts high into the sky to rain down well away from the riverbank and close to the position occupied by the sumerian leaders it seemed odd to be shooting at something that wasnt shooting back at you but the archers didnt seem concerned about that they just kept launching their shafts at whatever target their leaders selected grunting with every effort to draw the string back to the full force position before letting fly yavtar wondered if these latest shafts aimed high into the sky were having any effect he watched gatuss men first advance and then fall back an orderly movement that kept their lines and shield wall intact still the sumerians hadnt budged from their position which wasnt a good sign by now yavtar expected that the enemy would have abandoned their defensive positions to come to grips with their attackers he decided to move the boats a little more upriver to catch a glimpse what lay behind shulgis main battle line it might confuse the sumerians who would be expecting the ships to stay just ahead of gatuss spearmen move the boats upriver with both hands cupped to his mouth yavtars bellow carried to the other two ships and he repeated the message twice in each direction at least three hundred paces pull you lazy bastards pull he turned to find daro staring at him but the questioning look on the master bowmans face gave way to approval good idea daro too had to shout to be heard well be able to see behind them he raised his voice keep shooting as fast as you can the three ships moved ponderously forward pulling well ahead of gatuss line if yavtar could maneuver the boats even a small distance behind the sumerian front daros archers should be able to create havoc the ships crept steadily upriver the enemy either didnt notice or didnt care yavtars vessel still in the center of the little fleet had drawn almost even with the sumerian line when the arrows stopped arriving the cessation of enemy arrows drumming against the hull tempted yavtar to take a good look at the sumerians on the shore at least a thousand bowmen had shifted their positions readying themselves to fire directly at the boats the men moved quickly formed ranks facing the river and drew their bows yavtar turned to daro but the archer had already grasped the significance and shouted new orders to his men a few moments later the first volley hurtled toward the ships yavtar hunched down below the boats hull and shouted a warning to his steersmen and rowers to do the same daro and his men ducked behind their shields the thudding impact of the first volley was strong enough to make the boat lurch in the water before yavtar had time to congratulate himself on being alive more arrows struck creating a hammering sound that went on and on the limp sail even captured a dozen shafts entangled in the thick linen while plenty of others just passed through looking forward he saw more arrows protruding from the vessels sides like blades of grass in a field if it werent for the outriggers slipped into place right after the morning launch the boats might have capsized from the extra weight of all those arrows alone every one of the archers had dropped to his knees and huddled close to the shields while the rain of death poured down on them but the moment the volleys ended daro ordered his men to return to their shooting positions yavtar counted four more bowmen down victims of the savage volleys either dead or out of the fight probably the losses would be about the same on the other boats but daro still had a battle grimace on his face and every man that could fight still launched his shaft with a full pull of his bow something burned along his cheek and yavtar realized a shaft had just missed his eye he felt the warm blood dripping down his face and he hunched a little closer to the wooden shield not much thicker than the width of his thumb all that stood between himself and almost certain death from the slight incline that provided some height shulgi still had to strain upwards on his horse to take in the entire battlefield what he did see caused his brief moment of exultation to turn to anger again the akkadians had finally advanced within bowshot but then they retreated almost as quickly meanwhile their cursed archers were wreaking havoc on his bowmen and infantry the spearmen at least had their shields but the rear ranks of archers and foot soldiers were taking losses at an alarming rate now those damned riverboats had crept further up the river almost level with his own position and launched arrows at his spearmens right flank and even toward his command post once again the main force of akkadian archers remained just out of reach of his smaller bows and though he had three times as many archers they might as well have stayed in sumer for all the good they were doing they couldnt even stop the handful of enemy archers on the ships who kept shooting despite the massive volleys that hed ordered directed at them shulgi we have to advance now their archers are cutting our men to pieces he turned to find vanar beside him a shield held up high to protect his head his commanders wide eyes reflected his concern shulgi took another look toward eskkars horsemen still moving slowly to the east not yet i want to see what eskkars cavalry are doing damn eskkar whatever hes up to weve got to close with those bowmen the men are already looking behind them theyll be running soon the akkadians should have been out of arrows by now the riverboats must have resupplied them we have to attack now shulgi gritted his teeth he wanted to wait at little longer but if even a few men started to run he knew what that would lead to all right give the order to advance move them all forward make sure they all move together we need to strike the enemy with a solid line they will and the sooner the better vanar shouted the orders as he turned away and the subcommanders repeated it the sumerian spearmen raised a cheer as the preliminary commands worked their way up and down the ranks they welcomed the order better to move forward on the attack than just stand there taking enemy fire and plenty of men in the sumerian ranks wanted revenge for larsa as shulgi watched the first rank after some pushing and shoving moved forward slipping between or knocking aside the stakes driven into the ground yesterday in preparation for the akkadian night attack that had never come shulgi urged them on his sumerians looked as eager to close with the akkadians as he was theyd chased eskkars army for days and now wanted nothing better than to cut them apart shields held high they moved forward he turned to see razreks cavalry on the move continuing to shift so as to contain eskkars moving horse fighters then shulgi saw the gap between his infantry and horsemen begin to grow razrek was supposed to keep the left flank of the spearmen protected instead hed left it exposed as he moved his men eastward shulgi turned to one of his messengers move up the tanukhs have them close that gap and send a rider to razrek and tell him to protect our flank shulgi had kept a quarter of the tanukhs in reserve almost three hundred fighters intending to send them in where they might be needed they might not be as steady as razreks men but they would do until razrek got his horsemen under control for now shulgi wanted to maintain a solid line as much to overawe his enemy as protect his center o ut of the corner of his eye eskkar watched the movement in the sumerian lines he saw the small gap developing but forced himself to continue plodding east he needed to get all of the sumerian horse in motion and once they started he knew they would find it hard to stop the horses would want to keep moving if nothing else across the gap between the two cavalry forces razreks men not as well trained or used to following orders began to move faster and faster to the east determined to stay ahead of eskkars horsemen so that when the attack command came they could easily sweep around eskkars flank eskkar i think its time gronds voice betrayed his excitement more than five hundred paces now separated eskkar from gatus and the spearmen and the rest of the line stretched far ahead keep steady not yet eskkar kept his eyes on klexor and muta at the far end of the line still pacing their horses steadily to the east eskkar had ordered his commanders not to turn their heads around but to keep their eyes and those of their men straight ahead until they heard eskkars signal he gritted his teeth and let the horse take another dozen steps before he allowed himself to turn his head toward the sumerians the small gap shifted and opened a bit more as the horses kicked some dust into the air he glimpsed men milling around in the rear of the infantry behind shulgis command post a force of horsemen remained in the rear no doubt a reserve suddenly he saw a cluster of men that must be shulgis guard surrounding a trio of tall red banners that would be where he would find shulgi if eskkar could see shulgi that meant the moment had come he took a deep breath fashod now akkadians attack the bellowed order carried down the line and even as he uttered it eskkar wheeled his horse around and kicked it into a gallop fashod barked his own command in the harsh gutturals of the ur nammu and eskkar heard it repeated up the warriors though by now it didnt matter the pounding of the horses hooves relayed the moment of attack as well as any words as soon as he had the horse moving at a dead run he brought up the two javelins that hed carried in his right hand held along the side of the horse eskkar might not be able to shoot a bow from horseback like his kinsmen or some of his own cavalry but his powerful arm could still hurl the javelin as hard and as accurately as any of his followers like the tip of a spear he headed straight for the small break in the sumerian lines that had opened between the sumerian foot soldiers and their cavalry behind eskkar his gleaming helmet and breastplate catching the sun charged the ur nammu warriors already fitting shafts to their bows their war cries burst across the gap and managed to rise above the din of the akkadian archers the frightening sounds of the steppe barbarians riding to war in a few dozen strides and determined to lead the charge they drew abreast of eskkars stallion and he had to urge his horse again just to keep up with them as soon as eskkar began the charge hathor and klexor also tugged their horses around and followed the entire akkadian cavalry aimed directly like the shaft of a spear at shulgis command post driving at a full gallop every rider shouting his war cry as they cut diagonally across the open space months and years of training to teach horse and rider to respond to every command no matter how odd now proved its worth the akkadian charge led by eskkar and fashod was only thirty horses wide but the entire mass of hathors cavalry followed in their steps they rode as wildly as any barbarian horde with the fastest moving to the front and the slower following behind all intent on closing with the enemy as fast as possible arrows flew toward eskkar and those leading the charge a few striking the horsemen but the sumerian archers were far to the left of the line many having been shifted to the river to deal with the akkadian boats and not all that remained had a clear shot and at a full gallop the moments eskkar and his men were under fire from the enemy archers would be brief indeed eskkar shifted one lance to his left hand and raised the other in his right hand the horses thundered across the shaking ground and already he could see his foes shouting at each other in confusion no one had expected the akkadians to attack the sumerian infantry at their flank especially not with so many of razreks horsemen ready to oppose such an attempt eskkar saw one or two already taking a few steps backward unsure of what to do at about one hundred and fifty paces from the enemy eskkar heard fashod signal the ur nammu warriors to loose their arrows some had already launched their shafts counting on the speed of their horses to propel the arrow the extra distance all the missiles flew straight at the sumerians directly in their path those still trying to fill the gap that first flight didnt have much effect but in moments every one of eskkars mounted bowmen were loosing shafts as fast as they could guiding their horses with their knees and still managing to give their war cries with so many men before them they had no need to aim just launch as quickly as possible eskkar glimpsed horsemen urging their horses forward to fill in the gap but now arrows were striking at them horses were hit disrupting the movement wounded animals tried to flee frightened at the mass of horses approaching them others reared up in simple fright eskkar took all this in as he galloped from behind more arrows from his own riders flew just over his head striking at the sumerian horsemen moving to fill the gap caught in the battle rage eskkar gave voice to the battle cry of his fathers as he hurled himself toward shulgis forces nevertheless the enemy horsemen kept moving forward from the rear and the empty gap began to disappear however the number of defenders moving into position remained small for the moment and by now nothing could stop the akkadians hurtling down on them the distance between the forces vanished eskkar saw a sumerian horse fighter struggling to control his horse and aiming an arrow at him eskkar flung the lance with all his strength arching it up slightly its flight intensified by the speed of his horse the shaft struck the man in the chest the force of the blow knocking him backward off the horse eskkar had just enough time to snatch the second lance from his left hand and hurl it toward the mass of riders moving toward him then he jerked the sword from his scabbard as his horse burst in the midst of the tanukh riders the ur nammu warriors screaming like demons beside and behind him a touch of the halter guided the stallion between two sumerians one man went down from eskkars sword swinging down with all his strength while the second was knocked from his horse by the stallions shoulder more arrows fired at a dead run by both the ur nammu and the akkadians still charging behind their leaders hissed through the air striking down men and horses alike everything in their path javelins too flung by most of the cavalry struck with devastating effect behind eskkar hathor and his men were screaming their war cries the sound drowning out any sumerian battle cries eskkar and grond at the head of the ur nammu broke through the thin first rank and smashed their way deep into the tanukhs moving to fill the gap the desert horsemen still shifting into position recognized the barbarian war cries though they had no idea of how few such men eskkar had with him a handful took one look at eskkars forces and decided they wanted no part in fighting steppe warriors they turned their horses away unwilling to face their hereditary foes nevertheless the sheer mass of tanukhs slowed eskkars charge and soon his stallion labored to push its way forward urged on by the pressure of eskkars knees the great sword rose and fell striking at anything that came within reach man or beast just as the charges momentum seemed about to stall ur nammu shafts fired with rapidity cleared the path ahead with one last blow of his sword eskkar burst through the last of the tanukhs grond at his side a savage kick to his horses ribs drove the animal forward a hundred paces away shulgis guard had formed up around their leader some had bows and they launched arrows at the charging akkadians toward shulgis guard a shaft rattled against eskkars bronze breastplate before glancing off and he felt the force of the blow another shaft hissed by his face and he felt something else glance against the bronze helmet then arrows didnt matter as the two forces collided eskkars sword came down with all his strength knocking aside an enemy blade raised in defense with grond and the ur nammu and two hundred other horse fighters eskkar had thrust himself deep into the rear ranks of the sumerians shulgis fighters driven back at first finally managed to slow the attack by sheer numbers now swords rose and fell as eskkar kept pushing his horse forward determined to close with shulgi the sumerian kings men no less determined tried to halt the deadly advance toward their leader the jam of horseflesh and men blocked the way and eskkar found himself fifty paces from shulgis red standards still waving gaily in the gentle breeze surrounded on all sides by desperate men fighting to the death all eskkar could do was strike as hard and fast as he could he struck a horse in the forehead and it reared up screaming in pain a following thrust caught its rider in the belly another rider pushed forward to take his place and eskkars stallion butted shoulders with the new attacker on all sides horses neighed and screamed either from fright or wounds as they pushed against each other at the brutal urging of their riders men too screamed in pain or in rage as swords swung with all the force each man could muster clashed against the bronze blades raised against them gronds horse went down its legs in a tangle and eskkar saw his bodyguard crash to the ground in spite of his fury eskkars advance slowed and stopped he found himself beset on all sides with thrusting blades and spears his horse reared up screaming in pain and sending eskkar sliding down the animals rump unable to maintain his seat he landed on a stillmoving body as the horse turned into a kicking and biting beast striking at anyone within reach a twitching tanukh body beneath him had taken a lance in the throat eskkar seized it with his left hand and jerked it free hed managed to hang onto his sword the battle rage still swept over him a war cry burst from his lungs and he charged forward into the mass of men and horses before him two strikes of the sword cleared his advance and he thrust the lance into a horses open mouth before the rider could get close enough to bring his blade to bear ducking under another wild swing he extended his body and drove the point of the sword through a mans stomach using lance and blade he cut his way forward i gnoring eskkars battle hathor and three hundred men closed the gap shifted slightly to their left and smashed into the flank of the sumerian spearmen disrupting the enemy infantry remained his primary task arrows and javelins flew through the air striking into the midst of the spearmen still trying to advance against the akkadians sumerian commanders screamed orders and tried to turn the line to face hathors horsemen a few managed to do so and raised their shields and spears against this new foe but the sumerians had only a small number of men opposing hathors three hundred and he had the advantage of numbers at the point of contact akkadian javelins hurtled through the air at such close range many found their target even those that missed striking flesh penetrated the sumerian shields entangled themselves and hindered the spearmens efforts to form a line hathor grunted in satisfaction at what he saw spearmen to withstand infantry need to be in a formed line and moving forward now horses and men clashed over the ragged remnants of the sumerian left flank stepping over the dead and dying the enemy continued to try and shift their position to face this sudden threat urged on by the desperate shouts of their commanders despite those efforts the left flank of sumers spearmen crumbled under hathors ferocious onslaught then started to collapse as the men were driven backward pushing and shoving against others still in ranks disrupting them further and preventing them from facing the akkadians nevertheless the dense mass of infantry slowed hathors advance horses went down stabbed by enemy spears wounded animals mad with pain lashed out at friend and foe alike horsemen flung to the ground found themselves scrambling away from spears thrust at them the akkadians drew their swords and kept fighting they had no other choice the sumerians had to be broken or all was lost any retreat would give the sumerians time to reform ranks and drive the akkadians before them but hathors men knew they only needed to roll up the end of the sumerian flank and help was on the way he glimpsed klexor leading a wild charge into the rear of the enemy still at the tip of his men hathor screamed his war cry the sumerians had never managed to shift their line by now the akkadians had hurled all their lances swords rasped from scabbards as hathors horsefighters flung themselves into what remained of the left flank of the sumerian spearmen in his excitement he fell back into his native language but the harsh egyptian challenge needed no translation hathors horse ploughed deep into the confused mass of sumerians knocking one man backwards into the ranks hathors sword swung down crunching loudly through another mans shoulder his horse lashed out with his hooves knocking another spearman to the earth hathor urged the horse forward leaning aside to let a thrust spear slip past then striking hard the mans arm the shriek of pain added to the din of men shouting horses neighing and bronze blades clashing against shields and spears by now the enemy left flank had crumbled into a disorderly mass of men struggling to get away from the akkadian horsemen nevertheless some sumerians fought bravely with a scream of panic hathors horse stumbled and went down a spear thrust between its forelegs hathor felt the first trembling through his legs and leapt aside as his horse crashed into the earth kicking and biting at anything that moved another horse brushed past him as he struggled to regain his footing the snorting beast hurtling over hathors downed mount an enemy spearman lunged at hathor but he struck the spear aside stepped inside the length of the weapon and drove his sword into the face of the sumerian blood spurted over the length of his arm as the dying man shrieked in agony at close quarters and without the support of orderly ranks knitted together the sumerian spears turned into clumsy weapons hathor dodged and weaved his way between them striking at everything shield spear or man that he could reach two sumerians shields locked moved toward him but before they could get close enough an arrow split the skull of one of the men transfixing its length just below his mouth hathor struck aside the other spear and flung his weight against the mans shield the foe lacked hathors size and he stumbled back exposing his right side hathor swung his sword with both hands the sharp blade cutting through the mans upper arm and eliciting a scream of agony hathor had no idea of how the battle was progressing all he could do was try to stay alive and strike at anyone within reach all around him men were fighting struggling some even without weapons in their hands suddenly a riderless horse reared up before him kicking out with both its front hooves hathor ducked under an enemy sword and shoved the man to the earth two quick steps allowed him to catch the panicky animals halter and he leapt up onto the beasts back the horse responded to the pressure of his knees a quick glance showed the mass of sumerian spearmen ahead most trying to reform their lines to face the savage attack from the akkadian cavalry at least from the back of the horse hathor could see the battle developing horses were still moving forward he saw klexors men join in the attack shouting their war cries and hurling lances and arrows into the rear of the enemy infantry the first two blows of the hammer had struck and now parts of the sumerian line began to collapse faced with ferocious spearmen on one side and frenzied horsemen at their flank and rear hathor could see nothing of eskkar or his men and could only hope his leader had survived the wild charge akkad akkad kill the sumerians this time hathor remembered to avoid egyptian as he pointed with his sword his distinctive voice rallied his men and a handful of horsemen as well as an equal number on foot rallied to his side their war cries echoing his own he swept back into the battle waving his bloody sword high over his head kill kill the sumerians kill them all he thought before they kill us the moment eskkar turned to the attack as the cavalry thundered by them shappa and his four hundred slingers were exposed scattered behind the galloping horsemen the slingers carried only their knives slings and as many missiles as they could fit into the two pouches attached to every mans waist in addition they all carried at least one extra bag of stones in their left hand and some of the stronger men carried two shappa didnt want to take any chance of running out of missiles or even worse having his men waste time trying to find something on the battlefield they could use good hunting nivar shappa and his friend had grown closer during the last two years and now they were fighting side by side attempting to do something few akkadian soldiers believed possible stop a massed charge of horsemen with nothing but slingshot the small force of slingers had the most exposed and difficult task of all this day to slow down the huge force of sumerian cavalry and prevent them from falling on eskkars rear as soon as eskkar gave the order to charge shappa burst into a run keeping a tight grip on his two bags of stones he didnt bother shouting any commands his men knew what needed to be done running as fast as he could he led them toward what had been the center of the open ground between the two forces unlike eskkars diagonal charge shappa moved directly toward the enemy line he had time for one glance behind him and saw the entire force of slingers following his steps they didnt look graceful or organized each lumbering along and carrying the extra projectiles but they were young and fleet of foot for the short distance they had to travel to block the gap they covered the ground almost as fast as a man on horseback they clutched their slings as they raced forward and every man had their roundest and heaviest bronze ball already held fast within the leather breathing hard shappa reached the midpoint just as the sumerian cavalry caught offguard by eskkars unexpected attack realized what had happened some turned their horses around intending to pounce on eskkars exposed rear shappa dropped the extra bag of stones he carried then scooped out three missiles with his left hand his sling carried in his right hand already contained a stone the sumerian cavalry had finally halted all movement to the east despite their confusion they wheeled their horses around delighted at the chance to fall upon eskkars rear and shappa could see the commanders urging their men to attack he spun the sling and loosed the first stone flinging it into the mass of horsemen less than a hundred and fifty paces away beside him shappa heard the pants and grunts of the rest of his men arriving followed a moment later by the sound of whirling slings the sumerian horsemen needed only moments to turn around and countercharge shappa didnt intend to give them that moment throw throw slow them down a few of the slingers let loose their missiles while they pressed ahead but most slowed down enough to put all their force into the throw hundreds of stones rose up into the air to descend on the sumerian cavalry in moments the air hummed with the steady sounds of slings snapping as they hurled their small but deadly projectiles at the enemy horsemen by now all four hundred slingers were in range and missiles filled the air striking horse and rider in what seemed like an unceasing rain of bronze it was almost impossible not to hit something with so many horses jammed together the animals began bucking and rearing whinnying in pain as the heavy round pellets stuck their necks and chests or glanced off their flanks some of the riders turned aside moving either toward their own rear or trying to get to the slingers flank or rear shappa had to prevent that if he could move his men directly between eskkars cavalry and the enemy horsemen at least he wouldnt have to worry about anyone in his rear the thought that he might get run down never entered his head keep moving forward move closer shappa gave the order and set the example moving forward determined to put his slingers directly between eskkars force and the sumerian horsemen off to his right he caught a glimpse of nivar urging his men in the same direction even as his friend loosed his own weapon enemy riders went down struck by stones or pitched from their mounts the countercharge against eskkars riders hesitated then stopped as men fought to control their animals none of the sumerians or tanukhs had ever faced slingers before and this new tactic by this strange foe had them confused their horses too reacted with fear to these men whirling things through the air shappa knew his men looked helpless and vulnerable without any real weapons the obvious sumerian tactic would be to ride them down to accomplish that the great numbers of sumerian cavalry needed only to move as a concerted force ignoring their losses until they could ride into the slingers midst but the stones kept coming smashing into the enemy horsemen with even greater force as the slingers drew closer a few riders charged the slingers some even managed to evade the dozens of stones flung at them but when those hardy sumerians tried to strike down the apparently helpless slingers they saw their opponents throw themselves to the ground beneath the sumerian swords only to rise up an instant later and strike with their long knives at the rear legs of the horses wounded animals reared out of control unhorsing their riders who then became easy targets for the slingers stones or long knives shappa had trained his men well and they knew to seek out enemy commanders as targets for their missiles those men who would be trying to restore order and rally their ranks without commanders urging them forward ordering them to run down the slingers and kill them at any cost the sumerians continued to hesitate then some began turning away from the rain of missiles they saw the fate of those who had rushed into the slingers midst and decided a more prudent course of action was to ride around them a few galloped off as much to get out of range of the slingers as to reach the akkadian rear shappa ignored them he kept directing his slingers against the mass of horsemen still milling about the stones sought them out arcing higher in the sky before falling when they struck the horses the animals bolted or started bucking often tossing their riders to the earth at the same moment shappa had to keep up the pressure the sumerians had thousands of riders and if it occurred to all of them to simply ride around the flanks of the slingers both eskkar and the spearmen would be in trouble but the havoc and commotion of eskkars charge had driven reason from their heads they had thought only of attacking eskkars smaller force hitting them from the rear and wiping them out they wanted to reach the akkadian king not waste time on insignificant slingers and risking their own lives in the process shappa had no time to worry about that he kept dropping stones into his pouch and flinging them toward the enemy suddenly his hand came up empty from the first pouch he had already thrown over thirty stones he ripped open the second sack and hoped that the sumerians turned back or help arrived before he emptied that one as well off to one side he saw a large force of enemy horsemen moving across the battle line intending to attack gatuss rear that didnt concern him his task this day was to halt or slow down the sumerian cavalry and by all the gods he intended to do just that r azrek picked himself up from the ground he didnt remember falling but a stone must have struck his bronze helmet and knocked him from his horse he needed both hands to push himself to his feet his sword had vanished lost in the debris that now littered the battlefield bodies of men and horses lay scattered on the ground all around him those cursed slingers continued to hurl their missiles into his horsemen many of them milling around like a bunch of frightened women with an oath he stumbled toward the rear a horse kicked its heels its halter tangled around its dead rider the mans body kept the frightened animal from bolting a vicious cut with his knife freed the rope and razrek jerked the halter so hard that the stunned animal ceased its frantic efforts to get away still it took all his strength to pull himself onto the animal razrek razrek we cant get through mattaki pulled up beside him those slingers are blocking the way i can see you fool forget shulgi and forget these slingers get our men to the rear of the akkadian infantry we can ride them down theyve no one behind them ill rally the men two stones arrived at the same time one hit mattakis horse in the chest and the other glanced off razreks forehead for a few moments mattaki fought to regain control of his bucking mount when he finally got the animal under control he turned toward razrek and saw his leader motionless flat on his back with his forehead a mass of blood either dead or dying more stones hissed through the air the accursed akkadian slingers still had a plentiful supply of missiles mattaki thought of all the gold hed buried deep in the earth near the edge of the desert and decided he had had enough fighting for the day razrek was dead and win or lose today shulgi wasnt going to be too happy with the commanders of his cavalry mattaki wheeled his horse around and galloped at full speed away from the battle a few other horsemen had already reached the same conclusion by twos and threes then by twenty and thirty many of the sumerian cavalry followed riding away from the battlefield g atus heard the wild roar that signaled eskkars charge the enemy spearmen had pushed forty or fifty paces past their line of stakes their bowmen moving up behind them the first sumerian arrows began to strike the akkadian shield wall and he knew that soon every sumerian bowman would have the entire akkadian force within range but that didnt matter any longer the line of deadly stakes had vanished overrun by the advancing enemy the time had come the anvil had to move forward spearmen ready to advance one brief moment to make sure the command reached up and down the line advance fast march advance attack up and down the line leaders of ten and twenty repeated the commands the line moved forward no slow step this time the akkadian infantry took full strides moving as quickly as the ground permitted determined to close with their enemy and get past the arrows beginning to rain down on them ignoring the noise and cries of battle all around them they quick marched in silence shields raised spears still carried low in the right hand the two soldiers responsible for guarding gatus pulled him from his horse one handed him a sturdy shield as the only mounted man he would have drawn every sumerian arrow and eskkar himself had warned them about that possibility one guard smacked the mare on the rump sending it away from the coming battle gatus had no time to do more than swear at his guards he rushed forward slipping his arm through the shields leather grip and hitching it into position his two guards stayed in front using their shields to protect his sides from any stray arrow behind him he heard mitrac ordering the bowmen forward as well if the archers were going to face a sumerian arrow storm theyd be safer as close behind the spearmen as they could get arrows now flew in both directions and the sumerian arrows started to take their toll men dropped out of the advancing line killed or wounded but the line kept its cohesion and those in the rear ranks moved forward to fill the spaces of those whod fallen gatus stretched his body upward jumping every few steps so that he could see the mens progress and gauge the remaining distance to the enemy spearmen a dozen more paces the approaching enemy had closed to within a hundred and fifty paces close enough he decided spearmen ready to charge those words rippled up and down the line the men growling impatiently voices called out from the ranks to add their own encouragement to their leaders orders as they waited for the final command that would release them to the attack but they never stopped moving forward gatuss bellow rolled out over the battlefield spearmen charge charge charge the two akkadian drummers silent up to this moment now pounded the attack drumbeat with a roar that drew every head on the battlefield the akkadian spearmen broke into a run the spears were lifted to the attack position raised just over the shield which they held at eye level with their bronze helmets only akkadian eyes and spear points were visible to the enemy everyone shouted as loud as they could the line surged forward theyd been silent throughout the battle so far and now they intended to make up for it war cries filled the air as the line rushed forward some parts moved a bit quicker than others but the threemandeep attack line remained in good order holding its cohesion for long months the men had trained to charge together spears raised shouting as loud as they could now all that training would be put to the real test the sumerian line which had moved at a regular marching pace heard the savage drumbeats and saw the enemy approaching at a run screaming war cries as their spears moved up and down with each stride the sumerian line slowed slightly they had expected the two lines to close together at the fast marching pace no one expected a wild charge by the smaller force still only three ranks deep most of the others didnt notice the slight slowing the doubt creeping into the sumerian forward line gatus however had been searching for it by now he could see wideeyed sumerian faces showing the first hint of fear the sumerian army might win the battle but those spearmen in the front line knew who was going to take the full brunt of the collision attack charge kill them all akkad akkad attack gatuss words bellowed with every breath within him swept over the ranks the frenzied spearmen repeated the war cries they all screamed like demons possessed then the gap between the forces disappeared the akkadian spearmen crashed into the still advancing sumerian line at the moment of contact spears were driven forward with every bit of strength the men could summon sounds of splintering wood crackled over the deeper crash as shield wall met shield wall both overshadowing the sudden cries of the wounded and dying the noise drowned out every other part of the battle as the shields smashed together up and down the line in the front rank bronze spear points tore right through sumerian shields to impale the shrieking body behind it the akkadian second rank pushed their shields into the backs of the men in front of them leaned forward and drove their spears into the faces of the enemy jabbing again and again at any thing that moved any flesh that showed itself the sumerian front line went down by the dozens despite having twice as many men in the ranks and overlapping the akkadians to some extent the sumerian countercharge slowed and stopped as the akkadian second and third ranks closed up the sixdeep sumerian line found themselves to their own surprise being pushed back by the smaller force to the sumerians these akkadians were indeed demons unafraid to attack a superior force the sumerian spearmen forced to take a step or two backward to regain their momentum found themselves incapable of moving forward again instead they found themselves slipping or stumbling unable to use their weapons some tried to duck behind the shield of another to gain a moments protection from the spears and swords now being thrust at their faces the akkadians kept pushing pushing driving the heavier line backwards their powerful leg muscles thrusting furiously against the earth as they tried to shove the sumerian line into the ground men tripped and stumbled over dead bodies and live ones too whose howls rose up from the ground as they were trampled on the smell of dying men was in the air and blood now soaked the ground shields helmets faces all were splashed in hot liquid that spurted from open veins and splattered like rain against mens faces and shields soldiers shouted their battle cries into the faces of their enemy sometimes only a hands width away from their own other men screeched in agony as sharp spear points thrust into their bodies many in the akkadian front rank had lost their spears either splintering from the collision or hopelessly entangled with the enemy but despite the press of bodies at their front and rear each could still manage to draw his short sword some men squeezed in front and back by the pressure of opposing shields had no room to use a blade instead they smashed the pommel of the weapon into their opponents faces others jabbed the swords point into the heads and necks of those pressed against them or those in the rank behind they struck again and again until the man in front of them went down when that happened the now ragged line would surge another halfstep forward bringing a new opponent into reach some of the dead had no room to fall kept upright for a few moments by the sheer press of numbers others their bodies slippery with blood slid to the ground many still alive and gasping at the thought of what awaited them to fall meant never to rise again scrambling feet from both sides trampled those underfoot adding new pain to existing wounds or simply crushing the life from their bodies the battle had degenerated into individual combat with each man pressed against the opposing mans shield but the akkadians had trained hard for just such an encounter they welcomed the pressure of their companions shield in their back and as gatus had taught them they never stopped struggling to move forward they knew their legs would win the battle for them as long as they pressed ahead the days of long and hard training under gatuss tutelage kept the shield wall not only intact but moving forward a halfstep every few moments the smaller force had not only stopped the advancing sumerians but now began to drive them backwards step by step for the sumerians to reach the front rank meant death but still they held their ground clinging stubbornly to their position the sumerian commanders urged their men forward and determined men hurled themselves against the backs of their ranks the akkadian advance slowed then stopped the greater weight of numbers on the sumerian side began to weigh against the tiring akkadian infantry the battle line surged and rippled but the sumerians now in a battle frenzy of their own halted the onrush and began to push their enemy backwards k lexor led his men at the charge at first following the path of eskkar and hathor klexors orders were to take his men between the other akkadian commanders the battle plan required that the king break through the line with his men and seek out shulgi hathor would attack the sumerian left flank klexors objective was to guide his three hundred men between eskkar and hathors forces and crumple the sumerian spearmens rear to disrupt the sumerian infantry from behind only by attacking from the front and rear could the akkadians hope to prevail over the superior numbers of their enemy nevertheless this meant klexors men had the greatest distance to cover before they came to grips with the enemy to make sure his horsemen followed his lead klexor had the steadiest men under his command all of them knew where to go and what to do eskkars men had vanished into a mob of swirling horses and screaming men still klexor found the tiniest of gaps only a few paces wide between hathor and eskkars fighters klexor raised his sword and guided his horse toward the opening attack follow me attack he swept past hathors still struggling horsemen in front of klexor the enemy spears loomed up the enemy left flank still extended beyond the line of gatuss spearmen and hadnt yet engaged in battle now they saw klexors thundering horsemen approaching and tried to turn to their rear to meet this new threat but that maneuver required some doing men had to shift and reform ranks a task that would take precious moments if they could raise a wall of spear points between them and klexors men they would be able to stop the advance but before the sumerians could form up klexors cavalry began hurling their javelins at the mass of men struggling to regroup flung with all a mans strength and aided by the speed of the galloping horse the deadly missiles rained down on the reforming ranks arrows too flew into the sumerians disrupting their effort to form a solid line some men panicked trying to shift out of the path of the onrushing horsemen that had suddenly appeared in their rear klexor saw the fear in their faces as he swung his sword down with all his might striking right and left at anything that moved pushing the horse ahead with all his strength attack he shouted kill them all kill them all h is horse killed beneath him fashod broke through his own ring of attackers and saw eskkar a dozen paces ahead swinging his sword and surrounded by enemies fashods bow was gone wrenched from his hands and hed seen grond go down crushed by a mass of surging tanukhs fashod saw chinua jump his horse over the mounting bodies of the dead to move to fashods side eskkar fashod used his sword to point at the akkadian chinua still had his bow gripping his horse hard with his knees he fit a shaft to the string and shot it striking a tanukh horseman trying to ride down the king three more shafts followed launched faster than any fashod had ever seen and the rush that threatened to overwhelm eskkar slowed his quiver empty chinua dropped his bow and snatched out his sword behind them the ur nammu war cry sounded and a half dozen warriors broke through their enemies and swept past fashod and chinua kicking their horses to the gallop they charged the tanukhs brushing past eskkar as they hurled themselves into the mass of enemy horsemen behind them rode another shouting handful of akkadians desperate to reach the kings side if eskkar went down the battle could still be lost shulgis voice rasped with every order he shouted the akkadian bowmen had raked his men with their shafts the puny boats on the river had taken their toll on his right flank and now eskkars horsemen had charged deep into the gap created by razreks carelessness hold them off shulgi shouted turning to the tanukh beside him kapturu the leader of the tanukhs heard the war cries of the approaching men and hesitated order your men forward or ill kill you now shulgi said his sword suddenly in his hand the kings guards moved in closer both to protect their leader and prevent kapturus leaving the tanukh weighed his chances then gave the order raising his arm he pointed toward eskkars charging horsemen tanukhs forward attack attack the mass of tanukh horsemen surged forward whatever their misgivings in a few strides the sumerian reserve moved toward the gap gaining speed as they moved then the wave of akkadians tore through the tiny opening and crashed into the tanukhs in moments the fighting had surged past his once orderly ranks and into his rear the battle shulgi had sought for two years now threatened to overwhelm him shulgi stared at the carnage surrounding him his cavalry had vanished and only the tanukhs were keeping the akkadians from breaking through the line but his infantrys flank was in ruins and some of eskkars cavalry had slipped past and smashed into the rear of the line still if the tanukhs could hold a little longer until razreks men counterattacked the akkadians would be caught between two forces and broken the mass of sumerian and tanukh fighters to his left thinned out and shulgi saw eskkars tall figure now dismounted but still leading the attack and trying to break through to the rear bowmen shulgis bellow turned every one of his mens heads toward him he pointed toward eskkar get bowmen on the king kill eskkar two archers ran up pushing their way through shulgis protective ring of horsemen trying to scramble onto the tiny hillock and get high enough above the mass of men to take a shot at akkads king shulgi reached down and grabbed the nearest by the shoulder and pointed towards eskkar hurry dont let him get away the first archer drew back his shaft and let fly a good shot and shulgi saw the arrow strike eskkar in the chest but the king was turning when the missile struck and it merely glanced off the akkadians breastplate the other archer still struggling to find his footing amidst shulgis personal guards drew back his shaft for a carefully aimed shot o n the river yavtar saw the sumerians start their advance and a quick glance showed the akkadian spearmen also moving forward they looked helpless against such a large force their flanks would be turned or theyd be overrun and pinned against the river and slaughtered boats yavtar had to shout the word with all his lungs fortunately the emptiness of the river carried his voice to the other two boats move in closer to shore we have to hold the spearmens flank he turned to his steersman still crouched as low as he could and just as frightened as when the battle began move us closer to the shore get us within fifty paces and keep us there daro dropped down beside him an arrow still strung on the bow good move well cut them apart at that distance unless a few hundred suddenly jumped in the river and swam toward them yavtar thought then were all going to be dead but the boat crept toward the riverbank the men still straining at their oars it took more effort to hold the boat in position as the land drew near and these men had been pulling at the oars for some time a look ahead and behind showed that the other two vessels had heard and understood the order either that or they were just keeping their station on yavtars boat as theyd been ordered daro we need to lighten the boat throw the dead overboard at least five bowmen were dead and two or three were cursing in pain from their wounds still getting rid of the dead would help the oarsmen daro nodded and soon bodies were shoved over the side to splash loudly in the water before drifting away on the current by the time his men dumped the dead overboard yavtars boat had pulled within twenty paces of the fighting the three craft which had drifted a few dozen paces apart since the start of the fighting now drew closer together yavtar could have jumped from his boat into either of the other two he could see the drawn faces of the sumerians and hear the shouts and curses as they advanced on shore all the sumerians were on the move forward their attention for a moment fixed on the advancing akkadian infantry as the two forces converged the archers on board the riverboats noticed the slackening of arrows directed toward them emboldened they aimed their shafts and launched at the sumerian flank now unprotected by either shield wall or the sumerian archers as the enemy advanced the boats compensated to keep themselves level with the sumerians yavtars boat and the one following behind him slowed their rowing to keep themselves in the same position but a gap opened up between those two craft and the remaining boat the one that had been farthest north it was now well behind the advancing enemy lines and drifted even nearer to the shore for a moment yavtar thought the wayward craft might be sinking then he saw the arrows that flew from that craft were aimed not at the moving infantry but deep toward the center of the sumerian line what targets drew their shafts yavtar couldnt see but the boat captain knew his business and the leader of his boats archers had been picked by daro for that command still their orders were to stay close to yavtars boat and to follow his lead daro he pointed with his hand at the other boast now a hundred paces ahead of the other two boats after launching the shaft on his bowstring daro ducked back behind the shield yavtar again jabbed his hand toward the lead boat breathing hard daro had no time for more than a glance at the wayward craft forget them yavtar keep us abreast of the enemy line o n the first ship a young archer named viran commanded the force of bowmen he saw yavtars and the other boat slipping southward to maintain close contact with the sumerian line but as the enemy spearmen infantry and their supporting archers moved forward viran glimpsed a cluster of horsemen near the center of the sumerian line three red banners floated in the air just around them viran couldnt see much but he knew what the banners floating softly in the morning breeze likely meant some sumerian commanders had marked their position and the banners dipped and rose to signal movements to their men alexar drakis even eskkar had all ordered their bowmen time after time to aim for the leaders of the enemy viran saw that the banners neither advanced nor retreated that might not mean much he took but a moment to decide boatmaster forget yavtars order keep us where we are viran turned his attention to his own men archers see those three red banners lets give them a few volleys by this stage of the battle viran only had nine archers still fit to draw a bow but if even one or two arrows struck the enemy commanders it would be worth the effort the arrows flight would be a long one and his bowmen would have to put plenty of arc on the shot but they should be just within range halt at my command draw your bows shoot again hit those red banners damn you draw shoot keep shooting viran barked the same commands used on the training ground but now his voice added urgency to his men and they dug deep into their waning reserves of strength to obey fortunately no enemy archers were targeting virans boat though out of the corner of his eye he saw plenty of shafts still striking yavtars vessel the first volley from virans ship rose up into the air almost like a flight of birds one shaft leading the others at this distance and without a high place to observe the targets viran knew he wouldnt be able to see the effects of his mens arrows but like all of akkads finer marksmen he had faith in both his weapon and his mens ability he glanced at his bowmen on either side pull those shafts you lazy dogs make sure every arrow reaches those banners as he gave the command viran set the example aiming his arrow high toward the still climbing sun he dragged the feathered end to his ear fighting against the tension and the tiredness in his arms and released the thick bowstring twanged and slapped hard against his wrist guard as the shaft tore its way up into the air a puff of air pushed it forward before it began its descent as he nocked another shaft he wondered if he would ever know what effect his mens arrows would have this day t he small flight of arrows rained down on shulgis bodyguards only a half dozen reached the place where the sumerian king stood a bodyguard took a shaft in the thigh but despite the knot of men surrounding the king the rest failed to strike any other targets except one one arrow dove deep into the rump of a horse ridden by a bodyguard positioned just behind shulgi the wounded beast bolted forward crashing into shulgis mount and driving the sumerian king and his horse into the two archers the arrow aimed at eskkars head flew wide and both archers were knocked to the ground the terrified animal wild with pain from the thick shaft and unable to move forward then reared up and began striking out with its hooves with a curse shulgi found himself fighting to keep his seat his horse was struck in the neck by a flying hoof from the enraged animal beside him both horses reared up biting and kicking at each other but shulgis mount lost its footing and crashed to the earth taking the king with him his shoulder took the brunt of the fall knocking the breath from his lungs for a moment he lay pinned beneath his kicking horse then the frantic animal found its footing struggled to its feet and bolted off to the rear away from the noise and confusion the other horse maddened by the pain in its rump continued bucking and rearing until one of the guardsmen struck it across the head with his sword sending the animal stumbling dead to the ground two of shulgis red banners went down with it entangled with the beast another half dozen or so arrows rained down on the sumerian kings position one man took a shaft in the side but no other missiles found a target shaking his head shulgi climbed to his feet the first thing he saw was kapturu the leader of the tanukhs wheeling his horse around and kicking it hard away from the edge of the battle front that had come too near for kapturus liking other tanukhs followed their clan leaders example king shulgi is dead the king is dead some fool had seen shulgi fall and given voice to the lie others took up the cry at the sight of the kings riderless horse he knew he had to stop the panic from spreading sumerians to me to me except for those surrounding him shulgis shout went unheard almost lost in the clamor of the conflict men shouted at each other horses neighed and screamed and the clash of bronze sword rang on both wooden shields and naked blades he tried to drag his sword from its scabbard but the blade resisted the scabbard bent by the fall shulgi finally ripped it free and raised it up over his head to me rally to your king he trod over two bodies to reach the lone red standard and stood beside it rally to your king a few heads turned his way others picked up his words and passed them on shulgi knew he needed to hold his position long enough to give his spearmen time to break the akkadian ranks victory remained within his grasp h is shield held close to his eyes gatus stood behind his ranks of spearmen watching the battle line ripple and waver as the bloody fighting continued his left flank anchored against the river was holding fast no doubt helped by the two of yavtars fighting boats that gatus could see what should have been the weakest part of the line the right flank also stood firm no doubt helped by the confusion that hathor and klexors men had brought to bear only at the center facing the greatest concentration of sumerian might had the advance ground to a halt and even as he stared it started giving way gatus turned his head by now hed expected the sumerian cavalry to be on his back but the grassy field trampled down by his men remained empty as far as he could see the slingers must still be engaging the enemy horsemen shouts from his infantry snapped his head around his precious spearmen were being driven back killed as they tried to hold the line they had started out in ranks three or even four deep but now he saw many gaps where only one or two ranks remained struggling to resist the enormous mass of sumerian infantry many shouting the war cries of larsa only a dozen paces away gatus knew they couldnt withstand so many for much longer mitrac alexar help hold the line without waiting for a reply gatus charged ahead his two cursing bodyguards caught by surprise at the old mans sudden burst of speed drawing his sword gatus ran straight toward the largest bulge in the line he arrived just as three men went down losing their footing against the pressure of the sumerians sumerian shouts rose as the enemy saw only a handful of archers before them with an oath gatus thrust himself into the breech despite his age his muscles were fresh unlike those of all the men fighting akkad spearmen hold hold the line his shield knocked one man back and he thrust his sword into the face of another the ground had good footing here and his guards crashed against the line on either side of their leader all three using their swords and shouting their war cries hacking and stabbing the three men halted the advance and gatus managed to take a step forward before the sumerians regained their footing the sumerians nipped and harried by the akkadians all morning with many of their own men killed in the initial charge now saw empty space only a few paces ahead the sight rallied their strength and they pushed forward one of gatuss guards went down struck in the head with a sword gatus redoubled his efforts thrusting and hacking with his sword and keeping his shoulder pressed against his shield something burned his side and he staggered back shoved by the force of the spear that entered his body his surviving bodyguard struck at the enemy spearmans face knocking the man down and ripping the spears point from gatuss side ignoring the pain gatus moved forward again swinging his sword down on another enemy head then a crazed sumerian shoved a shield against gatuss and once again drove the akkadian back he slipped and fell as the way opened up for the sumerian spearmen to burst through the akkadian line m itrac had arrived with one hundred archers the enemy horsemen hadnt appeared on the infantrys flank yet and hed seen gatuss line bend and begin to break mitracs men gathered into two ranks a dozen paces behind the center of the line first rank aim high second rank low shoot without seeming to aim he put a shaft right through the eye of the first battlecrazed sumerian to step over gatuss still struggling body shaft after shaft propelled from the powerful bow tore into the enemy many of them too weary to lift their shields high enough to protect their faces the second rank of archers targeted the enemys legs shooting downward into the mass of churning limbs that were packed so close together that almost every shaft had to strike something before it buried itself in the earth mitrac realized those facing him were not spearmen most of those had fallen victim to the akkadian spears these men lacked the large shields that the sumerian infantry carried most were armed only with swords and small shields the deadly flight of arrows halted the surging sumerians even those with shields found their protection of little use at such close range many bronzetipped shafts bored through the hidecovered wood with enough strength to kill or wound the flesh pressed against it mitracs bowmen had plenty of arrows and in moments theyd launched a thousand arrows at the concentrated enemy line the sumerians halted unable to advance in the face of the withering arrow volleys a few glanced up to see even more archers racing toward them cries went up from behind them as klexors horsemen continued to pound their rear the sound of akkadian war cries at their back adding to their confusion in a few heartbeats panic raced through the sumerians mitrac saw the effect of his arrow storm advance keep shooting even as he bellowed the words he stepped forward still loosing shafts as fast as he could kill the sumerians death to sumeria akkad the shout burst from his mens lungs as they took a dozen steps forward more arrows tore into the sumerian center more archers arrived to add their shafts to the carnage it was more than the sumerians could bear some took a step backward others turned and tried to shove their way out of the line theyd fought bravely enough but there seemed to be no end to these bloodcrazed akkadians even those men from larsa still driven by their thirst for revenge began to fall back some turned to run arrows ripped through the mass of men without shields to protect their backs every arrow brought a man down the retreat turned into a rout then it became a slaughter as the akkadian spearmen freed from the pressure of the enemy summoned up one last effort regained their footing and returned to the attack mitrac expended his last shaft clutching his bow in his left hand he drew his sword and charged kill them all kill them all b reathing hard eskkar ran after the ur nammu horsemen the tanukhs were falling back despite the smaller number of akkadians facing them blood covered the slippery ground and bodies of the dead and wounded lay everywhere one red standard still stood and he raced toward it still gripping the lance in his left hand the battle now raged at close quarters victory or defeat depended on dozens of individual combats raging all over the battleground all eskkar could do was try and kill as many of his enemies as possible akkad his powerful voice bellowed above the din of battle follow me akkad no matter what happened he swore to cut his way through and reach the sumerian king men fought all around him but almost all were mounted a tanukh fought against one of the ur nammu warriors ducking between the two eskkar thrust up with the lance at the tanukh the bronze tip digging into the mans left side the wounded man broke away with a cry wheeling his horse and bolting for the rear eskkar kept moving ducking and shifting his way through the mass of milling men and animals he burst past the last of the tanukh line astonished to see the entire force falling back some already galloping off to the rear the lone red standard stood atop a slight rise in the ground and he advanced toward it bodies lay all about many with arrows protruding from them a handful of sumerians most struggling to control their mounts saw him coming one man on foot wore a burnished breastplate and held a sword upright in his hand shulgi eskkar moved forward akkad his cry pierced the clash of weapons and the shouts of men fighting to the right of shulgis standard eskkar saw the sumerian infantry giving way their archers led the retreat some tossing their weapons away to run all the faster what remained of the sumerian spearmen followed some still trying to retain their ranks as they moved backwards a few started to run and once that started eskkar knew it wouldnt stop the sumerians had broken and not even a counterattack from razreks cavalry could save them now three of shulgis guards kicked their horses forward eskkar never slowed when only a few paces from the oncoming riders he flung his arms up lance and sword jutting toward the face of the center horse trying to panic it akkad either eskkars bellowing charge or the lance flashing before its face made the lead animal dig in its heels its rear haunches sliding to the ground eskkar shifted to his left and drove the lance into the horses shoulder while his sword thrust forward with all his strength slipped under the center horseman still trying to regain control of his mount eskkars blade passed completely through the mans stomach the remaining rider after taking a wild cut at eskkars head pulled his mount around his sword swinging down ripping lance and sword free eskkar flung himself to the ground and the sword stroke passed a hands length over his head then he pushed himself to his feet the lance bit again this time into the horses hindquarters the horse reared and eskkar felt something strike his chest he stumbled backwards then tripped over a body another sumerian fighter this one on foot appeared his sword thrust down to pin eskkar to the earth eskkar rolled toward him flinging his body into the mans legs a sword hissed through the air as chinua thundered by his long sword taking the surprised mans head from its shoulders and sending a spray of blood into the air shulgi thrust at chinua as he galloped past but missed the ur nammu warrior other akkadian horsemen arrived killing a few of the sumerian kings guards and driving off the rest in a few moments theyd cut shulgi off from the rest of his men soon a ring of akkadian and ur nammu warriors surrounded the king of sumer eskkar used the haft of the lance to help himself to his feet drinking air into his lungs he realized the battle was over everywhere he looked men were fleeing the battlefield avoiding the circle that held their king sumers army was finished all eskkar had to do was give the word and his men would cut shulgi down or take him prisoner eskkar saw chinua ride back to the edge of the ring and halt he knew what the ur nammu expected his army defeated his guards driven off shulgi saw death circled all around him but the akkadians and their barbarian allies held back they wanted to see the two leaders battle shulgi hefted his shield into position and waited eskkar gulped more air into his chest the fierce fighting had tired him while shulgi still possessed all his strength but eskkars honor demanded that he fight his men had followed him into battle and they had done what he asked of them it had taken many of their lives to bring him to the heart of the enemy now it was up to eskkar to finish the conflict shulgi looked around him and understood unafraid he moved forward now only a dozen paces from akkads king at least ill have the satisfaction of killing you before i die eskkar shifted the lance in his hand and tightened his grip days of practicing with the cavalry had taught him how to use the weapon that way shulgi either didnt understand its use or didnt care the sumerian edged forward making sure of his footing as he advanced throw down your sword shulgi ill let you live you can surrender your better to die after i kill you you filthy eskkar knew better than to heed an enemys words he struck first jabbing the lance toward shulgis face the shield rose to deflect it and eskkar struck at shulgis left leg with a vicious overhand stroke from his sword but the sumerian recovered and shifted away before the blow could strike though the blade knocked a clod of dirt and sand from the earth shulgi laughed and circled to his right youre slow old man with your clumsy weapon ive killed a dozen horsefighters with their long swords behind eskkar the sounds of battle began to fade more and more men joined the circle to watch the two leaders fight even a few sumerians having thrown down their weapons in surrender now stood on the ring that encircled the two fighters eskkar gritted his teeth no matter what the cost he could not allow shulgis taunts to continue at least eskkar had recovered most of his breath he attacked again sword and lance thrusting and cutting shifting his feet even leaping over a body but shulgi danced away each time using his shield and short sword effectively counterstriking at every opportunity eskkar kept up the attack trying to overwhelm the younger man with sheer strength blade clashed against blade and this time shulgi stood toe to toe twice he used his shield to force eskkar back the bloody grass littered with weapons and debris hindered both fighters eskkar knew what would happen to the first man to slip and fall better summon your archers to finish me barbarian before its too late shulgi attacked for the first time his short sword flashing in the sun as it sought to weave a deadly web of bronze around his enemy after three hard strokes eskkar broke off the contact leaping back and to his right away from shulgis sword arm the sumerians strokes were too quick too powerful for eskkars long sword to counter for long by now his chest again heaved with the exertion too proud to call on your men old man shulgi taunted they see whats happening eskkar used his anger to attack but shulgi met his advance his shield absorbing the vicious overhand strike of eskkars blade only the slim lance in eskkars left hand kept shulgis sword at bay another four or five hard strokes forced eskkar to give up the attack once again moving back and to his right his right arm was weakening and he knew shulgi could feel it too and then he remembered many years ago eskkar had fought a skilled and powerful swordsman a warrior so strong that even eskkars strength and youth could not defeat the man a trick had saved eskkars life then a gamble that would leave him open to a deadly stroke if it failed still he felt the sword growing heavier in his hand the blade sagging a little lower after each attack eskkar realized he would not last much longer against his younger opponent he took one deep breath time to die boy king as the last word left his lips eskkar attacked with a ferocity that took every bit of his remaining strength the blades clashed again and again mixed with the dull thud of sword against shield stroke followed stroke until eskkar felt himself weakening he threw himself back and to the side as hed done twice before shulgi had waited for the same moment as soon as eskkar shifted shulgi moving with a blur of speed turned to his left lunged forward and struck at where eskkars unprotected sword arm would be but eskkar had not fully shifted his body and instead of dodging to the right he flung himself forward and to his left diving under shulgis overhand swing that would have cut eskkars arm in two if hed moved as shulgi expected instead eskkar slid onto his left knee and thrust the point of his sword into shulgis exposed armpit the weapons tip piercing the laces that bound shulgis breastplate and stopping only when the blade bit against the shoulder bone shulgi whirled around and struck downwards but eskkar had already rolled away wrenching his sword loose and regaining his footing blood poured down shulgis side as he advanced again he lunged at eskkars head with his sword and eskkar nearly failed to raise his blade in time to parry the stroke the sumerian king tried to raise his sword for another attack but his arm muscles refused to obey and eskkar struck the weapon aside with his own shulgi flung himself forward raising his shield and trying to smash into eskkar and bring him to the ground eskkar closed in lowering his left shoulder and smashing his body against the shield shulgi moving slower couldnt shift to the side as he done before eskkars weight now flung shulgi backwards the sumerians heel caught on the outflung leg of a body and he crashed onto the trampled earth the sword fell from his hand shulgi looked up unable to lift his right arm already growing weak from the blood loss that streamed down his right arm and side shulgi tried to recover his sword but eskkar placed his left sandal on the blade pinning it to the ground he had to take two breaths before he could get control of his words i told your father he should have stayed in sumer you should have learned from what happened to him blood now soaked the ground beneath shulgis arm the sumerian glanced at his right arm already covered in blood and then laughed a trick to keep yourself alive the mighty eskkar he coughed tried to laugh then coughed again this time spewing blood from his mouth onto his chest enough talk sumerian eskkar thrust down not with his sword but with the lance in his left hand the slim bronze tip tore into shulgis throat and buried itself in the earth his eyes bulged with pain then rolled up into his head the body twitched for a moment then lay still the boy king of sumer had at least died bravely fighting to the last a warriors end and better than his fathers eskkar didnt care he straightened up letting go of the lance and looked around the circle of men it had grown in depth and it seemed as though half the akkadian army had stopped and watched the brutal demise of shulgis ambitions a cheer started at first just a few men then more until everyone joined in the realization that they had not only won the battle but destroyed the enemy and killed its king sank in they had survived and would live the jubilation rose in intensity until every voice shouted the same refrain akkad akkad akkad he let the chant go on until their voices ran out of breath eskkar raised his sword forcing himself to keep the blade steady youve won a mighty victory another cheer answered him now on to sumer this time the roar shook the battlefield a new cry went up death to sumer death to sumer it went on and on this time accompanied by the clamor of men crashing swords against shields until the sound came from every voice and floated from horizon to horizon on the warm air t wo miles away king naxos of isin sat on his horse his advisor kuara at his side the two men had slipped out of the city and ridden south before swinging around to the east taking care not to be seen by the handful of eskkars men still guarding the ditch all over the horizon they saw hundreds and hundreds of men running or riding away all of them heading south many would flee to isin but naxos had already given orders to admit only those who could prove they lived there suddenly a roar ascended into the heavens a mighty cheer that echoed over the ground that will be shulgis death knell kuara said shaking his head in disgust his army is destroyed now eskkar will march to sumer and tear it down naxos shook his head i doubt it the sumerians would be fools to resist and kushanna is anything but a fool shell slip away or come up with some idea to turn aside the akkadians sword well if anyone can talk their way out of trouble shes the one do you think eskkar will turn his fury on isin he may be a barbarian naxos said but hes no fool either he knows hell need as many allies in sumeria as he can get with larsa gone and sumers wealth exhausted akkad needs our trade to recover just as we need theirs no hell keep his word and spare our city then well have to ally ourselves with him kuara sighed still it may not be so bad if akkad directs its trade to isin in a few years well be strong again naxos had reported his encounter with eskkar to his advisor but hadnt mentioned that eskkar had invited him to visit akkad perhaps i will visit the barbarians city for myself kuara glanced at him youd put yourself within reach of trellas power why would you risk your life to go there ah to meet lady trella of course naxos laughed sooner or later eskkar is going to get himself killed some day she may need another strong leader to protect her kuara shook his head if what eskkar told you is true you just escaped kushannas poison my king i dont think you should be taking yourself from the path of one viper and placing your neck in front of another well well see about that after all only the gods know what the future holds i doubt if that particular future is in the stars naxos laughed well the years will tell us now lets get back to isin weve got to fill in that ditch as soon as possible t he first thing razrek felt was a fly buzzing around his face he lay flat on his back something hard pressing against his spine his eyes refused to open and all he could make out was a reddish haze blood he decided it took all his strength to raise his hand and rub it across his eyes first one eyelid then the other broke loose from the dried blood and the fierce midmorning sun nearly blinded him razrek closed his eyes and tried to ignore the pain something had struck his head but he couldnt remember the silence washed over him he heard no sounds of fighting no horses crying out nothing razrek used the pain to force himself fully awake the battle had ended no matter which side had won he had to get to a horse heres another one still alive razrek squinted into the sun but couldnt see the speaker he tried to sit up but a foot planted itself firmly on his chest this ones a commander at least another voice remarked look at that fancy knife razrek twisted his head and gazed upward a boy had moved into view over him a bulging sack slung over his shoulder and a long knife in his hand should be good for a few coins another boy joined the first his shadow blocking out the sun razrek saw a sling hanging from the second boys neck he too carried a long knife in his hand both blades razrek realized were stained with fresh blood should we take him to shappa he may be someone important and give up what hes carrying your wits are slow today little brother before razrek could reach for his knife the second youth dropped down and thrust his blade into razreks neck the powerful stroke sent the sharp point straight through the flesh and into the earth pain lanced through razreks throat and head he flailed his arms trying to grasp the knife but already he felt blood gurgling up choking he thrashed about but the pressure on his chest increased his muscles failed him and the pain slipped away his eyes remained open and words still reached his ears look at this purse well never have to work again hurry before anyone sees strip the body he may have more concealed in his tunic for razrek the bright morning sun faded to darkness as the two slingers finished looting his dead body b y sundown the akkadians had established a camp about a mile north of the battlefield every man and beast stumbling wearily northward until they reached the chosen site the burst of energy after the defeat of the sumerians had faded exhaustion set in as well as sadness many in eskkars army had died though not as many as hed expected the wounded and there were many needed to be cared for with the river now clear of shulgis men more riverboats arrived to deliver food and take those who could not walk back to akkad eskkar sat before the fire staring into the flames every muscle in his body ached his right arm still felt numb and hed had trouble controlling his horse on the brief ride upriver a wine skin lay close at hand and hed already finished at least two cups of the strong drink one more and hed sleep well tonight though hed pay for it in the morning right now it didnt seem to matter alexar limped up as weary as any man in the army he had taken a spear in his leg despite that alexar had been the first to recognize the black mood that descended over eskkar after shulgis death alexar regrouped the men and organized the brief march north he slumped to the ground beside eskkar ive got a rough count of our dead captain how bad another grim aftermath of every battle the dead friends and companions the wounded who would die later eskkar knew there was no escape from alexars tidings about two hundred cavalry dead less than fifty archers and almost half of those died on the boats the slingers did better than anyone expected only forty dead the infantry two hundred and forty dead many of the survivors took wounds including gatus who had died with eskkars arms around his shoulders eskkar had wept for the old soldier who had flung his life into the battle to save his line from breaking at least he died as he would have wanted standing alongside his men and fighting to the end grond had died as well overwhelmed by a dozen men after he raised a mound of dead around himself and probably still struggling to reach eskkars side klexor had died too riddled by enemy spears when his horse went down almost as the fighting ended muta had taken his command when his leader fell a dozen paces away from where eskkar sat drakis lay wrapped in bandages four years ago the man had nearly died fighting in akkad and now he was gravely wounded again he would be on the first boat returning to akkad in the morning the list of dead could have been far worse eskkar knew the gods had favored him once again either that or gatuss training had kept most of the men alive including himself the slim akkadian lance had kept shulgis sword at bay just long enough eskkars own victory over shulgi counted for little every man watching had seen the younger man wear down his older opponent in truth eskkar had won only by a trick a desperate gamble that should have failed the first time he tried it let alone the second it bothered him that he hadnt been able to kill shulgi outright but staying alive was what counted not how you did it eskkar knew what trella would say when he told her in time they will only remember that you faced the king of sumer in battle and slew him he would send her word of the victory tomorrow shed had her own victory over the alur meriki to celebrate that didnt matter either only that the city would remain safe and free and that sargon would grow stronger every day the threat from sumer had been eliminated once eskkar stamped out kushanna and her nest of snakes peace would return to the land at least for a time in the morning hathor would take the brunt of the cavalry and ride south despite todays victory eskkar intended to give sumer no time to recover raise more troops or prepare a defense hathor had somehow come through the fighting almost unscathed his dark egyptian gods must still be protecting him he would ravage the lands around sumer and seal it off from any river traffic by the time eskkars army arrived the city might have already surrendered drink some more wine captain and get some sleep alexar said you need the rest eskkar glanced up alexars voice showed his concern it always surprised eskkar when others showed honest affection for him and alexar had his own wound to prove his courage at least his commander knew how great the danger had been and how lucky they were to survive it without stopping eskkar emptied the wine cup tossed it aside then fell back against the hard ground more than two years had passed since this war began but it had finally ended once again trella would be kept busy helping the city recover better than anyone she knew how to heal the wounds in the countryside and in the city but peace would soothe the pain and in time akkad would grow strong again with its walls raised ever higher until like mighty arms they spread their protection around trella their son and their children yet to come eskkar looked up at the stars blazing overhead now he knew what they foretold long life for himself and trella a son to carry on their line other descendants who would live through them and through the ages most of all akkad would grow strong and prosperous again the empire encompassing all the land between the two rivers would be ruled from akkad not sumer and that eskkar decided before he fell into an exhausted and troubled sleep made all the fighting worthwhile in sumer the days rushed by each filled with excitement the war talk dominated every conversation rumors abounded about king shulgis army its mighty size and power its rapid march to the north everyone spoke proudly of how the other sumerian cities already acknowledged sumers leadership others boasted about the coming destruction of akkad and the creation of a mighty sumerian empire that stretched between the two rivers all the way to the far north when word of the fall of kanesh arrived the citys inhabitants celebrated the fertile fields of the north would soon supply sumers every need and slaves from the akkadian lands would abound in the slave market nevertheless many suffered hardship with the resumption of hostilities trading ceased almost at once every boat that arrived at the docks was taken into king shulgis service as the soldiers commandeered every craft wine and ale grain and bread chickens and herd animals all were rushed aboard boats and sent north since the only vessels moving on the river carried cargoes to support king shulgis army food supplies within sumer grew scarce queen kushannas men had already emptied the citys storage places to feed the ravenous army and still supply caravans departed each day taking what little remained and collecting supplies along the way the shortages caused every merchant to raise prices though few buyers had enough coins remaining to purchase anything but necessities even enhedus massages slowed as the tightfisted upper classes staggering under kushannas everrising taxes ordered their pampered women to cut back without a steady supply of ale business at the kestrel dropped off as well and enhedu and tammuz suddenly found they had plenty of time on their hands still the mood in sumer remained jubilant until the ninth day after the start of hostilities late in the afternoon boatmen returning from kanesh reported the disquieting news that eskkars army had slipped by king shulgis forces at kanesh the akkadians were reputed to be marching toward larsa or possibly even sumer before the sun set word had reached every hut in every lane many refused to believe it for the first time worried looks appeared on many faces the citys soldiers doubled their efforts to strengthen the walls a kings messenger arrived the next day demanding more troops half the citys remaining garrison departed ordered north to protect the caravans moving supplies for enhedu and tammuz that resulted in one piece of good tidings jarud was promoted to captain of the guard he celebrated with his friends and companions at the kestrel the next evening three days later a boat carrying no cargo docked with word of the fall of larsa the grim news swept through sumer over the next few days more reports arrived many of them conflicting all of them adding shocking details about the destruction of larsa king shulgi remained in pursuit of eskkars forces but now that meant little to the citys inhabitants rumors insisted that the akkadians were on the march to sumer intending to tear down the walls and kill everyone within the inhabitants started hoarding what little they had many shops and stalls in the lanes closed dozens left the city before queen kushanna ordered the gates closed no one was allowed to depart the city without her permission the mood in sumer turned sullen as hardeyed messengers from king shulgi returned and departed forbidden by kushanna to speak to any desperate people trapped in the city without any means of livelihood formed gangs that roamed the lanes at night searching for anything of value or even food to eat the gloom worsened when sumer learned of the raid on uruk the city burned and its inhabitants driven into the countryside by eskkars horsemen who had magically appeared out of the desert wreaked their havoc and disappeared everyone agreed that the king of akkad was a demon from the underworld how else could his armies be in so many places and move about unopposed twenty days after the start of the war horsemen arriving at midday brought word of a mighty battle outside isin and the destruction of the akkadian army eskkars soldiers had been crushed and the survivors driven into the euphrates to drown the welcome news swept through the city like the fresh breeze from the southern sea smiling and relieved people gathered in the marketplace and outside the queens quarters to give thanks happy to learn that their sons and husbands would soon be returning home victorious over their enemy enhedu and tammuz cheered as loudly as any this is bad tammuz said when they were alone enhedu shook her head no its just another rumor even if eskkar were defeated he would not have let his army be completely destroyed hes far too good a fighter to let that happen eskkar may have lost a battle but we mustnt give up hope yet that evening a good number of customers returned to the kestrel eager to drink to the success of shulgis soldiers later that night as the raucous patrons began to depart jarud strode into the kestrel accompanied by three of his men enhedu took in their scowling faces and felt her heart jump afraid that she and tammuz had been discovered but the newly appointed captain of the guard called out for ale and plenty of it as he slumped onto a bench enhedu carried a pitcher with the last of the nights brew to the table and filled everyones cups you look too serious to be celebrating captain is anything wrong jarud downed his ale before replying nothing to celebrate he ignored her questioning look for a moment damn all the demons i just found out youll hear the news soon enough he lowered his voice a handful of soldiers from the north arrived this evening he filled his cup not soldiers any more rabble king shulgis army was defeated at isin king naxos and the rest of his traitors refused to fight and the akkadian scum caught shulgi unprepared our soldiers broke and ran hundreds maybe thousands are dead including the king eyes wide enhedu sank down on the bench beside jarud are you sure i mean im sure i spoke to some of the scum myself the army was jarud couldnt find words to describe what he felt tammuz joined them and she whispered the news to him it didnt matter the remaining patrons needed only a look at jarud and his companions to guess the worst then faint shouts from the lane could be heard the news had already begun to spread enhedu clasped her hands to her bosom the gods preserve us what will happen now who knows jarud shrugged whenever hes ready eskkar will march on sumer the last messenger brought news that isin has changed sides and is now supporting the akkadians king naxos will allow free passage across his lands the filthy coward sumer will not fall enhedu declared its walls are high larsa fell and uruk too the other cities will not come to our aid now like isin theyll rush to make their peace with akkad on kushannas orders i sealed the city to keep everyone within but thats not going to work for long with eskkar on the march everyone will want to flee no longer queen kushanna enhedu noted just the womans name spoken unflatteringly perhaps things are not as bad as we think tomorrow may bring better news but in her heart and for the first time enhedu started to believe that eskkar had succeeded she rose and fetched two more cups and she and tammuz joined in with jarud consuming the last of the ale and all of them wondering what word would arrive tomorrow j ust before dawn kushanna raged at the wretched soldier cringing before her his right arm bound in a clumsy sling a leader of twenty hed ridden through the night to bring his news my husband is dead you saw him fall yes my queen he fought with eskkar and was slain king shulgi fought well but the barbarian was too strong afterwards the akkadian king spared my life he set many of us free gave us horses and told us all to deliver word of shulgis defeat and death to you and to tell you that he is coming to destroy sumer of all those given the message only this man had bothered to return probably the others had already disappeared into the countryside and our army how many men remain to fight when will they return the subcommander shook his head not many escaped sumers soldiers fought to the last even when the other contingents lay down their weapons however many survived it will not be enough to stop the akkadians they fought like demons my queen attacking our men despite their few numbers she cared nothing about how either side had fought how long before eskkar arrives a few days four or five at most i expect his horsemen will be here tomorrow they were already preparing to ride south when i and the others left the main force wont be far behind kushanna tried to control the sinking sensation in her stomach how had this happened how could everything have gone so horribly wrong twenty thousand men defeated by a handful get out all of you get out she turned away ignoring them and stepped onto the balcony the courtyard appeared different and she realized that many of the soldiers who should have been standing guard had gone slipping away in the night as soon as they heard the news the morning would find more deserters abandoning their posts damn you shulgi you fool kushanna took a deep breath and tried to control her rage she needed to think something must be done she could leave the city but where could she go that trellas agents wouldnt find her nippur and lagash wouldnt take her in and there would soon be a bounty on her head trella knew of kushannas involvement in the war and wouldnt rest until shed been captured or killed besides who could she trust to protect her if she ran whoever kushanna turned to would want her gold and jewels more than they wanted her body and she would be helpless to protect either of them sumer might be held at least for a time perhaps long enough to wring some concession from eskkar but another look at the quiet courtyard convinced her that wouldnt happen without enough fighting men to man the walls the soldiers wouldnt continue the battle for her theyd throw down their weapons at first sight of eskkars riders in fact the longer she thought the more she realized only one man could save her eskkar the king of akkad kushanna would have to turn him to her side she had dominated every man shed ever met and had no doubt that she would succeed with the barbarian king it would take some doing but perhaps it could be managed she thanked the gods that she hadnt killed trellas brother now the halfwitted slave might prove useful she would send word to the farm and have him delivered to her by the time kushanna worked out what to do the first rays of the sun broke into the morning sky she left her chambers and descended to the courtyard grateful to see at least a few loyal soldiers still awaiting her commands her eyes rested on jarud the new captain of the guard jarud round up every one of the nobles every merchant every trader she rattled off the names of sumers wealthiest bring them here at once make sure you find every one they would protest but that didnt matter and spread the word throughout the city i will speak to the people at midmorning in the marketplace go and do not fail sumers fate may rest on how well you obey my commands and more important her own e nhedu and tammuz arrived at the marketplace well before midmorning determined to get a good place to stand and hear queen kushannas words rimaud joined them as much to keep them safe as to hear the queen speak with the city in an ugly mood rimaud wore his sword and tammuz carried his knife on his belt others arrived early as well and soon at least eight or nine hundred people of all ages packed their way into the marketplace with more arriving every moment everyone had questions and shouts echoed back and forth as people sought to learn what had happened many had news probably most of it wrong to share with whomever would listen enhedu shook her head at their foolishness midmorning came and went before jarud and ten soldiers arrived escorting thirteen of sumers richest men some showed bruises and marks on their face and arms so enhedu knew they hadnt come willingly every one of them had sullen looks on their faces she saw merchant gemama there along with puzuramurri and jamshid bikkus husband enhedu had given massages to most of their women she leaned closer to tammuz too bad i never got invited to service kushanna she fingered the knife under her dress the crowd now numbering close to two thousand surged forward shouting questions at the merchants demanding to know what had happened the former leaders of sumer stared at the angry people confronting them but said nothing theyve been ordered not to speak tammuz said queen kushanna had better arrive soon enhedu whispered the people are getting angry there arent enough soldiers here to control this many they both sensed the rising tension no one enjoyed standing around in the hot sun which added to the crowds anger the smell from so many bodies filled the still air the incensed mutterings grew louder and angrier the soldiers glanced at each other and fingered their weapons where is our army an old man shouted the question with a quavering voice what happened to my sons everyone joined in and soon the crowd began to shift and move under the pressure of so many struggling to make themselves heard this could get out of hand tammuz said stay close to me a column of eight soldiers strode down the lane shoving anyone in their path out of the way queen kushanna walked in their midst wearing one of her finest gowns her hair combed and arrayed she wore a necklace of pearls gold rings on her fingers and bracelets on her arms her escort started for the top of the market but she halted them too many people blocked the way stop here ill speak to them from here kushanna ignored both the people and their cries for answers a soldier carried over a stool and helped her step onto it so kushanna could be seen and heard she stared at the crowd and waited until the din had died down people of sumer people of sumer hear me her melodious voice quieted the crowd i bring you evil tidings our army has been defeated by the akkadians enhedu noted the use of just the name no longer demons or barbarians our king my husband is dead now the akkadian army marches toward sumer a groan went up from the crowd along with a few curses to save our city and protect your lives i will offer a ransom of gold to king eskkar when he arrives these men kushanna lifted her shapely arm to point at the nobles under jaruds guard will be required to give up their wealth to save the city with all their gold and possessions and what little is left of king shulgis goods we should be able to raise at least a thousand gold coins a cheer burst forth at the nobles discomfort let the bastards pay others grew angry as they grasped the size of the merchants wealth flaunted at them while they went hungry kushanna raised her arm again to quiet the now angry mob to ensure that sumer and your safety is protected i will also offer myself to king eskkar begging him to spare our city i will kneel before him and throw myself at his mercy king eskkar has shown forgiveness in the past now i will sacrifice myself to save your lives and to save our city and i will present him with the gift of the brother of lady trella who we rescued from the mines cheers greeted the news the first bit of hope theyd been offered enhedu exchanged a brief glance with tammuz neither of them had ever heard that trella had a brother listening to the crowd enhedu decided that kushanna might just manage to do it she would win over the mob with the sacrifice of the nobles with more than a little apprehension enhedu wondered if eskkar would fall under kushannas spell the woman was indeed a witch a shrill voice broke through the clamor you murdered my sons i had three sons and now theyre all dead an old woman with long gray hair hanging limp around her face had pushed her way through the crowd shoving grown men aside she flung a stone at kushanna only a few paces away narrowly missing the queen whose eyes went wide in surprise no one had ever dared raise a hand toward her the woman refused to be silent you sent them all to their deaths she reached down and scooped up a handful of dirt and threw that as well a soldier stepped forward and struck the woman in the face with the haft of his spear knocking her back into the arms of those behind whatever sympathy the crowd had started to give kushanna vanished in a moment murderers she sent our husbands to their deaths the soldiers lowered their spears and pushed the now angry crowd back while a frowning queen kushanna looked on her lips clenched in anger at the insolence the throng of people pushed and shoved moving in all directions everyone cursing and shouting enhedu realized what could happen this crowd could be turned her elbow jabbed tammuz in the ribs death to the queen she yelled the words with all her strength death to those murderers who led us to war death to the queen tammuz shocked at his wifes outburst took a moment to grasp the situation then he too joined in death to the queen death to those who betrayed us in a moment every voice in the marketplace repeated the same words the soldiers greatly outnumbered hesitated at the sudden ferocity from the mass of men and women facing them most of sumers remaining soldiers guarded the gates and the wall and queen kushannas guards were not hardened veterans most were either too young or too old to go off to war and none had ever seen naked anger and hatred such as this the crowd saw the doubt and fear on their faces a wave of people surged forward as ten fifty a hundred voices joined in all shouting death to queen kushanna tammuz pushed his way to the front death to kushanna a soldier tried to hold him back but tammuzs knife lashed out and the guard staggered back his nose broken by the weapons hilt a few people in front died impaled on the spears but the screaming mob now could not be stopped death to kushanna the words came from every voice and this time the cry didnt stop chaos erupted the people of sumer had been demeaned and crushed down for many years and now they saw a chance for their revenge the soldiers grasped the situation too many shrank aside others dropped their spears some turned toward the queen as eager to strike as any of the mob the nobles released by the captors added their voices to the din jarud saw the danger he abandoned the nobles and closed up his men around the queen shouting at his soldiers to keep together enough heeded his words in moments they formed a protective ring around kushanna they struggled and shoved their way through the clawing mob moving toward the lane that had brought kushanna into the marketplace a few more steps and enhedu saw kushanna slipping away she ducked low practically slithering between the legs of the crowd shrieking hatred and venom above her then she saw the legs of the soldiers forcing their way forward then the hem of kushannas gown rising up enhedus long arm stretched out she meant to strike at kushannas heart but an unheeding arm knocked the blade down and instead the weapon sank to the hilt just above the queens hip before it was wrenched from enhedus hand by the forward momentum of the guards kushannas scream could scarcely be heard in all the confusion because the stroke landed so low none of the soldiers realized what had happened only one man saw enhedu strike jarud her knife gone enhedu moved back trying to return to tammuzs side a dozen paces away her husband pushed and shoved against the nearly unmovable mass of people to reach her she looked back and saw jarud knocking people aside determined to get his hands on her enhedu struggled as hard as she could trying to move away from jarud but the captain of the guard was bigger and stronger and the crowd gave way before him as he forced his way closer looking up she saw the nobles fighting the angry crowd for their own lives stones and clods of dirt flew through the air gemama had both arms raised trying to protect his head from the peoples wrath the sight gave enhedu another idea gemama for king gemama for king she snapped her gaze at tammuz the soldiers escorting kushanna had pushed their way clear dragging the faltering queen with them jarud had moved almost within arms length gemama for king unable to reach his wife through the surging mob tammuz bellowed the words gemama for king rimaud took up the cry and others joined in a few at first then dozens and more at the head of the market gemama lowered his hands looking at the shouting mob as surprised as anyone at least the stones pelting him and the other nobles ceased his eyes sought the place where the call started and he picked out enhedu and tammuz gemama will save us enhedu shouted the words as loud as she could those standing beside gemama stopped their attacks one man his anger vanished in a heartbeat grabbed the merchants arm and lifted it high gemama will be our king the sight of the stout merchants arm raised high turned the mood of the mob king gemama king gemama the chant filled the marketplace repeated again and again jarud pushed aside the last of those blocking his way and his hand closed on enhedus shoulder with a grip of bronze tammuz and rimaud struggled a few paces away helpless to reach her side the words king gemama came from every voice now along with appeals for him to save their city enhedu saw jaruds sword jerked from its scabbard wait listen to me she leaned toward him shouting the words into his face to make herself heard over the noise you will be commander of all of sumers forces the swords tip reached her breast gemama will need you you will lead his soldiers we can help you she tried to push herself away from the blade but the crowd held her fast swirling around the two of them no one paid any attention to them every eye now remained fixed on gemama standing dazed before the chants of the crowd two soldiers moved forward to protect the merchant who now held both arms high jaruds eyes burned into hers but he stayed his sword he glanced at gemama then at her understanding came as he worked out what had happened help him jarud she said to save sumer help him tammuz and rimaud pushed their way to her side both with weapons in their hands whether it was their presence or his own choice jarud lowered his weapon make way for the kings men he shouted soldiers defend king gemama protect sumers king then he was gone knocking people left and right until he reached the forefront to clear the way for gemama enhedu breathed a sigh of relief and fell against her husband her heart still raced in her breast lets get out of here tammuz said rimaud lead the way home they headed toward the same lane that queen kushanna had used they pushed through the last of the crowd a dozen paces farther kushanna lay in the dirt a large pool of blood staining her dress and the ground beneath it the pearl necklace and gold rings had vanished her guards had abandoned her enhedu stared down in astonishment her knife stroke had managed to cut the big blood carrier queen kushanna was dead t he next day at midafternoon hathor and four hundred horsemen appeared outside sumers walls they had made a fast passage encountering no resistance and finding a steady source of supplies originally intended for king shulgi now to hathors surprise he stared at sumers walls and found them undefended the gates standing open and a delegation of the citys inhabitants stepping outside the city and walking toward the akkadians hathor halted his men just out of bowshot of the walls and waited a portly man led the way a single armed soldier accompanying him but hathors gaze went to the dozen or so frightened men and women walking respectfully behind only two strode upright and met his eyes unafraid hathor saw the hint of a smile on tammuzs lips while the slight incline of enhedus head told hathor everything he needed to know the man leading the little troop stopped a few steps from the akkadians he announced himself as king gemama he offered to surrender the city and pay a ransom if they would spare sumer and its inhabitants he pleaded for mercy and blamed the war on shulgi and his evil wife both dead gemamas voice droned on but hathor scarcely heard him the mans words didnt matter later on hathor would find an excuse to speak to enhedu in private and she would tell him what had happened and how to resolve sumers future whatever happened king eskkar would get quite a shock sumer taken without a battle queen kushanna dead a ransom offered and all with enhedu and tammuz standing directly behind the citys new king and the leader of his guards incredible perhaps hathor decided the gods of egypt did have power even this far east of the nile they had stayed his hand and spared tammuzs life that mercy had saved hathors own life and in time delivered cnari into his arms no man it seems could fathom the ways of those who ruled the heavens above and earth below the conflict between sumer and akkad had ended and neither hathor nor any of his men needed to risk their lives in battle any more hathor offered a silent prayer to the mighty egyptian god ra for this new gift of life then just to be certain hathor muttered the same prayer to every single one of the gods that held sway over the land of the nile epilogue eskkar guided trella up the last and steepest flight of stairs until they reached the open space at the top the two watchtowers that overhung the citys main gate were the highest structures in the land climbing more than twentyfive paces above the ground no other city including those in sumeria had dared to raise any structure that high sunk into the battlement a tall staff rose even higher into the sky from its tip the lion pennant fluttered over their heads the symbol of the citys power opposite on the right tower flew the pennant of the hawk clan its bronze cap catching the rays of the setting sun trella rested her elbows on the waisthigh wall and gazed out over the countryside eskkar stood behind her his arms wrapped around her he touched her stomach and felt the swell of the child within soon there would be another son or daughter to carry on their line eskkar hoped for a boy but trella shook her head this one feels different husband i think you will soon have a daughter behind them the city of akkad celebrated once again its people happy in their deliverance the sumerians had pillaged the southern lands but akkad itself had avoided the devastating horror of war the inhabitants had suffered through hardships but already that memory was fading as trade resumed and new crops burst from the rich soil akkads victory turned the city into the hub for every merchant trader and shipmaster throughout the land once again hundreds perhaps thousands of people would converge on the city eager to pass through its gates commerce would flourish and the people would be happy and secure eskkar had returned to akkad last night little more than a month after he marched the army south to meet the sumerians in that time the world had changed larsa destroyed uruk humbled isin turned into an ally and trading partner and sumer now ruled by trellas agents shulgi and kushanna dead and already forgotten even trellas brother had survived rescued by tammuz and enhedu from the chaos of sumer as soon as almaric recovered his strength he would journey north to be reunited with his sister whether he would ever fully regain his wits only time and the gods would decide with all its enemies vanquished akkad reigned supreme over the land between the rivers there was no place her soldiers could not march no land so distant her horsemen could not penetrate no enemy so bold as to offer challenge soon her influence if not her soldiers would spread even beyond those boundaries trella raised her arm and pointed toward the north where the wide ribbon of the tigris glistened in the setting sun thats where the future of akkad will lie those empty lands will fill with farms and villages in five or ten years they will be the source of our strength sargon will rule over those lands eskkar said he will grow up to be their king as much as akkads no one will challenge his right to rule now in another few months the boy would be five seasons old and already hed begun to outgrow his childish toys he will be safe for a time trella said perhaps for many years but there will be new enemies if not from outside these walls then from within there will always be those who will seek to take what belongs to him when he is old enough i will send him north to the lands of the ur nammu they will teach him how to be a warrior when he returns you will teach him how to be a king well talk about that when the time comes eskkar knew she wasnt convinced of the wisdom of sending the boy away but that day of reckoning lay seven or eight years in the future enhedu is also carrying a child trella said though he may grow up to be more sumerian than akkadian and cnari has given hathor a son our children and those of our friends will all grow up together and you and i eskkar will make sure they do we must never forget that our strength lies in the hearts of our people as long as we care for them as much as we care for sargon they will give us their allegiance sumer and larsa showed what happens when rulers place their own desires above those of their subjects you will make sure of that eskkar said while i will make certain our army remains strong gatus would have made sure of that and who knows from what direction the next danger will come she turned away from the expanse and put her arms around his neck our blood is still in these walls husband and soon our children will draw their strength from these same walls he kissed the top of her head i think you will give them more strength than any wall no matter how high or strong eskkar glanced up at the heavens one by one the stars were breaking through the darkness perhaps because of them hed survived another battle another conflict whatever role they planned for his future was yet to be played out but for now they had given him what he wanted and he didnt intend to waste the moment come trella lets go home i want to play with my son
