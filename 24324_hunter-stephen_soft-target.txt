soft target stephen hunter pm pm the bullet hit santa claus beneath the left eye it shattered his skull blew a large exit wound from the rear of that vessel and drove a bright red spatter pattern across the pale satin of his throne like some sort of twisted abstract painting worse still the ballistic energy unleashed an upperbody spasm that shook his hat comically askew and it slipped off his face and caught on his ear and hung there like a large red sock the fouryearold girl sitting in his lap stared not so much in horror but in fascination she understood that this was different but had no larger context against which to compare it she had no acquaintance yet with the concept of horror and the human fear of seeing the bodys vaults penetrated and eviscerated but she picked up immediately on the appropriate response from her mother who grabbed her and started screaming as the hundreds of others clustered around santas throne began to do the same a few minutes earlier it was like combat except the food wasnt as good it was shopping in a mall on the day after thanksgiving the blackest of black fridays ray cruz decided that he would never take an iq test again for the results after he had agreed to this adventure would prove suicidally depressing he shook his head even as someone in the crowd jostled his shoulder that person was outbound down the corridor called coloradoafter the river not the statewhile he was inbound his fault maybe maybe not and courteous as ever he shot a look to his victim issued a tiny smile of contrition noted that it was a she and that she was under twenty and concluded that he did not register as a carbonbased life form and turned back to what lay ahead what lay ahead was people confusion greed stuff the despair of the holidays the crunch of families that did not get along duties and responsibilities only halfarticulated but completely felt guilt and regret endless and passionate all that was evident in the tableaux before him the long corridor of mall america a place he hardly knew lined on each side by mercantile units offering the usual treasurejewelry clothes shoes ladies undies toys a stop here and there for junk food or hoochall of it lit through the daylight by the redgreenyellow spectrum of holiday illumination though the temp was a steady seventytwo and the echoes that amplified the ambient noise level testified also to its indoorness so much data so many splendors a multitude of faces and costumes the range from beauty to grotesque from health to sickness from the very young to the very old it was like a village bazaar hed once seen in afghanistan except for the afghanistan part it sucked the energy out of him he wanted to take cover it was incoming like an artillery barrage to the senses he felt his normally impassive face collapse in unwilled but undeniable melancholy hey marine dont fade on me molly chan said im about to call a corpsman he said big tough guy like you you can get through this well show up with packages and make them so happy and youll feel good the nephews will all worship you the sisters will wonder why you took me over them my father will offer to make you a partner in his business and my mom well who knows about my mom it sounded pretty good to ray family it was something that had been taken from him years ago on a highway outside manila when a drunken truck driver hit his mother and father as they drove home from a visit with her relatives even discovering that his biological father still lived hadnt quite filled the hole in his life maybe the sprawling argumentative rambunctious chan clan would he was fortytwo now a few months past twentytwo years of gung ho semper fi usmc lifestyle mostly shooting and getting shot at ray had many scars from distant dry or cold places and he had many memories that sometimesless now than beforeflooded over him men and boys bleeding out or torn to pieces the dysentery of fear the yoke of duty his own need to press on and finish even if it finished him whatre you trying to prove ray achilles died a million years ago someones going to put an arrow in your heel too if you dont watch out im hector not achilles ray had replied knowing the difference but then in the washington area for a talk at one of the alphabetsoup agencies that sought his postretirement employment he had met molly chan and maybe it would all change maybe it would be better after all it had been of all places another gigantic mall one out in northern virginia you look like youre about to cry someone had said to him as he stood at the corner of macys and lord amp taylors baffled as to direction and destination he turned she was more asian than he was shorter than he was and unlike his dead flat desert of a face adept primarily at staying neutral while people tried to kill him hers was lively lit from within by intelligence and wit and she had you have cheekbones he said one on each side they wont go away no matter how much i eat im halfasian he said i noticed both halves she said i bet its a long story longer than tolkien denser too but at leastno hobbits anyhow yeah i am about to cry why did i come here its like the end of the world i just need some underpants youve never been in a mall before possibly im not sure im just out of the marine corps twentytwo years they may get you killed but they do hand out free underpants she laughed at his little joke and that was a kind of start it turned out they got along their rhythms were right they agreed on who the worlds assholes were they didnt like pompous overbearing selfimportant people they believed in hard work modesty repression and honesty neither drank a lot both drank a little both were embarrassingly smart what could possibly go wrong first it was coffee then it was a couple of meals a number of enjoyably merry emails then a really bad movie and then some interesting stuff happened and here he was in suburban minnesota at the biggest mall in americaamerica the mall it called itself and everywhere you looked stood the three letters atmon the biggest shopping day of the year he was visiting her parents and family headquartered in nearby saint paul and on this day the chans went shopping en masse the family was hmong that is formerly mountain tribal vietnamese honorable and ferocious allies of the american war effort of the s and s since by political necessity decamped to the upper midwest she was secondgeneration had only been to asia as a tourist she was thirtyfour and an attorney in washington at the department of energy she was beautiful too good for any man shed ever met and even now unsure why she had spoken to the trim guy in the mall looking for underpants but glad she had he remained vague about his past not knowing that at a certain time before she got in too deep molly had called in a dc favor and had received a synopsis of his career highlights all five tours in the suck and the last crazy ride to hell and glory that ended in that famous missile detonation at the rose garden now he said as they were carried along by the current of the torrential secondfloor colorado corridor are we at this spot by random drift or is there a conscious destination ahead on either side stores came and went ann taylor invisibleshield by zagg lego imagination center impulse lees video gallery and everywhere lights green and red christmas trees elves santas the whole nine yards of christmas cheer braying psychotically at the innocent and the easily disturbed i think theres a skateboard place up ahead my nephew george needs tape it has been explained to me thus tape we get the tape and we are on the homeward bound i guess i can handle that he said youll prevail you always have why wouldnt you now she said with a smile but the going wasnt easy not by any means and en masse the normally polite and melancholy minnesotans became somewhat bellicose christmas was doordie for them a fullcontact sport played more vigorously than their beloved if sadboy minnesota vikings had played again this season and two exotics like rayreyes fidencio cruz filipino by culture if not by birthand molly chan werent going to stand in anybodys way they came to skate city and he followed her in and watched mutely as she purchased a spool of bright red grit tape so that her nephew could whistle around the streets off central avenue aboard a minisurfboard on jet aircraft landing gear one look at the shaky conveyance built for speed guts stamina strong legs and a fourteenyearolds lack of capacity to imagine disaster and ray faced his own advanced age hed been shot at several thousand times but a skateboard scared him to death hed rather face a brace of hadjis than something so lethal see wasnt that easy molly asked not bad he said i feel myself rallying we are done now no we are done now yes so we can move on to other things unless she said you want to ride the wild mouse id rather do another combat tour than ride that thing he said as not twentyfive yards away the corridor called colorado yielded to an amazing splurge of space under a wash of lateafternoon sunlight and in the forefront of that space the single car of a roller coaster called the wild mouse slalomed by shaking screams from its teenaged inhabitants this spectacle was sited just beyond the rail of the balcony for the mall at that location opened its central space to provide area enough for an amusement park under a vast skylight shaped to resemble a prominent map icon the conceit of america the mall of indian falls minnesota and the stroke of marketing genius was that it was no simple doughnutshaped fabrication its designers had contrived it to more or less resemble the shape of the continental united states a stylized pentagon whose morphic resonance would instantly conjure the association to america in the collective unconscious it was correctly oriented to the compass moreover so that a flat straight border was actually its northern extremity then a washingtonoregoncalifornia coastline angled downward to a san diego corner before jutting eastward via a long long wall engineered to form two crescents which signified the swoops of the mexican border and the coast of the gulf of mexico at that terminus roughly where tallahassee was located in the real world its outer wall trekked southeasterly to form a peninsular outcrop that stood in for florida to complete the fantasy from the tip of the sunshine state to the tip of frosty maine a wall ran with only one bend to honor the atlanticside convergence of florida and georgia this of course meant that the amusement park was in the midwest or center of the squarefoot immensity and above it the skylights were patterned across the vast roof in the configuration of the great lakes from the ground the view yielded nothing of interest no matter from which direction you chose to examine atm it looked more or less like an aircraft carrier hull dumped in the middle of the frozen minnesota plains that wasnt the point however the whole thing had been located on the primary flight path to the twin cities great multihub international airport so thousands saw it in its full glory every day from feet as it had been imagined by its builders like the pyramids it only made sense from the sky inside besides the corridors designated by river names and zones by compass location it continued with a zealots intensity to have fun with geography some wit had been allowed the multiplex movie theaterfifteen screenswas on the fourth floor of california the higherend more sophisticated mens and womens shops in the ne in manhattan florida contained vacationware shops around the midwestern amusement park had been clustered most of the many many food stalls snack bars and restaurants and so on and so on most hellish was the amusement park it sported not only the wild mouse but a batch of other thrill rides one that whirled seats about at the end of tethered wires another that replicated somebodys idea of a log waterway that shunted screamers down aquamarine chlorineinfused liquid more like scope than actual ho the yells of the riders the clack of the vehicles on their tracks the blur of motion the whoosh of disturbed currents filling the air of the huge place all amplified under a roof of skylights designed to let in the wan november minnesota sun and combined with the din of shoppers made the place pretty much unbearable it was all there the two great things that befit a place calling itself america the mall shopping and speed okay she said then lets get out of here i am so gone he said oh wait she said now if you really want to make molly happy let me point you in the proper direction and she twisted him fortyfive degrees until he came to bear on a place called boardwalk fries i smell potato she said potato is good potato grease salt crispy exterior well he said i have to say they smell good they do but thats probably not the actual fryingpotato odor but rather some chemical product from monsanto it probably comes out of an aerosol can well it worked on me lets get some french fries and that was a sound he knew one loud then lots of them percussions sharp and hurtful flashing back among the corridors and crannies too loud earsplittingly loud replicating themselves in the echo unto multiplicity and drawing the crowd into silence in a frozen instant before panic screams and chaos somebodys shooting ray said the man who shot santa claus was named maahir he was an unusually large somali soldier from the militia hizbul islam under command of general hassan dahir aweys opposed to the brigands and false believers of the militia al shbaab the policy differences between them were immense and one could list them easily if given a year and a half to do so the shot was about feet but for him it was nothing maahir had taken many other long shots in his time making most hed also taken many close shots and the spectacle of death as released upon a body by bullet wound was nothing new to him but everything else was new this place this strange structure these people in their comfort their wealth their fear the unbearable smells of food the beauty of the young girls the data so overwhelmed him he had almost fallen into enchantment but allah had kept him rigorously devoted to mission after the shot which signaled the beginning of this great martyrdom operation one that would see him happily arrived in paradise before the day finished he looked around as people fled him in horror it was so funny ha ha the look of terror on their faces in wars you seldom saw such fear because you were always moving not so here he stood in the center of the collection of crazed speed apparatuses and listened as the gunshots arose from his brothers as they engaged the infidels for the first time before him panic and fear but mostly collision as some ran this way and some that and many went sprawling in the crackups that ensued he edged backward a bit to get out of the rush of the masses and knew that if he wanted he could fire and fire and kill and kill but after all there was no hurry and there would be ample time for those pleasures on the large video screen displaying the scada icons memtac purred away placidly cybertestimony to the fact that all was tidy in the kingdom of atm you could be forgiven for not looking but phil deakins watched anyway scada stood for supervisory control and data acquisition and it was the technology by which the mall was ruled through the auspices of its software program as designed by siemens in germany called memtac scada ran access controls hvac energy consumption life safety and all other operational aspects of the mall it supervised through the computer and it acquired data needed to tell the computers what to do it could do the simple unlock doors at a certain time or the complex reroute cash register transactions if the satellite processing system went down it had no preferences idiosyncrasies quirks glitches charm or moodiness and represented the dull systemized perfection of the german engineering mind you wouldnt want to go drinking with it youd end up barfing beer in a gutter while yearning to invade poland it set the temperature regulated the lighting informed security when an alarm went off controlled the credit card verification process monitored the fire control system determined that the cameras and the recording equipment worked at all times what was so cool about itthose nutsy germans was that its user interface was pictorial and userintuitive thus what dominated the wall of the security office of america the mall was a glowing representation against an azure blue background of a large flow chart that looked a lot like a family tree from the planet dune chunks of info identifying labels holding pens all arranged by a grid of lines and accessed by an operator with a good mouse hand the system itself when it needed petting by humans rare enough was controlled by the technique called drag and drop or sometimes dragon drop whereby the operator made things happen via nesting the cursor on something and mousing it to another zone where it was deposited and somewhere faroff airconditioning went down two degrees the janitors were notified that someone had stuffed cotton underpants in the urinal in the mens at hudson the log flume chlorine fluoridation program was cranked down by twenty parts per million so that lab smell wasnt nearly so offensive to older people with oversensitive olfactory glands but until that afternoon nobody had ever shot santa claus jesus somebody just shot santa someone shouted it was a security geek tasked with monitoring the camera displays on another wall as one of his toomany duties jesus christ i am not kidding they blew his head wide open call the police said deakins god i cant imagine what kind of sick phil look at nine phil commander of the afternoon watch for america the mall security looked and saw chaos speed blur panic spreading into a plague of indistinct animal movement on the monitor marked nine which he knew to represent the nw colorado corridor floor one camera which gazed from its plexiglas encasement down the thoroughfare toward in the distance yards area z as the silliland amusement complex was professionally known in fact by the crazed magic of closed circuit security television he could watch the panic spread from nine to eight area z entryway east while lights began to blink on phone lines and twoway radios barked as various security personnel called in meanwhile the big board began to send signals of distress it monitored pedestrian traffic density and noted drily an overload and backup at three exits oh shit called thomason number two in command at the fourthfloor security headquarters look at fifteen phil felt a cold edge of hurt slice his solar plexus and actually had to take a deep breath to keep from hyperventilating into collapse fifteen betrayed the same symptoms panic flight mass movement chaos fear people running people falling children being knocked over old people pushed aside the horror bled from monitor to monitor across the vast wall of security views into the mall from all anglesthirtysix of them total in the background the hazy image of a gun muzzle issuing a whitehot spurt of blast drew all eyes even if packed in here no outside noise reached them im getting shooters thomason was screaming over the phone we have active shooters in the mall first floor people down and bleeding jesus christ it was their ultimate nightmare the one that everyone said would never come but it had come it was here it was happening phil swallowed dwarfed by it he looked from monitor to monitor seeing the armed men moving down the corridors driving before them the unarmed civilians in the hundreds of course drive them to the center to area z and hold them there or turn it into a slaughterhouse he had a moment of remorse at the complexity of the mall and how hard a puzzle it would be for responders to engage the amusement park at the center with its jungle of attractions and its loops and swirls of track spread across all altitudes of course the whole thing was equally riven by corridors and stairways running behind the stores it was like an immense game of d chutes and ladders his mind clarified he picked up the red phone on his console the direct line to state police headquarters bypassing local suburban yokels when he picked up the red line no dial was necessary as instantly a pipelined voice responded daywatch emergency do you have an incident atm phil hung together daywatch emergency we have active shooters in the mall as far as i can make it out we have one no two of them in each main corridor i cant see who they are but ive got a massive panic situation here i need relief fast someone even shot santa claus could this be some kind of a drill or a movie scene no no its for real goddammit people shooting people down hysteria snuck into the margins of his voice daywatch emergency got it together or maybe now it was an older guy more experienced do not move from your command position officer he said we are dispatching units immediately we need you on the monitors security do you hear me affirmative said phil who had fifteen good years on the saint paul metropolitan police force under his belt and had been in emergencies before he turned cooler now to the number two guy inform our people they are not to attempt apprehension unarmed theyll just be gunned down jesus we have no weapons we phil i got indian falls metro theyre sending cars we have people all over the mall calling we have cops inbound from all over the place man this is a real basketfuck said phil then again with the calm of a serious professional in the crisis of his life he picked up his earphones and throat mike slipped them on went to override on the communications grid of the console and spoke to his men spread throughout the mall some on segways some on foot listen all personnel we have a ten thirtytwo man with gun maybe multiple i repeat a ten thirtytwo man with gun multiple shots fired do not try to apprehend armed personnel you will only get yourself hurt move people away from the line of fire if possible provide medical attention and traffic control to open exits i am putting mall evacuation plan a in effect i have alerted local le we have big help inbound come on guys stay with me on this do your jobs hang in there we will get you help as quickly as possible we have cavalry coming from all directions and with the sound of a vacuum tin being opened power died in the room darkness fell replaced in seconds by emergency red lighting but the big board plasma screen with its gleaming representation of germanic efficiency was black all the security monitors were down and the radio net had gone bellyup the electrical backup system had not cut over and there were no comforting sounds of wellrunning technology what the fuck phil said and he wasnt the only one as all six men in the command office began to curse immediately flipping buttons hitting toggles banging screens twisting radio dials yelling at handsets cool it cool it yelled phil in seconds his team had gotten hold of themselves hes taken over our security system someone said motherfucker has cut us out of it okay okay said phil stay calm nothing is helped if we panic we the fucking doors are locked someone said the men sat there for a second amid dead security monitors lightless communications equipment airconditioningless rising temps feeling nausea they were trapped they were in lockdown the electromagnets concealed within each door had been directed by memtac to clamp them closed using the full power of the lodestone which was beyond influence by any force less than a wellplanted explosive oh shit someone said smell that yes it was an odor something chemical in nature had just popped in the air vent the smell of freshmown hay filled the air it reminded phil of the farm hed grown up on in iowa even as he recalled from a class on some longforgotten law enforcement seminar twenty years ago that the smell of newmown hay or grass was an indicator of a substance called phosgene it was a poison gas asad thought look at the white sheep run oh how they ran what sorts of men were these they had no courage no heart of lion no belief in allah a little pop from the gun and they ran what cowards he said to saalim saalims job was to cover the rear he was not happy about it it wasnt fair was he not a fighter like asad perhaps more so even had he not stood in the high desert with hizbul islam against the city usurpers of al shbaab near wabra had he not burned their houses and executed their men and herded their women and children into the stockades he had done it all praise be to allah may peace be upon you brother but now he was the rear security chap while this miscreant asad reaped allahs glory on the rifle the cracks of the gunfire knifing through then echoing off the profane walls of this grotesque temple of infidel faith with its nude women in windows its temptations its then a man appeared in a white shirt on some kind of insane upright motorcycle his head clasped in a helmet and certainly he was armed for he had what appeared to be police wires running to communications plugs in his ears as had the iranian advisor in the high bright desert whod talked them through the campaign and led them in their vengeance upon the false believers of al shbaab the rifle was there cradled in his arms against his shoulder and with a surge of joy and glory he fired loving the drama of the baby kalashnikov and in the smear of flash at the muzzle he saw darkness blossom upon his enemys chest and down the infidel went sprawling lifelessly in a heap beyond grace as if his legs had been turned to wet clay beneath him that is how they die no without dignity or sense of courage just brought down like animals i killed one asad he said hah said asad i have killed many but stung by the boastfulness in saalims voice he felt that to retain warrior face he must kill again and so he selected a cow from the herd and fired she was a big one black like himself but slow which is why she lingered at the rear of the fleeing crowd but he had no mercy this day the rifle cracked and spurt spinning hot brass and though he could not see the hit she went down with the heavy flop of a large dead animal next to her behind her two more a man and a child went down but the man got up got the child up and the two raced off trailing slicks of blood easy to track he looked back at his kill she lay in a sprawl her face fat and slack and next to her a child knelt crying for his downed mother unaware that today would be a day without pity we will kill them all he exulted feeling the power of gods will move through his body the aphrodisiacal smell of the fired powder the satisfying recoil of the baby kalashnikov before him with even more urgency if such could be imagined the crowd seemed to speed up all the mothers and daughters and fathers and sons of the west all of them cursed unto damnation and eternal fire by allah and he asad was the deliverer the living embodiment of allahs will on earth oh it so fit with his imagery of the end of timesthe scale of it the fury of it the blood of it his own pitiless relentlessness like an angel from on high sent by our lord to cleanse the earth of those who would not submit to the faith he was so lucky he did not know how to contain himself this day he would sit with allah and feel his warmth and benevolence and he would have sexual congress with any young women he cared so to select and the best part he didnt have to be dead to enjoy the sex he had been promised a live western girl to celebrate he decided to shoot up a ladies shop he turned faced it directly and began to pump the trigger at the big display window the baby kalashnikov danced in his hands breathing hells breath of smoke and flame and spent casings as before him the glass yielded into punctures then shattered in a sleet of delirious reflection and behind that dummies that wore those garments that decent women kept hidden under their burkas and only showed to their husbands splintered and fell in puffs of white dust and snapping ribbon as the bullets pierced them andin the metaphorical immensity of asads mindpierced the west too with its temptation its licentiousness its sultry ardor and appeal it reminded him of a strip club in toronto hed visited and had wanted to shoot up as well though it had been explained to him then that his rage was best controlled until it could be unleashed then on his radio set came the stern voice of authority you two he heard the imam command we see you on the television screens asad and saalim correct you were told not to wantonly destroy property with your limited amounts of ammunition this is not a party it is a serious martyr operation treat it seriously or be banished all you boys you listen you are martyrs not brigands the mission is to drive the people forward into the center and hold them penned under your guns you cannot give in to temptation and random impulse the koran forbids it verse twentythree directive eleven know the wisdom of thy elders throughout america the mall there was frenzy people scurried desperately to comply to escape or to hide their minds focused on a single thing and that was to survive yet they were not inhumane and some were quite heroic goth teenagers helped old ladies black gangbangers helped white republican mothers gay waiters helped high school football players old white men helped young white women without thinking about having sex with them at least for a little while somali grandmothers helped scandinavian grandmothers who helped them back fallen children were gathered and shielded and comforted by complete strangers doctors went to the wounded tried to stanch the blood flow without bandages and placed their own bodies in the way of bullets dead santas teenaged elves tried to keep some panicked mothers from racing off and one even threw herself on a child who had fallen in the crush got the girl up and helped her towell there was no place to go but helped her to her screaming mother who hadnt found her yet no one hit anyone or trampled anyone to escape none of them committed an imustliveaboveallelse sin worthy of punishment manhood was in flower down there on the killing floor and so was womanhood and fellowhood until there was nothing to be done but to sit down under the guns of the attackers and hope that they had grown bored with slaughter but in all this motion there was one figure of motionlessness he was a gangly young man of an age perhaps between eighteen and twentyfive more or less lounging against the fourthfloor railing of the balcony overlooking the amusement park area from the terminus of the corridor called colorado he wore jeans over new balance hiking boots a hoodie that actually said harvad the r having flaked off after numerous washings and an old vikings cap backward on his head from his coloring and the perfect shape of his nose most would have assumed a shock of blond hair lay under his cap and they would have assumed rightly his legs were crossed and he slouched against the railing his arms crossed as he supported himself upon it he looked like he was watching a baseball game or a parade or something no tension showed in the muscles of his body under the clothes no shock no fear nothing except the utmost in relaxed viewing he was recognizing patterns it was interesting to him that the rio grande team had been the most aggressive and so they forced their flock into the center of the mall the soonest meanwhile the colorado and hudson driven reached almost simultaneously and both mobs crushed together with much bumping and shoving finally the laggards at mississippi produced and those folks were the most unfortunate as all the prime real estate had been seized and they were left to the margins which put them closest to the gunmen the most apt to incur the whimsical displeasure and hairtrigger temper of the shooters and therefore most at risk then he switched his attention to the throne in the center where santa had been whacked from four stories he could just barely make out the mans ruined face and the pattern of blood spray across the satin plush of the throne he was struck nonetheless by the considerable if de trop amusement factor in seeing the familiar icon so completely comprehensively dead it seemed to make up for a lot he hoped someone got a good picture of it because as an image of his ambition it seemed to say it all it was one of those casual artifacts that nonetheless are freighted with communication a piece of spontaneous art he saw the image on the cover of a box dead santa the christmas mall carnage game for microsoft xbox only it was pretty damn funny the game had begun pm pm the shooting had stopped ray lay with molly and several other women in the rear of a fredericks of hollywood store on the second floor generic womens bodies truncated at neck and thigh stood around in bikinis leather corsets underpants pasties but nobody thought there was anything remotely funny about it outside the pedestrian traffic had disappeared oh god said a girl oh god oh god oh god i cant believe this is happening i dont want to die said another woman i have children i cant die its not right please ladies ray said im no expert but youll be better off if you hold it down and get a grip you can worry about how unfair it is later hes right phyllis someone said shut up just be glad milt and the kids arent here im here to buy something to wear for his goddamn birthday he should be here its probably some freak with a gun said another the cops will get him dont you think theyll get him mister i heard more than one gun said ray thats what bothers me i cant get through i have to call my husband the phones are its all jammed up ray said everyone in this mall who isnt dead is trying to call home please youd be much better off not to worry about making contact now just try and stay calm and relax i didnt hear any firing on the upper floors i think this is restricted to downstairs so if youll just try and stay calm and still in the long run thats the best course we just lie here and they come kill us if they were into slaughter theyd still be shooting now im going to slip out and see what i can see stay here stay down dont get curious molly pulled him close my mother and sister are downstairs she said let me see whats going on he said then louder is there a manager or a clerk here a young woman crawled over to him mrs renfels is the manager but shes in pretty bad shape my name is rose i work here listen rose i need to know about the security cameras here in the mall are they everywhere if i sneak out will someone watching them in the security headquarters see me maybe theyve taken that over that would be their logical first step i dont think there are any in the corridors you know i mean what i mean is settle down rose take a deep breath no rush youre doing fine okay mostly theyre at the intersections and they look down the corridors they dont have them every twentyfive feet or anything thats what i mean they make you take a tour when you start working here and i was in that room the views dont have a lot of details you know its a long look down the corridor theres a lot of shadows i wouldnt stand up if you stand up and someones looking at that camera theyll know youre there good very good he considered okay he said im going to crawl out and try and get a feel for whats happening ladies please stay here like rose said if you try and get out by running they may see you what are you going to do ray molly asked well i guess i ought to scout around i cant just sit here ray you can just sit here follow your own advice just sit here wait help will come i heard that one about a thousand times in the suck it never did im just going to slide out and see whats what you ladies you just stay still slowly ray snaked forward he eased his head around the threshold of the doorway the corridor was empty though signs of rapid abandonment were everywhere dropped purses and bags of goods upturned baby carts some of the windows of the stores broken he saw no bodies and no shell casings on the floor but he heard moans din the sound of many people shifting in place that noise came from the space of the atrium seventyfive feet away its openness and height guarded by railings incomprehensibly christmas music still filled the air and the lights from the amusement park still blinked remorselessly on no it wasnt a silent night it was a loud afternoon he looked up and down the hallway for a sign of gunmen saw nothing everything told him get in the back of the store block the doors wait it out there cant be that many even now law enforcement is responding in a big way there will be an assault and you do not want to be running around in the middle of that kind of shitstorm fuck he thought i thought i was done with this stuff he had been shot at a whole lot in his life and for the most part he was fine by that it went with the territory it was the avenue by which he expressed his odd powerful even selfdefining gift to put a bullet where he wanted no matter the position the distance the angle the firearm to be the dark figure known as the sniper someone wanted him to enjoy that talent and it was the centerpiece of his life that he not blow the mission whatever the mission was whoever gave it to him and now he knew that it tracked back over generations to an odd family of men with similar gifts some greater some smaller but who had always gone beyond the edge with their possibly autistic how else to explain it coordination of front sight and target and sometimes not even front sight but now here he thought he was home free from the suck but the suck had followed him home and he was not free someone had given him another mission and though his bones ached and his breath came in hard spurts he had some obligation to well he knew the obligation more than he knew the name of the force that had generated it so he pushed on again checking the hallway and seeing no signs of movement he edged out and slithered in the low crawl he stuck close to the wall figuring that he was in a zone of shadow and unless one were looking carefully at the feed from a particular camera itself mounted a good hundred feet down the corridor at the intersection he ought to be okay he got by several stores and became aware that each contained people as well the smart ones the lucky ones the strong ones the young ones had beat it to the exitways and gotten out to the parking areas he could see the balcony ahead and beyond it the looming strutwork of various thrill rides the buttresses of the coaster tracks the log chute the top of the whirling twoseat swings the noise from just beyond had gotten more intense he had to know what was going on below he slid forward just a few feet to the very edge of the balcony lifted his head and took a quick scan then withdrew shit first of course in the center of the park dead santa atop his throne of blood presided head tilted inert as the earth itself he was the king of death beneath his majesty sitting disconsolately on the pathways that crosscut the amusement park were at least a thousand people packed closely most in a state of shock he saw what had happened the gunmen had begun at the outer ring and shooting wildly killing enough to compel instant terrified obedience had driven shoppers forward to converge in the amusement park in the center a thousand hostages under the struts and buttresses of the roller coasters under the vastness of glass above shaped like lake michigan he hadnt time to check closely but he imagined they were now circled by gunmen that was two gunmen per corridor eight gunmen at least a team for each river in the wacky scheme of the mall the colorado the hudson the rio grande and the mississippi he scooted low along the balcony railing out of view from beneath and popped up again for a look at the shooters he could see them as if from his own nightmares the insouciant postures the raffish shemaghs thrown loosely around the neck in gaudy variations otherwise in jeans and hoodies and sneaks all carried some kind of ak though from the distance and given the time he had he couldnt tell if it was a or a they carried the guns with that moviedriven stylishness of the young jihadi aware how cool and badass they looked selfconsciously modeled on the same figure they had worshipped for years on television thinhipped sexy anonymous deadly the warrior of the east come to slay in the west and he saw what a mess they had crafted the situation instantly became clear in rays tactical mind those on the upper floors will be abandoned there too terrified to move downward basically not a part of the equation the young the spry the brave they had escaped running crazily past the gunmen getting out of groundfloor exits climbing finding other ways out or secure hides who was left the weakest of the weak the most defenseless of the defenseless the old the very young mothers and fathers tethered to children at any sign of an assault the gunmen could open fire even with semiautomatics as his ears told him their weapons were they could kill hundreds while at each corridor their brothers held off the assaulters for a few minutes more ray looked up saw the lakeshaped skylights they appeared deserted but at any moment snipers would station themselves there could they get shots through the heavy glass probably not theyd have to blow the glass to have any effectiveness and that would give away any surprise element military operators delta people or seals could blow the glass and rappel down but theyd be sitting ducks as they descended and they couldnt fire downward for fear of hitting the innocent they could ray supposed just keep coming like the marines at iwo but that kind of dying for an objective was definitely out of fashion on top of that operators at that tactical level were mostly deployed overseas where would the minnesota authorities even with fbi assistance get such men on short notice and this whole op had the look of something planned for maximum outrage over a short window of time he remembered something similar in russia with chechens didnt they take over a theater hundreds of hostages lots of explosives and gunmen no way in the russian authorities had gassed the place but the gas was tricky and although it incapacitated the chechens it killed half the hostages there was no way americans would be willing to run that risk and with so many hostages children and the elderly with undeveloped or overworked inefficient respiratory systems the gas would be doubly risky perhaps doubly lethal and who said the gunmen didnt have gas masks they seemed to have everything else fuck ray thought he suddenly felt him him yes the one the guy whatshisname beelzebub lucifer whoever he was the fellow whod thought this thing up in his mind he saw some osama variant possibly with time in america who knew american vanities and vulnerabilities a guy with a special malevolent cunning and a great deal damn his damned soul of creativity hed thought it through very carefully for maximum impact maximum drama maximum casualties at a site comprising entirely the innocent at the start of the wests most precious holiday he knew who his hostages would be he knew where to place his assets for maximum utility he had both a strategic and a tactical gift already ray knew this was worldwide news and in every department in the world pointyheads were trying to figure out its meaning nobody anywhere was talking about anything else would i ever like to get that guy in my crosshairs he thought molly looked up as ray slid back in the door did you see my mother and sally she asked no i didnt have time ladies listen up im going to tell you what i think is best quickly he narrated his discoveries the situation his estimation of the difficulties law enforcement would face how soon will they come one of the women asked not soon they have to get their best people in here they have to acquire detailed plans for the mall they have to try and penetrate the security system which these people may already control and which was designed by geniuses to keep people out they have to decide their best course on top of that these invaders they may have demands which will put further complications into the situation they seem professional and this operation appears well planned and nobody outside wants to make a hasty decision that could get a thousand civilians killed believe me so im telling you right now you have to commit to the long haul you cant pin your hopes on this being done quickly so do we just sit here he turned to the young clerk rose rose what about a back way out theres a loading corridor that runs through each of the sections thats how we receive our merchandise where would that take us well theres an elevator to the basement which leads to the subterranean receiving level first thing theyd do would be to turn off the elevators what about a stairwell yes theres a stairwell we could escape through the stairwell someone said joyously no not quite see im thinking that for now theyre not going to pay attention to the upper floors but as time goes by they may send teams upstairs to root people out and herd them down to join the hostages the more hostages they have the more power to negotiate so id go up one floor to three and find refuge there because when they come for us one team will start at the top and work their way down and another will come up to the second and work up so the middle floor is the safest in the long run plus if the cops do assault they may drive some gunmen up here to this floor and have a shootout here and trust me you dont want to be in the middle of it does that make sense a surge of good cheer arose and ray noticed that all the women were buoyed at the prospect of doing something to help their chances except for rose rose whats wrong when the shooting started i had the same idea i ran out the back and tried the stairwell see all the locks in the building are part of the software hes locked it were stuck here are the doors heavy theyre not as heavy as the outside doors those are metal sunk in metal but these are tough heavy wood and youd have to batter and kick an hour to get them down or shoot your way through ray didnt say anything but he knew what that meant yes it confirmed that somehow the attack team had taken over the security program that underlay the mall operations protocols they had locked the doors remotely they were in complete control he looked carefully at the scada representation of memtac where its captured images blazed from his own monitors quickly he checked off the key points lockdown enabledelevators disabledescalators disabled no surprises there once you get in you learn the culture of the system the assumptions its built on how the german geniuses at siemens think how thorough they were how they swept up their sandwich crumbs after lunch and how shiny the bathroom fixtures were he continued to monitor examining the ecosystem of the empire airconditioning ontemperature control fire sprinklers enabledfluorescent lighting system enabledarea z fuses function percentpower grid stablesanta claus dead no no it didnt say that but he had a morbid sense of humor and he saw it in his imagination as he also thought about what he could do with his power since the owners of this mall owned dozens of other malls in the us and canada all using the memtacdriven scada all linked he could really raise hell if he wanted by refusing credit cards turning cash registers insane locking out and in freezing elevators directing the coke machines to urge customers to buy pepsi all across the land but really that wasnt the point the point was the game and then as an afterthought his piece de resistance internet connection disabled ha i hear you knocking but you cant come in well actually there was one way in it would be interesting to see if there was anybody out there smart enough to figure it out i cant get in said a computer technician from the minnesota state police whoever he is hes taken the thing off line its internally sealed ive run all my conventional link search programs and im not getting a thing its a vault keep trying said douglas obobo who was the newly appointed commandant of the state cops i know you wont let me down a special warmth came into colonel obobos voice on the last sentence i know you wont let me down that was the obobo touch known in its limited way and possibly about to become more famous he had the gift of inspiration of making people believe first in him second in the mission third in the larger program that sustained the mission and finally in the administrative entity that embraced all it was why he was the youngest man in history at fortyfour to become a superintendent of state police and the first african american it had been national news sir we need more sophisticated programs and more sophisticated it guys the federal people will have that maybe they can get in obobo said i understand and thats why i have federal people on the way i know if we all work together we can get this done with a minimum of loss he spoke with the confidence of the man who knew the truth and why shouldnt he his success had been pretty much a certainty the son of a kenyan graduate student at harvard and a radcliffe anthropology major hed graduated from both harvard and harvard law but instead of taking the conventional path to whatever the american dream was hed joined the boston police department as a beat cop he was quickly absorbed into the homicide bureau and had been the front man on a series of highly publicized cases where he revealed himself to be a mellifluous speaker and a quick wit and to exude a kind of enlightened law enforcement attitude that could console the races even in a tough town like boston despite the fact that he never broke a case arrested a suspect won a gunfight led a raid or testified in court in five years he left the department to become the lead investigator for the senate subcommittee on government fraud where again his charisma made him a star and got him noticed on the national level run for office many said you have the gift but he was a cop he said and committed to the healing of america by progressive law enforcement policy the old days of kickass and coerced confession were gone the new day of respect for all had arrived he became quickly the assistant commissioner of the baltimore police department then the chief of the omaha police department though he cared little for the snowy plains far from the national media but they kept dropping by anyway and he made the national news more than any other police executive in the country in and finally his big move to head the minnesota state police with the idea of bringing it into the twentyfirst century making it the premier investigative agency in the state while aiming to cut traffic fatalities to a new low that hadnt happened yet and in fact no stated goal had been accomplished but it was hard to hold that against a man struggling against the old culture and the old ways the media loved him for his effort somehow hed ended up on the cover of the new york times magazine subject of a gushing profile by david banjax now his first real crisis he understood that america the mall was a mess first responders had had a nightmare approaching as shoppers fled in the thousands most in cars gridlocking the place so that incoming le simply added to the confusion meanwhile the reports were sketchy mall security was not answering and had not communicated since the first alert went out thousands of calls crowded the circuits all some variety on the theme machine gunners are in the mall or i lost my grandma in the mess help me find my grandma grandma was going to have to wait unless she was already dead but he also understood that this was an opportunity beyond measure in some way a gift the national spotlight would again shine on him and the decisions he made the leadership he showedthe resolution coupled with fairness the fortitude coupled with compassion the eloquence coupled with wisdomwould be on fine display it wasnt about ambition he always said it was about gifts he had been given many it was mandated therefore that he give back you know his longtime civilian advisor and public affairs guru david renfro had whispered in his ear on the thunderous ride over few men get a chance like this this is an opportunity we have to seize by the throat obobo and his senior command teamincluding mr renfrowere in a state police communication van parked across the highway from the huge structure of the mall they were roughly in the position of bermuda about yards out from the middle atlantic states directly to the east he had made some early organizational decisions one major was liaising with incoming swat teams from the local area assigning the men positions on the perimeter but the colonel had authorized no entry or engagement the situation was too unclear he had no idea what he was up against who these people were what they wanted the last thing he needed was an outofcontrol gunfight between his heavily armed operators and equally heavily armed terrorists or whatever in the middle of a crowd of civilians hundreds would die but he also knew that people inside were bleeding out with wounds suffering heart attacks anxiety overloads had been separated from children or other siblings or relatives were hiding in stores panicking maybe plotting a rebellion of their own then he had a major running communications trying to get everybody on the same met and organizing the inflow of information any news on the feds a skeleton team is inbound from minneapolis fast under siren theyre still collecting their swat people theyve got their hrt team gearing up at quantico but theyre still three hours out and then when they land theyve got to get here its going to take a while colonel are we going in ive got people in body armor at every exit now maybe we shouldnt wait reports are that theres a lot of wounded inside those folks need medical attention ah he said an issue of jurisdiction was looming by federal law the fbi took charge in any situation that was defined as terrorism and ran the show but things at america the mall were still unclear despite reports of terroristlike gunmen and terroristlike tactics and ruthlessness he thought it could still be some crazed white militia some nra offshoot some screwball tea party gone berserk in his mind one never could tell about the right in this country particularly deep in the glowering midwest where men clung to guns and religion cursed bitterly as america changed and still believed fundamentally in the old ways renfro said colonel you cannot let the fbi people run this show it cant be a washington thing there are sound policy reasons for itharder for them to coordinate with the locals unfamiliarity with the territory lack of intelligence on the local scenebut the politics count here too washington will want in but youve got to hold washington at bay i know i know said the colonel ive got a plan obobos idea was to use the fbi as the primary investigative tool of this operation they would interview witnesses run the databases check the photo ids and the fingerprint files they would liaise with atf on ballistics that would be plenty for them but in no way was he prepared to relinquish command this one was his negative negative on any kind of assault he announced to his gathered majors i am not going to tell the governor that he has presided over the largest bloodbath in american history establish the perimeter hold the medical people and the ambulance in a zone keep the media in the loop because we do have a responsibility to inform a panicked public and try and set up some kind of contact with these people they must want something and i know i can influence them positively given the chance maybe they just want to kill a lot of folks someone said maybe the longer we wait this was mike jefferson another major head of swat and by nature aggressive hed won three gunfights and could be a pain in the ass obobo mistrusted him as he mistrusted that kind of man bodacious bodyproud thickarmed tattooed and a little too hungry to go to guns if you went to guns he knew all kinds of craziness was loosed upon the earth and nobody knew which way the bullets would ricochet he would never go to guns on the other hand it was not his way to crush underlings major jefferson thats a great point therefore i want you to begin to assemble an assault plan and be ready to deploy and implement at present i feel we must hold until federal reinforcement arrives and then we will see where we are and consider our options but we have to have other options and thats your job jefferson understood hed just gotten a no that sounded like a yes he muttered something and backed off someone else said mike the doors are locked from the inside to even get in for an assault youd have to blow fifty doors simultaneously and we dont have the technology or the explosives to do that only the feds have stuff like that the feds dont even have it not in their shop in minneapolis said jefferson get the governor to authorize the national guard to the site isnt there a special forces unit part of the minnesota national guard maybe they have the expertise also doj maybe dod we may need some army commandos major itll take hours maybe days to get commandos in here i got minnetonka swat incoming where should i put them asked one of the radio operators i think were weak at california said the major in charge of logistics his job was to decide where to place the various units determine their areas of responsibility keep them from stumbling into each other or being assigned redundant tasks and also managing food coffee blankets and other support for the men on the line dispatch them to holding positions at the california entrance said obobo once again reiterating his major theme on the management theory that you tell them then you tell them again and when youre finished then you tell them again no contact no initiatives stay off the air unless theres an emergency their job is to help late stragglers get to medical aid not to be heroes the last thing we need is a hero now lets have a quick press conference we have to start putting information out mr renfro youre on top of this i am sir said renfro it was difficult to determine who died first mrs goldbine from her heart attack or mr graffick from his lowerback wound the sixtysevenyearold woman certainly died the loudest she gripped her chest and began to breath harshly coughing now and then the woman sitting next to her a somali waitress who worked in a restaurant in the mall tried to comfort her and held her hand the woman turned gray the waitress stood raising her hand desperately to attract the attention of one of the gunmen who pushed his way through the crowd with the familiar arrogance of the armed among the unarmed this lady is very sick said the waitress in somali too bad for her said the boy she will die said the girl then that is what allah has decreed sister do not take up with these white devils all are going to die sooner or later if you are nice to me maybe i can spare you go fuck yourself said the young woman in english the boy laughed and turned away what did he say what did he say a dozen nearby hostages had to know she decided not to tell them what he had told her he says he doesnt care he thinks he is god he will find out different she bent over mrs goldbine and saw that it was too late she had passed in another sector of the crowd graffick lay in the arms of his wife he had taken a bullet meant for and aimed at her it had hit him in the lower back and initially didnt produce much blood or even pain hed stumbled but continued to push her ahead in the mad scramble toward the middle of the mall not that there was safety there there was safety nowhere but the law of least resistance produced the inward rush he lay looking up at the lakeshaped spread of skylights four stories up he was not a religious man for driving eight hundred miles a day in the cab of an eighteenwheeler for forty years does not incline one toward the more spiritual things in life nor was he ever in any one place long enough for church to present itself as an option if he worshipped anything it was a goddess his wife you must fight he told her he knew about fighting st marine division an loc rvn purple heart silver star jerry she said just be still sweetie listen these bastards dont let em see you crying dont give em nothing dont give em no satisfaction at all when i go just put on your steel face and dont show a thing remember that time i got busted in that vice sting in ohio you didnt talk to me for a year honey thats the face i know you got it you give it to them and make them fear you please please jerry she was sitting in a lake of blood he was bleeding out and the warm fluid ran from his wound into her dress and puddled around them on the floor god i love you so much he said and then went still not far from him a man named charles dougan was concerned about a bowel movement he could not prevent from occurring he was ashamed it was one thing to die it was another to die with your pants full of shit he didnt realize that incontinence of one sort or another was a crucial feature of hostage situations because no media ever dealt with it honestly but the significant commonality among a large number of people held against their will was lack of sanitation for bodily fluids and that was simply an unfortunate biological reality he raised his hand a boy shoved his way over roughly i have to go to the bathroom he said shit in pants the boy said and turned away and so to his shame and horror thats what charles dougan did im sorry he said to the young woman next to him thats okay said sally chan it doesnt matter there were at least a thousand sitting crosslegged and headdown on the brick pathways of the silliland amusement park the rides now still towered over them absurd contrivances they seemed yet more insane given the circumstances but no one in the crowd much cared about the irony of being surrounded by thrill rides while being held at gunpoint under threat of death and there was dead santa on his throne his body twisted his hat on his ear his head so askew only a corpse could sustain it and that red spatter of blood vshaped by the exit of the bullet on the satin plush of his chair a loudspeaker issued the words jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way but nobody paid much attention the armed boys wandered the perimeter sometimes kicking their way into crowds to deal with issues their faces were impassive but the guns sinister black with ventilated barrels and wicked curved magazines were terrifying nearly everyone had seen such weapons on the tv news and knew them to be the tool of the subhuman category of merciless terrorists of which their owners were surely members the boys occasionally came together and laughed or one would vanish into the mall and return with say taffy apples or french fries and all would eat they drank a lot of cokes and pretty much looted the silliland refreshment center for shakes and hot dogs one of them put a cowboy hat on squishing it down over his shemagh headdress and all helped themselves to new jeans and highend new balance or nike sneakers who was in charge there didnt seem to be a leader but the boys werent quite random in their movement and more or less obeyed the rules of sound security each knot of two hanging in that quadrant of the perimeter keeping their guns oriented toward the seated hostages at any time there were a great many guns bearing on the hostages and all fingers on all triggers most of the hostages also believed the guns were machine guns and that a single pull would send a squirt of bullets out to take them down in batches that concept alone was enough to keep them seated and quiet there was no chance at heroism any kind of mass rush toward a gunman was precluded by the impossibility of coordinating it and the immediacy of mass death it would ensure the smell of burned powder still hung in the air it was like an antiaphrodisiac to dreams of action to rise against the guns would be to die pointlessly in a mall even while outside the rescuers accumulated from above it looked somewhat like the bristol speedway nikki swagger thought a huge absurd structure decreed into the middle of nowhere its odd shape touching automatically on chords of patriotism and sacrifice in all who saw it from the sky serviced by a mesh of highways that came to it from the vague hinterlands now it seemed like race day activity activity activity trucks kept pulling up all of them spurting illumination that lit the twilight in incoherent splash patterns from them spilled urgent men in black with strange devices who ran to cover and took up positions the whole portrait pulsed with energy purpose dedication high training sophisticated deployment yet nothing was happening a fleet of redwhite ambulances and other emergency service vehicles had gathered in one of the parking lots outside the ring the highways were jammed with cars and trucks even as more public safety teams tried to fight the rush and get through them to get close enough to assist over her earphones she heard marty back at the station nikki the great obobo is giving a briefing the first of many im sure he didnt say much only that this appears to be some kind of violent takeover shots have been fired some people have been wounded and the mall has been evacuated duh said nikki who didnt know that does he have a time frame he just said law enforcement from all over the state is gathering on site the feds are pitching in but the situation is still hazy he has no casualty numbers no time frame no declarations of policy nothing but your usual tightlipped fiveoh bullshit nikki knew bullshitshed covered cops in bristol virginia for five yearsbut this guy obobo was a bullshitter beyond any shed encountered he was handsome smooth learned the reporters names knew which cameras and what lights were used and how to apply his own makeup her joke for a cop he knows more about makeup than lady gaga but this was her big op too she knew just as it was the ambitious obobos shed worked as a news producer in cape coral florida for a bit and now she was a producer for wufftv saint paul scoops here on this day could get her to a network to washington or new york she gazed down on the scene from about two thousand feet in the wuffcopter as it was called on the air the wusscopter by station personnel because everybody was scared to fly in it usually it covered traffic but today with capn tom at the controls it orbited over the mall while in the rear larry soames and jim diehl worked cameras to send the images back to the station and thence to the greater minneapolis area she hoped capn tom wasnt drinking today and cursed the united states marine corps for whom he had once flown because it was that connection that got him the job with the station manager another exmarine and she chose not to acknowledge the fact that it was her connection to the corps via her father that had probably gotten her the job too in fact the station was a kind of marine outpost in the chilly upper midwest nikki id like to go up a couple thousand its tricky this low said capn tom her paranoia tried to convince her that there was a slur to his words but she couldnt be positive tom lets hold it a little longer we need good pictures for the feed and up higher its just blurs and lights people need to see the damned place nik i agree with tom if we crash into kpop well be the lead on someone elses live feed youd hate that that was larry older of the two camera jocks he knew how fragile and precious life was even if the concept hadnt yet dawned on nikki but she would hate to lead anybody elses feed she was ferociously competitive so much so that it scared many people in the station she was called mary tyler moore from hell she looked out the window and saw a fleet a mob a density of news choppers hovering about her same altitude over america the country and america the mall it was a tricky thing the birds had to avoid updrafts and couldnt predict blasts of prairie wind so they tried to keep a good three hundred feet apart but nearly everyone wanted the money shot which was the state police communications trailer a few hundred yards east of the mall itself surrounded by police and other official vehicles in the same shot with the south entrance of the mall with its famous atm sign plastered four stories tall that was based on a cartoony simplification of the malls americanized shape just a few seconds more guys she commanded marty are you getting good pix the best nik but dont get yourself killed yet if we need you to die for ratings well let you know ha ha she said humorlessly okay lets get out of here somethings coming through said capn tom and he plugged the emergency general aviation channel into the radio system this is state police hq i am asking all news helicopters to rise to and not wander below three thousand feet we have incoming to the mall and i need you people out of the way so you dont get hurt hey maybe somethings finally going to happen jim the younger the more eager cameraman said we wont be able to see jack from three said nikki larry what lens are you using can you go to something zoomier you really lose a lot of resolution larry said itll look like plastic toys in splitpea soup but no one else will have much anyway damn she said okay lets do it she felt the bottomlesspit sensation as capn tom elevated the craft against the pull of gravity and the structure beneath got smaller from altitude the mall stood in gigantic isolation a wounded america whose sundered arteries spurted illuminated blood into the purple haze of the lowering sun it felt so strange this proximity thing of the media there they were safe and toasty at feet above the place and inside terrible dramas of life and death were being played out nikki and her cohort were there to witness and report yet it was real life and real death at stake nothing neat or melodramatic about it and of course they knew that if they did wellwhat was the line from some old movie i think its safe to say you men are in for some promotions medals and positive recommendations in your personnel files then she saw it the cavalry not quite is that all jim asked clearly thats not an assault said nikki it was just the state police bell jetranger rising from a parking lot and veering on the tilt toward the mall all lights running hot and red and blinking what are they going to do scare the bad guys with the noise larry said the bird painted in the maroonbrown scheme of the minnesota state police took a direct line to the mall and hovered six feet off its roof six young men in dark suits jumped out and began to deploy at the edges of the lakeshaped glass skylights that topped the atrium over the center of the mall six guys said jim those arent guys said nikki theyre snipers pm pm d ont have too much fun in there someone yelled merrily at special agent jeffrey neal he was one of the bright guys techstyle who worked in the hoover building detecting mainly on a computer he was an unbuttoner a penetrator a secondstory man a slippery little shadow in the night of cyberspace it was said hed get the department if he didnt fuck up but that he would fuck up as guys with his iq could be counted on to get busted for falling in love with escorts or acquiring a drug habit or coming to believe ancient grecians were communicating with him through his grecian formula hair coloring brush something selfdestructive that for some reason always draws the hyperintelligent into its flame ha ha he commented from within the shroud the shroud was a canopy draped over his second computer which was connected to the internet it was next to his unshrouded noninternetconnected computer and the two machines and two monitors crowded his small cubicle in the computer services division of the pennsylvania avenue monstrosity the shroud on the net beast kept inquiring eyes out and political correctness at its highest level for one had to dip inside it and only in dark secrecy encounter the very special hell known as the universe of child pornography it was dues you had to pay even if nobody wanted to but neal had three months left to go on his sixmonth tour on the child porn task force which meant he went home each night feeling like a used condom his own sex life mild as it was had been destroyed the things people did to kids the sick worms in their heads that compelled them to conjure new variations in torment abuse piercing and posture you wanted to reach through the screen and crush skulls watch the bastardsnot just fat white guys in their forties but amazingly handsome people of all races ages demo groups normallooking people even distinguishedlooking peoplebleed out in the gutter whimpering but he soldiered on knowing that at the end of neal hey wake up in there hot one in from hq theres some kind of mall takedown in minneapolis and we have to get into the computer system it was his supervisor dr bob benson sa and phd hes in the system neal asked is he ever hes got a thousand hostages hes locked down the mall no local agencies have been able to penetrate guess on whose plate it is now on it said neal get upstairs asap for the briefing then get down here and get your action into gear this babys so hot its steaming no more kiddie rape neal rose quickly started to dash out but he turned back reached out grabbed the shroud of his enforced disgust and ripped it down it was sort of like john wayne throwing off the rifle scabbard as he saw the burning ranch before him in the searchers it meant he was going to war on the way over kemp had been on the phone with washington the whole time subject politics tone unpleasant reality discouraging you have to play this very well will said assistant director nick memphis he will not want to give up command and if you backstreet him he will go to the media and they love him you know that so how the hell do i play it said kemp i wouldnt buck him said nick let him come to you he has to he better come to me goddammit said kemp the saic of the minneapolis office a vet of several task forces including a long spell in texas with atf and drug enforcement that got him shot in the leg he doesnt know a goddamn thing it was true colonel douglas obobo really hadnt done anything his career was primarily a phenomenon of showing up giving speeches accepting awards then moving up to the next level as assisted by the superb public relations and career advisor david renfro whod spent years working the trade fronting at various times for the new york chief of police the san francisco police commissioner renfro had met obobo when both worked for the senate committee and had been with him ever since dont say that to anybody counseled nick keep it to yourself publicly you love and respect him as does everyone in the bureau hes the one we all know that what a mess said kemp and both men knew what he was talking about rumors were rife in washington that obobos next big job would be as director of the fbi the first black man the youngest to ever get the job so both memphis and kemp knew that whatever decisions they made today might come back to shadow them if they ended up working for the guy somewhere down the road assistant director memphis if i think hes endangering people i have to act i have to thats the bottom line you know that look all this may be premature the situation may not be as bad as we think or it may resolve itself peacefully without force and everybody will walk away unscathed if the worst comes he has good people in the minnesota state police to advise him if he listens to them three ford ranger xlt modified trucks black with black glass pulled into the area under the onoff rhythm of redblue and rolled to the state police trailer kemp leaped out in black nomex swat gear with an mp submachine gun on a sling across his chest and a glock in a shoulder holster strapped across his body armor three of the other seven men were equally equipped but the four snipers unlimbered large awkward gun cases from the back of each big suv special agent kemp im surprised you dont have more manpower said obobo in full uniform with his shadow renfro close at hand colonel obobo weve got all our people coming in but its a tough thing logistically more will arrive shortly of course said obobo now let me brief you quickly ive got jefferson on assault planning ive got carmody handling logistics ive got neimeyer trying to coordinate with the medical people i will be handling negotiations myself but of course we need to get an investigation going and thats where i see the bureau making its contribution ive decided to turn over the investigationthe witness interviews the collation of evidence the records and forensic database checks all thatto the bureau sir im sure you realize by federal statute the bureau is obligated to take over any incidents involving terrorism of course and absolutely said obobo smiling broadly putting a big hand on kemps shoulder he was tall towering over most and had an especially beguiling style even in disagreement so it was hard to dislike him but this situation has not clarified i think youll agree and were not sure with whom were dealing there is no operative intelligence suggesting foreign involvement other than unsubstantiated reports of some arabicstyled scarves im sure you agree thats not enough to make a determination this could be any group of nuts as ive already organized my teams i think its more sound for me to retain command of course if and when evidence develops that clarifies the situation and if its within parameters id be happy to make another disposition but you understand of course and i know you agree that turf is less important than teamwork i know i can count on you to work with our initiatives and within our framework yes sir im hoping youre open to advice from my people we do have a lot of experience in these matters of course special agent youll get your more detailed briefing from major carmody and if you have any suggestions wed love to hear them but let me tell you up front i am not about to launch an assault even with your additions i dont have the people the expertise or the equipment weve asked the governor to get us some national guard people to take over the perimeter and that will free up our swat personnel for possible deployment kemp suspected the chances of a swat deployment order from obobo were somewhere between zefuckingro and nafuckingda he kept his face that administrative blank that long government service teaches you know the drill said obobo perimeter security establish commo with the hostage takers and begin to negotiate time is on our side theyll get tired hungry and scared well play them out over their demands as long as possible if i might suggest id like you to get on the horn to defense and see if we could get some advice on chemical agents that might come into play i will colonel obobo i also brought in some very good snipers id like to deploy them on the roof of course and well combine forces with some state police marksmen but im advised the roof skylights are heavy plexiglas sealed in concrete i dont know how we get through them yes well send snipers but no shooting without permission of course and they have to understand their primary mission is observation yes sir said kemp standing nearby was the rogue state police commander mike jefferson his take was different but he had fewer people to answer to and if he lost his job his status as a famous police gunfighter and swat warrior would get him rehired anywhere in america on a moments notice hed been thinking about idaho as a matter of fact but his warriors instincts were all lit up now his idea assault the gunmen have a gunfight take the casualties and the press bashing that would occur and to hell with it kill all the bad guys that was the basic idea he was custer always moving to the sound of the guns he had no patience for the obobo school of psychobabble bullshit for that faction of police psychology that required negotiators welltrained in making empathetic connection to the hostage takers understanding their pain and cajoling them to a peaceful resolution he knew that obobo by long reputation not afraid of the sound of his own voice would assume that responsibility for himself but jefferson knew how fragile these things could be and had seen it all go down his idea was to end the bad guys pain by shooting them in the head but he saw now nobody wanted to listen to him or entertain his speculations jefferson thought these gunmen were here simply because they wanted to kill people thats what would make the biggest splash if they killed five hundred people on the day after thanksgiving to the greater glory of allah and the islamic faithno no confirmation that islamists were involvedin a mall called america that looked like america then that would be their victory hell theyd already killed santa claus there was no evidence this wasnt a suicide thing and suicidemartyrdom the goatfuckers called itwas a part of their mindset the truth was jefferson really shouldnt have been a cop he should have been an oldtime marshal with a sixgun on his belt not a sig sauer that was his mentality he felt fully alive when he faced armed men and his solution to all problems tended to angle the situation toward manonman violence the team play aspect of law enforcement had never meant much to him not since he was twentyone and faced three armed robbers in a saint paul bank and shot it out face to face to face to face with them took two s in the left arm and hand but dropped all three two fatally with his own it being the day of the revolver nothing since had quite matched that moment of maximum lifemaximum risk he was a gunfighter that was all and love him or hate him hed never be another thing as long as he lived which might not given his personality and lack of fear of anything be very long mike another major yelled we have detailed mall plans just arrived from the construction firm that built the place an engineer is here too bring him along maybe he knows the back way in meanwhile obobo and renfro conferred briefly in the corner you handled that well said renfro decent smooth no macho bullshit that goddamned jefferson though he has been a pain since the start i can tell he doesnt buy me never has never will the tough guys hate me think im too fine a lady id love to push him up to international falls in charge of taking the temperature you were fine with him colonel yes hes a pain all the swat people are kill em all let god sort em out but you handled him heres my advice keep him busy keep him running around making reports checking this way and that you dont want him here at command sowing doubts collecting allies make him your little errand boy and bury him in praise thats a weapon he cant overcome saalim had his eye on the somali girl in the crowd fuck you she had said in english to him the two words he knew ha ha she was spirited she was proud she had bright eyes and fine straight white teeth and a rich crop of hair she would make a good wife he wondered how many goats her father would charge probably many sitting there in the mall his baby kalashnikov across his lap his pistol dangling from his holster the shemagh tight around his face he had a brief fantasy that reflected on a childhood he never had he was the son of the tribal chief in the high desert he was a fierce warrior a killer of men and lions he was favored by allah and the mullahs agreed he was destined for greatness he would have many wives and many concubines and many goats he would lead his people in many battles and that one that proud african girl she would be his actually he had been born in a slum of mogadishu his mother was a whore he lived the life of an unclean wild pig for some years scrapping and fighting for survival finally when he was big enough to hold a kalashnikov general hassan dahir aweyss hizbul islam militia took him in that was his family boy soldiers and brutal leaders and enemies to be slain in the name of allah fuck you she said what spirit what saalim i can tell by the glaze in your eyes you are dreaming said asad next to him if the imam catches you with a faraway look on your face hell cane you and make you sleep with the goats there are no goats here said saalim this is america they keep the goats outside no goats no goatshit in a fine american place that is why we came so far to destroy it and spread the will of allah and to bring the goats inside where they belong both boys laughed they were lounging on a park bench on the southeast side of the silliland park near the ticket office for the ridealog flume shoot a twisty tube of water that enabled americans the thrill of a downward thunder of a splashing ride now vacant and unattended from where they were they were spared the disagreeable sight of dead man in red upon his throne but they did see everywhere desultory americans sitting crunched together supposedly with their hands on their heads though this imposed discipline had soon disappeared they were teenaged boys their own discipline was not superb they were supposed to keep iron eyes on their captives to make certain little cliques didnt form and plot some kind of revolution but the americans seemed to have no spirit for that kind of work and mostly just sat there in a kind of stupor that both saalim and asad had seen among the struggling citizens of wabra thus saalim and asad found themselves occupied with chitchat petty teasing attraction to various girls shows of adolescent bravado and hunger for fast food which was abundant in the now largely empty mall that sometime soon soldiers or police officers would surely crash the place guns firing and probably kill them was of utterly no concern given the toughness of their lives death held little sting but suddenly a crackle came over the earphones they wore under their shemaghs it was the imam you asad that is your name correct yes imam said asad jumping alert you remember what we discussed you and i it was true he had a special mission i do imam he said into the throat mike well its time you can find this place he remembered second floor nw colorado c that was the destination the imam had shown him on the brightcolored brochures with maps that guided them through the mall i can imam he said good said the imam its time to go and get the babies humbly mr and mrs girardi approached the police officer at the farthest extreme from the mall in fact they could see it almost a mile away in the twilight looking like a big tub upside down surrounded by police cars and fire engines folks said the cop sorry i cant let you in any closer sir said mr girardi were looking for our son hes fourteen its the first time ive ever let him go to the mall alone said mrs girardi i usually take him or he goes with friends but he wanted to do his christmas shopping yes maam we havent heard from him should we call him he hasnt called you we havent heard anything we just know whats on the tv no i wouldnt advise that said the officer he may be hiding or something or hurt orwell you just dont know what his circumstance is and its probably better to wait until he reaches out to you is there any information available no sir were trying to get a command structure set up and get organized its a terrible problem and nobody is clear on what to do to be honest itll be several hours before we really get whats going on and even longer before we have information im sure your son is okay hes young hes strong hes quick hes not really he has asthma hes very thin and frail well said the cop stuck for an answer maybe the best thing for you to do is find the red cross tent i think theyre set up on the western side you can rest there and youll get information there sooner i never should have let him come to the mall by himself said mrs girardi as her husband led her away lavelva oates shushed the redheaded one he was a handful maybe it was because he was a redhead he seemed to want a lot of attention and had tendencies toward disruption he kept picking on a little asian girl who would do nothing but sit and weep when he addressed her smack him hard on his burry little pipsqueak head thats what lavelva wanted to do but she knew it was a mistake jobs were hard enough to come by these days and no one went around hitting damn babies okay boys and girls now lets play a new game she said brightly in this game i want you all to be playing hide from the monster when i say go you go hide well pretend the bad monsters are here but they wont see you and youll be all right we can hide from the monsters together thats a scary game said robert she knew he was named robert because he had a big name tag pinned on robert but it was past four oclock and roberts mom hadnt shown up maybe she was dead i want to go home wheres my mom asked robert im sure shes on her way lavelva said i have to go to the bathroom linda said peepee or the other asked lavelva both said the child all right said lavelva anybody else a few hands came up im going to take you back therethe lavatory was in the rear of the roombut we have to go on tippytoes i dont like tippytoes said larry its for babies lavelva was the day care service coordinator afternoon shift second floor she had seventeen unruly kids three through eight under her charge this was her first day goddamn she wasnt sure what was going on she was trapped in the day care center a large room full of beatup toys and pissedon dolls on the second floor about an hour ago shed heard the shootingloud sharp cracks echoing eerily along the walls the nooks and crannies of the mall very frighteningand herded her kids to the back of the room and told them to them lie down she went to the doorway and watched as the crowded corridor outside seemed to drain itself in a couple of minutes people ran crazily screaming theyre shooting theyre shooting they have machine guns she knew there was no way she could get seventeen kids through that mob and that the kids would be knocked down separated even hurt where was her supervisor mrs watney head of mall day care didnt answer her calls or her texts maybe shed raced out the door too she tried her mom couldnt get through she tried her brother ralphie installing carpets even though hed told her never to call while he was on the job it didnt matter couldnt get through she tried no response she was alone lavelva knew two things immediately the first was that shed be much better holding the children here until someone in authoritya cop a fireman someonecame with instructions and second that if there were men with guns around she had to have a weapon in her universe innercity minneapolis twentyeighth and washington it was a tough life and all the young men carried shed seen them lying on the streets bled out eyes blank that was the world there was no other all the newspapers were always jabbering about the tragedy of it blah blah and blah but words like tragedy held little meaning for lavelva hers was a more practical turn of mind and it had to do with dealing with what was instead of dreaming about what could be she herded the kids back to the rear of the room and sent linda in to do peepee and the other one suzanne mindy jessica and marsha went too in fact all the girls went everybody gets a turn no shoving stand in line make miss lavelva proud she instructed knowing these passive little white girls would do exactly that she couldnt go with them of course policy was that no childcare coordinator could be alone in a bathroom with a child of either sex but perhaps on a day such as today the rules had gone out the window still it was better to obey policy no matter what was happening outside here in the secondfloor mall service childcare center policies would be obeyed well all but one she said to the boys you all line up against the wall were still going to play hide from the monster you lie down you be quiet you dont let no monster spot you this is going to be a long game so best get used to it i dont want crying or whining yall have to be brave little boys today you hear they nodded the redheaded one charles said whats brave like a big old football player aint scared of nothing i am scared said charles its different now yes it is said lavelva it is very different but charles you are so feisty i want you to be the leader okay you be the bravest yes miss lavelva said charles lavelva turned went to her desk or rather the desk as it was generic to the center owned by none of the coordinators she saw nothing that could be altered to be dangerous no letter openers no files no spikes for spearing paper notices nothing not even a ruler obviously with nimblefingered little brutes around thought had been exercised on keeping the space free of dangerous implements then she saw the daily schedule notebook a threering binder volume she opened it realized that a steel or at least metal slat ran up its spine she pulled apart the three rings and dumped the papers out then used her strength to rip the slat from the spine of the book it tore messily taking some cardboard binding with it but it was eleven inches of sharp steel albeit flawed by three rings which she snapped shut she slipped it into her jeans in the small of her back then she turned back to the boys charles was standing and pointing i see a monster he said she turned and through the glass block wall that divided the center from the pedestrian corridor she saw the shadow of a gunman there were six of them but the manager mrs renfels had broken down all women all terrified except for molly who was more concerned for her mother and her sister sally than she was for herself even tough little rose the assistant manager had quieted down as apprehension gripped her you wont find out soon ray told molly you have to worry about molly first you have to commit yourself to staying put locking down waiting them out that is how you win there was no privacy as all of them were jammed in the rear storeroom under racks of bustiers and negligees and all the scanties of the male imagination that now seemed quite alien to their world i have to know she said trying to quell the anxiety sally was impossibly cute at fifteen with smart vivid eyes a thin girls body and grace just easing into a womans radiance and mom was still feisty even if she had never quite adjusted to american ways it sickened molly that the two most vulnerable members of her family were in the greatest danger the last shed spoken to them on her cell they had in fact been on the first floor where the roundup had taken place but if theyd been luckily in the outer ring they might have made it to an exit she wanted to call but she was terrified that if they were in the mob of hostages ray had described the ringing cell might have attracted attention i wish theyd turn that goddamn music off milts wife said if i hear jingle bells one more time i will puke not on me please said the blonde the one who clearly considered herself a hot number why is this happening mrs renfels asked her first words since the crisis had begun its because we should have used the atom bomb on them after nineeleven said the hot blonde obviously the sort used to issuing opinions and by her beauty banishing responses if wed have burned them all this wouldnt be going on you cant kill a billion people because what thirteen men are crazy assholes responded milts wife oh yes you can you push a button and they are in flames that is the craziest all right all right said ray i am not trying to be a boss or take over or anything but its better if you dont get in squabbles until this thing is over you may have to work together and you have to see the person beside you as a family member you can fight all you want when youre advising on the set of the tv movie or something hes right said rose just keep a cork in it its better for all of us its easy for you to say said mrs renfels youre young youre in this for yourself i have three kids if something happens to meoh why is this happening maam said ray i dont mean to tell you how to think but i am a former marine and i have been in some fights if youll allow me i would advise you never to use the wword today the wword is why sometimes there is no why and if you get hung up on why you lose your effectiveness ive seen it happen the men who die are the men who cant believe theyre in a fight and cant believe that someone is trying to kill them it seems so unfair to them and theyre so busy feeling sorry for themselves they dont seek cover they dont return fire they dont scan the horizon they forget how to use their expensive equipment the men who live get it right away they understand theyre in a different world and they have to deal with exactly what is before them with maximum concentration thats very good advice said rose maybe we should surrender said the blonde no maam said ray you should instead consider how lucky you are some people are dead some people maybe a thousand are under the gun you are for the time being safe no one knows youre here and no one that i can tell is looking for you just stay put and trust in god and the public safety people who are i guarantee you working very hard right this second to set us free great job said obobo major jefferson this is a fabulous plan im very impressed jefferson amplified we dont blow all doors simultaneously and move down the corridors into the crowd unable to engage until we reach the amusement park thats a no go because it gives them however long it takes our people to advance down the corridors to open fire on hostages one guy at each corridor shooting at swat could hold up the advance for six or eight minutes way too much time go on major so we take the six best shooters with gunfight experience all armed with red dot mps on semiauto and weve got these guys some of our people are good some of the fbi guys are really good and phil mason of edina swat is the area seven threegun champion ive shot against him and he is damned good and damned cool so we six we go underground through a shaft that runs from parking lot seven to the mall central that puts us right underneath area z i have a guy from bloomington swat who was an army engineer in the sandbox we rig six detonations to blow through the floor at a given moment we turn off the power the place goes dark itll be a few seconds before the emergency gen kicks in but the gunmen immediately see the holes and assume men will come from them no uhuh thats the diversion weve quietly come up through the ducts under the area z concessionaire stand herehe pointed to it on the chartand have only floor boarding and linoleum at a certain locality that the engineer has specified once the gunmen commit to the assault from the ground we hit em they will have moved to cover the openings weve just blown head shots targets marked we can take em down fast before the crowd has a chance to panic but colonel we have to move now itll take time to get men through the ducts into the space under area z itll take time to locate and plant the explosives and itll take time to again i cant tell you how impressed i am colonel obobo said explaining his reasons its thorough its creative it takes all the variables into consideration im very pleased to take it under advisement he touched the intense major on the shoulder as if to confer a blessing then he turned away leaving an incredulous look on the majors face and the awareness that hed just gotten another no that sounded even more like a yes theyre shooting inside the mall one of the radio techs announced fbi snipers say theyre shooting inside the mall mcelroy was first off the chopper first into position from the air the lake shape of the glass was apparent and he had raced to what must have been the tip of lake michigan right at chicago but now that he was here it was simply lake glass or lake plastic an immensity of transparent thick plastic that would somehow have to be penetrated but first he had to equip he unzipped the rifle bag and laid out a remington with a leupold tactical scope the whole thing anodized forest green carefully he removed a long green tube which a velcro strap had secured inside the bag and brought it close to his eyes for an examination it was a gemtech suppressor about eight inches long and an inch and a half in diameter and under the tubing it consisted mainly of baffles and chambers and holes the point of which was to elongate the time of escape for the rapidly expanding gases of a shot so that when they reached the atmosphere they were slowed down and exited with a kind of snap instead of a terrible earsplitting crack with the suppressor screwed carefully on the threaded muzzle he inserted the bolt into the receiver reached into an ammo compartment to remove a box of federal grain match cartridges in and slid five into the rifles magazine closing the bolt on and chambering the fifth he flicked the safety on not that he believed in safeties looped the sling around his shoulder and stood to examine the scene what lay before him was a wall about five feet tall that formed the well of the vast skylight that was lake michigan it was of course not a single sheet of plexiglas but divided into cells about by feet peering over the edge of this southernmost cell he was rewarded with a vision from five stories up of a crowd of disconsolate christmas shoppers jammed into the walkways and open areas of a technicolor amusement park and seen from ninety degrees at an altitude of about feet through heavy plastic details were hard to pick out in time he recognized what had to be a gunman mainly by the black object carried under one arm and the blackgreen rag on his head details emerged pistol knife throat mike with access it would have been an easy shot and he prayed to the sniper god that he would get a chance to take it he radiochecked sniper five set up in position speaking to a state police sergeant in the headquarters van i have you five sitrep please i have a good angle on the scene almost straight down im at site chicago at the bottom of michigan and therefore have a good view of the balconies on the opposite that is the eastward side no activity there i do not have a shot repeat do not have a shot the glass or plastic or whatever it is is very thick i dont think i could get through it if i had a fucking hammer be advised no shooting that is our call you stay on position and call in periodically with intelligence and we will take that under advisement may i talk with fbi supervisor negative five he is in conference with incident commander and others the governor is expected momentarily request conference with him when available over noted will try and make that happen five but no promises out so that was it all dressed up and no one to shoot or rather no way to shoot although given the angle the bad boys would literally represent the idealized fish in a barrel dear sniper god your humble servant dave here please let me take one of these motherfuckers before the day is done but he also knew the ways of the sniper god and the sniper god would only help those who help themselves mcelroy thirtytwo and a bureau lifer who loved the swat life and had been on a hundred raids and on the periphery of two or three gunfights but had yet to fire a shot in anger looked around him beyond of course was minnesota turning dark and pierced with an everincreasing array of lights as the sun was setting far off he could see highways streaming with cars the illumination of suburbs and strip malls just regular american stuff then there was the roof itself the flat blackasphalt stage upon which this drama was playing out the flatness was vast way out of human scale easily bigger than an aircraft carriers deck or a football stadiums parking area reaching to infinity about a mile away or so it seemed was a rack of industriallooking apparatuses presumably part of the cooling and heating system there were at least six little shedsthey looked comically like the icefishing hutches these minnesotans built on their frozen lakes in winterthat presumably held doors that opened onto stairways into the interior he guessed they were all locked but it occurred to him that a good bande man could probably get through and operators could be fed into play that way but surely they would know that at command then more immediately these goddamned lakeshaped skylights here at the center of the vastness regularly spaced around the perimeter of michigan he saw a fellow such as himself all tommytacticaled up in nomex jumpsuit with glock in shoulder holster with a big bad rifle a black watch cap or kevlar helmet and a posture of utter helplessness with reference to the thick wall of impenetrable glass between himself and his potential targets he thought i will get through this fucking glass i will i will i will but how this wasnt one of those absurd movies where the guy reaches into his kit and just happens to have exactly the right tool a computerdriven microdiamond buzz saw that was also miniaturized and could cut through the stuff like butter and makes a hell of an oldfashioned no darn hed left that at home nor did he have gatorade and cough medicine that could be instantly combined into sulfuric acid and melt the glass he didnt have a goddamned thing he walked the edge of the skylight finding it uniform in its precision why had the developers built it so sturdily couldnt they have cut corners couldnt a worker have faked the effort couldnt there be some way the thing wasnt up to spec and a hole could be bored through the joinery of glass and building giving him a shooting lane no no such luck it was all solid and tight to the finger okay so his eye caught movement below what was looking down from godseye view he could tell that two of the gunmen had kicked their way into the center of the crowd covered by other gunmen they cleared a space then they grabbed five people apparently two women two men and a teenager and dragged them to the center of the opening and made them kneel it looked like an execution please sniper god give me a shot but he had no shot he was sealed off by thick glass one of the gunmen walked behind the kneeling five and with his rifle shot each in the back of the head mcelroy felt the vibration of the gunshot meeting the glass giving it a little buzz he wished he could look away but he could not executed each victim fell forward without grace and hit the floor facefirst and hard they lay sprawled loose as ragdolls in a bit of time one then another and finally all began to spew a blackish puddle from the head and these multiple lakes of plasma reached out found and followed fissures on the floor and joined in a large wetland of blood though leaving the odd island of high spot control this is five directly below me the gunmen just executed five hostages shot em dead through the head i have that said the radio jesus christ let us blow this goddamn glass and take these pricks down they dont know were here if we get through the glass we can do them all in under thirty seconds negative negative five you are advised to do nothing but stand and observe if we go tactical you will be notified and assigned targets goddammit they are killing people and five this is command commo space is at a premium and we dont want you using it up on a rant tactical discipline sir please put special agent kemp on any information must be channeled through command said the frosted voice pm pm this is very disturbing said colonel obobo he stood unbelieving in the center of the state police incident command van surrounded by several majors and the fbi executive kemp as they dealt with the news from the snipers that five people had just been executed mr renfro stood immediately to the left of the colonel saying nothing could it be a phony someone asked maybe those are actors or something or his own volunteers previously put in place and theyre real said mike jefferson the aggressive swat commander and he is talking to usin blood i just look at the time colonel obobo its five oclock he killed five people at five oclock hell kill six people at six oclock seven at seven oclock and on through the night there arent any demands except that we get a lot of body bags this is just a straight murder job we have to get our assault units in position issue orders distribute the proper breaching equipment and get ready to jump he will talk to us said the colonel this is just his way of getting our attention he had our attention for gods sake shouted jefferson for christs fucking sake men with aks shooting everything that moves he has our fucking attention no said obobo ever courteous ever unflappably astute and collected he has to demonstrate that he is capable of ordering executions that is his baseline all our negotiations will now have to take that into consideration hes laying down the rules thats what hes doing he will talk to us before six well before six and he knows that to assault we have a massive job of logistics planning equipping moving and coordinating and hes putting something before us to slow us down baffle us make us inefficient at that very tough job ah said jefferson in immense frustration colonel let me begin to put people in play under the mall weve got to be able to breach that floor its the only way and we have to have them there now in order to do it anytime in the future we cant just blow the doors and charge into the place can we chopper people to the roof arent there doorways they could come down from above somehow someone asked no said kemp at least not as a main strike it would take a dozen choppers to get men in force hed know if they blew the doors it would take ten minutes for them to work their way down if they rappelled theyd be sitting ducks for the riflemen youd just get a lot of highly trained men killed for nothing and maybe fifty or sixty hostages obobo tuned it all out he made eye contact with mr renfro and the two exchanged listentotheseidiotstalk expressions the advisor then nodded communicating his sublime confidence in colonel obobos abilities he knew that if the colonel could just talk to these people and make them see the hopelessness of their position the inevitability of what lay ahead he could make this thing go away he had that power he was a convincer an inspirer gentlemen for now id like you to hold your positions obobo finally said commo continue to monitor the channels to see if hes trying to talk to us we have to know his demands when we learn his demands his demands are that a lot of people die those are his demands said jefferson this is a straight murder raid like mumbai or the world trade center he just wants a lot of people off the earth and his own glory and ascension to heaven guaranteed he thinks when this is over hes going to get himself fucked royally by seventytwo major jefferson said obobo showing a whisper of irritation i think youve made your point in the meantime i want a written assault plan from you a list of assets you currently have and those that you will need before i can authorize any kind of a strike i hope to hell i never have to issue that order nichols get on the phone to the justice department and see how our request for army engineers delta and seal people is playing at defense special agent kemp i want an update on your investigative efforts in minneapolis as well as our requests to batf for support in the firearms investigation sir said jefferson this isnt an investigation its a war major jefferson youve made your point fifty times over please follow my orders or be relieved of duty i cant fight him and you yes sir sir someone said do we release to media no said mr renfro who rarely addressed tactical or operational issues but this time couldnt help himself if word gets out hes shooting hostages itll add pressure to an already pressurized decision good point said the colonel do you concur special agent kemp kemp thanking god he had no dog in this fight said yes colonel sir someone said the governor is here oh fuck said somebody it happened that nikki was watching a particular sniper whom she had nicknamed chicago with her binoculars from three thousand feet up at a particular moment as the wusscopter hovered at that height though from there he was a tiny almost blurred figure and the light was quickly diminishing she saw him suddenly bolt upward then lean forward tense radically as if he were willing himself somehow to penetrate the glass of the skylight and fly down into the atrium instantly his finger flew to the radio unit at his beltshe knew where to look because shed covered cops in bristoland presumably switched it on he began jabbering into the throat mike she zapped around the margins of the lake of plexiglas until shed located all five snipers and noted that all five were on their mikes something just happened she said how can you tell asked jim the cameraman i saw the snipers jerk up and now all are reporting in she switched to marty back at the station is command saying anything no nothing weve had reports the governor is incoming we might want to put you on the ground and get over there in case he has a presser marty no presser means anything tonight theyll use the press to put out reassuring bullshit knowing that whoevers doing this is monitoring pressers are a waste of time and it pisses me off that his eminence puts his big fat mug on camera tonight settle down mary richards it was only a suggestion well somethings happened here and she had an idea two weeks ago shed been to the mall and had bought a pocketbook from a shop called purses bags and whatnot one of those cutesy places that smelled of potpourri but had very nice leather bags she pulled out that very same pocketbook now and began to rifle through it because she remembered thats where shed stuffed the bill of sale yes indeed there it was amid a scruffy collection of receipts for from bank of america for gas at sheetz and from safeway remembering the very pleasant young woman who had run the transaction for her she looked at the bottom of the bill of sale and saw a handwritten note thanks so much amanda birkowsky marty she said real quick run the name birkowsky through anywho com and see what you come up with nikki just do it marty i dont have time to explain its a rare enough name so there probably arent too many of them there were as it turned out only three in the three minneapolissaint paul area codes she dialed the first got no answer and then hit on the second yes she said this is wufftv may i speak with amanda please a woman said brokenly amanda is in the mall i am so sorry mrs birkowsky nikki said guessing from the voice that it was a mom not a sister shes all right said mrs birkowsky for now shes upstairs in thewho did you say you were nikki explained the connection what is it you want im trying to reach amanda shes called you i guess she has a cell she called you to tell you shes all right shes in no danger or no immediate danger i cant give you her number i understand but can you call her give her my number and if she decides she can call me i just think people have a right to know whats going on its my job theres next to no information available and thats never a good thing amanda called nikki three minutes later she and two customers and two other staff were hiding in the rear room of purses bags and whatnot on the first floor of the mall in the dark they felt themselves all right for the time being as no one had begun to search the stores for hiding shoppers did anything happen at five nikki asked we heard five shots bang bang bang bang bang not a machine gun not like that but five individual shots then we heard the crowdit makes noise like an animal all those peoplewe heard what i would call some kind of uproar i dont know then barking from the voices of the guards i guess it was very unclear but something bad must have happened five shots said nikki yes exactly i could try and sneak out there and no no no no you just stay where you are are they going to come get us soon the police there are police all over the place but in truth i dont see any signs of an attack or an entry or anything this is so awful listen if something happens and you want to and it seems safe can you call me back and if i think the cops are going to go ill give you a headsup through your mom okay and you can get low to the floor behind cover ill never call you because i wont know what situation youll be in is that fair thank you said amanda sweetie dont thank me youre the brave one here one minute later nikki was on the air with the news that five shots had been fired within the atrium and that possibly the gunmen had begun to shoot hostages they just shot five people ray said you dont know that molly said yes i do said ray it seemed that the sound of the shots still echoed through the weird acoustics of the gigantic space everyone in the fredericks had stiffened when the sounds reached them and in the several minutes since nobody had said a thing until ray broke the silence maybe some kid raised his rifle and pulled the trigger five times because he thought it was a cool thing to do molly said no said ray that would have been faster shooting onetwothreefourfive this was deliberate fire one shot move to the next shoot move to the next he just shot five people nobody said a thing ray molly rose the clerk the brokendown manager of the store and the three customers just lay there in the dark in the storeroom you could go check like last time rose finally said ray didnt answer right away then he said no no if i go out there im not coming back somebodys got to do something and im probably the only man with training whos close enough to the situation to act and the police have no idea of how to get in here ray said molly but rose cut her off if you go what do we do do we just lie here six women and theres guys out there with machine guns what do we do what happens to us i think youre okay said ray you dont need help the people down there do theres nothing you can do said rose theres a bunch of them with army weapons what can one guy do youll just get yourself killed you dont even have a gun much less a machine gun molly said shes right if they see you theyll kill you thats all after all youve done some punk kills you in the payless shoe store or the best buy and you havent helped a thing and in six hours the hostage takers make a deal with the cops and fly to cuba with a million dollars and what has your death accomplished if i hide in the ladies underwear store what has my life accomplished ray said youll be all right as i said you stay here you commit psychologically to the long term you dont expect help now or in an hour or a day or a week and you will survive he thinks hes john wayne said molly bitterly john wayne was a fantasy he never existed hes a dream a phantom a ghost he existed said ray and his name was bob lee swagger hes my father you dont even have a gun said rose then i will have to get a gun said ray okay said lavelva quietly now boys and girls lets go back to the bathroom all right the name of this game is lets hide in the bathroom miss lavelva said david im scared david dont you be scared now no ones going to hurt you you trust miss lavelva on this sweetie okay now kids come on now lets put on our quiet shoes and our quiet voices and go back to the bathroom and it will be all right somehowshe could feel their fear in the dropoff of energy the quiet that overtook them the lassitude that seemed to creep through their small bonesshe got them back and into the room larry she said to the eldest you be in charge here you hear you stay till miss lavelva comes back yall stay quiet now and listen to larry miss lavelva im scared too said sherry its okay sherry said miss lavelva and when this is over miss lavelva goin take you to get something nice to eat maybe french fries or frosties whatever you want a nice treat from miss lavelva that seemed to quiet them down lavelva slipped out she was alone in the bigger room she looked at the translucent glass blocks that marked off the day care center and saw nothing maybe hed missed her maybe he was gone asad could not read the english in the mall directory pamphlet but he got the representation of the map well enough and the imam had drawn a circle around the location of the day care center yes this was the colorado corridor yes colorado the numbers were right it seemed that helpfully each store had an address that indexed it to the map and even though he had little english he recognized the address ne c he divined practically that it meant colorado corridor second floor retail designation and since evens were on the left and odds on the right it had to be on his left even though he assumed that he had free range he was careful he was aware that many of the stores still hid customers what if some of them came rushing out and jumped him then he laughed no americans would do that they were a soft and decadent people and here in this palace of luxury and greed their reflexes and warrior minds if they even had them would be shoved way down by shock and fear they would lie in the dark weeping praying to their absurd man on the cross saying to him pleasepleasepleaseplease he missed it he looked at a store and saw an address that read colorado he turned back began to edge his way down the corridor it was quiet and dark strewn with abandoned bags tipped carriages shoes hats jackets all signs of the intensity of the panic a few windows had been broken but no looting appeared to have taken place slowly he tracked the stores stopping every once in a while to check for signs of threat he saw none and then he came to it for about thirty feet the gaudy glass windows of the storefronts yielded to glass brick and a double door stood in the center above a sign must have announced the purpose of the location though he could not read it he slid to the glass doors and peered in and soon his eyes made out toys on the floor childrens furniture tilted sideways that sort of thing this had to be where the babies were but it was quiet maybe they had moved the babies but he didnt see how maybe they were inside in hiding he slipped in his eyes in full search mode scanning what lay before him in semidarkness and everywhere he looked he swept with the muzzle of the baby kalashnikov his finger on the trigger a full orange magazine clicked solidly in place then he saw her she was dark like him she stood facing him twentyfive feet away her face was a stone mask he read her bones and saw that she was not somali thinnosed and lipped highforeheaded like him but still of africa with that stoic face of the subsaharan peoples broad of nose she wore her hair in the african style in tiny ringlets all over her head sister he said in somali and she replied in english two words he knew fuck you she said nothing worked when you busted kiddie porn you pierced you fought your way through pretty elementary protection schemes worms predatory malware you looked for back doors baited and phished you ran decoding or passwordfinding programs and eventually with stamina and creativity and a strong stomach you got in then the deal was trying to put a network together finding out who was buying the stuff who was distributing the stuff who was producing the stuff then you penetrated playing the role of john a smith corporate lawyer father of five country club member kiwanis rotary bar association vice president with a hunger for watching children violated and you put all that together documented the linkages and you took it to whichever fed or state prosecutor in whichever state had the most juice and eagerness and you pounced yes you got dirty but you took down someone much dirtier but none of those programs worked whoever was playing this game had a brain or two in his head neal had tried everything had madly improvised program improvements had written enough code to start a new social network yet scada was impenetrable by virtue of the tough defenses built into memtac and its resolute steadfastness in avoiding temptations to jump to online status hows it coming jeff asked dr benson this guys good he tightened up their protocols so i cant even get the scada meme up just to get a rope on the culture ive been to the siemens website and its clear what this guy has come up with is even beyond them jesus he could be making a billion a year writing code for steve or bill and getting laid by nerdbabes left and right and hes doing this shit maybe he doesnt like nerdbabes benson said so what are you going to do pray swell ill tell them that pray as in talk to god god being the engineer at siemens who designed it you better get me a translator fast bob because i dont speak one word of german lavelva looked at him this was it then somali like so many somalis in the area thin arrogant reeking of narcissism because he considered himself so beautiful with the thin nose and the thin lips presumably the hair was that thick froth so somali in its wiriness but she could not tell for he wore a patterned scarf tied tightly to his head held in place by a band he wore baggy jeans and a hoodie like any banger she had seen and shed seen a lot of them somali and otherwise and he carried a kalashnikov and he had a handgun dangling in a holster he was all warredup his eyes seemed slightly crazed all nubianwarriorlionkilling bullshit in his mind and that was what made the somali gangs so feared on the east side and anywhere they left their signs he called to her in his jive fuck you she replied no way she backed down to this sucker no way she gave him the kids no way no way no way he smiled showing bright teeth he walked to her full of bravado and confidence lionproud with his big guns and a knife he spoke again to her in his gibberish she held her ground he approached babies he said you give me babies in poor english now give me the babies aint no way im giving you nothing jack she said babies i want babies imam want babies downstairs bring babies now he poked her with the muzzle of the kalash then he poked her again this time hard enough to bruise want to die sister i kill no problem bangbang shoot dead black sister then take babies maybe i kill a baby no problem no problem he poked her again but did not see the thing in her hand that now flew at him and struck him with a swords cut across the face and drove a flash of light and pain up through his head and he stepped back feeling the tremendous hurt of it the gun muzzle dropping as he pivoted and then his pain alchemized into rage and he flew on her wanting to kill her with his hands and the two grappled awkwardly spinning this way or that and she cracked him another time in the head with her weapon another slicing gouge that shot off lights behind his eyes but he was stronger and he leaned into her and twisted her down and was on her he would kill the bitch with his own hands choke the life out of her and then get the babies the press loved him they always had they projected their dreams upon him he knew and he had no problem internalizing that emotion and building it into his persona after a brief sumup by the governors public affairs idiot the governor uttered a few bromides about his confidence in minnesotas first responders and announced that he had activated the minnesota guard and that units would be arriving within five hours then fbi special agent kemp repping the feds said aid was on the way from dc and all over america and back on pennsylvania avenue in the hoover building analysts and intelligence experts were applying their full energy to the crisis and then the govs idiot turned things over to colonel obobo and everyone smiled and took reassurance from his collected calmness his radiant charisma he stood at a podium outside the incident command van lit by a thousand tv lights to say nothing of the mercury vapors on aluminum supports already in place thanks to the sites origin as a parking lot behind them blank and gigantic and without detail in the gloaming the mall itself loomed one hundred or so feet tall it was ringed by emergency vehicles and police units all lit to hell with their flashers going so that its darkness was jabbed by the redblue cop lights above a fleet of choppers held in steady formation at three thousand feet the roar of their engines undercutting the press conference as you all know we have a terrible situation here i simply want to echo the words of the governor and our friends in the fbi the minnesota state police have assumed primary responsibility for resolving this situation under my command and we are moving quickly to secure the mall but we are not cowboys and this is not dodge city our enemy isnt so much these deluded men but violence itself we have no intentions of getting into a showdown and demonstrating that we are capable of more violence than they are violence is death and death is unacceptable so we will pursue alternative means of deescalating the situation all the while hoping that as time passes tempers cool and justice rather than vengeance becomes the order of the day that i promise you are they executing hostages goddammit somehow some tv reporter had gotten through to someone in the mall reporting that witnesses were claiming that five shots had been fired already mr renfro was on the line to the station complaining bitterly about unauthorized news reports even if accurate and how they jeopardized operations but clearly five shots would not signify a headon assault the only conclusion was hostage execution and this drama held a particularly ugly fascination for the reporters americans put on their knees and shot in the head in a mall in middle america on the opening of the christmas season the day after thanksgiving the most familysome might say too much familyof family days i cannot confirm or deny reports that hostages have been shot was all that obobo could say but he was extremely annoyed at the abruptness and the hostility with which the question had been launched at him it was not the sort of treatment he was used to but there was shooting in the mall it was a thin line but he stuck to it i cannot confirm or deny there has been shooting in the mall obviously we prefer to keep tactical details to ourselves as we deal with this situation if they start executing hostages dont you have to attack we dont have to do anything said the colonel its when we permit ourselves to be locked into have to situations that tragedy ensues hmm no he didnt like this tone of hostility in fact all of a sudden he decided he was sick of them he looked out on a hundred faces where was the love where had it gone it began to needle him he would have to discuss this with renfro i did not say they were killing hostages i will not be announcing any tactical plans here presumably these folks are monitoring our public announcements who are they we do not know yet as i said they have yet to make contact or issue demands i can say we have secured the mall and nobody is going anywhere at this time we are studying various options as you might suspect this is a tremendously complex undertaking and we dont want to do anything hasty and stupid at columbine didnt they decide they should have moved immediately on the shooters all they did was set up guard posts outside while people bled to death is that what youre doing another ridiculous question who did these assholes think they were where was renfro this is not columbine this is an entity that is far more than a high school the number of gunmen is as yet unknown thought to be ten or more extremely well informed working with a wellthoughtout plan heavily armed with professionalquality weapons as special agent kemp said we do have army and navy commando types inbound and they are far better suited to this kind of tactical work than we are i have at least twenty teams ready to go in but i have to get them coordinated i have to get them inside i have to get them moving in step with each other and they have to have clear targets guided by intelligence none of those conditions exist at this time so we are in a waitandsee mode ladies and gentlemen interrupted the governor although its true that shots were fired we have no evidence that people were executed it could have been just some kid shooting his gun great the stupid bastard had just put the shots on the table colonel obobo tom kiefaver nbc news handsome national haircut sometimes anchored the big show are you comfortable in established positions while people may be a few dozen feet away dying i think we all need to get back to work folks youll forgive us and he turned manfully and walked back toward the trailer as he went back to the van obobo saw the governor giving oneonones to the national news and the big minneapolis channels each team waiting patiently the governor seemed to be enjoying himself it went all fuzzy on lavelva the somali pressed his thumbs into her larynx grinning wildly his gashed face bleeding the blood falling into her face she bucked and fought and twice again swacked him hard with the steel spine of the notebook but each time he saw it coming and turned flinching down and the blade bit into his hairline and across his ear cutting shallowly but not hurting him bad enough he had her now it was over she felt herself in the whirlpool as the oxygen debt turned her lungs into broken balloons then he relented his fingers came slightly out of her throat and he let a desperately sought gush of air into her throat but his fingers did not come off her neck he spoke in somali not that she understood anything but the emotional gist hah girl see what asad does to you hah now i send you to the fiery noplace of infidel hell you who stand against allah must go i am your killer your ruler you defy me and die as do all peoples everywhere soon to know the power of islam what bullshit he was all lit up so proud of his mighty victory unwilling to let the moment go savoring the kill she whacked him again but he blinked only a bit shook his head and said now die bitch the thumbs went hard into her and her air supply drained quickly and she sucked at dry nothingness bucking against him but feeling her will vanish and wishing shed been able to save the babies she tried so hard to save the babies and and someone broke his neck broke it clean and hard and she heard the snap as the vertebrae cracked into two pieces and his tongue came into his skinnyass lips and his eyes went all cue ball on him and his head hung at a brokenspring angle and his thumbs lost their power and he was lifted from her like a sack of potatoes and laid on a floor from which he would never again rise some asianlike dude looked down at her you okay he said man he like to choke the fuck out of me just relax rest hes not going to choke anybody ever again okay the guy she now saw was some kind of thin hardball type had warrior written all over him in the leanness under his sweatshirt and the veins thick with blood on his wrists he turned and quickly began to loot the fallen somali separating first the ak from the boy then quickly unbuckling the bandolier of ammunitionthe clips were all weird orange you know like popsiclesthen slipped the kids belt with knife and pistol off he checked the pistol expertly pinching back the slide to see if it held a chambered round and then he began to reassemble himself in the image of the man hed just killed finally finished he turned back to her feeling better youll be bruised for a month but i think youll be all right sweetie i cant believe you cracked him with that shiv you can play ball on my team anytime the guts you must have who you she asked the names ray spent some time in the marines thats why im all goingtowar now nobody else is anyhow i saw this joker slide in here as i was stalking him sorry i didnt get here sooner she looked at the dead boy shed seen the gaze before on the streets that imasleep look the eyes blank seeing nothing the iaintnothingnomore look of extinction someone run into a bullet or a blade with his name on it down he go his face come all moony nothingness like this sucker she could still gut him cut his slimy insides out and hang em up to dry but no he dead she turned back to see the chinese marine studying a mall pamphlet which must have come from mr dead ass you have kids here seventeen of them in back that boy said hed come to get the babies yeah the place is marked so they want children they need em as hostages and they sent this joker okay were going to move the kids a little ways down the hall into the ladies underwear place there are some women in there and they can help you take care of them does that seem like a good idea it does you want them in a single file hugging the walls make it a game see that way those tv cameras cant pick them out of the shadow you get that i do lets get this done fast i dont know how long itll be before they notice war hero here didnt come back with the babies it made as much sense as anything it was the first positive thing that had happened since the shooting started i also want to hide this guy he said if they find him it may piss them off and they may take it out on the hostages they have about a thousand people down in the amusement park yes sir she said hey what is your name i am lavelva oates well miss lavelva i say again you did real good if i had it id give you a medal stand up to the killer with the gun not many have the sand yes sir she said secretly so very pleased next she went back got the kids out of the bathroom on the pretext of a new game creep down the hall be a kitty cat or a doggy all fours by the time she got them organized the body was gone and so was the chinese marine and so was the ak rifle bet he know how to run that she thought it took a while before anyone at the red cross tent paid attention to mr and mrs girardi and it was not their personality type either as individuals or as a couple to demand notice they simply stood there and watched while nurses bandaged the odd escapees from the mall whod fallen and cut themselves bruised torn twisted something and handed out glasses of juice and cookies meanwhile uniformed policemen moved among those on the cots or waiting to see a physician or a nurse to interview the escapees hoping to pick up that one new piece of information that might matter but it was a sloppy process the cops were under great pressure to produce and when witnesses turned out to have nothing they were quickly abandoned raising hard feelings and complaints all this frenzy took place under the openwalled canvas structure lit by fluorescents and enough insects remained to buzz and hum around the lights which themselves were so harsh they showed everything in vivid clarity the red of the many red cross insignias the blue and gray of the police uniforms the white smocks of the doctors finally a woman came to them have you been helped no maam said mr girardi he was fiftytwo stooped balding he was an unimpressive man by any standards and in no crowd would he stand out whats the problem the policeman over there suggested you might have some information our son jimmy hes fourteen he went to the mall today by himself for the first time we havent heard from him ah said the woman we wondered if there was any information we thought they might have released a list or something they might know who had escaped and where they were hes small for his age said mrs girardi i never let him go alone but he was so insistent that he wanted to get his shopping done early gosh the woman a volunteer from an upscale suburb said thats a tough one but no im sorry they havent released any information or names we just really got set up a little while ago and were really here to deal with seriously hurt people if and when theres a battle and people need fast medical help i cant help you i can get you a cookie and a juice does that interest you no maam thank you very much you might try the media tent its where all the reporters and tv people are thats probably where theyd release information thank you said mrs girardi youve been very kind pm pm the geeks had spoken that is the first behavioral sciences report had come in besci being the forensic psychology unit of the bureau tasked with inferring personality of perpetrator from evidence originally begun in response to various colorful serial killers of depraved sexual impulse then glorified in novel film and tv however despite their glory the boys seldom got out of the office a bunker in a nondescript building on the fbi campus at quantico since their duty was basically riding the net putting together personalities from what they uncovered and then offering their work product to whomever was interested and not many were they were known as the geeks they looked mostly like the excitable guys who try and sell you televisions at realdeal its a very interesting set of attributes said kemp to his second in command as they both looked at the document just emailed to them the geeks point out that hes clearly got intimate familiarity with this mall which after all isnt just any mall that means hes worked here he knows it forwards and backwards and this thing began as a fantasy that became a temptation so overwhelming he couldnt resist it its probably been at the core of his secret life for three or four years now if thats the core i think we can assume further said number two jake webley he doesnt have a real life so im seeing some technonerd full of resentments and grudges working alone in a little corner of the mall probably convinced that no one gets how special he is very good said kemp so we have to find that guy hes probably been fired or he has a record of near firings disciplinary problems and everybody says joey youre so smart why on earth cant you get along and they dont get that the reason he cant get along is that joeys so smart agh said webley whod seen that dynamic in play more than a few times so our first move is to begin to search the records for that profile i will get teams in contact with every corporate hq of all shops who wait said kemp theres more theres always more said webley aint it the truth okay hes got computer chops and has been able to take command of the mall security protocols that means hes penetrated several layers of obstacles evaded several firewalls avoided setting off countermeasures all in all a worldclass job of hacking perhaps on a wikileaks level i hope our geniuses are smart enough to fight him i hate the smart ones said webley they make all the trouble in the world they get so techedup they think theyre supermen and we normal onethirtyiq drones have to clean up after them both men all geared up in their combat style and decorated with automatic weapons and tear gas grenades huddled a hundred or so feet from the big state police incident command trailer in their own recently arrived hq a smallish commo van which put them in private contact with the bureau and its assets okay kemp said add to the profile a dense immersion in computer science there must be twenty computer or computer game shops in the mall they must employ a hundred bitter grinds maybe one of those guys got fired or disciplined or lost his girlfriend or something and one of his buddies would know that and that would lead us to him and when we know who he is well have leverage of some sort on him i will inform our teams and yet the geeks also point out that despite his brilliance hes got some odd perhaps revealing gaps in his knowledge even possibly subtler strategy im talking about the phones it is strange he could but he hasnt cut off the cell phone usage in his little empire so did he not do it because hes stupid and didnt think of it unlikely did he not do it because he doesnt know how to do it its pretty easy actually all you have to do is override the frequency with white noise and you could do that with a microwave oven or did he not do it because he knew that a major thing like this is going to produce megamultigazillion phone calls and he thought that would impact our communications bigtime and maybe he also wanted all the bad information the chaff that would produce good question then theres the power said webley clearly on a riff leaping through mental gymnastics with super agility seeing things clearly for the first time he must have shut it down in the security office when he iced the place but he left the main lines on we havent shut em down because itll terrify the hostages but we can shut em down easily plus maybe well want to do that as a prelude to an assault doesnt this mall have an emergency generator it does on the roof said webley now the issue is what does he know about power has he anticipated action in the dark do they have night vision if so and we think were all stateoftheart with our night goggles we could be walking into a killer ambush or has it just not crossed his mind or maybe hes aware of that vulnerability and the vulnerability of the emergency generator we can shut down the power and light in thirty seconds or so we think but this guy has tech chops this guy has the profile of a bomber he likes to express himself through his mastery of tech im surprised he hasnt planted explosives the little fucks at columbine did maybe its the same mentality when we go to blow the emergency gen it may be boobytrapped maybe we ought to get a team on that now good idea make it happen i will but what im seeing doesnt sound like a terrorist of the turbanwearing koranspouting kind you know that guy nothing in this whatsoever suggests islam or international terrorism despite the reports of the scarves fuck anybody can buy those scarves mail order you see em on chicks these days no i see another guy some twisted computer freak with a hardon against authority said webley i agree and yet and yet and yet theres still another component that doesnt really fit with this first diagram said kemp as if it was his turn to be the brilliant one what is wrong with the picture ill tell you how does this guy bitter techie the it man from hell how does he of all people round up hardcore gunmen and send them down hallways machinegunning little girls good question he needs manpower firepower fireandmove smallunit training communications setup all the sorts of things a green beret or some kind of seal pro could handle not the president of the chess club whos angry because he got fired from computersrus so maybe its a partnership two of em the bright kid somehow the seasoned combat operator highly unlikely i know those arent types that hang together no way okay said kemp maybe you ought to put people in dc on professional soldiers contractors graywolf vets exberets or seals in the greater minneapolis area also maybe get somebody local digging into very smart but screwedup kids arsonists bomb threateners maybe commies or socialists you know activists they call them im thinking university of minnesota would be a good place to start looking plus if there are any gifted and talented high schools in the area and im guessing there are ill get right on it said webley if we could find a convergence we might find our guy or our guys ill bring this to obobo maybe hes got state police investigators to toss in plus we ought to be able to get metros from saint paul and minneapolis thats a good idea will said webley but the thing is even if we figure out who is doing this how does that help us stop him i mean if we put his crying mommy on the bullhorn it could just as easily set him off as break him down i know said kemp disconsolately i have a terrible feeling were going to lose a lot more civilians on this one and i dont think theres a goddamn thing we can do about it mcelroy found something he found it by tracing with his fingers around the joinery of glass to stucco of the entire loop of lower lake michigan from milwaukee past chicago and gary on up into michigan halfway to canada it was a subtle thing a sort of give in the surface as though the stucco wasnt quite set he pulled out his surefire put a bright beam on it and decided that what he saw revealed under the harshness of the illumination was a subtly different coloration in the stucco the concrete the whatever it was that comprised the window well next he took out the wicked long spyderco he carried clipped into his thigh cargo pocket flicked it open to reveal a blade bad enough for killing for getting deep into bloodbearing organs if the need arose the need was not present now but the sharpness of point and blade certainly looked promising and he set at the patch of whatever it was and began to chip and dig away the surface yielded swiftly and mcelroy realized that this zone here must have been somehow damaged water damage maybe a broken pipe or something maybe a lightning strike but anyway the malls engineering staff had done a quick repair not with hardset concrete or whatever but with putty and had then painted over it a cheap repair costsavingthe recession remember thats what he wanted just what the doctor ordered he thought and began to dig aggressively soon revealing the heavy metal of the window frame itself couldnt get through that with a knife blade of course but beneath it more of the soft stuff and he was so heated with energy over the enormity of his discovery he worked with renewed dedication feeling himself a superman the sniper god had answered his prayer he lost track of time but it seemed to be only seconds in that period he scooped out an actual channel through the material being sure as he dug to draw the stuff toward him so that debris didnt fall upon the crowd and the gunmen five stories below but it was gloppy somehow and the moisture provided an adhesive factor the knife scraped off not particles of dust but gobbets of mucus clay something unpleasant it wasnt much but he had opened an oblong gap alongside a section of the steel frame of the sky light he peered through it and no glass obstructed his view he fished out his binocs and saw what he could see now jacked up by an optical factor of ten he had an angle onto a few feet of major corridor leading to the balcony overlooking the amusement park about two hundred feet away at roughly degrees not a lot of range not a lot of elevation or windage but he had the view into one of the corridorscolorado it had to be based on his familiarity with the placewith nothing but air between him and his theoretical target could he get a shot that was the first issue and it had to be solved before what would the target be even came up he picked the rifle up eased the suppressor through the hole hed opened found a shooting position his spotweld and went to the scope and saw nothing goddamn there was clearance for the muzzle but the scope was mounted higher than the muzzle by about an inch and it looked squarely into the metal frame he began to grind downward trying to torque the suppressor deeper into the putty to lower the muzzle another inch or so which would afford him the vantage of the leupold tactical he carried nah couldnt get enough leverage he withdrew the rifle went back to the knife he hoped he didnt have to cut any throats or cut open any tin cans because he was blunting the crap out of the murderous sharpness of the blade but he could afford a new knife ugh he ground he scraped he rubbed he spit he thought about pissing anything to wear down the resistance of what opposed him for it seemed he was beyond putty now and fighting the higher tensile strength of something hardened it seemed to take hours he felt the sweat running down his sides he felt the ache in his wrists and fingers from the steady pressure he was applying to the structure through the medium of the blade he sat back at last and it seemed hed opened a loophole in the building material under the frame of the window would it be enough was he done he reacquired the rifle repeated the shouldering and inserting process tried to gauge how far hed come how far hed have to go and finally peeked through the scope and saw lightness blur whatever realized he was focused at two hundred yards and this was much shorter just seventyfive and his finger flew to the focus knob and he found himself staring with surprise into the face of a terrorist edging down the corridor he looked up through the window and confirmed it was a man stealing his way toward the balcony and that was an ak in his grip his head was blanketed in an arabic tribal scarf and a boom microphone came around to cover his lips from earphones inside the headgear mcelroy went back to scope and saw the face quadrisected by the four pie slices of scope upon which the reticle was centered he had the kill shot with his suppressor he had to get the okay to shoot amazingly the guy looked not arabic at all but sort of chinese or something it was webley again kemps second in command and this time hed come up almost secretly to kemp he spoke in a whisper one of our guys on the roof has managed to bore through a soft spot under the frame of the window he has a target tango asked kemp affirmative dead center moving down the hallway one guy isolated ak dont know what hes doing up there my shooter is suppressed hes on him now can take him down quietly the others wont know interesting said kemp will we have to take this guy we ought to clear it with obobo hell say no i guarantee you you know it i know it hes riskaverse forceaverse killaverse i dont know what hes doing in this line of work jake keep it down you dont know whos listening will let us take this guy its one less to deal with obobo doesnt need to know its our sniper our operation we have to take this chance everything in kemp warned him to say no which is why he himself was surprised when he said greenlight him drop the fucker hard sniper five cleared to engage mcelroy heard roger wilco said mcelroy trying to fight the spasm of elation that it had finally come the clearance to make the kill the order hed been waiting for his whole life he almost pulled hard at that second but some sniper wisdom from somewhere halted him maybe the sniper god reaching down to calm him hed been in position too long his body discipline was breaking down the whole goddamn thing was pretty shaky because he wasnt set up on something to take the weight the rifle wasnt on its bipod he didnt have a bag or a tight left arm under the buttstock to eat up the tremble this was all fucked up and nobody in sniper school had ever said a thing about an improvised position like this he stood half hunching all weight centered on the small of his back which was beginning to object his legs were slightly spread but he couldnt lock his knees and instead had to keep them precisely folded to stay on target he supported the rifle entirely on the strength of his arms which deadened his trigger finger and sent telegrams of pain to wrists and gripping hands the yips had begun to build little random tremors that could come from nowhere and blow the shot hed made ten thousand times he stepped back eased the rifle down took a deep breath of cool air felt it soothe his lungs and his dried throat felt the oxygen send a squirt of strength to his muchtroubled and overworked limbs and he willed himself back together again he went into his hunch drawing the rifle up knowing that he wouldnt want to spend too much time on target but break the trigger at the first sight picture he torqued his elbows inward even as his trigger finger snapped the safety forward making him hot good to go ready to rock he found the spotweld watched the sight picture clarify noted that his guy had moved just a bit and was possibly a foot closer to his objectivewhich had to be the balcony overlooking the hostagesand felt a little oddness why was he so cautious why was he not striding about like he owned the place why was he kind of asian mcelroy had no answers but on the other hand he has an ak he is dressed in the tribal headdress of islamic specifically arab persuasion he has a throat mike a pistol a knife as had all the others mcelroyd seen he was a terrorist he had to be the only explanation that made sense kill him he thought kill him quick before the yips break you down again he made the slight adjustment to drop the muzzle to account for the slight forward progress of the man felt the trigger strut against the softest push of his finger just exactly as the four right angles of the reticle settled on the blank of the forehead and beheld the perfection the rifle fired itself first person shooter at its ultimate first person shooter for real first person shooter the logical destination first person shooter the end of the road he watched on number seven the big screen he knew he should be watching the other screens should be scanning this corridor and that stairwell for all the signs of disturbance for possible threat for danger for sloppiness on the part of the kids but he could not stop watching the rifles unnoticed by their users had miniaturized vidcams clamped to the barrel with some fixture from gg ampg or bravo company or larue tactical just behind the muzzle and each sent a streaming vid feed to him at his headquarters via the malls wifi network and came up on the big screens adjacent to the wall that displayed his intercept of the security cam data images images everywhere on the walls of this dark back room which was filled with screenglow turning everything a translucent gray white yet more surrealism for this most surreal of enterprises the guncam imagery of course was sent to and recorded on the tb memory card but he was still able to hit replay at the local level and watch a designated sequence over and over again so now he watched number seven for about the fourteenth time the gunman was maahir the oldest and most reliable the killer of santa claus it took a while for the video to settle down but even as the muzzle prodded the arbitrarily selected five and pried them out of the crowd in a dazzle of nearabstract shapes and blackwhitegray imagery certain lucid visions still arrived the look in the eyes of the woman the sullen downcast of the face of the old man the simple dullness of the uncomprehending teenager then it all went to blur again as the gunman walked them to the cleared space got them on their knees they hadnt yet figured what was going to happen because of course it was so outside their imagination this kind of thing this wantonness this jihadi contempt for life it hadnt yet come to america oh sure at the trade center but those were meaningless numbers the deaths of these five would be far more terrible and would live forever in the western imagination when the data got into the world blogosphere but that was still a few days off okay now five kneelers hands at their sides maahir has settled down the gun muzzle isnt flappityflapping all over the joint reducing the imagery to a smear of gaudy electrons and the tiny camera peers down from its forearm mount seeing the muzzle as a black prong in the upper right hand of the screen eternally fixed in the image the woman is first the camera closes on the back of her head as he presses the muzzle almost to her skull she has no idea shes about to enter history and sits placidly awaiting a deliverance that isnt to be flash jump blur a haze of smoke and the image is still again and fills with light as she topples forward twisted slightly instantly extinct with animal death comes the end of body discipline as all the muscles let go at once and she lunges forward like a felled building straight into the floor not much damage visible because the bullet passed through hair burning it pushing it aside but still hiding the fragility of the skull as the muzzle sweeps to the next in line his eyes shoot back to the gunman laced with bulgy fear flash jump blur haze stability he topples sideways out of the frame the next is the younger woman who appears to be knit up in desperate prayer all bunched up her jaw vibrating as she uncorks the various afterlife mantras and deity ass kissing that constitute formal address to the supreme then flash jump blur haze stability an eccentricity she does not fall immediately but for some reason remains intact and upward for another second or so then seems to melt from within as if her core has turned liquid and imploded downward the fourth is the older man who struggles in his anger to rise and fight so we get a double jolt the first from maahir tomahawking him with the gun barrel to drive him back to his knees in pain and then the flash jump blur and haze of the shot itself a disappointment because it hits him above the ear disappearing again in hair the last is better the teen actually closer to a child small frail skull thirteen fourteenyearold boy he thinks flash jump blur haze but the head detonates becoming in an instant too swift to even record something called nothead or unhead a kind of broken empty vessel departed entirely from assumptions of human anatomy its deflated emptied eviscerated but the boys bones are so light and his musculature so unimposing that he falls to earth almost insignificantly maahir steps back from his work and casually sweeps the carnage he has unleashed five bodies shorn of dignity on the floor in the cruel blackwhite videography of the guncam maahir walks around them muzzle on them in case he needs to fire another shot but all are quite dead in their looseknit positions and beyond them on the pavement a kind of communal blood pool has formed fed by five tributaries in the screen room andrew toggles a button on his keyboard and restores the livefeed guncam data which has he has to admit turned out to be rather useless except in special conditions such as the one hes just witnessed its mostly blurs of floors as the boys sweep this way and that and occasionally you get a view of the cowed hostages sitting in misery and terror or a look down some deserted corridor as the boys are sent out on various errands he looks at his watch its almost time p m pm it was like being hit in the head by a snow shovel the shock was more disconcerting than the pain as the world went to crazed fractionality his memory purged the eternal sensation best described as what the fuck commandeered his entire mind and it seemed to take minutes before clarity finally restored itself to the effect that ive just been shot in the head the next logical question why am i not dead somehow didnt follow instead his knees gone all jelloy ray threw himself back in primal panic and slipped into some kind of notch in the wall where he shared a few square feet with a water fountain he fought for cognizance first he remembered who he was then he remembered squeezing lisa fongs left tit thirtyone years ago in the cloakroom of the subic bay naval base elementary school no then he remembered that he was in a shopping mall taken over by the huns and only then did it occur to him that a sniper was shooting at him at him the nerve of some people he sucked in his chest just in case an inch or so of it extended beyond the edge of his little water fountain niche and invited another shot but he also realized he was trapped he could risk a run but even now the guy was on him from wherever his reticle greedily massaging the edge of wall that shielded ray from death he tried to think can these guys have brought snipers along and salted them all over the mall in case theres some movement from the people hiding in the stores on the upper floors but that seemed a little farfetched yes possible but also insane and therefore unlikely so who the fuck was shooting at him and why did he miss it didnt take a genius to make the next leap sure it was a law enforcement sniper maybe directly across the atrium on the other secondfloor expanse of balcony maybe a part of a team the cops had somehow gotten into the mall who were even now moving into position for the assault hes on his scope he sees a guy with an ak and a head scarf and he figures hes got a target he gets his authorization or maybe not and then he puts a bullet in rays head only for some reason he misses fuck you jack ray thought but telling jack to fuck himself did nothing to solve his immediate problem and the more he thought about it the more he realized the guy probably wasnt across the way or even higher on the third or fourth levels but even higher than that he had to be firing through or from the skylight if hed been right on ray he couldnt have missed but the higher he was the more extreme the angle was if youre shooting downhill the rule was you always hold low because the bullets point of impact will be higher hed forgotten while putting the hairs on rays forehead and the bullet had instead hit high blitzing rays head right through the scarf and the crew cut spilling red but not gray stuff but fuck it hurt ray could feel blood sliding down through his hair his ears rang still and he couldnt stop shaking man that was a close sucker that was as close as close gets without death being involved he tried to work out a move hmm maybe a feint to draw a shot then a quick dash during the cocking sequence but suppose jack isnt shooting a bolt gun but is on some stateoftheart semiauto rig so the gun reloads itself in a onehundredth of a second and after his feint ray steps out and catches the spine breaker the bastard has me deadzero he thought sniper five sniper five come in mcelroy heard through his earphones shit sniper five have you engaged sniper five goddammit mcelroy what the fuck is going on mcelroy recognized the voice of his immediate supervisor he couldnt hide anymore i have engaged he said one shot can you confirm a kill uh oh fuck mcelroy you missed jesus christ i am going to have your ass for sure no i hit him i saw his scarf blow up as the bullet impacted in the rear quadrant of the head but he didnt prone out i think i damaged him badly but he slipped back in this niche in the wall thats where he is now you have him zeroed did he ever even if the weight was racking him hed now been in this awkward halfhunch offhand standing for a good seven minutes sweat was everywhere on him despite the fortydegree temp the small of his back felt like it had taken the bullet his arms and wrists were fighting those oncoming yips and he kept squirming a little this way and that to find a more comfortable position even as the crosshairs had begun to widen in their tremble circle he wasnt sure how much longer he could hold it and still have the confidence to squeeze one off if the guy made a sudden move on the other hand he did not want to lose this i will not let up i am strong enough i will stay on this guy no matter what i have him zeroed he said sitrep hes stuck in there hes out of the fight im guessing hes bleeding out hell be gone soon you know brain shots arent always instantaneous sometimes not even fatal but hes not going to do much more today that i guarantee you yeah but while youre on him whos on your window sending us dope there is no dope nothings happening you stay on him for a little while longer but if i have to im pulling you off and sending you back to general intelligence reporting i will get him for you said mcelroy thinking i will get him for me the phone vibrated great trapped by a sniper shot in the head men with guns all over the joint and the phone vibes somehow ray got the little rectangle of plastic genius out of his pocket careful not to extend an elbow past the edge of the niche and invite a bullet into it slid the answer icon to the right and saw mollys name announced as the caller are you all right she asked not really he said sort of stuck here i heard from my sister ray shes in with the hostages my mother too i cant do anything for them now ray what should i tell her if theres an assault get down dont run most of the firing will be at waist to chest level or higher if theyre down theyll be much safer crawl slowly away from the area but be willing to play dead at any second itll be over quickly therell be a lot of firing a lot of confusion and they should be as innocuous as possible if they panic and run someone may target them as movers our guys their guys okay ill tell her did those kids get there yes the place is now crawling with them all the women are helping that day care girl is something shed make a hell of a marine meanwhile ive just had an idea i have to get off the phone okay be careful tell him ray thought but now that he had the phone out he went quickly to his contacts screen and touched the call icon for the one man who might be able to help him the strange remote laconic guy who was they had both so recently learned his biological father this is swagger came the message leave a number and maybe ill call you back but i probably wont ha ha great for the dry humor the old bastard was known for almost as much as his shooting but it did his son no good now ray swept his contacts and at last came upon another possibility nick memphis fbi the entry read only a few people had his private number so nick was somewhat surprised to feel the phone tingling in his jacket he picked it open saw rays number thought it odd that the man should be calling him at all particularly now today cruz how are you long time no hear nice to get a call actually ray im kind of busy i am too im betting youre watching reports come in of a terrorist deal in minnesota well im in the middle of it memphis was stunned he was indeed sitting in the fbi incident command center in the hoover building in dc actually not doing much except pitching in his comments on dealing not with the gunmen but with the phenomenon known as douglas obobo a tricky character on another floor theoretically brilliant people on computer terminals tried to hack into the closedoff mall system up here others worked the phones trying desperately to find some clue as to who was behind this and others ran logistics helping coordinate the problems by which law enforcement units continued to pour into indian falls particularly the now airborne fbi hrt from quantico while still others were on the phone constantly to will kemp the saic in minnesota giving him advice and handling his inquiries while also monitoring the situation and evaluating his performance ray explained what was happening to him jesus said nick thinking instantly how ugly a fate it would be for cruz after his legendary service to get nailed by an fbi sniper in a bullshit friendlyfire incident he looked over saw ron fields head of the fbis sniper school and a leading tactical guru within the institution on the phone okay he said cruz you stay put im going to try and get you out of the kill zone he went over and said ronnie i have a situation fields had the usual deadpan swat response to anything even the fact that a marine sniper was being targeted by an fbi sniper inside a terrorist takeover of a replica of america in the heart of the actual america on primetime televison and that someone had shot santa claus if anything in the fix seemed ironic or ridiculous or even unfortunate he didnt register it he solved it he nodded pushed some buttons and handed a hardwired receiver to nick saying webley kemps number two on site and helping kemp webley came a voice webley this is nick memphis yes mr memphis nick heard webley pop to immediately aware that he was on the phone with a big dc player probably for the first time in his life webley you have snipers on the roof yes sir answered webley one of them is engaging even as we thats the problem said nick the guy hes shooting at is a good guy exmarine sniper himself call him off yes sir and put me on the line yes sir nick listened as someone did more connecting and heard in a few seconds sniper five this is command disengage that is an order disengage goddammit i have him hes going to break out of there and i will nail him sniper five i am advised you are firing on a friendly what he has an ak and a head scarf and sniper five this is assistant director memphis in dc the man you are firing on is an exmarine with sniper experience himself do not engage he could be our asset inside can he signal three fingers nick put down the phone picked up his cell ray hold out three fingers ive got the guy on the line actually hes not some fucking kid wholl shoot em off is he he sounds excited yes but hes under control there was a pause then sniper five said i have acknowledgment i see three i am stepping down good good said webley okay ray youre clear now at least sniper five wont be it seemed to occur to all of them at once and the jabber was impenetrable until finally all shut up and let nick say what all had figured out webley im going to give you rays number his name is ray cruz twentytwo years usmc maybe their number one sniper five tours in the sand great great operator i dont know what hes doing there but hes there and were fools if we dont use him have sniper five contact him maybe the two of them can work together and deal with these guys in a way no one else is in position to got you ad wilco nick went back to ray the guy on the roof is going to call you sniper five dont know his name but maybe you and he can see things we cant and help us got it said ray clicking off to wait sir said webley should i alert saic kemp about this contact you know kemp i dont you make the call ah hes not too anxious to get heavy into this one it looks like its going down bad for all involved and there could be big repercussions the bureau culture it was as often as not the true enemy sas learned that the route to promotion and retirement plus lucrative security industry positions afterward was a spotless run through their twenty years on the street and that had the inevitable effect of drying out initiative nobody wanted to make the big mistake and get creamed and no one seemed to notice that nick had mavericked himself aloft but even nick knew he was the exception and that his connection to the even more maverick bob lee swagger had been a fantastic aid so these guys always played it cautious and somehow career considerations came into play in command decisions in ways that couldnt be anticipated it was nobodys fault it was the culture so nick said you know hes got a lot on his mind webley and i dont want him trying to conceal anything from obobo so until we see how this is going to work out well keep it to ourselves okay if ray moves he may have to move fast and i dont want him fighting bureau culture and command doubt among his many enemies i am on board sir said webley nothing scared mom her wrinkled old face had knitted up tight and now showed nothing but fighting rage and she knew a little about fighting rage shed been born into the tribal mountain zones of a country that had been destroyed into a war culture and had grown up to the smell of aviation fuel from the coming and going of the american helicopters the fluttery lights of illumination flares parachuting down outside the wire in the night the faroff and sometimes not so faroff popping of smallarms fire she knew how to fieldstrip both an ak and a carbine she knew how to lay a mine cut a mans throat read sign and stay dead still when the northerners in their ridiculous uniforms were they monkeys she thought they looked like monkeys stalked her shed lost three brothers by the time she was fifteen and her father guamo chan had worked with a variety of young american commandos on missions against the same hated northerners she married at seventeen to a fighter named jang the bravest of the brave then one day he didnt come back and so she mourned for a year and a day and at eighteen married another fighter her current husband dang yan called danny now a travel agency owner on central avenue in saint paul she remembered the day when the world ended and it was foretold that the northerners would win the americans were not cruel they did not abandon their loyal allies but they were not gentle either and in truth what followed next was a mess coming close in its sloppiness to a tragedy in a confusion of camps and helicopters and ships and more camps she ended up with those of her family who still survived in the belly of a cold far city she began a new life and raised five daughters and nothing ever scared her this filth didnt scare her boys with guns black boys with guns just like the ones you sometimes saw in saint paul with no respect for ancestors for family or clan no warrior ethic not even an ability to read or write they were nothing she spat on creatures so low what scared her was her daughter sally who sat next to her under the blaze of windows in the roof high above in an ocean of victims somewhat like the camps where she had spent too many months they sat hands folded on heads driven here by the panic of the crowd at the gunfire some had already died some were crying some were breaking down some sat with the dullness of the soontobedead most prayed for deliverance or tried to hush frightened children but all of them just hoped not to be noticed but someone had noticed sally mom saw he was the shooter the one whod killed the five he was maybe a little bigger than the others and there was something surly about him he alone wasthe hmong word was khav meaning proud or possibly selfimportant although she didnt know english well at all even after these many yearsin the way he carried his weapon with a certain deliberate coolness and disdain the other filth saw nothing their eyes were blank they had no appreciation for what lay in front of them as if other lives had no meaning and other places had none either they had no depth whatever had formed themwar poverty whateverit had left them empty incapable of paying attention to or feeling anything they would take what was before them life or death beauty or ugliness fate or luck and do what they had been instructed but they would not select they would not consider they did not winnow they did not decide this one had decided sally her youngest was a fragrant blossom on a spring day before the wet season arrived she smelled of delicacy sweetness notyetripeness she was too young to have developed but you could tell from the way men looked at her that she had a rare almost ethereal beauty molly the eldest so smart went away to school and now was a lawyer for the americans in their capital annie had married a japanese dentist with a practice in the suburbs ginger was a softball coach and nationally ranked player who had almost made the olympics and might still and jeannie was in firstyear med at bloomington but sally a latecomer a final surprise from god was the baby of the family with ears of porcelain and a perfect little nose and bright eyes and thick lustrous hair gathered in a ponytail she was her mothers prize but he had noticed her she sat beside mom huddling trying to comfort both mom and herself she wore ugg boots in suede black tights a little blue jean skirt a hoodie sweatshirt with st paul trinity stenciled on it and a blue jean jacket much too light for the weather though sally was a native minnesotan far hardier than her tropically raised mom and normally shrugged off the cold like the white people did the crowd parted as he bullied his way to them about ten feet away he stopped bent down and snatched up a womans purse roughly opening it he grabbed the wallet and pulled out a wad of bills then he tossed the purse and strode forcefully to sally through the crowd of cowed hostages he stood above her looking down on her imperially like the conqueror he believed himself to be he smiled showing broad white teeth then he took a step to mom bent down and said i have no goats here take this and he threw the money at her i buy her from you now she is mine she will be my bride this day he laughed heartily then he reached down forced his hand inside her sweatshirt and bra and enjoyed a fondle of her small left breast mom saw the pain and shame cross her daughters face and the girl violated seemed to diminish before her the large man laughed winked at mom and stomped away mom watched him go she knew what she must do she reached back over a low stone arrangement that separated grass from garden in this mock outdoors and surreptitiously she snatched up a fistful of black soil she dumped it into her purse then she did it again and again and again it seemed to take forever setting up the phone connections finding a special agent fluent in german getting numbers from someone at a siemens branch in new york reaching finally a siemens pr gal in stuttgart then finally a vice president getting an authenticating call from the german federal police they were so goddamned careful and now finally hans jochim fiftyfour yet it was not like talking to someone named hans jochim fiftyfour it was like talking to someone named holly burbridge thirtytwo who sat next to him she was the translator and eventually the rhythms of the time lags seemed to disappear sir i understand you were the design team leader on the memtac program that runs the scada system at several big malls in america well not exactly team leader holly responded i was more of a coordinator policy is set by the executive branch and alas vetted by marketing then an environmental committee and a labor union committee have to file action reports which of course must be responded to in detail and then theres the hearing where the arguments are made orally in front of a board composed of jesus christ how long would this take sir were in an emergency mode here may i proceed with all due respect herr doktor ingenieur the last a flourish hed picked up from some world war ii novel or something grumpilygrumpiness came even into hollys voiceherr jochim said i am not a doktor ingenieur i am an ingenieur i may go back to hamburg sir our perpetrator has taken the whole system off line and we cant penetrate it is necessary lives are at stake for us to penetrate the system and regain control of the buildings security system im sure with your brilliance sir you can suggest another route in a back door or something wrong word back door exploded holly in rage i do not forget things i have no back doors this is not a parlor game it is one of the most sophisticated programs in the world it controls everything we wrote a million kilometers of code just for the cooling system and neal took his headset off waiting for the teutonic typhoon to blow out to sea finally hearing a pause he jumped in with i did not mean to imply accidental openings or sloppiness in any professional discipline obviously youre smarter than i am because i cant get in and i need your help and the fire control system said the german the fire control system it has guns no no as in fires fire engines firemen we had to interface with another firm very delicate business japanese very arrogant people you cannot tell them anything can you be more specific they do have the best fire control hard and software in the world and they maintain their very high standard by retaining direct access to their system from tokyo they can monitor and troubleshoot anyplace in the world from their headquarters in tokyo all by nothing more sophisticated thanperhaps you have heard of this a telephone my god said neal yes now i am going to give you a number to call and an engineer to talk to they are very careful too so i advise you to have your state department run interference you want to get into the system this is how you get into the system decisions obobo with mr renfros shrewd advice had a superb gift for making the right one his confidence only a little shaken by the hostility of the press conference had reassembled itself and now various people put various issues to him for disposition but there were so many of them some could be put off or safely ignored jefferson the swat hotshot wouldnt go anywhere he was so desperate to get the nod from obobo to go in shooting of course shoot shoot everyone thats a good idea a mall full of bodies with lakes of blood on the floor but jefferson like other men of his ilk was basically so obsessed he was stupid he could be manipulated with flattery and attention and easily disposed of other decisions should we leave food at the doors and pull back in hopes that the gunmen whoever they are will take it in and distribute it what about medical supplies antidepressants or antianxiety drugs renfro agreed the answer to both yes why not the stress on the hostages must be godawful not that anyone could do anything about it then there was the pressure of the media national correspondents were hammering renfro for more info and renfro pointed out that if you let them feel like insiders maybe they wont be so rough on you but renfro also knew it would be illconsidered and play to the strength of the colonels enemies if he were seen giving oneonones in the crisis so it was a thin line to be walked and renfro advised giving the networks brief oneonones but against a dynamic situation all in standup so that it didnt have that public relations feel to it and was more cinema verite in nature renfro had also arranged for the colonel to suit up in tactical gear and the man was now resplendent in a black jumpsuit with his beretta in a midthigh tactical holster as well as radio gear flashbangs cuffs and danner tac boots now he looked the part as well and the frustrations why was he getting no meaningful intelligence where was the fbi on this to get him some leverage they had been tasked with running an investigation they had the access to the various federal databases and so far what had they come up with a little something from the geeks that kemp had thrown at him but really constituted nothing but a big yawn obvious stuff so disappointing they were supposed to set up an information central under command of a major by which data from records interviews of witnesses many grabbed on the run advice from other departments and police executives would all be collated evaluated prioritized and thenthe most importantbrought to him and of course it was an utter fiasco too much information too fast too much of it unreliable or hearsay or interpretation so that enterprise had yet to produce anything meanwhile he was aware of the clock spinning its inevitable way toward pm that would make three hours since the thing had begun three long hours suppose the man inside shot six more people then hed have to go before pm he couldnt stay on the outside for seven at pm then eight at pm why didnt these people talk to him tell me what you want start a conversation lets see where we are nobody does something like this and then goes silent it doesnt make any sense he knew that if he could only start a dialogue he could ultimately bring them to his side that was one of his greatest gifts and it always served him well his intellect his humanity his empathy his compassion those were his secret weapons those would win the day sir came another voice one of many and he said yes yes what is it then turned his attention caught because he saw jefferson outside talking to a tv reporter and he didnt want to be criticized from within the command during the incident and at the same time he saw his pa hustling in possibly with some new directive from the governor and outside the window in the falling dark he saw reporters laughing and knew they were having a good one at his expense and he wants to talk and he himself had to go to the bathroom and he hadnt had dinner and couldnt stay sharp without food and who wants to talk him said the tech suddenly it got very quiet the fellow inside sir its a call from mall security command ive verified it its the right number its from inside all right its from somebody who says he represents an outfit called brigade mumbai he wants to talk he says or at six pm hell kill six more people three months earlier the imam nadifa aba locked the door of his storefront mosquemasjid altaqwaon bedford avenue and checked for his enemies before walking to his car he had many enemies of course the fbi but at least they kept their distance then the young american black men who thought he was a fool and mocked his dignity and laughed at his prayerfulness and liked to intimidate him with fantasy violence that ended with a blow halted an inch from his nose when he ducked they collapsed in laughter but worst of all was the reverend reed hobart of the minnescola avenue baptist church of the redeemer who one day decided that his god had spoken to him and it was his duty to drive the nonchristians from minnesota the reverend had a long history of crusades and himself was probably under fbi surveillance for links to a violent antiabortion underground but he also had a nose for publicity and for two weeks had shown up at ten each morning for four hours of nonviolent but very loud protest outside the imams modest mosque islam is the bunk one placard read and go back to goatland read another and osama is toast and the worst was koran matches home cookin to see the text desecrated like that it filled him with rage and pain and hatred pushing him further and further toward the violence that he felt deep in his heart but he knew if he struck at the reverend hobart with his mane of hair and his big head and his loud voice hed only be mocked and ridiculed how could a believer keep his dignity in such a hellish circumstance but the reverend had taken the day off and no one cursed at the imam as he walked to the car to his right as he passed a vacant lot the vividly lit towers of downtown minneapolis gleamed in the surprisingly chill august night like a nightmare metaphorically of course it was the west hideous and tempting all gloss glitter licentiousness and flesh insolent black youth bellowing white false holy men he sniffed in disrespect sending a snort of disapproving breath out into the air purposefully not looking at the skyline of decadence a babylon of infidel scum he was a bitter man fortytwo tall and angular like many somalis with bright eyes white teeth cheekbones like razors and a froth of beautiful hair he yearned for dry heat the solitude of the desert for quiet brightness for the path of gods will to be known to him for a mission more potent than his current one which was to enforce the faith upon an everdiminishing group of countrymen and observe in desolation as for every new arrival who joined two older ones wandered off away from the faith captivated by the temptation of america since the killing of osama the holy warrior and the barbaric spectacle of celebration that ensued the imam had been in a state of constant fiery rage he shrugged drawing his cheap coat tightly about him to keep the chill out his circumstances might be severe but his spirit was not he fancied himself a warrior a mover of worlds and shaker of universes he burned with zeal and urgency he glanced about checking for his fbi monitors sometimes they were there sometimes they were not maybe they werent even fbi as he was on every western terrorist watch list mainly for his propensity to write angry essays in a small number of somalilanguage community newspapers such as his most recent allah demands harshness yet pity in attacking homosexual deviation drawn from several koranic sources yet given a certain modernistic oomph by the imams relentless prose style and his merciful conclusion that the deviates should be defenestrated not stoned so much easier on everyone including the transgressors for whom he was not without compassion tonight was a rare treat not only was the reverend blessedly absent but as well there appeared to be no federal agents about you could tell them because their sedans were inevitably dark in color without american frill and held two rather doughylooking white men who appeared wracked with boredom they followed at a respectful distance and sometimes they accompanied him all the way home and sometimes not depending on who knew what indicators that suggested tonight would not be the night he blew up america so he had a free night he checked his watch saw that he still had an hour before his last prayers were expected thought about this or that temptationa small glass of wine a trip through the pages of the latest hustler a rerun of the video as al jazeera had reported itbut decided that tonight would be a pure and consecrated devotion he unlocked his ford tempo and climbed in turned on the engine waited for the moisture to clear from the windshield and pulled into traffic checking the mirrors to see if on either side of bedford anybody pulled out behind him no one did however in his own back seat someone rose directly behind him and sat back relaxed the imams gut clenched you always had this fear in america that some crazed follower of a maniac like the reverend would take it in hand to blow away islam in the form of the imam as if the imam himself were plotting to blow up america although of course that was on his todo list he cursed his stupidity for not checking the back seat he was at war he had to be alert he prayed to allah that this was not his death and then he heard an american voice say if youre worried about the fbi theyre not here tonight they only come on oddnumbered days in oddnumbered months and evennumbered days in even months on the odd months the shift is the last twelve hours of the day the evens the first twelve hours it used to be but you know budget cutbacks the imam swallowed drily who are you he asked licking his lips are you from the reverend hobart not exactly who sir please dont turn around drive to your home the usual route the car is bugged but ive momentarily diverted their penetration how do you know ive hacked into their computer net and examined their operating orders and their technical capacities to get the car bugged they hacked into the new myford touch wireless connection this lets them hear everything in the car see out the rear window track via gps turn it on and off everything i wrote an iphone app to control the car and switched the fbi views to another vehicle currently theyre watching a soccer mom deliver her kids to practice they think its some kind of anomaly so i will talk while you drive you will park in your garage now listen hard and well and remember what i tell you are you of the faith shut up listen my faith is of no importance and you would not understand it anyway accept my aid consider me a messenger from your god but for now shut up and listen the imam swallowed again and kept his eyes straight ahead i want to hurt them badly why none of your beeswax holy man maybe just because i love rock and roll but i need gunmen i want twelve somali jihadis smuggled into canada and held in a safe house near the border in midnovember they should be true believers of low intelligence and profound impulses toward religious obedience true believers the seventytwo virgins all that horseshit if blooded so much the better its impossible said the imam i told you nothings impossible you have connections with half a dozen refugee organizations as well you have contacts with hizbul islam in mogadishu and the general will provide you what you need if you can convince him and you will convince him what is this all about america that is america the mall you know the place a hideous vulgarity a dozen or so miles out of town in indian falls busy busy busy it will be jammed on the day after thanksgiving your gunmen will unjam it thats impossible nothing is impossible i will provide weapons and access and plans i will take over the mall security system we will give them a lesson they will never forget to the glory of your god and mine your job is to get the men hold them and deliver them at a certain moment the plan is not sophisticated and will require no rehearsal these fellows will simply walk down a hallway shooting then they will hold hostages for a short while thats all none of them will survive it is a martyrs mission i invite you to join me in death and glory together we will punish them for their sins and for the murder of the holy warrior in his bed it costs money and permission you cannot do such a thing without finances and a judgment from higher councils we must examine to make sure such a course is correct and consider the political consequences ours is not simple nihilism but political policy bullshit listen to these rules and commit to them or this will all go away and you will burn in your hell for eternity no emails email has been penetrated no phone calls also penetrated nothing written no facebook or twitter or any stupid teenaged thing that you guys always give yourself away on nothing amateur there must be no physical or electronic acknowledgment of the planned event no records everything recorded can be recovered the imam himself must not deviate from his routine of the past few months except to handle communications with the great general hassan dahir aweys in somalia solely by satellite phone which will be provided but he should contact no other units no alqaeda cells nothing as all communications must be presumed penetrated he must never ask permission everything must be local and person to person guaranteed by a handshake and mutual obedience to your faith the imam hardly knew what to say was this a dream a phantom a movie but then he had an image of america the mall consumed in flame riven with blood heaped with bodies of dogs the smoke blowing its acrid perfume an american blazing in the heart of middle america and he was profoundly moved the holy warrior avenged the imam arrived at his prosaic twobedroom house in his prosaic neighborhood he pulled into his garage get out quickly go inside and say or write nothing cling exactly to your routine here is an envelope with ten thousand cash to support your activities it must never be banked because banks raise alarms they are not on your side make plans to go to somalia within the month to find and arrange for the boys nothing on paper nothing by phone nothing by email be hard disciplined focused and i will give you glory you havent even dreamed of is this a trick are you an agent provocateur have you been sent here to gull me into a mistake what is you want proof is that it you dont trust the white kid you think im on some kind of prank or working for the assholes of fiveoh hmm what can i do to convince you you must convert to not hardly oh i know ill give you a nice present that will convince you would you like some delicious candy what about a gift certificate for walmart possibly a new clock radio one that goes dingdong five times a day the imam said nothing in the face of such blasphemy okay my friend reach down under the dashboard in front of the seat to your right theres your present enjoy it in good health the imam thought this was another joke but he looked and indeed in the darkness of the space beneath the dashboard thought he made out a shape he bent and his fingers closed around some kind of green plastic garbage bag he pulled it up to the seat feeling its four pounds of weight he set it down studied the drawstrings of bright yellow plastic and pulled it open it was the large florid and quite excited head of the reverend reed hobart wont that look great on the mantel said the boy as he slipped out the back and disappeared into the darkness then suddenly the dashboard display came alive and the radio blared stones paint it black pm pm ray slid the answer icon to the right and put the phone to his ear this is special agent mcelroy he heard no he said its chucklehead mcelroy dumbbell and dope you ever shoot downangle mcelroy i guess not said mcelroy you have to hold low if you hold straight on you hit high you owe me fifty dollars pushups im a little busy now said mcelroy and youre going to get busier put that rifle down youre too dangerous with it you find me isolated targets out of visual contact with their main force and i will put them down well reduce their team one by one before they even notice it uh sergeant thats against policy id have to get some sort of higher approval on that and to be honest i dont think an agent has ever acted under such a wide license it would definitely be against our policy its against your policy its not against my policy my policy is stalk and kill oneshot variety its what i do its all i do i can shoot suppressed so noise isnt an issue now i am going to move out and try and take these people down having you birddog for me from on high like my private satellite would be very helpful or i can do it on my own either way it will happen mcelroy you decide right now who you are with he heard mcelroy pause and even imagined that the phone picked up the vibrations of a dry swallow but then mcelroy said okay im in nothings happening here anyway then he said first maybe you have some intel i can forward to command you got your gear from one of them right he didnt seem to mind black male age twentytwo or so somali id guess from what ive seen of them in minnesota handsome dude even with a broken neck didnt do an id check you took his stuff though equipment data okay the pistol is a heckler and koch p much battered im guessing some european police department tradein you have to squeeze it to make it shoot very unusual gun the mil ammo has a foreign head stamp i dont have time to check it exactly it looked grungy as if it had been stored in tins for three decades the ak is a not a its overmarked wti laredo texas looks to be a bulgarian or romanian clone i cant really read the serial number the ammo is which is the eastbloc variant on nato small lethal fast grain round looks surplus too no recognizable head stamp crappy od steel case red band at base of bullet copper gilding the mags are sort of plumorange color and i saw that shade all over the mideast and afghanistan so im guessing eastbloc junk too the commo shit is radio shack lowend the knife was some kind of surplus ak bayonet the whole thing could have been supported out of some shitcity surplus store so maybe thats a place for you to look got it ill get this to command we can get atf hacking on it you do that meanwhile im on the stalk the more we kill the easier any kind of assault will be when the heavy hitters go in and when that happens i can provide distracting fire and then suppressive if they have to maneuver youre my spotter mcelroy clear on that yes sir said mcelroy good now find me targets mcelroy closed up the phone and pressed his radio he got webleys assistant on the wave and fed him the weapon info he had just acquired then he signed off eased over the edge of lake michigan and went to work through his binoculars nothing much had changed one hundred feet below from his ninezerodegree perspective he could see a mass of humanity gathered on the walkways of the amusement park shaded here and there by the foliage of trees plastic or real unknown santa still dead still on his throne why didnt somebody throw a blanket over the guy the people were crowded together so tightly it was hard to make out the individual from the herd most were on their haunches some still with hands on head or behind necks looking nowhere except straight ahead many were trying to talk inconspicuously on their cell phones on their outskirts he could make out the more vigorous movements of the gunmen who strolled about the perimeter aks showily in hand they were easy to spot because of the bright tribal scarves which made excellent target markers someone either hadnt thought that one through or had thought it through very carefully and didnt particularly care that if the assault came targeting the gunmen would be much easier mcelroy himself didnt know what to make of it nor did he know what to make of a situation in which so few controlled so many so completely he thought about it yes indeed if all the hostages rose and ran at one of the gunmensay that dude there who lounged against a mall pillar smoking an illegal cigarette looking not particularly terrorist but more teen punkthey could almost certainly overcome him and flee en masse down the corridor but to do that theyd have to act as one and the first twentyfive or so would have had to have made friends with their own death no twentyfive middleclass americans were about to do that whatever that spirit was gone and nobody down there today would die of crazed courage they would sit try to wait it out pray for the authorities to run the rescue and pray that theyd be spared when that happened the guy behind this puppy knew his victim psychology a la america the mall and america the country he looked for evidence of explosives rigging canisters of gas maybe tanks of ignitable propane all emblems of weapons of mass destruction mallstyle and saw nothing just menyoung if he read their rangy undisciplined postures correctlyand their rifles the five executed hostages had been dragged over to the railing that separated the wild mouse ride from the public areas targets none to be had if the marine sniper pegged one of the gunmen hed go down in full view the crowd would react the other gunmen would see and the whole game would be up theyd shoot ten more then ten again until he gave himself up that was the message in the first five deaths but thenyes okay maybe yes on the second floor three jihadis had emerged from their posts below and now overlooked the crowd concentrating hard he saw that all three had the bigger fortyround magazines that probably were designed to feed the gun in its light machinegun role these three leaned on the balcony smoking joking joshing goosing goofing around theyd been put there obviously because their vantage post was so much higher their angle better and in the event of an assault they could bring fire not through the crowd but on the crowd they were on the marine snipers level but not across from him rather to his right one corridor he was colorado they were rio grande he couldnt engage them from where he was but if he rotated another corridor in the opposite direction over to hudson hed have a good shot at them if he were above them hed have an even better angle mcelroy took out the phone punched the button yeah okay three of them have come up to your level they are immediatelythat is a quarter rotation around the atriumto your right it seems to me that you might be able to get an angle onto them if you rotated to the left then youd be directly across from them or if you got up a level youd have an even better angle on all three i cant fire multiple shots with my technology said the marine well maybe theyll separate maybe one will be left alone and you can take him good call itll take me a while but ill try and get around and up you dont have any engineering diagrams theres not some kind of passage by which i can find a short cut they just dumped us up here without any guidance it was a big rush there wasnt any chance to bring that stuff into play now i can contact command and see if no no thats just more time being eaten up more people offering opinions more people wanting to be heard today action is king action and only action you get i get okay ill get into position if you see movement in my direction you alert me got it roger said the spotter mcelroy settled down to stay connected to the targets finally he swaggered to the phone this was his moment his whole life hed been able to synthesize arguments turn them around instantly and reiterate them in cajoling tones until his opponent had agreed with him it was his strength he knew he could do it now brilliant synopsizer genius of empathy purveyor of megaearnestness colonel obobo looked around saw renfro standing close by giving him encouragement through sympathetic even moist eyes its your line three sir obobo peeled off his earphones snatched up the phone punched this is colonel douglas obobo superintendent of the minnesota state police to whom am i talking please you know who i am came the voice calm and collected untainted by accent perhaps younger than might have been expected im the guy in the mall with a thousand hostages and ten thousand rounds of ammo you do the math i have demands sir im sure we can work something out your demands will be given fair hearing but i want to be clear i must also advise you to immediately cease your activity release all hostages lay your weapons down and turn yourself over to police authorities no one else needs to get hurt i really dont care if anyone else gets hurt said the voice i have no objection to other people getting hurt i have the hostages ergo i have the power you sit there and shut up and i will tell you what must be done at what timetable and what you can expect from us any more proffers of advice and i shoot a child if you ever call me son or young man ill shoot another child if you say i want to be clear again i will kill ten now if you want to save lives you have to do exactly what im telling you very quickly you dont have a lot of time do you understand i dont think anything is accomplished by belligerence we must have a calm clear measured shoot the little girl holy man the voice said no no please you cant actually i can ive seen you on tv i know youre an ambitious political asshole who thinks he can talk himself into anything put it on the shelf or people die do you get me loud and clear i am not rational i am not clear i am not bartering i will kill a lot of people do what i say and shut the fuck up time magazine cover boy obobo swallowed please proceed he said tightly excellent hmm its almost six at six i shoot six more unless you pay attention and i see action you cant i can anything i want let me say this whole plan is predicated on speed you will have to work like hell to make my demands happen in the short time frame i specify but it can be done i will enforce my demands with hostage executions if i dont see alacrity i want you to have no time to counterplot to plan reversals or assaults to get cute to hold meetings you wont have time to discuss or consider or make counteroffers this whole thing will be done in four hours or everybody dies and you go into the history books as the biggest fool in america you do what i say you do it at high speed low drag and most of these assholes will make it out alive you care about them frankly i dont theyre the herd and any herd can be thinned thats the law of nature get to it the colonel thought go ahead he said there are three young men doing ten to fifteen in the minnesota state penitentiary for bank robbery you remember the case it was famous yusuf jaheel and khalid kaafi they got far more for their crimes because of the blackguy penalty which nobody will admit to but which everybody acknowledges anyway their crime was political to raise money for the brigades back home my friends here are very upset that you treated them like common criminals it seems so unfair do you not understand that no infidel law can be applied to those of the faith this is the lesson they must teach you the kaafi boys heroes and geniuses all are to be immediately released and ferried to minneapolis international where they are to be flown to yemen by an air saudi super ready to take that flight at seven fiftyfive pm you should have just enough time if the flight is full kick three people off moreover if i do not see visual confirmation on cnn of the prisoners boarding buses by seven pm i will execute seven more hostages if they are not on that plane at seven fiftyfive i will order the massacre that you fear so much say wouldnt that be a career black eye you might not even make eagle scout or get into princeton as for the next batch i shoot the six at six i will begin with jews then if i am not pleased i may break my own rules though i hate to do that and shoot seven and a half children at seven thirty at a certain point i will allow each of my men to rape any woman they choose and if you know the muslim mind you know the women will be preteens if there is any assault i will order all my gunners to open fire on hostages you must comply hostages will be released when i see the plane has safely taken off for yemen and has crossed into canadian airspace a few minutes later when the hostages have been released we will not surrender we will take cover you may assault we will have a nice gun battle we do not fear death the narrative demands a climax and we will give it one america will enjoy it mightily i would say to your assault troops that though you might ultimately prevail bring many many body bags i know in those circumstances the thing to do would be to destroy us with a smart bomb but you wont do that youd destroy too many shoe stores allahu akbar motherfucker he broke the contact ray decided not to try to find a stairwell for the downangle shot which would cost him time as well as the effort to somehow get through the locked door instead he lowcrawled as fast as he could along the shadows where the floor and walls joined sliding under the retail windows good thing he was a gym rat still and did hard cardiovascular every day stamina is the essence of victory he knew and he was able to move at a high rate of speed not really in the classical low crawl with that squirming swimming wiggle that pulls you along but on all fours like some kind of sniper rat scurrying along he thought when they make the movie theyll cut this bullshit out it was a long transit and he fought the fatigue and particularly the neck strain for he had to keep his neck pried back so that he could use his eyes to scan ahead for threat whoever was monitoring the hall cameras was not paying much attention no call came from mcelroy indicating a reaction from the gunmen and ahead of him he saw nothing though as he passed each store he could hear scurrying breathing shifting as people sought security deep inside it took six minutes down the length of colorado to the outer ring down the outer ring then back down rio grande until he came to rest at the balcony overlooking the atrium though one quarter of a turn to the left he set up not at but a little behind the railing peering between its steel struts he saw his targets now there were two as one had departed for destinations unknown ray uncorked his iphone okay im here whered the third guy go he kind of casually left a few minutes ago and took the elevator down i guess that one central elevator is working ive seen him hes rejoined the downstairs bunch okay two thisll take some tricky work what are you doing my secret weapon the deadly potato ray had a shirtful of the starchy tubers with him hed dipped into the boardwalk fries outlet near the fredericks of hollywood picked seven or eight of the biggest gnarliest grossest spuds a potato said mcelroy potatoes make excellent fieldexpedient suppressors you watch bud he selected the biggest unslung the ak and wedged the vegetable over the muzzle feeling the flash hider and sight blade cut into the crunchy fiber of the thing as he slid it over until a good two inches of potato embraced the weapon the potato was stoutly mounted he set himself up in prone brought rifle to shoulder slipped the big prong safety off by pressing it down on the right side of the receiver ancient memories came back associated with the weapon some firefight in the sandafghanistan iraq who could remember he and a mixed force of marine infantry and army rangers in a house in some godawful ville hed gone to a captured ak and fired and fired and fired the whole night through he must have killed thirty men that night and in the morning when the bradleys got to them nobody in the house was dead though several were badly hit that gun was crude rattly unclean but baby it had done its work hard and well over the long nights ordeal but wont the first one blow the potato are you going to have time to get a second one on the muzzle good question said ray he rolled slightly to the left and extracted another potato he pushed it up close to the muzzle when the first guy goes down the second guy wont believe it hell freeze ill get potato two aboard and whack him i dont know said the spotter hes been in war before he just might empty in your direction and start screaming oh waitoh wait one of them just left hes going i lost him i cant tell where hes going i saw him he went into the bathroom its four or five stores back down the corridor ill do him when he comes out the other guy wont hear a thing and ill do him next jesus you have balls of steel said the spotter im a professional said ray this is what i do ray found his prone and built it from the bones outward legs splayed feet cranked outward for muscular pressure within the hold rifle tight to shoulder supported on bone not muscle breathing cranked down to a slow seepage of air ball of finger against the curve of the trigger its all in the pull that is after everything else its all about the pull hed made the pull a million times he had a sweet stroke firm soft untwisted by torque a steady ouncebyounce escalation of pressure until the break and something inevitably ended up with a hole exactly where hed intended the jihadi emerged from the restroom a hundred yards away at this distance a small man wiping his hands on a paper towel well pleased and well relieved with his bathroom work probably one of the few times he had relieved himself indoors and its good he enjoyed it so for the next second he stepped smack into the bullet it hit him above the right eye and his head jerked as no head in full health could jerk and he went down with what was presumably a thud though ray couldnt hear it at his range what he had heard was a kind of wet pop as the potato accepting the injection of supersonic gases from the muzzle behind the exiting bullet detonated in a muted spatter like a potato balloon becoming atomized pulp in a nanosecond potato mist hung in the air ray cranked the rifle back crunched on another potato and rebuilt himself the position in replica this time he cranked over on the jihadi at the balcony who leaned vacantly upon the rail that a bullet had just passed by his shoulder and destroyed his partners face was a fact he missed entirely and he only recognized that it was his turn next when his own bullet took his existence from him without him even knowing it find me another target said ray as it turned out the japanese were much less fearsome than the obstreperous herr doktor ingenieur jochim and that transaction went well and so it was that in a very few minutes special agent neal found himself with a landline receiver punching in nothing more exotic than an number neal had downloaded a modem app to his iphone and connected that via wifi to his computer thus his phone was sending and receiving the modem tones via the wifi connection and then via the landline circuitry to the mall he quickly engaged the wifi application on the phone and linked it to his desktop pc using a wifi usb stick meanwhile the drama around him had attracted quite an audience to his little chamber dr benson was there a couple of interns who could be bullied into getting coffee holly burbridge whom no one had the heart to get rid of she was that goodlooking and a few other its computer service geeks and special agents the phone rang as it would in any pizza shop in america and after a few seconds signified an answer by a series of clicks he had the logon code from the japanese punched in the numbers and a robot voice informed him that he was in contact he quickly disconnected the line from the phone and clicked it into the computer and again in seconds after some blinking and clinking a busy menu in japanese came up oh shit he said anybody read japanese arent you an expert on japanese porn neal someone asked yeah but only the office lady variety goddammit no help here but then his iphone rang he picked it up and answered it was juko yamata the japanese engineer special agent neal apologies i forgot to tell you our menu styles are very complex on japanese software it looks like a map of the universe said neal go to the third blank box on the righthand column that is external links punch anything in there then hit enter which you can see lower right red box with just two emblems on it looking like a flower and a broken ski jump neal did as he was told and was instantly informed he had accessed memtac english language version pm pm the colonel talked immediately by phone to the governor then called renfro and asked him to make an announcement to the press that demands had been issued by the gunmen and that they were being considered at the highest level of state government no hostages were shot at six well thats something the colonel said he said it to nobody the only person near him was kemp who had come up with an urgent look on his face to make the expected assault renfro had steeled colonel obobo for this and so he was ready for it i see your point he said after kemp had finished his rather overlong argument and special agent rest assured i will consider it very carefully and perhaps in the fullness of time thats the route ill choose to go but its important to make these decisions carefully goddammit said kemp the demand for the freedom of these somalis proves these bastards are international terrorists this is an fbi operation and local law enforcement will assist in any way possible but its not up to you to make these decisions anymore agent kemp possibly youre jumping to conclusions your investigators and mine have come up with no connection of this group to organized terror cells i heard no evidence of connection to overseas entities i heard an accentfree young white man and these prisoners are hardly international terrorists theyre local bank robbers petty criminals kemp was somewhat limited in his argument because he knew that in a certain way the colonel was right behavioral sciences had done a scan of the colonels conversation with the terrorist their conclusion was that he was an americanborn male early to mid twenties with a high iq and verbal facility his vocabulary alonealacrity for speediness for one the narrative demands a climax for anotherwould put him in the area of the standard sat verbal test they pointed out other things too such as a penchant for correct parallelism in speech very rare except among the highly cultured and a use of sophisticated irony he used the wellknown terrorist cliche allahu akbar in conjunction with motherfucker from urban argot the two chosen for ironic shock value in that they are the last thing one would expect from diction such as his whatever islamic terrorists were known for it wasnt irony but that wasnt the real issue the real issue was strategy colonel i am not trying to seize command i say again and i speak for the bureau i am bothered that you have made no contingency plans to assault and seem inclined not to do so these guys could start shooting at any second people could start dying and we are not ready to do a thing we have to do something and just as easily he could read our contingency preparations for assault as provocation and start shooting we save more lives by adjudicating than by assaulting another excellent gambit renfro had come up with we dont have enough men he continued we dont have the equipment to blow the doors simultaneously until the national guard engineers get here any assault will create a bloodbath its much better to cooperate and get this thing over i cannot in good conscience go any other way sir we have got to be in some kind of posture where we can operate quickly if i dont know what is taking them so long to make up their minds but i am now officially recommending that the terrorists terms be met that those somali prisoners be removed to the airport and sent to yemen lets get this thing over lets get those hostages out its the only way i can morally proceed its important to keep our moral guidelines intact yes sir said kemp now please return to your investigation thats very important and im trusting you implicitly on it he tried to sound utterly calm and serene kemp muttered and ran off you handled that well whispered renfro thanks said obobo slightly more upset than he cared to reveal these macho people always wanted to shoot that was the problem with law enforcementtoo many shooters too many bigots too many old john waynes who reveled even if they werent honest enough to articulate it in the license for violence had some sort of pornographic obsession with the guns the last thing he needed was gunslingers screwing things up kemp jefferson the same kind of but then he had a moment of mortal fear where was jefferson where is major jefferson he barked beyond the hovering renfro to major carmody i havent seen him in he was getting himself gunned up the colonel just knew it get me jefferson he said to his commo guy again no one noticed mr and mrs girardi the people at the press tent lounged around separated by an impregnable line of yellow tape from the state police command van a hundred feet or so back and next to it the smaller fbi van but parked here at the jerrybuilt tent where soft drinks and coffee urns had been placed men and women simply stood and talked or talked over cell phones the cameramen who had to lug the heavy equipment with them took advantage of the lull to park themselves on the many folding chairs that had been set up for a canteen before the site had been turned into a chaotic press tent by the reporters finally a man in a suit came over to them he seemed not to be a reporter for he didnt have that sort of scruffy look that most of the reporters affected and he didnt have a notebook or a cell phone in his hand may i help you he said im david jasper corporal minnesota state police im mr renfros assistant im in charge of this facility do you have press credentials you have to have press credentials to be admitted to this area were the girardis said mr girardi i dont know anything about credentials nobody asked us for credentials well the officer must have been otherwise occupied its a very tense situation were here about jimmy im sorry he said as he tried to gently herd them away from the reporters our son jimmy hes fourteen but small for his age today was the first time i let him go to the mall by himself he hasnt called no sir folks you have to know its a mess in there its total chaos and nobodys quite sure whats happening we thought you might have a list or something of casualties maybe he was hurt maybe he was sent to a hospital have you tried the red cross they were the ones who said come over here oh i see the runaround well im sympathetic but lots of people are in your situation its going to be days before all this is sorted out best advice is simply go home and wait for notification maybe jimmy will suddenly there was a spontaneous whoop from a group of reporters and at that moment several broke and rushed to the young corporal pushing the girardis aside wuff is on air saying theres an agreement why the hell dont we have that wheres obobo we need a confirmation okay okay said corporal jasper let me check he turned from the girardis to grab his own cell phone and the two watched as the circus moved elsewhere the phone rang in nikkis hand three thousand feet above the mall in the wusscopter and she saw that it was mrs birkowsky the hiding clerks mother she punched answer immediately mrs birkowsky ms swagger i just got what i think is good news from my daughter nikki did a little jump in her copilots seat and the sparkly horizon on the plains above indian falls seemed to leap with her was this thing going to end happily could it please share with me she asked amanda says the gunmen are all jumping happily and some have shot their guns off in jubilation she thinks what could that mean asked nikki whatever their demands are id guess the government has just agreed to them it means that the hostages will be released soon yes maam nikki said is that all amanda said well she said there was also a kind of roar from the crowd she called it a happy roar a roar of excitement im going to see my little girl again soon i just had to share it mrs birkowsky im very happy for you but please tell amanda not to come out of hiding until after the police authorities have taken over with people like this you never know yes yes of course but isnt it wonderful its fabulous said nikki she switched to marty at the station okay is anything going on what do you mean he asked i mean from our ground people has there been a newsbreak is there a new presser scheduled are there any signs say of buses moving up or ambulances getting into position or even the armed men drawing back not a thing its still a holding situation what about gunfire from within the mall no reports nothing all quiet on the western front what is this all about i have a report from inside the mall that the gunmen are celebrating shooting off their guns in jubilation and that the hostages are suddenly i dont know happy or relieved is it enough to go live it sure sounds like the state has met their demands i dont know nik wellwait wait im seeing buses beginning to feed in okay thats it lets go with it now on air you got it jim the cameraman leaned in supporting himself in the bulwark turning his camera light on she heard her vocal wired into the main feed heard the ridiculous ditdotdash bullshit intro music and heard phil restons syrupy staffannouncer voice say breaking news from wuffnews the wuffcopter over america the mall where terrorists are holding a thousand hostages as the crisis at america the mall goes into its fourth terrifying hour here is nikki swagger wuffnews wuffnews has just learned that inside the mall gunmen have fired weapons skyward in jubilation and that hostages themselves are relieved and excited some believe these factors indicate that the state government has agreed to terrorist demands as yet unspecified and that the terrible crisis might reach a peaceful conclusion and that freedom for the hostages might be imminent though she couldnt see him she knew that the shot had cut to the anchorman who now said in his best ted baxter profundo nikki can you confirm a timetable for this terrific news reports here are still preliminary she said and we will be following developments as they occur and nikki nikki im getting word that the state police superintendent and incident commander colonel douglas obobo is about to make a statement were going live to incident command headquarters she stared off into space and no monitor being available on board the wusscopter simply listened to the audio feed the colonels voice was calm and reassuring less than an hour ago a man calling himself the commanding general of brigade mumbai communicated with us from within the mall where he and his colleagues hold approximately a thousand hostages at gunpoint many of them hurt and in need of medical attention he demanded immediate transfer of three brothers yusuf jaheel and khalid kaafi from the state penitentiary where they are imprisoned for bank robbery to the airport where they are to be put aboard an air saudi airliner bound for yemen he gave us an hour to begin compliance or he would begin to execute hostages i have just received word that his demands will be implemented that indeed the prisoners are en route to the airport one of the cameramen poked nikki then held up one finger signifying that she had it first that she was number one goddammit and this was the scoop of all scoops didnt matter that she was only ninetyodd seconds ahead of the announcement she broke a worldwide story when they have cleared american airspace the hostage taker says all hostages will be released unharmed that is all i have for you at this time nikki heard a thousand questions launched and not a one of them answered and imagined the pompous goat turning and exiting smartly stage left great work nikki baby you own this story you will be in new york before the week is over i swear i just got lucky she said and in the long run it doesnt meanwhoa the chopper suddenly dipped sideways falling about ten weightless feet until capn tom got his two rotor blades back in synchronicity at that same second a black shape slid by uncomfortably close before it too leveled off bastard said capn tom man learn to fly before you come up here into crowded airspace wusscopter almost got clipped said one of the cameramen unsettled you ought to report him tom said the other cameraman ah said tom hes just a traffic amateur hes not used to being in formation or a jammed area still what a jerk but nikki had watched the craft slide by so close and her insides were still roiling it occurred to her yes you could die up here tom really someones going to get hurt call it in ill make a formal complaint tomorrow said tom meaning of course he wouldnt but something else nipped at nikki i saw his emblem he was from that alltraffic crowd pop like i said an amateur his idea of flying is holding stable over a highway but i thought they had run into hard times i dont know who told me cant remember but i heard they were grounding their chopper and buying their traffic from a big outside vendor i heard that too said one of the cameramen maybe so said tom whatever hes gone now and he was whoever pop was hed shot up high and she couldnt pick him out in the dimly lit skies above the message came to major mike jefferson huddled with his surreptitiously collected shooters in a parking lot near the entrance to the system of heating ducts that would eventually lead to the chamber beneath the amusement area concession stand he had put this little operation together on the qt hanging around command was only going to get him demoted so he thought ill just get some people and move into the area mike another major told him on the secure tactical radio channel the colonel wants you back here hes also pulling all the swat guys back and bringing in a fleet of buses what said jefferson are you nuts what the fuck hey mike said his colleague dont blow at me its the colonels decision were going to let this thing play out you heard theyve made demands were acceding to those demands and theyre going to let the hostages go maybe within the hour any sign of offensive action against them and they could open up and take out dozens maybe hundreds of hostages youre to stand down return to incident command and return your shooters to their original units and what happens if after its all done and the kaafi assholes are on their way to freedom and glory this motherfucker still opens up on the hostages only this time we have no way to get to them in minutes and they just kill and kill and kill while were blowing doors its not our decision mike its the colonels call and the consensus up and down the line is that its a good one medias gone nuts about him hes their guy hes the hero hes the winner thats the narrative suppose you go in set up underneath just in case and one of your people drops a fortyfive and it goes off and the bad guys panic and start blasting these are trained men nobody is going to drop a fortyfive plus fortyfives dont work like that plus we all carry glocks or sigs mike just bring it back okay well make a note of your objections thats the best i can do jefferson announced the decision to his allstar swat group and got from them what he had given to the other major disbelief anger a sense of something important slipping away if you let these guys get away with this somebody said its open season on america all over the world we have to fight them now and kill them now thats our responsibility are you suggesting a revolution said mike you want us to go rogue you realize what that means end of all careers for a start possible legal action because without formal authorization were just vigilantes im talking prosecution fines maybe prison time you want to do hard time after all the skells youve busted you wouldnt last three nights in the showers and your ass would get royally fucked before your throat was cut so that was it walk back to their units join the pullback make way for the buses hope that the colonel and all the heads on suits had made the right call and if they hadnt go in afterward and supervise the forensics and the janitorial tell you what said jefferson lets go real slow now obviously were not going in underground but some of you guys have doorbreaching rounds for your shotguns right there were a few yeses from the assembled crew of helmeted guys with mps ars and rem s okay ill play for time meanwhile i want you guys to chamber your breaching rounds if it goes down were only fifty yards from that set of doorshe gestured to an entryway boasting the name northeast where one townships swat people were withdrawingand we can get to the doors breach them fast and get into the fight maybe not in five seconds but maybe in one minute mike i have a better idea yeah the man explained then he said and its not quite a revolution more of a coup detat no said mike smiling its a coup de swat mcelroy had found him another target still on the second floor ray was rotating another corridor to the left moving down the outer ring toward hudson when he heard the sound of the shots he recoiled thought someone had seen him was shooting at him and rolled backward slipping the rifle off his back knowing he was behind the curve and would take one in the head soon but the shots were ragged not a volley more spontaneous and he realized that they were echoing down the hallways from the wideopen amusement park where the hostages were being held then he heard this other thing this animal thing he wasnt sure what it was some kind of crowd noise a hubbub a roar a vibration it communicated joy well excitement maybe relief it was of course the sound of a thousand people letting out their breaths involuntarily as if theyd just gotten the good news it was somehow the opposite of mass dread it was mass undread ray waited for it to die down he was puzzled but alert he settled back into his scuttling position ready to proceed waiting for some kind of cue to suggest a path a course a possibility and seeing none decided to continue on plan he moved ahead slowly his eyes scanning for motion nothing it was quiet ray rounded the corner under the window into a bright stilllit retail space called dsw shoe warehouse and peered down hudson to the atrium space this angle afforded him a closeup view of the log flume ride and the smell of chlorine from the heavily disinfected waterway reached his nostrils recalling the pool on the subic bay naval base of his childhood and the many summer days hed spent there he wondered absently what had happened to the installation since the navy closed it down then he got his war brain back excoriated himself for taking a little mental vacation in the middle of a combat zone and started to scoot ahead hoping hed reach the railing before whatever gunman was lounging there had gotten bored with his cigarette break and taken off but thenthe vibration of his phone always at the wrong time jesus christ dont call me goddammit molly but it wasnt molly sergeant this is mcelroy we just got the news were to stand down they reached some kind of agreement were going to pull back the hostages will be released as soon as the plane takes off what the hell are you talking about a deal a deal were sending some supposedly political somali prisoners back theyll let the hostages go fuck ray thought it went against everything he believed in if you dont stand up to them you embolden them you teach them that well quit and it only makes them hungrier and crazier and the killing goes on and on you fought wars to win or you didnt fight them at all do you hear me sergeant please acknowledge fuck said ray it means you too theyre very worried at incident command that some kind of accident or some guy not getting the word could queer the whole deal so you have to cease operating youd best pull into a store take the rest of the day off and well let this play out then well come and get you ray came a new voice memphis here listening in obobo thinks hes got it done you have to do what five is telling you let it cool suppose these guys dont play fair said ray ive had five tours fighting these guys and i know they can look you in the eye and give you total sincerity from the bottom of their hearts and be lying like a son of a bitch and to them lying to an infidel isnt a lie its a gesture of love for allah we have our order said mcelroy ray yours not to reason why et cetera et cetera it doesnt sit right with me either but are they choppering you guys out ray asked mcelroy nobodys said anything yet you have any demolition there of course not okay listen to me you have to have a contingency thats all im saying listen to him five said nick you have to be able to blow a hole in that window thats fine to say but you have to be able to blow a hole in that window you squad with the other snipers you figure out something just in case to get through that fucking window fast and start taking people down you may have just seconds to engage solve it yourself solve it now youre basically asking me to disobey orders sniper five said memphis in washington crisis you do what cruz tells you and if it comes to flak you give them my name and i will swing for it got that got it yes sir said mcelroy and you dont know anything about this webley if youre listening i never heard a thing sir said webley who had been listening now mcelroy get busy you have work to do ray put the phone away and tried to search out a retail outlet near the balcony where he could get into action if something happened but he sensed a presence turning his eyes met those of a jihadi gunman not three feet away the man stared at him quizzically and in the split second of stillness ray saw him trying to solve certain problems why he had to be wondering is this fellow here in our uniform why is he not somali who was he talking to and then he and ray leaped at each other dead santa atop his throne gazed with sightless eyes upon the mortal anguish his passing signified a woman on the other side of the crowd had also died of a heart attack there was a man near the tiltawhirl who was very very close to death he needed blood badly one of the babies had started to cry and would not shut up everywhere people were giving up or surrendering to bitterness and despair trying to sneak last phone calls to tell relatives how much they loved them worst of all the odors of colonic release filled the air generally it felt like the end of the world in the mass of hostages packed on the byways of the amusement park dwarfed by the skeletal struts of various thrill rides mocked by flappityflapping banners and signs for refreshments and insane christmas muzak from unstoppable speakers silent night holy night all is calm all is bright yadda yadda but mom had seen worlds end before and gotten through so she was not upset she held sally close to her she did not want sally looking around with her bright face and bright eyes she knew the childs charisma was like a beacon and that it attracted attention the wrong kind in her native language she prayed to buddha for deliverance but she also prayed for death to come to the filth that had engineered this thing everywhere she looked she saw bleakness and turmoil she continued to steal a handful of dirt into her bag every few minutes or so as yet unnoticed uncaught it was just about time for another load but then simultaneously two or three of the gun boys began to leap with what looked like joy and clap each other on the back then one pointed his rifle upward and jerked off a batch of shots while others pounded him raucously a whisper ran through the crowd and it came to and blew over mom and sally there must be an agreement well be getting out of here soon we just have to hold on a little longer mom didnt buy it not for a second shed seen boys like these before they loved their guns their power their uniforms too much they had too little wisdom or imagination theyd never felt responsibility they were just children really and even if someone was directing themno evidence except in the earphones that suggested a leader somewhere addressing them and giving orders and instructionsthey would behave like children pointlessly foolishly violent and cruel then a confirmation came someone with an iphone had managed to call up cnn which was reporting an agreement in the minnesota standoff this news flew through the crowd and was confirmed by other iphoners faster than the first news now the optimism was palpable the sense of relief oh it was so good mom allowed herself to half believe but her hard experience in the world still left her worried sally peeked up mom what is it she asked in hmong good news they say well be out of here in a bit some kind of deal has been made thank god said sally sally do not let yourself believe until it is true guard against feelings of gratitude and relief it may still be a long tragic day and you might still have to use all your skills to survive it suddenly a shadow crossed them both looked up the black man whod shot the hostages and whod bought sally as his bride stood there all insolence pride glee his weapon resting casually on his shoulder he smiled white teeth showing brightly then he knelt down i will have my wedding night he said when the time is right you will come to love me and possibly when you give yourself to maahir maahir will save you the martyrs are cheering because they know that the killing is near the young man turned to the imam so can you watch the shop for a while im sorry what do you oh nothings going to happen for a while theyll be driving the kaafi boys to the airport youll see and then therell be the tv drama of the boarding and takeoff and all the talking heads will check in and then well move up to another game level on them but meanwhile ive got a little something to check you can hang here ill be back in a second yes of course he reached under his console and took out a plastic bag that could only contain a gas mask or another head but it was a gas mask he pulled it on carefully making adjustments then he went to the console armed himself with the mouse dragged the cursor to security office and clicked the icon told him it was still remotely locked he ordered unlock then he rose snatched up an ak and left through the front door it was only a quarter rotation around and there was no pedestrian traffic a few windows had been broken a few carriages abandoned a few shoes lost it had an afterthezombieapocalypse feeling he kind of liked thank you george romero and all your clones he passed the big bright deserted realdeal that sold more tv sets than any other retail outlet in america saw more zombie ruin inside but still utter stillness as all the trapped shoppers would presume him a killer and quake in their hiding places and beyond that he came to the unmarked door that was the security office unlocked by computer fiat it yielded to his push admitting him to a tunnel that led to more heavy doors and they too opened cheerfully inside not pleasant six dead guys wrong place wrong time fellows the way of the universe he felt not a morsel of pity for them andthis was his gift or somethingcould not imagine them as men of families with lives relatives kids histories contributions they were just sort of repulsive in their twisted grotesqueness he walked to a device of some mystery mounted on a wall a small green bulb gleamed brightly oh they think theyre so smart oh they think theyve got it figured some boy genius of the fbi or the nsa or the cia working away hed managed to connect with the system thinking that satan had forgotten something too bad for him so it goes with the weak and virtuous he smashed the greenlit modem two times with his rifle butt the second driving the shattered plastic mechanism its guts of circuits and wires and smashed plastic hanging out to the floor he was doing what he had always dreamed of he was smashing the machine in its tangled ripped wiring in its shattered plastic in its broken solenoids he saw the future aint it cool two months earlier mr reilly was baffled the owneractually the ffl was still in his wifes name though shed died three months earlierof reillys sporting goods and surplus in far suburban nearly rural twin falls minnesota he stared at the two crates one quite large one quite small that rested on the ups mans freight dolly he bent saw the return address on the shipping label as wti laredo texas which he knew to be west texas imports his supplier for lowend eastbloc surplus military weapons which he sold to workingclass hunters and gun folks who couldnt afford a bigticket american deer rifle about a hundred mounted animals witnessed the somewhat confused transaction between the old fellow and the man in brown and most of them had horns though of course a few were badgers ducks even whimsically a groundhog noted for its sagacity and insight also on the cozy woodpaneled walls rifles rifles rifles most bolt guns a few ars a few shotguns in the fluorescentlit cabinets lay the handguns gleaming laid out neatly by someone who took the responsibility for display of merchandise and price the bedrock of retail seriously i just dont see why its such a big crate he said to wally the ups man mr reilly do you want to refuse it no big deal ill just dolly it back to the truck and well return it well said mr reilly still a little foggy lets ask andrew he turned and called andrew andrew andrew stepped from the stockroom he was a tall thin young man in his early twenties and he was the best thing that had come into mr reillys life since flora died he was punctual hardworking entirely trustworthy good with customers reliable and honest he had a shock of blond hair and a fair complexion he could have been any neighbors son and it was his compulsion toward tidiness that had turned the store into such a masterpiece of organization he doesnt understand why the wti crate is so big said wally mr reilly ill check it maybe its two or three orders in one you dont want to refuse it said wally no i guess not said mr reilly okay andrew yes sir ill run it down through the computer records they do make mistakes but i think we did have an outstanding order on chinese skses and maybe this is them or maybe its them plus a duplicate order wouldnt be the first time ill straighten it out and if its wrong you can pick it up tomorrow wally sure carefully wally ran his digital reader over the bar codes on each package label thus recording accurately and in perpetuity the fact that both packages had been delivered to their destination andrew hefted the handles of the dolly got it unmoored from the floor upon which it rested and wheeled it back into the stockroom he returned with the empty dolly and slid it over to wally who took control of it from him turned as mr reilly unlocked the door as it was well after closing time and returned to his brown van reilly waved goodbye then looked around his store part of a decaying strip mall that had been on the downhill since big boys like cabelas and midway usa put everything one click away youll get it straightened out andrew he asked absolutely it may take a while ive got to go through the records i may have to call them and i havent even begun to put the handguns in the safe oh ill do that no no said andrew i know youre tired ill take care of everything that pleased the old man there were over seventy handguns on display in the store and though it had never been robbed the old man wanted it never to be robbed which committed him or andrew to a half hours hard labor every night picking up the guns and carefully stowing them in the two big safes behind the counter then locking them tight the rifles he could leave on display the thieves were mostly black people from the city and they only wanted handguns okay andrew i think were due for an atf walkthrough anytime now and i dont want any trouble there was never any trouble with flora she kept the records so neatly its not my skill you know not my kind of mind id rather talk hunting with customers i dont know what id do without you its not a problem ill get to the bottom of this and by the time you get in tomorrow well be shipshape make sure to i know i know said andrew log the shipment into the atf bound book no worries andrew knew the atf regs forward and backward maybe better than flora if any gun spent twentyfour hours in a retail outlet it had to be accounted for in the big log book atf required which would show its arrival and ultimately its dispersal either via retail sale or rarely shipment back to wholesaler mr reilly you go on home ill run this through and if its a mistake ill relabel and ready for shipment back and wally can pick them up tomorrow thanks andrew dont know what id do without you it took the old man more than a few minutes to get himself together enough to leave since floras death hed become a ditherer hed start one thing get halfway through then move on to another in the end he had accomplished nothing except to half start a bunch of things that poor andrew would have to follow through on mr reilly knew he had this tendency and he was too reliant on andrew but hed never really come out of the fog that his wifes death had caused anyway in time he was set to leave and he yelled good night to andrew unlocked then relocked the door and got into his car and drove away wondering if he could still make the early bird rate at the walloon lake sizzler as soon as the old man left andrew used an xacto knife to slice the shipping pouch on the big crate and slid out the bill of lading he knew that it contained sixteen bulgarian aks from wti theyd arrived in the united states as surplus kit purchased by century arms of vermont centurys not particularly subtle armorers had replaced the full auto parts with americanmade semiauto parts which by regulation qualified them for us retail sale and somewhat haphazardly reassembled them usually they worked sometimes they didnt those guns were wholesaled to wti who overstamped them with their own emblem then repackaged them for entry in the great american gun ocean million and growing the smaller package contained two hundred of the orange chinese magazines held to be the best on the market nobody cared much about them and they went uncovered in atf regs andrew recorded each gun by serial number off the bill of lading as well as all other pertinent data then using the blade again he sliced the box end open skillfully careful not to make any jagged cuts or rip anything in haste he slid out the guns each of which arrived packed in a styrofoam box then sliced the tape on the boxes the guns lay inside along with a moldy leather strap a tenround aftermarket magazine a bayonet a brass oiler and a poorly translated manual the s were real cool hed seen them initially in the first edition of modern combat where merc force blue used them to take down a soviet missile silo in uzbek that had been commandeered by muslim terrorists in that game theyd worked well though of course the s fired a smaller round than the s an eastbloc variant on our own nato the cool thing about the modern combat series as opposed to medal of honor or black merx or commando ops was that the game took into account the muzzle energy of its weapons so when you smoked a muji on the it took more center of mass hits to put him down you had to make that adjustment just like in real life or he was the one that got the kill in any event the guns bore no surprises standard red design utilitarian untroubled by aesthetics uninterested in making a statement other than this machine exists to kill people with rough triggers and painted or baked enamel finishes it was a gun for small brown people with a smallish pistol grip and a shortish buttstock just the thing for little men trying to upset a big ussupported government the rifles purpose the world over the metal was pressedthat is stamped out crudelyor industrially bent to form by some huge clanky device in a hellish dismal steampunk factory next to a river of sludge in some perpetually smogshrouded eastbloc or chicom city its makers were all government workers paid in pennies by the national defense industry they went home to nothingness and squalor while the guns in the millions were shipped to hot spots under license to their original artisans in the then soviet union thats why the pieces were so crappy no gunmakers craft here as was evident in the older winchesters and remingtons in the old mans rifle racks next andrew filled each of the styrofoam boxes with scrap metal from decommissioned shopping carts hed bought with cash and smuggled into mr reillys store about six pounds in each box just an array of coaster wheels tubes gratings screws washers and bolts when the lids were retaped over the trays to form a whole the whole reinserted in the crate the crate carefully sealed by packing tape the result was a package equally the size and weight of the one that had arrived with the same shifty noisy density short of an xray exam no one could tell the difference between the first package and this one now he went to the store computer and printed out a west texas imports address label to patch over the reillys sporting goods label except that it contained carefully engineered errors the return zip code for reillys sporting goods and for west texas imports were both a number off the from west texas being where the from reillys should be and vice versa computer error obviously then the piece de resistance it was a ups next day air bar code selfadhesive and the key to the ups system it was fake carefully handmanufactured by the clever andrew in his lair in a minneapolis suburb no human eyes could read it but the computers would send the package to new mexico to a store that didnt exist on a street that didnt exist at that point the confused driver would use his optical reader on the bar code for the return address and send it on its way but its way was not back to mr reilly it went instead to another store that didnt exist on a street that didnt exist then it would go to the ups undeliverable warehouse in schenectady new york with thousands of other items a facility bound to become overloaded with misaddressed packages during the upcoming christmas shipping season as clerks struggled to keep up with and track each package either to its proper destination or back to its point of origin tomorrow he would log them out and record the transaction in the bound book for atf and in the notebook of shipping records that ups issued to all commercial customers the missing guns thought delivered to their destination by the sender and thought returned to their sender by mr reilly would go unnoticed for months no money was missing to alert any bean counters either as andrew stole about five thousand dollars a month from his wealthy father by equally intricate computer strategies and had financed the transaction out of that fund no need for ceremony or delicacy not with guns like this grabbing them five or six at a time like pieces of firewood andrew hauled them to the truck bed of his vehicle and dumped them in the magazines got the same rough treatment these babies were all designed for rough treatment thats what made them so perfect for what he had halffacetiously named operation mumbai after the pakistani murder mission in that hindu city that killed people andrew had a momentary lapse in his otherwise tightly focused attention he had nostalgia for mumbai almost as if he had been there with the kill team had stridden boldly down the great hotels corridors down the citys backstreets through its bazaars with his own ak and a satchelful of grenades everything that moved or breathed was a target it was a night of pure anarchy slouching to mumbai to be born in the hot spill of the empty brass from the hyperactive bolt of the gun in full auto mode from the pop of pressure when the sov grenades detonated from the scurrying figures in the darkness stilled forever when lanced by a fleet of hurtling into them andrew was a collector of apocalypses he loved those final moments of the fall when troy went up in flames when the red ts rolled through berlin at the head of an army of rapists and looters when the sepoys went crazed and put all the british women and children screaming helpless down the well at cawnpore why was this andrew could not tell you nor could his many expensive medical and psychological advisors perhaps it was some excess brain chemical perhaps hed walked in on his mother giving his father a blow job perhaps one of the bigger boys at school had smacked him in the mouth turning him forever into a hater or perhaps he was simply evil in the old testament sense after all as he had noted many times evil is fun it truly is he came back into the world as we know it and reacquired the self that he showed the world most of the timesteady handsome thorough creative obsequious he went back into reillys carefully put the seventy handguns into the safe swept the place out for the tenth timesome habits die hardmade sure everything was secure then armed the alarm stepped out the back door and pulled it shut and locked behind him he drove about thirty miles through the earlyfall minnesota night and at last turned off the highway to follow the signs to his destination a freakishly large building in the center of a vast plain of nowempty parking lots the sign read welcome to america the mall pm pm ray got off the x first leaping driving his crown into the mans nose feeling it crush flat and spew blood but where that would put most men out of the fight in an instant this tough little skinny simply took it took the pounding thrust of rays full body weight and went to the floor under him but upon hitting it hard he became a squirming dervish his small but leanly powerful muscles twisting desperately for leverage he was faster than ray who was faster than most he was clearly a guy whod done a lot of closequarter combat and somehow he found enough leverage to slip from underneath ray so that the bigger man couldnt use his weight as an advantage and the two knitted limbs and tried to break each others backs faces about an inch apart ray saw insane strength in the wide black pupils ignored the bloody snot and saliva that flew from the flattened nose and the rancid breath contained in the gaseous propulsive exhalations through the mouth and tried to get enough floor contact under him to move the guy back down to the submissive position but the bastard was too active ray had one of his arms by the wrist which also meant that the enemy had one of rays hands by the arm and the other arms were tangled like fighting snakes as each tried to find a path to the throat ray headbutted again hard but didnt have enough neck to get the torque to deliver a disabling strike and all he did was knock stars into both mens eyes then the guy got a leg free and kneed ray hard in the balls and as his breath was driven from his body sharply rays grip loosened and the guy snatched his arm free and got it to his bayonet and got that blade out before ray caught up and snatched the wrist again but now the blade was in play and both men in wrestling stalemate of enmeshed body on body put all their focus and strength into controlling the blade with the ultimate hope of driving it deep into the others body and piercing a bloodbearing organ but then ray formally trained in handtohand and the owner of six black belts in six disciplines yielded suddenly knowing that the mans strength would overextend him and when that happened he reasserted control now the somalis arm was straight and lacked space to set up for a plunge and ray bent it back back and back and thats when the guy managed to bite him hard in the ear the pain wasnt so bad as the surprise and the intimacy of it and ray lost concentration the man whod lost the knifehand battle came quickly to victory on the nonknife side snaking his arm through a brief hole in rays defense and getting his wrist crossways across rays throat he just had to press the windpipe closed and hold it so for three minutes and hed get the kill the fight sounded like six pigs in a pen built for three all grunting and yelping and gulping their lungs pumped inout the breath came and went like waves on a beach oxygen fuel of battle was as precious as gold and they sucked for it whenever possible in a medium lubricated by copious sweat outflow that slimed their pushing sliding musculature like some kind of battle grease not a conscious thought formed in either mind it was just instinct for the geometry of bodies strength will and survival ray risked his leverage contact with the floor and with one leg pried loose he got an anklewrap around his enemys leg and began to torque it hard perhaps to loosen the body from the clamp it had on ray it seemed to be working too but then the guy did an incredibly creative thing he dropped the knife and ray took the bait releasing the arm to grope for the knife and the tough somali shot his hand through the opening and clenched rays throat with his thumb driving into rays larynx ray blinked some bloody snot rained into his face and suddenly the guy quick as a snake regripped his left wrist pulling it from the neck then plunging back in supertime to wrap that wrist around rays windpipe rising enough for enough play to get his arm strength factored into the equation and then had both thumbs on rays adams apple and was driving in ray could only force him to an upward posture so that he couldnt get the fullness of his power into the dynamic but now really it was a matter of time for hed cut rays oxygen intake by a good percent ray tried to get his arm inside the vise closing down on his throat but his opponent half collapsed and there was no space to penetrate even if it meant the somali had to reset his hand just slightly pulling it to the right so that one pressing thumb moved on top of the other one ray knucklestruck him in the ear hard feeling tissue rip and more blood spurt but the little man was too close to victory to let the strike throw him off and his eyes mad with the killing lust he drove his thumbs ray had just the most fleeting impression of something flying horizontally through the air and whatever it was it hit his wouldbe killer in the temple with the force of a heavyweights punch sending a resonant cracking breaking sound into the atmosphere and the somali went semilimp for a second relinquishing his control his hands flying involuntarily to protect his head as fear fought the unconsciousness that threatened to overwhelm him from the power of the blow somehow ray found the bayonet and at the same time did a power roll and in a moment achieved position on top of the squirming man his other hand suffocated any screams in the throat and he fingered the bayonet into a grip strong enough for thrusting then brought it back and shoved it forward he felt it penetrate and open the softer flesh between the ribs slide off of deep interior objects then sink pointfirst in something fibrous ray withdrew placing more strength on the man through the wrist clamp getting more leverage as he rose to his knees and drove again and again the guy bucked through spasms fighting it his eyes cueballing his tongue writhing like a dying snake until at last supersoaked in blood he went limp ray rolled off him feeling close enough to death himself he lay flat on his back sucking for oxygen at the effort hed spent and it seemed hed drained the mall of all of it but then it flooded into his lungs bringing coolness and clarity he sucked hard through three or four strong breaths felt his limbs tremble with salvation at having survived the ordeal noticed how much blood he now wore on his jeans and looked up into the eyes of his savior it was the black girl lasomething he couldnt remember lamelba lavioletta laviva lavelva jesus christ you got here just in time i clonked his ass with a eight iron she said holding up the nowbent club i hope they aint mad i busted it when this is over i will buy you a bagful of clubs sweetie he said now lets get out of here renfro called a press conference fast and still had to wait a few minutes for the network cams to set up colonel obobo flanked by the governor and all his majors except for jefferson took to the podium nodded to a few friendly reporters pivoting this way and that to accommodate the flash cameras of the print guys then turned on the microphone renfro hoped he wouldnt overdo the ididthis ididthat shit but then he always did i am happy to report that i have achieved success he said i am happy to announce an end to the killing and the dying i have been in discussion with a man calling himself the commanding general of brigade mumbaia reference to the terrorist attack on mumbai india in and i have negotiated an end to the standoff he has made certain policy demands to which the state has acceded when those demands have been met he will release his over one thousand hostages and we will retake possession of the mall he left out any information about the mans threat to have a nice little gunfight after the civilians were out of there he didnt want some orgy of recriminations and doubts exploding before his assault teams had even fired a shot the press reacted to this news with muted glee yes it was satisfactory yes it was wonderful yes this and yes that but of course a narrative had been set up and a primal tradition evoked evil had attacked from nowhere and spilled blood it must be punished in blood too many movies demanded a big climax without any man admitting it the press as well as the millions worldwide who watched were subtly disappointed they wanted a gun battle at america the mall not obobo he saw this as another triumph of his theories of progressive law enforcement evidence that if you treated even the most jaded of perps with respect and a view toward their common humanity then great things could be achieved what concessions were made shouted a dozen voices for the time being that information is classified you will be informed when the time is right meanwhile i want to say that the first responders of minnesota handled this unprecedented crisis with suppose theyre lying suppose they just want to kill people but first extracted massive concessions out of i personally the colonel said handled these negotiations i listened carefully to this mans voice and i believe i made human contact with him and despite the gulf in our cultural systems and political beliefs we both understood that the killing had to stop i am extremely proud of the progress that was made here today thank you ladies and gentlemen as he stepped away renfro collared individual reporters with unattributed stories actually the line went you should report that the oldline cops wanted to go in guns blazing but colonel obobo had the guts to stand up to them he himself worked the phone with this guy and he himself got us out of this jam that should be your angle finally a payoff the bureau tasked atf to start checking wholesalers for unusually large shipments of surplus russian or eastbloc ak rifles or ammunition preferably the grain russian s bullet to the minneapolissaint paul area and atf operators got on the phone to wholesalers the nation over in less than an hour reillys sporting goods twin falls minnesota came up which according to west texas imports had been steadily receiving a twocase cratetwo thousand roundsa month for six months moreover wti had shipped them sixteen of the rifles rebuilt from kits by century arms just a few months ago atf agents from minneapolis got out to reillys house fast under siren and rousted the old man from his afternoon nap it was another ten minutes before the team brought him to the store and he opened the building which was alarmed to ul level protection he checked his records no no he had no ak kit guns on hand though he did remember an accidental shipment weeks earlier that was never opened and returned which is why it had been logged out of the big book beneath the line in which it had been logged in possibly it contained aks you see the mm bullet isnt big enough for a deer which is why he had no interest in it now the sks an earliergeneration eastbloc assault rifle with a tenround magazine it fired a caliber bullet about the same power range as a so that agents backchecked with wti and discovered that they had never received the return and still held the wholesale money they had assumed mr reilly had taken the shipment moreover the guns were aks they confirmed ups was alerted and yes they had a record of a pickup that particular day but none of a delivery that meant it was probably in their undeliverable warehouse which would mean some heavy recordsearching one agent got the idea to track the ammo mr reilly opened the storeroom and discovered that he only had one tin of the surplus stuff left going to his computerized records he went through his wholesale expenses and saw that the store had a steady order for a double crate roundsof russian combat ammo for six months only one tin of it was in the storeroom which meant that eleven tins were not there and he couldnt believe that hed sold that much of it in six months he himself had never sold a box of it just as hed never sold anyone an ak because he specialized in hunting rifles not guerrilla raid and assault weapons he was baffled a little hurt and in the dumps to begin with because his superb clerk andrew had left a week ago sadly and he knew he didnt have the focus anymore to run a retail business especially now that the atf rules had gotten so complicated and what was the name of the clerk someone wanted to know his name was andrew nicks college boy very decent hard worker he was a fine boy mr reilly went to look for andrews address could andrew be in trouble ray dragged the dead terrorist to the nearest store the mocha spectrum chocolate shop and stuffed him inside a blood trail led to his body but that couldnt be helped now he stripped him of combat gear and handed the rifle and the magazine bandolier to his new partner then he gestured and she followed and they made their way down the corridor and dipped into a place called pandora jewelry and both collapsed thanks ray finally said its okay said lavelva still wearing her name tag i couldnt just sit up there during all this with all them ladies yakyakyakyak lord how they talk i had to get out of there like to give me a headache who are these guys what do they want it seems to be some islamic paramilitary unit possibly connected to somalia by the looks of these guys theres a lot of somalis in the twin cities right you got that right too many you ask me i dont know whos controlling them somebody smart whos taken over the mall security system from the inside theyve got a thousand hostages down in the amusement park area theyve already executed five and theyre threatening to kill more theyve made demands and as i understand it weve acceded to them my last order was to stay still and wait for it to be over nobody told the boy fixing to choke you no he didnt get the bulletin okay lets just cool it here and see what happens ive got a phone link to an fbi sniper on the roof if they need anything theyll call us you know what she said this was my first day i cant lose this job i ripped up a notebook you know to get a piece of metal that i used on that first guy am i going to get in trouble so far ray said i think youre doing swell fuck thats the way it goes its there then its not special agent neal had navigated the scada diagram and was dragging toward the security functions block to call it up and open the doors and nothing zip nothing nada zero the dead blank of unviolated cyberspace what happened yelled benson the crammedin audience ignited hoots squeals of anguish a chorus of profanity even luscious holly burbridge winced goddamn he knew said neal what well thats a very frail way in its not permanently hardwired its not wireless its old tech like science fiction rocket ships with clusters of cords everywhere its not in space cyber or otherwise its there in a gadget a magic box something that looks like a climate control gizmo on a wall its not covert so whack he sees it lit up he smashes it to bits and were totally fucked nobody said a thing finally neal said dr benson youre the boss cant you say anything inspiring no said dr benson so since this went nowhere said neal do you kids want to put on a musical jeff how can you be so good at pulling perverts out of the woodwork and so goddamned bad at this because perverts are idiots and this sonovabitch is super smart or lucky smart makes luck dumb makes bad luck too bad hes not taking pictures of fouryearolds in okay okay okay the okays tumbled out of his subconscious like a fluid from a broken bottle but they did not signify breakage so much as connectivity he thought he had he maybe had there was something it was so vague it was just beyond knowing he had it it skittered away he what just a minute let me think something through one month earlier the imam watched his two daughters play in the twilight of an earlyfall minnesota night it was sixty degrees and clear the air tranquil the stars beginning to show in the glow under the elms which had begun to go redorangebrown as they dried the girls sari and ami were bright lively beautiful children full of gaiety and mischief they were easy laughers as if much in the world merited delight and now they rode the swings in the twentythird street park first sari pushing ami and then ami pushing sari dont push too hard the imam called to sari he was afraid that the older childs energy and enthusiasm would catapult the younger from the seat and off she would sail into space it was an image that came to him in dreams sometimes his children falling he would waken in the dark drenched in sweat then go check no the girls were all right he saw a figure slide onto the bench beside him but didnt turn to look through his peripheral vision he saw this fellowyoung mantake out a paperback of a huge novel called crime and punishment open the dogeared copy to a certain page and pretend to read you are late the imam said not really said the young man not looking up the fbi was on you on the way here it was only one agent and he didnt have listening gear and he didnt stay long i think it was just a random checkup now hes gone i followed him to the expressway to make certain then doubled back ah said the imam so we are secure unless youre a double agent then yes we are secure how was your trip it went well i connected with general aweys he selected twelve of his youngest fighters as you requested they are unsophisticated in western ways uncontaminated by the internet they barely know how to operate cell phones good one of them maahir is a bit older more jaded he is what you might call a sergeant he is the commander such as it is good he can kill santa claus hell obey me right i dont want attitude hes not going to give me shit when i give the orders i have spoken to him he is the instrument of your will as you are the instrument of allahs will we will have to have a theological debate in hell as to whose will im obeying it is a tragedy that you have no belief not in the faith or any faith or any system that seeks to impose order you love only death and you live only to destroy a fine young man like you and allah has selected you for this task and brought you to me and together atheist and holy man we will strike such a blow avenge the great tragically fallen osama then i will go to paradise brother and i will be the first to greet you as im certain allah will grant you provisional entrance its actually not true that i have no faith said the young man i worship at the church of saint joan jett i love rock and roll its my deity now give me the details through a brother who runs a somali relief charity in toronto i have brought the menthe jihadisin by groups of three and four they have been granted temporary canadian visas and are staying in the relief organizations dormitory in the suburbs of toronto they have their instructions do not mingle with the others do not talk to anybody do not talk to infidels obey all rules of the facility be a humble leaf floating with the current but on the day of days they will be ready all have seen battle all have fought with hizbul islam in battles and operations in wabra and mogadishu in please i tried to understand the somali civil war from wikipedia it was like reading herodotus in chinese always the comedy even if i dont understand it all have lost brothers sisters parents all are hard and bitter and can do the necessary without flinching my kind of folks said the young man when the week arrives all will be driven to the busy border crossing at niagara falls and cross over secretly hidden in a truck which makes regular passage over the border owned by another believer who owns a carpet company i myself will drive them from albany across america to the safe house here where they will rest for a few days are you sure you dont want to bring them to the mall one or two at a time and let them get a feel for what they are doing sorry no one of them would fall in love with a somali girl selling videos or waitressing in a coffee shop or collecting parking fees and his mind wouldnt be on his work and hed fuck it up somehow hed find a way to fuck it up they have been promised jihad the slaughter of infidels and a ride to paradise i will make good on those promises but they must obey operation discipline until the fun begins thats the basic ruleno comedy here or we will be penetrated and destroyed i shouldnt have to tell you again do you need more money the imam was a little guilty about the money he had used some of it to purchase the services of a prostitute twice in somalia and to buy some extremely profane pornographic dvds and to take his girls to chuck e cheeses which they loved he still had over six hundred dollars left but he couldnt turn it down well he said one can always use cash no feasts no last suppers with the little lambs anything anything you do out of the ordinary might alert the feds so far they dont seem to be onto anything but were so close now id hate to see this thing fall apart and spend the rest of my life getting reamed three times a day in prison for nothing i understand i obey i am thankful good then thats it there is one other thing okay what death my favorite thing in any color whose are we talking about yours and mine it will come when it will come it is nothing in exchange for larger goals im not particularly afraid yes but have you no one youd like to see again only to laugh in their faces but consider the possibility of escape there is no possibility but if there was hmm said the boy it so happens that i have a follower who has a brother this brother was a helicopter pilot in the moroccan air force he got involved in radical politics he was arrested tortured imprisoned he escaped he managed to end up in canada interesting hes quite a good pilot he now works for an agricultural dusting firm he sprays poisons on weeds he kills things what a great job now i am thinking on that day the air will be full of helicopters police and military but mostly from the news organizations itll be a chopper hullabaloo no doubt about it suppose it were arranged and he continued with his plan pm pm it surprised no one that the house was so nice it was set back from the road by a driveway possibly one hundred feet in length and stood shaded by trees with all kinds of flourishes like porches and gables and a threecar garage it was in one of those posh milliondollar developments to the north of minneapolis among houses of equal or more value the whole gated neighborhood itself protected from the rigors of actuality by a uniformed patrol three cars of agents pulled up and bill simon acting on behalf of saic kemp took the lead he had the warrant number though no actual paper representation as the warrant had been arranged on the fly on the drive from downtown headquarters he knocked and a man in his late fifties with an ample head of gray hair teased attractively about his head and a scotch glass in his hand answered simon noted emblems of upperboho gentility running shoes tightfitting jeans a lush scottish heather turtleneck over a healthclub disciplined body wirerim glasses over the mans left shoulder lurked his wife maybe the trophy edition for she looked a decade younger a handsome woman with an adorable mess of tawny blond hair also in jeansgreat tight bodand an oxford buttondown shirt she held a glass of wine mr nicks jason nicks yes sir said nicks who thought he knew exactly what was going on youre fbi right here about andrew you have some news we havent heard from him and ive tried the store a hundred times im so worried yes sir said simon actually yes we are fbi and yes this is about your son and yes we know he manages one of your stores in the mall but were here to serve a search warrant what said jason nicks sir theres some suspicion that your son is involved with the gunmen whove taken over the mall he was definitely involved in procuring the arms and ammunition theyre using i have a number for a federal warrant thats been issued by the fourth circuit us judge raphael to search his house you can check if you want by looking up the warrant number on the internet oh christ said jason nicks stepping back to admit them simon himself ran the interrogation while the forensics and evidence collection team went downstairs where andrew lived as simon addressed the parents they all could hear the cracks as the agents used tactical entry battering rams to knock down the locked door does andrew need a lawyer asked nicks possibly sir do you want to make a call we are in a hurry as you might imagine but at the same time i want your son to have the full protection of the law no no go ahead in the background nbc was reporting that the van had arrived from the penitentiary and that the prisoners would file aboard the airplanes within a few minutes im looking at his record now said simon andrew has had some difficulties i see hes been a hard kid to have around yes said the father so bright so angry ive spent a lot of money on lawyers just trying to keep him out of jail hes my only child what could i do yes sir just scanning here i see some drug busts i see that he has been kicked out of three private schools and just barely managed to graduate from the fourth hes got a geniuslevel iq somehow he got into harvard i made a very large donation to the school and that may have had something to do with it but he was certainly smart enough he just wasnt mature enough he didnt stay long less than a year a very unfortunate year im afraid he let himself get angry he sent some unwise emails to people he didnt invent facebook because someone else had already he got lost in writing code hacking designing games stopped going to class ultimately returned to his drugs and his music and his trendy nihilism you know the profile love of destruction heavy metal a fantasy life full of violence i dont know whats wrong with that kid we gave him everything we supported him through it all hes been in psychotherapy since he was twelve hes been in every program you could imagine taken every antidepressant every add drug ritalin by the long ton it works sometimes for a while but he always regresses rock and roll computers violent nihilistic fantasies anger at i suppose at me i made a lot of money big mistake youre an entrepreneur i have a gift for retail jason said i just surf the zeitgeist looking for opportunities im not steve jobs or bill gates believe me just a storefront guy i had hippie clothing stores in the seventies running shoes in the eighties computers in the nineties now computer games thats the cool stuff theres some other stuff too not so cool i own several fastfood franchises the better part of three local strip malls a complete mall in kansas a restaurant and three motels in the wisconsin dells three sheetzes along ininetytwo i own the first person shooter shops do you know what they are im afraid i dont shooting games in cyberspace andrew grew up with them hes probably one of the best in the world when it comes to fighting with your thumbs on a playstation my flagship store is at the mall two years ago i asked andrew to manage it and for the first time in his life he applied himself hes run it very well and thats where he is now yes and every day are you aware that for six months he had a job in a sporting goods store in twin rivers what thats not andrew he used the stores ffl to acquire sixteen assault rifles sixteen surplus german pistols and over ten thousand rounds of ammunition an agent entered the room bill he said you ought to come see this everybodys so happy said mr girardi they say its almost over they stood essentially nowhere theyd been exiled from the press area and there seemed to be little point in going back to the red cross area especially as it would be buckling down to receive the seriously wounded they were more or less in between those two stations about three hundred yards from the bulk of america the mall which was a hub of activity still surrounded by cops with their lights flashing a few minutes ago buses had begun to assemble not at the mall per se but a few hundred yards off to the right so that when given the signal they could progress to the entrances and load up on freed hostages who would then be taken to triage stations and then to other destinations the whole thing was immensely complicated and it seemed everywhere they looked they saw vehicles and scurrying men it was cold now near forty degrees and the woman shivered i dont think we should get any closer theyll try and stop us she said well just stay here itll only be a little while longer im sure you see said colonel obobo to his friend david banjax of the new york times as they sat on folding chairs outside america the mall with mr renfro hovering over obobos shoulder behind them the buses to transport the freed hostages pulled into position im of the belief that we in law enforcement shouldnt be bullies or tough guys or sucker punchers ive believed that since i walked a beat in boston all those years ago banjax knew the colonel had walked the beat in boston for less than three weeks before being snatched up to more glamorous duty as befit his spectacular personage but he wrote it down anyhow while his tape recorder purred away even though obobo had used the same line when hed interviewed him before for the magazine ive always thought of force as the least and last part of law enforcements job rather guidance advice steady presence absolute fealty to the letter of the law but also patience and compassion and discipline all of it driven forward by a commitment to diversity no one should look at a policeman and feel fear thats the law enforcement i hope i embody and i hope i represent sir said banjax im hearing that there were elements in your command who wanted to go in guns blazing is that right we discussed many ideas david many possibilities but sometimes courage comes in doing nothing sometimes it comes in not applying pressure and in letting the alleged perpetrators understand the absurdity of the situation theyve engineered and letting them see that the sensible solution saves lives rather than takes them most people arent killers most people are simply trying to make themselves heard to have a selfhood an identity whatever you want to call it and once that is permitted it defuses the situation im sure these folks consider their cause right and just and whos to say really that it isnt theres room here on earth for different ideas thats why we treasure diversity as a value and ive tried to increase it wherever ive been and wherever i may go well said sir if i may but speaking of wherever you may go is it true that youre in consideration to become director of the federal bureau of investigation the successful closure of this emergency certainly cant hurt that well well let the future take care of itself david it will be what it will be yes it would be a great challenge to be in charge of the fbi and to see my ideas applied on a national scale but mr renfro leaned in i hate to break this up but were receiving word the kaafi brothers have arrived at the airport and been trucked to the plane doug we have to make you available to tv now the colonel and banjax turned a monitor had been set up and indeed the screen showed the three prisoners still in their orange jumpsuits all twitchy and excited climbing up the steps to the giant airliner one by one you should be proud to see that said banjax i am off the record i had people who wanted to explode bombs underneath the floor and go in shooting jesus christ can you imagine the carnage for what to save three measly bank robbers whod be out in a few years anyway wed never be at this moment no and wed have to send out for more body bags i dont think there are enough in minnesota for something like that simon walked through the shattered door into andrew nickss large paneled bedroom on the bottom floor of his fathers mansion the first thing he saw were posters from a group calling itself megakill on the walls jagged images of rockers made up as the angels of armageddon with crazed screwball makeup long black nails coils of hair to the shoulders lips red as blood electric instruments like weapons faces contorted into the pagan killing mask like conan on a good day outside the walls of some doomed hyborian citystate other pix smiling shots of dylan and eric of columbine fame a solemn loner named seunghui cho of virginia tech the great charles manson charles whitman a strange guy with haunted eyes and a bushy s haircut even two little squirts in period outfits he recognized finally as bonnie and clyde all screwball shooters little men with big guns artists of destruction and mayhem then the guy in the haircut clarified for him as he realized it was howard unruh whod taken a luger for a walk in murdering thirteen first of the bigkill maniacs then he saw the elaborate computer setup and an agent had called up memtac which simon knew to be the software package that controlled america the malls security system an immensely detailed and possibly impenetrable flowchart seemed to be on display on a table across from the unmade bed were stacks of blueprints all of them from oakland engineering and architectural one of the firms that had constructed the mall in on many of them red pencil lines tracked pathways corridors stairways choke points areas in square footage the bookshelf held a variety of textsclassic revolutionary strategy by mao debray guevara and trotsky to say nothing of sun tzu and machiavelli dave cullens columbine a variety of us army and marine corps insurgency and counterinsurgency manuals sniper guides improvised explosive handbooks psywar op pamphlets ambush tactics and mantracking guides from various survivalist or radical publishers mentally he was getting ready for war said someone mentally he was nuts someone else said oh god somebody said look at this he held up a batch of newspaper clippings on a reverend reed hobart of a church of the redeemer in some outlying community who had been famously demonstrating at downtown mosques with a group of his followers but then had suddenly vanished without a trace maybe andrew made the reverend mr reed go byebye said someone okay said simon i think that pretty much tears it ill call kemp and meanwhile lets get this stuff photoed tagged and removed itll all have to be looked at whats in the closet i wonder another agent said and opened the door the detonation represented itself even before it was a blade of light as a wall of immense energy that stopped time for a split second and in the next everybody in the room had been blown back until they hit something that stopped them the noise was stupendous and shards of wood flying viciously through the air opened a hundred or so wounds in the men and women so blasted simon who had been deeper in the room at the time of the blast and thus missed its killing force found himself the new owner of three broken ribs he fought the terrible suppurating lassitude that leadened his limbs and tried to shut down his brain he blinked exhaled a plume of acrid air looked about and through the smoke that hung everywhere in the room noted a young agent against another wall so still he had to be dead and grew angry at himself that he could not remember the young mans name just now he tried to pull himself up get himself together take charge make a report get medical and atf bomb people out here all at once then he saw through the fog the boys father standing in the doorway oh god andrew he was screaming what have you done tick tock tick tock jeff neal thought he looked around saw the eyes of all the leanersin boring in at him but he was trying to put pieces together somehow perverts and mall and and what he thought he had an idea an inspiration a possibility a sorry i thought i had something i didnt well said dr benson i guess you ought to just run penetration programs on it again and just maybe okay okay okay said neal suddenly again very fast stay with me on this we track pervs right that seems to be the consensus someone said now i do have a california guy in my crosshairs his name is bruce wyatt thirtyfour ive been all over his hard drive kids dressed as cowboys you dont want to know more okay okay he works i think at a realdeal in sacramento so im going to get on his drive search for links hes computersavvy sort of so hes got a link to realdeal corporate so from him i can get into realdeal corporate i get into that their main setup not the bullshit public website i get into their guts where all their maintenance and security and financial programs are and maybe theres a link to each branch even if its only email so maybe i somehow figure out which of the fifty or so branches jeff theres probably over five hundred of them so i get into their operating system and from there i get to the system here at this mall at their big fourthfloor store and maybe depending on who built it and how much money they spent maybe maybe maybe theres some kind of undocumented portal from it into the bigger scada thing and i can get in through that and i can take it down that way go for it said dr benson so we wait till its all clear asked lavelva oates then we come out is that what theyre saying thats what theyre saying its over the bad guys won hostages for prisoners the prisoners go then the hostages go what happens then i dont know ray said well let the geniuses figure it out it aint right said lavelva it aint right all those people dead and messed up and they git what they want but do you kill a thousand innocent to punish fifteen or so bad i dont know the answer but i thought the point of all these special police units was to set it up so you could kill the fifteen without the thousand but it didnt seem to work out here today did it no it didnt the one that was choking on me you punished him but good so theres a little justice here today and youre the one who brought it and you should be proud of yourself for the rest of your life for that one it still aint right she said disturbed they sat behind the rear counter of a store called perfumaria amid odors so sweet they had a gaggy quality to them cruz felt like throwing up but he had his orders and he would sit tight and make explanations later there was no percentage in any other line of action the vibrator on his phone buzzed he fished it out of his pocket slid the bar to answer it was all of them mcelroy but also webley and from far away nick memphis memphis did the talking where are you cruz in a perfume store still on the second floor we killed one more bad guy but i dont think anybodys caught on to that okay we have an id on the big man a kid actually twentytwo he manages a store in the mall called first person shooter he ordered the weapons through a dodge hes got the computer chops and maybe hes trying to do columbine on steroids so its just some little fuck he would have access to the mall hed know all security arrangements all the corridors and tunnels and he has a record of disturbing behavior from drug arrests to internet harassment to arson always quashed by dads money hes been under a psychiatrists care for years and it was thought he was getting better guess not said ray youre the only asset we have in the mall what we need you to do ray is find a way to the fourth floor and to the rio grande corridor this first person shooter is there rio grande its where his headquarters would have to be we think where hes got this thing wired when you get there you set up outside if everything goes well we may not need you if it goes bad you may have to bust in there and cap him and whoever else is there fast sorry i cant get you body armor or anything i suppose you dont even have to go if you dont want but on the other hand if any man in america would go on this one it would be you yeah me he thought i warrior i hero i marine i sniper cruz are you okay asked memphis im on my way said ray look said memphis i get it you thought you were out of it and it followed you home and its still trying to kill you you have a beautiful fiancee and a thousand job opportunities and its all looking swell and then these guys come along with their little thing im sorry but thats the way it is stay away from the wword cruz told himself there is no why in this world there is only is that is what has to be done next and this has to be done next his father would do it without a second thought and if he got killed in the very last seconds he would not die tainted by bitterness there is no why there is only is cruz are you okay on this one its past my nap time he said but i think i have one more day without a nap in me cruz when this is over ill buy you a mattress store and you can nap all day long ill take you up on that cruz said wearily he rose dont know where youre going said lavelva but im going too some things hadnt worked out for one the gun cameras now and then as in the execution footage they yielded something very interesting but mostly they just tracked the random imagery that the muzzles covered as the gunmen haphazardly wielded them at a speed that increased the abstraction to near totality and the information to almost nothing rather quickly andrew had ceased paying attention to them they were like lava lamps mounted on the wall nice if youre high and feeling kinda groovy otherwise useless he sat in his command chair in the back room of first person shooter before a wall of such imagery on the other wall more important to monitor were all the image feeds from the security cameras they at least communicated security responses to his event he could see in the exterior exit cameras for example that the murky blackclad ninjas known as swat teams had pulled back or at least out of the picture and that at each entrance a line of buses had pulled up according to andrews instructions each bus driver had opened his doors and left his bus and now stood in front of it arms held upward and without jacket to display his unarmed status hohum another day at the office it was all going swell the big board which had the hacked scada pictorial of the memtac security program showed nothing everything that was supposed to be locked down was still locked down everything that wasnt wasnt what is going on with number six asked the imam i dont he is still he is on the ground what is wrong with him andrew looked back to number six on the gun camera wall it took him a while to make any sense of it but then he realized it was an inverted image and twisting his head to find the proper orientation he saw that it was a floorlevel observation of nothing that is to say not ceiling not hallway nothing containing data but rather what upon concentration appeared to be the lower foot or so of wall beneath the window of a retail outlet on a level with the floor the gun is on the floor andrew said like the kid just dumped it and went and got himself some ice cream or maybe the camera fell off in some roughhouse and it landed on the floor sideways he wouldnt notice it he didnt even know it was there or someone killed him left the gun on the floor and its just lying there showing nothing call him said andrew the imam spoke in somali number six hanad are you there hanad has anybody seen hanad the imam listened to the return messages and then reported hanad went up on the second floor with feysal which one was he number eight he looked at number eight hmm it seemed okay just more blur and dazzle as the muzzle bounced about pulling the camera with it asad where is asad asked the imam i sent him to get the babies an hour or so ago where is asad asad was number three they both looked at that image and for a second it seemed to show nothing much just the same blur and dazzle but then it stabilized it seemed to show a door then it went up to the ceiling and a mans hand reached around from the left and both the imam and andrew watched as something large and irregularly shaped was crushed over the muzzle until it was held secure andrew almost laughed it looked like a potato then the muzzle was lowered and it reacquired the door settling just over the computercontrolled lock the muzzle leaped the irregular objectit was a potato dissolved in a blast of mist and the doorjamb was blown out of the door frame freeing the lock bolt hmm interesting the shooter had known not to fire into the lock itselfunbudgeablebut into the door frame which was wooden and vulnerable to highvelocity energy this fellowwas he a professional it was like the moment when dirty harry leaps onto the school bus roof from the rail trestle driving scorpio nuts on the monitor the muzzle dropped to the floor displaying a pair of new balance crosstrainers and andrew was aware that the owner had just moved through the door he had shot open and begun to climb some steps it suddenly made sense somebody in the mall was hunting his people some vigilante had killed asad silently gotten the rifle and then improvised a suppressor from the potatothat was straight out of marine field manual mc fieldexpedient suppression techniques now that person had shot his way into one of the locked stairwells and was headed upstairs that is upstairs toward him andrew was it bronson the young eastwood bruce willis or was it some clumping cheese eater who had disobeyed the malls privately imposed law and brought a carry piece inside and now waged war no he knew how to blow the lock he was a professional maybe delta maybe seal maybe some real good fbi hrt guy he hadnt counted on that but at the same time instead of being scared he was exhilarated this is really interesting oh this will be so cool in the final document every story needs a tragic hero this guy would be it this would also give the story another narrative strand to twist in and out it revved him way up he realized he must have in his voluminous recording stick the actual moment when the mystery man took out asad and feysal and hanad and whoever else hed taken out he also realized that the hunter was now carrying the rifle not having yet figured out that it was cameraequipped he went to his software screen found the elevator on switch on the menu and turned the elevators back on tell maahir to send two guys up to the fourth floor by elevator and set up in a storefront across from us theyll be getting visitors soon oh he continued this is going to look so cool in the game there it is said renfro thats it thats the ball game he and the colonel stood in the command trailer watching the network feed from nbc it showed the three kaafi boys bounding up the stairs into the air saudi plane joy pulsed through their limbs and loins three young men who two hours ago faced ten years of incarceration in an antiseptic dreary western prison now able to dream and plan and feel freedom and anticipate the softness of a womans flesh the awareness of allahs approval the congratulations of imams and mullahs and eventually another chance to strike and bring death to the infidel beast and vengeance for the murder of the holy warrior you did it said mr renfro you did it said the colonel we both did it said mr renfro and now look out world here we come itll only be another half hour before they clear airspace and theyre home free our people would never shoot them down and the saudi pilots would never obey orders to turn back the hostages will be freed the kaafi brothers will be in yemen and shortly mogadishu and i think ill let the mopping up devolve to my good friend mike jefferson who likes the bangbang stuff so much he can go in and have his little gun battle with the bad guys theyll all be punished that way my hands are clean and as you say look out world here we come colonel you have a oneonone now with abc its the only major you havent hit yet oh and fox my good friends at fox said the colonel even they will kowtow to the colonel on this day okay lets but like a bad dream someone stood between him and the doorway beyond which lay the abc team with its lights and camera and love it was the fbi hotshot will kemp i thought he was off running the investigation the colonel muttered to mr renfro but as kemp drew within hearing distance he blossomed into his wise cool public personality and said will your people were unbelievably fast and proficient on the andrew nicks id really and thats such a help once we get those citizens out of there and go in and take the little bastard down thank you sir said kemp ill be sure to tell the director how well you and your team operated and under what great pressure im sure hell be pleased and im sure youll be pleased yes sir said kemp but if youll forgive i want to discuss something else will im on my way to a media thing unpleasant but unfortunately it goes with the territory yes sir but just let me express myself quickly if i may sure will shoot but please make it snappy sir im wondering if it was wise to pull the swat people so far back equally im worried that it was unwise to give these people in the mall so much operational freedom i mean they start shooting hostages were a good five to six minutes away from confronting them with force and they could do a great deal of killing in that time our intelligence says they have at least ten thousand rounds of ammunition in there and sixteen fastfiring assault weapons will you know that troubles me too troubles me immensely in fact but the truth is you have to take some risks in operations i decided to take this one i think the muslims will be content with their propaganda victory hollow though it is i mean these are basically thirteenthcentury minds were dealing with and theyre easily distracted the glory that awaits them in this life the chance to be heroes to their coreligionists thats too much for them to give up on sir its not them im worried about its this goddamned white kid with his crazy nihilism and bloodlust his love for eric harris and seunghui cho he could do anything anything id feel so much better if we had a sniper put a bullet in his head will your concern is well placed and admirable but by now if we move swat back into place and authorize the rooftop snipers to get through the glass im worried that well set him off so my judgment is to stay passive just a little longer then well let the swat boys off the leash and teach this kid a thing or two he turned smiling and went out to face the abc cameras up they climbed up the steel steps in the unlit shaft of the stairwell slowly cruz in the lead tough little lavelva behind from the second floor to the third sir she said call me ray not sir is this a machine gun i havent fired no machine gun before she was gripping the ak that ray had snatched up from the jihadi lavelva had conked with her eight iron and he had finished with a bayonet it made him realize she knows nothing about that gun except what shes seen in the movies but shes going on anyhow its not a machine gun no here i better show you how to use it they knelt and he talked to her in whispers okay this one fires as fast as you pull the trigger no machine gun thirty times but its got to be loaded the safety has to be off it has to be cocked and its much better if youre aiming it he pushed the magazine release and snapped out the magazine this orange bananashaped thing is full of the cartridges you know what a cartridge is the bullets yeah close enough you can see them held by the lips of the magazine showing little things they are small but they move fast they hit hard they do real bad damage so to load it you have to lock in the magazine the bullet part up the bullets facing down the barrel look how i do it think of it as a kind of hinge you sort of wedge the front part of the magazine into the front part of the magazine well until it catches see he showed it to her two or three times then she took the mag and the smallframed tinny even toylike weapon and mimicked him ending up with the mag forward lip lodged into the mag well until it lightly clicked good now that its set you pivot the magazine back or up all the way into the well there thats right pivot it in see how it fits and sort of force it or shove until it locked okay turn the gun over she did so see that lever that piece of rotating metal on the right side of the receiver see how it goes up and hooks over this open slot in the gun i do thats the safety in that condition up the gun cant be fired or cocked it blocks the bolt see that and he pulled the bolt back about an inch until it hit the safety obstruction and would go no farther bet you can figure out what to do you push it down you got it with her thumb she rotated the long safety lever downward so that it no longer blocked the bolt raceway now you have to cock it set the bolt back allow a cartridge to come up into the chamber okay she said she rearranged the gun so that she controlled it more efficiently its stock against her hip secured by her tightened elbow now see that latch or prong thing he asked pointing to the bolt handle yes pull that back and let it go she pulled it back without trouble and then let the bolt fly forward and seat itself after having moved a mm cartridge into the chamber okay now youre ready to rock itll fire each time you pull the trigger you know how to shoot it like the movies just dont hold it sideways look over the top line up the rear sight with the front sight put it on target watch the front sight and press dont yank the trigger it reminded him of a time hed taken molly to a civilian rifle range molly tried gamely she pretended she cared she pretended the gun was interesting will it hurt molly had asked him no not if you do it right ill show you how to do it hed seated her behind a bench fiddled with wrist and arm and upper body aligning the barrel her head focusing the scope for her tidying the sandbags okay what are you thinking of what were going to have for dinner he laughed youre hopeless im not hopeless at all im full of hope im hoping this will be over soon and it was and they went out and had a nice dinner and laughed their way through it and now he wondered if hed ever get back to that simple peacetime ritual of just hanging out with a woman you loved was it that big a deal it seemed the whole world had managed it they made it to the top of the stairs okay he said beyond there is enemy territory im going to shoot open the door just like i did before and jump into the hallway ill be low well check left well check right then ill dash across the hallway and cover for you then well move into the store its just seventyfive or so feet down to the left on that side lavelva suddenly said no dont do it what youll be killed whatre you talking about they waiting for you they dont even know im here yes he do that boy he knows lavelva whatre you talking about dont you see its in the game i dont its a game this boy he turned this whole place into his own giantsize game you said he run first person shooter i been there all these geeky little etlookin motherfuckers black white yellow it dont matter they all be trippin on killing and blowing shit up its so real to them they dont remember they sittin in a mall surrounded by gal underpants stores and hes the king of all that and what do a king do he spread his empire right yeah hes nuts but why do you i play the game too she said were wasting time you get killed you wont waste no time anymore you listen to me i play the games a lot i like to leave my thing too i dont want to be no girl in the projects with a brother dead and another nailing carpet and no prospects for nothing i want to be alex in wizards of waverly place and im all the time trying to get through the maze you know i like that story i dont like the boy shit which is all blowing up but i like the girl shit the wizard alex shit and so i know the rule of the game its you never go in the first way what thats the way the game work some people get it some never do but there is always another way into it always thats the way you win you look and look and look and find that other way in cause if you go in the first way you find you get whacked he looked hard at her ray please she said im telling you straight through that door death sure enough pm pm that is it my brother said the imam he was weeping he had been so moved by the three young fighters in their orange suits leaping up the stairway into the plane and now all were aboard and the hatch door was secured the plane had to taxi to position at the head of the runway and then roar airborne it was a triumph beyond his imagining he looked at andrew the young man handsome enough in the western way with his blond short hair his little ski jump of a nose his sweatshirt and blue jeans and hiking boots his baseball cap on backward was lit by the glow of the news feed his face showed nothing he was not weeping at all he showed no trace of joy or liberation no sense of the meaning of the great thing he had accomplished a thing no jihadi not even the holy warrior himself the martyred osama had come close to achieving he had actually freed prisoners from the american prison system the kaafi brothers innocents naifs idiots who had bumbled into an american bank on the day after osamas death and in a fit of islamic passion attempted to rob it with airsoft pistols with the idea of contributing to the cause it was perhaps the stupidest robbery in the history of crime more farce than threat as the idiots had not even bothered to cover the orange rings appended to the gun muzzles to signify nonlethality they were arrested by a smiling sixtythreeyearold security guard but some prosecutor decided to ride the prank as far as he could and the three emerged six months later with massive sentences and were quickly shipped to the pen where their frailness their gentleness their somali beauty and grace got them fucked savagely every night by the depraved of america the imam could not stand it it hurt him so much and now the boys were free thanks to this american of dubious faith and principle named andrew we are so badass andrew finally said flatly andrew the imam asked i have to know why no virgins await you only nothingness by your own beliefs if there is no afterlife this life is meaningless so it must be so for you but i cannot abide that please now on the cusp of your greatness tell me your reasons andrew didnt bother to repay the earnestness with eye contact clearly the wword why wasnt of much interest to him hed been asked it a thousand times by teachers deans cops shrinks counselors parents shortterm girlfriends everybody anybody he preferred not to hassle with it it was psychobabble muzak to his ears he shrugged his shoulders one reason i did it for you is because everybody hates you that is so cool i love the way you guys feed on that hate and it makes you bigger and stronger and more intent on your cause which otherwise makes no fucking sense at all to me in fact he really didnt give a shit about the dumbbunny kaafis anyone that stupid was doomed and the rational functioning of natural selection had worked within design specifications to cull them from the herd and what the crips and bloods did to their asses in the dark of a jungle penitentiary night was of little concern to him empathy was not one of his gifts he actually thought the idea of the thin and beautiful and young and tender somalis being gangbanged was pretty funny the point of the prisoner release had really been just to stall things out for three hours or so in order to let the networks set up so that the final act would play out in prime time before a world audience he thought a bitmeanwhile the majestic jet had made it to the end of the airstrip and was rotating on its tires to orient itself for the long surge to liftoffand finally applied himself at last to the conundrum that was andrew nicks ideas abstractions conceits causesall were more or less hazy to him he had no sense of nation or state none whatsoever of american interest and to him the government was simply the entity that prevented the osama kill shot from making it to fox the game was everything it superseded all it provided framework a set of rules a rising litany of satisfied expectations level by level until the ultimate moment and that moment was the point didnt they get that come on assholes i want to see the ultimate moment the kill shot when the seal operator doubletaps pieces of flying steel at three thousand feet per into the famous mug of the tall guy and he spasms backward amid a sudden atomized mist of cuisinarted plasma and brain cells i want to see his eyes go all cue ball as the pupils rotate upward in the split second before his knees give and he notices his brains now decorate the wall and the ceiling but no were so delicate all of a sudden you have violated the rules of the game you have set up the greatest narrative since world war ii and demanded our attention and when the climax arrives you demurely avert your eyes you assholes you unbelievable pansy jerkoffs you have violated the rules of the game how could he say to this guy hey dude i just transformed america the mall into the greatest massively multiplayer online game it will support thousands of players simultaneously and players can be on the same side or play against each other in largescale combat simulations set in a real place they can be me or the swat hero who takes me down and i bet a surprising number choose to play me i am creating the scenes for a new game rather than using computergenerated images and sounds i will be the first to use actual pictures and sounds from actual slaughter and carnage in a real place in a real time with real characters real life real death the stories the miraculous mistakes the brave moms the gay waiters who give up their lives to protect their customers the teenaged killers the dedicated if hopelessly fuckedup imam maahir the killer of santa claus it just dont git no better i believe that this will provide the realism lacking in the other games and in my world which is the only one i care about the only one i succeeded in the only one where i found respect and loyalty and love and my ideal self that is immortality no its more its godhood and they will understand the generations of players who are absorbed into the culture of my creation and become its heroes and villains soam i crazy or what and its all on disc the finest first person shooter in history get the disc to wikileaks and itll astound the world it is first person shooter as art as the odyssey or war and peace not only did i have the imagination to conceive it i had the will to engineer it all before the age of twentyfive but the imam would have not even begun to grasp the conceit that if art was creation then it also had to be destruction instead andrew settled on a trope that seemed to satisfy most people and in which he himself even slightly believed i have always liked to wreck things he said more to end the conversation than to explain anything it may be a drive as human as sex or greed or fear think about it a certain tiny portion of the population has since time immemorial had a hunger to destroy so deep so consistent it has to be chromosomal a gene for destruction the dna theory of anarchism maybe allah or possibly the wonderful wizard of oz whichever one is really behind the curtain he seeds each generation with a few of us naturalborn blowersupofshit because he knows someones got to wreck all the crap so that someone else can start over and rebuild and have something to do on monday else what would we do all day year after year make cuckoo clocks the imam of course didnt catch the refs to wizard or to welless chilly speech in the third man but he caught the gist of it i think he said allah has touched you he just forgot to whisper his name into your ear see andrew said everyone makes mistakes earlier that day the truck pulled into the sublevel loading dock for the rio grande corridor at am and andrew was there to greet it as usual the place was deserted as the deliveries that kept america the mall running came in late afternoon between morning and evening crowds even on black friday andrew watched them unlimber from the truck interior twelve somali youths raggedlooking and bewildered in poor mens clothes pakistani copies of designer jeans malaysian mens club clone jackets and chinesemade athletic shoes the boys were clearly overwhelmed by what they saw which was nothing more than a large warehouse space in the malls dark underground far removed from the consumerist glories of the place itself the imam barked orders and got them quickly herded into a freight elevator where all fourteen men crowded together rode to the fourth floor and found themselves in another dark tunnel that ran behind the retail outlets on the rio grande corridor andrew led the way and a hundred or so feet later he popped the computer lock on his store opened the door and admitted them to his stockroom he had industriously cleared it out for them so thered be plenty of room moreover six tenpiece buckets of popeyes fried chicken and a cooler full of cokes awaited the jihad warriors whoeven the oldest called maahirat this point seemed in a kind of sloppy daze unsure where they were what their mission would be what fate lay ahead they had been told that this was a martyr operation about which they had no doubts that this day would end in paradise that even before paradise they would serve the faith more spectacularly than mohamed atta and the holy nineteen of that they would enjoy every single second of what lay ahead and that their job was to obey allah as represented by the will of the imam who the white boy was held no interest at all to them compared to the chicken which they found delicious as they did the cocacola though one wondered aloud in somali if there was diet coke available and seemed disappointed when he found it was not the imam bade them rest he knew the travel had been overlong and uncomfortable and he himself was quite agitated as unblooded martrydom was not something a certain part of him welcomed the part that had turned him into a chronic masturbator three times last night secret imbiber and occasional whoremonger what sustained him was not his faith in allah or his love of fallen osama but his belief in andrew andrew knew everything had foreseen everything was calm decisive kind just decent and sensitive to the iron mandates of islamic culture particularly as regarding infidels though he himself was an infidel that fact could be overlooked such a gifted boy such a committed warrior he loved andrew in a way that was almost unhealthy though of course he was not a deviantthe holy text is quite explicit on the fate of men who love menbut he saw now how such a thing was at least possible he loved him then as the arab leaders had loved lawrence in the great war decades ago and could give themselves to the care of an infidel knowing that in his heart this white man rode with the bedu andrews theory was to keep the boys occupied in these last few hours and far away from bigger questions of fate and duty and faith too much thinking was inappropriate now so late so close thus through the stern guidance of the imam he had three of them drag out the eleven crates of soviet ammunition knife open the tins rip the ammo out of the cheesy russian military cardboard boxes and all gather about to load the orange magazines this was no easy task and the boys didnt enjoy it but maahir the oldest was rough on the loafers and commanded them to their task even though fingers soon grew sore forcing the cartridges into the narrow slots in the magazines through the sharp lips that abraded or even cut their skin and stiffened in resistance as the boys loaded more and thereby increased the spring pressure against which they worked all of course had loaded kalash mags before but never in such abundance they usually carried but two or three with them and barring conflict they could have those tucked into pouches for days sometimes weeks now suddenly they were loading twenty magazines apiece and it was not enjoyable duty even if it portended a big killing and much glory ahead then to break the misery saalim told a funny story about the time his goat had been hit by a lorry and he had defrauded the driver out of three times the animals worth punchline it wasnt even saalims goat through all this not a word was said about plans the actualities of what lay ahead were as mysterious as ever and time was passing finally at around two oclock when the last of the mags had been topped off each boy had made sure his shoes were tied tight and had visited the pail in the little room to the left and made an ablative contribution when prayers had been said again finally it was time the imam asked the boys to separate into selfselected twosomes and there was some unanticipated difficulty here as ashkir was irritated because saalim had already teamed with asad for urgaas the idea of spending the last hours of his life on earth with ashkir was especially annoying but finally maahir grabbed ashkir as his partner which left urgaas to buddy up with madino whom though he had nothing in common with him urgaas at least did not actively despise that done the imam walked among them handing out tribal scarves which he demanded they wrap about their necks but stuff low inside the collars of their shirts the idea being to pull them out at the moment of action making each boy easy to identify by the others he also gave them radio headsets with little throat microphones through which during the operation he would address them he bade them sit he nodded to andrew who slid a blackboard in front of them and spun it on pivots to reveal a map the smartest among them recognized it instantly as a cross section of the very structure in which they were present as viewed from the top down it revealed a somewhat lopsided pentagon with the two bottom sides slightly concave the center of this odd structure appeared to be open though it was latticed with walkways and at each corner a larger box bore an odd name in english which some could sound out as nordstrom sears macys and bloomingdales four corridorsstrangely marked colorado rio grande mississippi and hudsonled from the outermost ring to the center area he spoke in somali today my brother pilgrims is the day we strike the beast of the west in his lair in a few short minutes i will release you you will be fully armed with your guns your knives warriors of the faith here to slay and ravage and rampage as is commanded by the holy text you will rest tonight in paradise my pilgrims attended by a fleet of winsome virgins who will bring you wine and dates and carnal pleasure and glory unto eternity let me show you the path to glory but first let me warn you we have shielded you thus far from the seductions of the west you were chosen for your purity your innocence your devotion to faith as you move along you will see wondrous things that only a decadent civilization can conjure clothes and toys and foods and other trivial but colorful delights you must be strong you must resist this is a day of jihad not vacation moreover you must not be tempted by the shameless flesh of the west you will see it everywhere and in its beguiling licentiousness it has brought many a true believer to ruin i have chosen you because you are strong in the mind and in the heart you can look upon such filth and spit in disgust you will not be tempted swayed weakened or in any way turned from duty and that is as follows you will smartly progress to the elevators as marked your rifles hidden under your coats will not be visible your earphones are common in america and the infidels will take them for the cell phones that dominate their lives each team of two will take the elevator to the first level there each team will progress to the corridors marked by the names of rivers colorado mississippi hudson and rio grandehe pointed them outand at the given hour as i signal maahir will shoot the king of the infidels atop his throne here and you will hear the shot pull your scarves up over your heads shout allahu akbar so that the infidels will know who has come to slay them in their sanctuary and you will open fire moving down the corridors toward this he pointed to the intricate pattern of roadways in the center this is a western playland full of absurd contrivances that give them the safe joy of speed you will drive them into this area by gunfire killing as you see fit drive them forward into the playland where all will commingle and halt in progress maahir and his three will receive them there you will command them to sit and you will commence to guard them an hour perhaps two will pass while i and my friend here make demands upon the infidels to help our cause we mean to order them to free our three brothers unjustly imprisoned so that they too will return to glory and the west will know our unquenchable will and that no bars can ever truly imprison a jihadi warrior prince at last it was time for the guns andrew had checked each for functionality and distributed them with confidence for the young men new guns were like an aphrodisiac to the sex of violence they crowded in hungrily to touch to hold to caress to possess a new weapon the usual orgy of rifle love took place as each newly equipped and wideeyed gunman tested bolt and trigger pull and sight alignment and heft and feel and pointability some of the more immature aimed issued copious phlegmy machinegun sounds and mimed the shaking of the instrument on full automatic as deployed in fantasy genocide against jews or if jews werent available mere infidels equally worthy of death but somehow lacking in the pizzazz of a jewish kill yes said the imam it is play now but soon my young fearless jihadis it will be real as will the blood that you spill including in martyrdom your own as you make the trip to be loved by allah allahu akbar someone shouted and the others took it up until it grew alarmingly loud and andrew elbowed the enthusiastic imam and that gentleman came to his senses and ordered silence the young men drew a single orange banana clip from the pouch they wore on their chest and now pivoted it into the well of the ak almost in perfect syncopation as if on drill so that the sound of twelve clicks snapped through the space to some ears it was music finally each of the young men was handed a large overgarment cheap blue gabardine overcoats formerly issued to czech draftees that had been picked up by andrew xxxl at a local surplus joint they were easily big enough to swallow the young men and the rifles they held cradled tight across their chests or down along their sides hands nesting on pistol grips to look at them in this condition was to see little that suggested lethal intent young somali men each handsome in that somali way of which somalis were so justly proud with high fine cheekbones chocolate skin a fine pelt of frizzed hair and bright and vivid eyes each wrapped in some garment indistinguishable from the garments worn by others of the age and cohort somali or whatever pretty much the world over when the kaafi brothers are released the imam concluded then you will have your killing no one will interrupt you as the infidels are cowards if they cannot bomb from afar or fire missiles they lack the will to fight they do not like the sight of blood or the damage a bullet may do but you my young lions are hardened in battle the destruction to flesh which you bring to them the lakes of blood you spill until it is thick upon the floor all of that is your contribution to the faith and the vessel of your glory you will avenge osama asad thought who was osama pm pm any reports from the mall asked colonel obobo himself bathed in the glow of the tv monitor in the dark of the incident command trailer as the same imagery of loading sealing and then taxiing was playing out all quiet sir great said the colonel then he felt a presence it was mr renfro leaning in quietly i havent seen jefferson lately whispered mr renfro i dont trust him maybe hes up to something crazy better check on him tell me wheres major jefferson the colonel asked loudly sir i havent seen him commo get me major jefferson yes sir the colonel put on his earphones and throat mike just in time to hear the channel one request all personnel this is command where is major jefferson major jefferson please report in tenfour the silence was ominous as the colonel watched the jet began the pirouette that would place it on the proper vector for takeoff ah command sorry jefferson here checking in major where are you please asked the colonel sir im

receive the hostages yes sir said jefferson ill do that okay said cruz you are the wizard of america the mall you know games i dont you get to be the intelligence officer im just the grunt ill find another way thank you ray she said he thought quickly you got a cell of her age and generation and culture who didnt have a cell sure she took out her nokia write the number down on my wrist she did with a bic she had in her jeans pocket im going back ill get up there by some other way ill figure it dont know how yet but she knew how there was only one way he had to get back to the atrium overlooking the amusement park and risk climbing from the thirdfloor balcony to the fourth somehow some superhero usmc goddamned way when im ready you go to the door and fire five or six rounds into the door jamb next to the lock like we did before push it open if geniusboy has his gunners out there waiting theyll run to the door to pop you coming out only you wont be coming out i will be from some other place i will do the popping then we move on to the store where hes running this game and we get ready to deal with him got it i wont let you down ray thats the one thing i know for a fact so the plane is at the runway marty told nikki over the radio itll be off in a few seconds a minute or so at the most got it i dont like it to me were trusting these guys to keep their word like i dont know theyre bridge club ladies or something the frabjous obobo has decided anyhow i have a great shot in mind oh youll like this thisll get me to new york too mary tyler moore mary tyler moore doesnt have room for moochers or slackers in her organization marty said nikki whats this shot you want well itll get me a local emmy thats for sure you want an emmy marty buy some more tables at the banquet so young so cynical go ahead with your gone with the wind shot when the planes take off i want you to have capn tom assuming hes still sober hey marty cut in tom i havent had a drink in at least three minutes tom drops down and hovers over the big entrance there on the east side got it you should get dramatic shots of hostages pouring out and heading toward the buses and climbing aboard somell be limping somell be being helped therell be crowding but also joy and thankfulness got it get me faces i want faces faces then the camera op pulls back comes in tight as he cranks focus way in and sitting in the doorwell of the wuffchopper is new star nikki swagger ms scoopsrus herself reporting on the hostage release in one continuous shot itll be terrific and maybe itll go national it was a good idea gee youre wonderful mr grant she said cruz made it out the doorway and slid down the rio grande hallway toward the balcony over the atrium he went prone slithered to the metalwork and saw two stories down and through the screening of possibly artificial trees the spread of hostages on the walkways of the amusement park and the gunmen standing all around he got a good look through a hole in the trees of santa still dead he picked up his phone sniper five go ahead cruz theyve set an ambush at the stairwell we think im going to go around it but theres no easy way no nearby escalators all the stairwells are locked so i have to climb in plain sight from this level to the next can you see me a pause as mcelroy worked his binoculars and then found the marine lying on his back just off the balcony got you i need a recon see any bad guys no theyre all downstairs i have no movement on any of the upper levels are you sure this is a good idea do you have a better one man i dont have any but thats a long exposure and if they see you an easy shot and if the bullet doesnt kill you you land on your back or head and break something important and permanent and maybe that queers the hostage deal you forget the best part im scared to death of heights all right id relocate about fifty feet to your left theres a support beam between the balconies looks like its decorated with some kind of phony turnofthecenturyaccordingtodisney shit maybe it has enough hand and footholds good work do you have buds for your phone yeah in the box at home okay i cant talk you up ill watch and and what there was nothing mcelroy could do but watch good luck marine semper fi all that ray put the phone away and lowcrawled the fifty he knew he didnt have much time he knew he couldnt make any noise he knew he couldnt sweat grunt breathe heavy swallow anything this was just pure acrobatics against a lethal height in front of an audience of killers who he hoped werent in the habit of looking up fortunately since the happy architects of silliland had planted the grounds with those interfering trees direct vision across or up was always impeded by the fluffy weaving of artificial leaves one word plastics that might help he pulled himself up made a last check none of the somali guards was in a particularly alert status they lounged gathering in little groupsprobably against their general ordersand seemed somehow quite happy if any wondered where pals a through d had gone to they werent showing it okay he told himself go i dont want to go his self answered what was it molly always said with a smile on her face too bad for you first he pulled himself up to the balcony railing securing himself by hand to the pillar which was itself about six inches wide the same sage green as everything else in this green metal universe then he planted his foot on a nub of scrollwork a filigree to the conceit of new orleans balcony wrought iron overlooking bourbon street and indeed it held and he hoisted himself up aware at the same time that his entire weight was supported by just a stub of fake wrought iron he rose by pulling felt secure enough to free his off arm and reached up once a tremor came to his foot he slipped but somehow managed to check himself before he went by getting ahead of the slippage and jamming the foot in hard he stabilized holding tight then brought his other leg up searching for a foothold with his toe where the fuck was it god there wasnt one meanwhile his twisted fingers all that were between him and the serious intentions of gravity began to cramp in pain they slipped too costing him a little purchase so that if he wasnt on by fingertips quite it was only the last joints of one hand that secured him dont look down dont look down ray stabbed again with his free leg like a show horse stomping out its age in the dirt onetwothree higher each time until almost at full extension it lit on something just big enough to hold him and he hoisted again very quickly this turned into a bad career move he was supported in his twohundredpound entirety by the leverage of about a toe and a half wedged against the meekest of protrusions and with a hand he reached high searching for a grabon aware that his purchase was slipping slipping slipping and in the second before he knew hed go swing inward and torque his support hand free and send himself into outer space his fingers closed on some kind of steel tube clamped hard upon it and this stretched him a little further into extension and his foot also found a mooring point and up he shot he rested still feeling the tracks of sweat running from hairline to eyes and nose down from his armpits the breath coming in hard gusts even as his primal fears of falling expressed themselves vividly and he saw himself as in a s movies crummy special effect spinning laterally getting further from the lens as he descended until at last he plunked hard to earth broken like a doll or a toy and then he heard a scream thats it he thought im dead he tensed against the shot that would hit him and bring him down it cannot be discovered who first saw him but it is known that esther greenberg sixtynine stockbroker mother of none mentor of many supporter of dozens was the only one who figured out what had to be done and had the stone guts to do it someone poked her and leaned close theyre here came the whisper commandos cops somebody she nodded frozen suddenly overwhelmed by this new reality up above came the whisper slowly as if she were merely stretching she elevated her head and she saw him at first she thought its one of them but then she thought no it cant be hes trying to move slowly hes not black hes one of us she looked over and saw two of the gunmen jabbering until they grew uninterested in each other the tall one was the dangerous one he disengaged from his buddy and began to look around innocently the way a young guy will let his eyes roam out of boredom he looked left right and then began to look up and noooooooo she screamed she stood up i cant take it anymore she yelled as if there were one thing on earth that frightened her please please let me go she ran at the tall boy with the gun who watched her come with lightless eyes even as other hostages tried to grab her to stop her from suicide but she made it to him and he smashed her in the head with his ak between puffs of his cigarette crazy american bitch he thought what was that all about no shot came he heard turmoil and scuffling below but was in no position to check it out instead he waited a second the panic passed again he reminded himself to not look down and he hoisted one foot up up up found a toehold god knew what and again launched himself upward feeling the pain of exhaustion sizzle through his arms and the yearning of his fingers to cease their death grip and then it occurred to him that he was there he had made it he was now resting on the solidity of the fourth floor except on the wrong side of the balcony and it just took an adroit but controlled roll and spin and he was over and landed on the floor of the next story he sucked at air waited for his racing heartbeat to diminish and finally sliding next to a wall stood got himself up he looked up at the skylight not nearly so far away now and waved and the figure that must have been mcelroy waved back ray got out his phone pressed the button jesus i thought you were going there for a second said mcelroy god looks after fools i guess ray said do you have an angle to the corridor not enough of one i can only see about fifteen feet down it okay im going to move down there set up if something happens and they start shooting hostages ill step out and drop the ambushers and move into that first person shooter place its on the left about halfway down he then called lavelva okay he said i made it up somehow im just inside the balcony to the right of the corridor what have you got nothing im just waiting here good if i give the signal you shoot the door frame not the lock you have to blow away the lockwork which is only buried in wood and plasterboard then you kick in the door then you drop back that should draw them and ill put them down and go to the store when you hear my shots youre clear to follow sweetie are you up for this you dont have to go you can just back on down the stairwell i am so up for this you are a true warrior princess bravest of the brave okay in just a few itll be our turn for some first person shooting the snipers huddled at roughly racine the only thing we have is flashbangs one of them said and they dont go boom they go pop fuck said mcelroy whod just returned from scouting for ray and hoped theyd solved their problem but was disappointed to discover they had not i have two red smokers someone said forget the smokers maybe if in concert all of us whacked a certain small area with our butts a probably doesnt work b throws the scopes out of zero no go im just thinking out loud thats good thats good said mcelroy think out loud everybody maybe well come up with something hey said a state trooper sniper we have kevlar tactical helmets he snapped his finger against the hard tactical shell maybe smash with them open the hole and that way we dont throw the zeros out youll never get through that shit with plastic helmets someone else said hey this shit is hard said the trooper any entrenching tools this isnt world war two what about with our knives we chip away at that groove fbi opened all of us working hard maybe we get it loosened then smash it with our helmets that seems about the best i mean its all we can do right fbi i guess said mcelroy reaching for his knife but as he did his wrist passed over the smooth cylinder that was the flashbang grenade more a pyrotechnic than anything else meant to produce a loud percussion and a disorienting flash but not enough junk in it to okay he said how many flashbangs a quick survey produced the answer twelve twelve im wondering what happens if they all go off at once youd have to contain it said somebody direct it they can bring down a huge building with a few pointed charges use the helmets and but it has to go simo youd need wiring dets a whole tech kit that the army has but we dont i dont mcelroy saw it then heres what were going to do we take one of those helmets we load it with flashbangs hmm lets see they work just like grenades right yes okay we wrap i dont know gauze bandages duct tape something soft and malleable around the levers on the flashbangs got it that secures the levers then we pull the pins but nothing happens because the levers are taped down then very carefully we run a wire or a piece of tape or something through the tape on the flashbang levers then very carefully we put the flashbangs on the glass and we cover them with the helmet and maybe you put something heavy on the helmet is this a game youre playing are you macgyver or something why not just run the tape through the rings on the flashers someone said simpler simpler yeah but those pins take a lot of pull to free up and i can see the tape or whatever breaking or getting hung up mcelroy said hes right said the trooper so if this thing goes bad and the bastards downstairs start shooting we pull the tape line which pulls the tape loose and all the flashbang levers go ping and three seconds later all twelve of them go off more or less simo and the helmet directs the considerable force of their detonation downward im betting you blow a nice big hole in that glass then we go to war and we shoot every gunman we see in the head do you get it yes i do and if the hostages are released all we have to do is replace the pins and give everybody their toys back okay have you got it its a plan stan no no no no no hed made the jumps from bruce wyatt to realdeal opsys to realdeal secsys to realdeal secsys linkage to a wilderness deployed in front of him on the screen were nearly four hundredmore than three screens worth of scrollingcoded units each representing some kind of realdeal franchise or outlet one of them had to be the realdeal on the fourth floor at america the mall in indian falls minnesota but which the geniuses at realdeal opsys so knew their empire that they didnt bother to split the list by category as any sane outfit would do it wasnt broken down by store profit levels major markets region or state no just an endless column of bullshit listings like rdopsysx what what the hell was that someone call realdeal corporate said dr benson well get an engineer on the phone and well so close thought neal so goddamned close the air saudi seemed to take forever the colonel watched it a heat mirage rose from the engine structures shimmering as it blurred the reality behind it signifying the mounting temperature of jet engine exhaust then finally it lurched picked up speed and the camera stayed with it while behind it the farm plains and dreary suburbs of minneapolis began to blur at the end of a long slow fifteen hundred yards it rose shivered then shucked the ground shivered again as its landing gear retracted and disappeared behind closing wheel wells and then banked right against the black sky heading north on the great circle route to yemen there was no cheering in the command trailer but the colonel felt a stir in his heart he had done what he could do he had given them what they wanted he had bridled in his wild cowboys who wanted to go in with guns blazing he felt at peace secure in the knowledge that no one else could have negotiated the treacherous terrain and the many obstacles between what he had discovered upon arrival and this very moment mr renfro whispered in his ear congratulations doug you brought it off you did it thanks he said i couldnt have sir its him andrew nicks the colonel took the phone surprised to find himself drenched in sweat you saw he said you have your prisoners good riddance to them now give us our hostages excellent by the way change of plans said andrew please witness the firepower of the armed fully operational death star he paused hoping the star wars ref gave his carefully considered statement more oomph imam he said in a loud voice so that all could hear tell the jihadis to open fire kill the hostages kill them all colonel i now restore the security television cameras so that you and all of america can watch the massacre and learn to cower in fear of islam pm pm nick in the pennsylvania avenue crisis center heard the kill order from andrew nicks eric and cho wannabe soldier of islam first person shooter champion and allaround asshole and almost before the sentence was finished was screaming and bodyenglishing into his mike mcelroy blow the window now blow it now and engage targets ray can you suppress from your position but he was a second behind the action curve as mcelroy having heard the same declaration of purpose had already yanked the master cord and felt the tape securing the levers of the twelve flashbangs under the kevlar helmet on the thick glass of the skylight pull free and in the next second or so the det went loud and hard made more pointed in its effectiveness by the cupping effect of the helmeta batch of bulletproof vests lay atop it pinning itwhich blew all force downward into and through the skylight shearing through the heavy plexiglas atomizing it into a spray of glitter like droplets of water yielding a jagged opening almost like a hole in the ice it blew like a howitzer shell the kevlar helmet was sent into orbit the noise of the purposefully loud flashbangs magnified by twelve seemed to put a needle into every nearby eardrum and the pressure wave and subsequent vibration shivered the foundations of the planet still ears ringing mcelroy was on the gun almost within a second finding a braced position on the window well and peering through the scope into the smoky interior what he could see wasnt detailed it was a seething blur almost abstract as beneath him en masse the hostages seemed to rise and scatter while at the same time at the edges of the crowd the flashes of gunfire the percussion of reports the shockwave of energy signified that the gunmen had opened fire in another second another agent on binocs screaming two oclock i have a shooter i see flash dave two oclock mcelroy traced the imaginary clock hand out to the two oclock orientation and found the flash saw a thin black youth in black and green tribal scarf pumping rounds from his ak the flash lighting the boys face displaying his excitement his joy his pleasure as he shot from the hip into the screaming herd before him and mcelroy put the xmarksthespot on the bridge of the nose power blew it up big as a movie screen hd no lessremembered he was shooting radically downhill and so brought point of aim down a minute of angle or so and then felt the gun recoilhe had fired instinctively without order his trigger finger making all decisions for himand took his first kill as the bullet split the head spewing a foam of black liquid and the boys limbs melted as he went down hard and forever clean hit screamed the spotter mcelroy raced through the bolt ritual up hard back hard seeing the empty pop like a muffin in his moms kitchen forward hard down soft go left to ten i see more flash two of them take them dave knock them down mcelroy found the shooter at the end of blurred transit across space and frenzy felt he was too low on the body to take time to find the head and his ohsoclever trigger finger put a grain hollowtip through the top of the guys chest so that it would follow its downward angle opening like an umbrella or some kind of steel rose with razor petals find and explode the heart which is what it did the result being another instant splash and collapse next to him next to him next to him screamed his spotter and mcelroy jacked the spent shell out planted a new one in the chamber and found his next target just as that young man was reacting to the death of his partner and looked up to see dave one hundred or so feet straight up from him but he vanished in a split second withdrawing under the canopy of the secondfloor balcony and dave felt a surge of groaning frustration find me targets he screamed looking looking looking the spotter said oh no said mr girardi a flash followed by the crack of a detonation seemed to blossom upon the roof of the great building suddenly activity burst out all over the compass the explosion seemed to galvanize every figure on the landscape and in seconds people were running by them cars were mobilized even the hovering helicopters seemed to descend from the sky they heard though muted the sounds that could only have been gunshots i thought it was all fixed said mr girardi something must have gone wrong said his wife i thought it was all over mr girardi said and now this each gunman heard over his earphones the scream of the imam my pilgrims the man raged it is time to avenge the sins of the crusaders and the murder of the holy warrior kill the infidels kill them my brave warriors and purify the world of their filth and disease faaid put down his box of caramel corn and winked at hani who was eating cold french fries out of a cardboard box and hani winked back merrily now for the fun part the remaining boys spread around the perimeter of the large docile crowd of white sheep in the amusement park lifted his rifle to hip and pivoted a candysticky finger going to the safety levers for those who had bothered to put their safeties on and each opened fire only nadif and khadar were reluctant they had spent most of the time eating and never really made eye contact with any of the white people they had more or less found each other over the long ordeal of travel and hiding each reading the others lack of killer zeal among the harder faces of the truly demented by nature passive they had done their duty with a minimum of aggression and frenzy they had strolled down mississippi at the beginning shooting out ceiling lights and blowing holes in store windows and watching mannikin strumpets dissolve under the multiple impacts of mm bullets traveling at close to feet per second which they found very amusing as for actually blowing large holes in human flesh not so much then they had more or less strolled the perimeter of the mass of huddled hostages making no eye contact with the victims interacting reluctantly taking frequent bathroom and food stand raid breaks they were not particularly into jihad nadif had dreamed of being a doctor and khadar a poet a poet he had soft eyes and gentle ways was almost girlish in his winsomeness but when general aweyss militia had wiped out his village and his parents as well he had been given a choice carry a rifle or die he chose the rifle and alone among the boys had never killed a soul today was supposed to be his first but the approach of it had left a queasy feeling in his stomach khadar said its time to do the work of allah though without much enthusiasm both knew punishment of all sorts awaited them if they did not perform as expected numbly they turned to do the necessary but at that moment from above the sky exploded all looked up to see the aftermath of some sort of blast at the tip of the oddly shaped skylight and besides the unpleasantness of the noise it rained sparkles upon them a kind of sudden dry wind of interfering debris and each involuntarily blinked closed eyes averted face only a second or two but possibly it was tactically significant in that its violence was so unexpected and overwhelming it stirred the torpid crowd in unanticipated directions suddenly many rose saw the rescue had commenced just as shooting had commenced and at last found the courage to run they scattered outward like cinders fleeing a fire faaid fired at one runner bringing him down turned fired fast at the crowd that suddenly roared toward him was astounded that none went down and realized that theres a lot of air in a crowd and at that time figured he was much better off aiming instead of crazily cracking off rounds from the hip brought the rifle to his shoulder and mcelroys first shot splattered his brains the others didnt notice they too tried to master the crowdmassacre learning curve and they too discovered that shooting blindly into the belly of the beast is likely to produce displeasing results and in the time it took them to bring rifles to shoulders and brace knees tightly for supported shooting several others assisted by mcelroy ray cruz and others lost interest in the point of the operation as they were felled for keeps ray got the news dropping the cell he rose to the balcony railing winced as above him mcelroys flashbang bouquet flashed and banged with stunning malevolence blew a hole in the lake michigan skylight and a blastpropelled spray of glass spewed downward and leaned over the balcony looking for shots he only had a p the german police tradein the killers had somehow come up with on the surplus market though he knew it by reputation to be an accurate pistol two hands locked onto the small thing the lever that bisected the grip compressed by the adrenalinepumped psycho strength coursing down his wrists ray stepped out oriented on a flashhe couldnt see well enough to pick out an actual shooterguesstimated where the shooter had to be relative to the flash and squeezed off three fast rounds the gun popped in his hands at each shot spitting an empty yet its jump wasnt radical and the barrel axis was so low to his hand that it just ate up recoil so ray got back on target fast three fired the flash disappeared and whether hed made a kill or just scared the guy to cover ray didnt know but he knew lavelvas theoretical ambushers would have been alerted by the flashbangs as well as his own shooting and he wheeled still in the twohand low isosceles stance and saw themgoddamn the girl was right as they both emerged from a shop about sixty feet away rifles flying to hips to take the infidel down the p lived up to its rep a long shot for a mil he still made it neatly and crisply put one into the lead shooter rocking him to stagger and sitdown he rotated smoothly telling himself not to hurry onto the second target tracked it as the man was moving laid the front sight on the leading edge of the mover then ray saw flashhe heard silence because his war brain had shut the world down to nothing but targetand knew instantly that his opponent shooting fast without aiming firing from the hip had missed and ray felt his trigger pull break the gun leaped in its little way and the runner slowed staggered by a solid hit stopped straightened up a little at that moment from across the hallway a door flew open and lavelva with her ak fired and although she shot more or less wildly at least three of her twenty or so rounds went home and the second somali himself slid into coma and death on the floor of the mall bring a gun he screamed and she picked up one of the fallen aks and ran to him he took it as if it were a baton in a relay race pivoted looked over the sights for targets in the chaos and scramble below vectored in on one muzzle flash as yet unquelled and put three or four rounds into that spot directly behind where instinct told him a shooter crouched if a man was there he either went down hard or scampered back under the overhang of the balconies so that no angle was available to ray then rays eyes were drawn to a melee in the center of the space below him and he saw that some kind of fight had broken out a pileon as hostages had trapped and were beating on one of their tormentors but he had no shot the coup de swat consisted of some neatly tuned disobedience thats my unit moving back the officer had said twenty minutes back as they crouched in the shadows of the parking lot across from the rio grande entrance they all have the black helmets from bravo company for that cool delta look it is cool another guy had said we tried to get them but the budget go ahead jefferson had said okay so why dont we go to them trade helmets and send them back to incident command if they keep their helmets on nobodys going to know its them and not us i know nick crewes who commands over there hell go for it and then were real close if the fucking balloon goes up said someone else and if it doesnt who knows so this meant jefferson and his ad hoc team of allstar swat mutineers were still in strike distance to the rio grande entrance and they didnt need an official order to go when they heard andrews orders to his gunmen they just went it was a quick dash to the entrance and both shotgunners laid muzzles next to the same metal door lock and fired simultaneously metal hit metal with a clang of super energy that combined with the percussion of the two shells firing sounded nuclear in its decibel level nobody blinked they were so full of adrenaline so ready to close and shoot after the hours of doing nothing the door torqued under the double slam of two hardmetal missiles being sent into its innards at a thousand feet per second and warped twisting showing two blisters and two smears of superheated carbon where the breaching rounds had tunneled through jefferson gave a hard wrench andthe door didnt budge goddamn he screamed and yanked and pulled but it didnt move inside they could hear the shots theyre shooting oh christ its a war came a terrified voice oh christ thought neal think think thank god for television was it a world war ii movie nazis hunting a clandestine radio in an apartment building they have the signal they just dont have the floor one by one they turn off the power on each floor and when the radio broadcast is interrupted they know their guy is on that floor thank you nazis thank you television neal dragged the icon to power down all and turned off every single realdeal outlet in every single mall strip mall town suburban shithole whatever in america from toledo to tucson from new york to natchez and along any other axis you cared to chart they all went blank all four hundredodd of them for a second then one by one by ten by twenty they came back on as branch managers went to their boards pressed restore and got their juice back on fast and the two hundred screen images back on that is all except one where the branch manager was lying on the floor hoping not to get shot surrounded by weepy clerks and sobbing customers all clenched in prayer neal dragged to that one clicked on it to bring it up looked for links clicked on that and found himself in a program called memtac went to the pictorial found lockdown engaged put the cursor on it and clicked lockdown disengaged came the message youre terminated fucker he thought with the clunky sound of large pieces of metal shifting the doors shivered and popped amid the stench of burned powder go go shouted jefferson as his people raced in semiauto lasers on look for targets but the order was largely meaningless as all six of them knew that what they found was the corridor called rio grande overflooded with a torrent of escapees coursing down the hallway at them as the outer margins of the hostage crowd had already begun its race to freedom and safety overwhelming the gunner meant to stop them by sheer numbers he got off a few shots and then was pierced from above by one of dave mcelroys s and taken from the fight and from the planet both forever so the swat team formed a flying wedge waving mps screaming police police make way and magically the torrent spread admitting them they could hear shooting up ahead see more chaos had no idea other shooters were already engaging the killers the team spread out bent low looking for targets as they moved to circle those who still stood and fired two spotted a gunman fleeing into a cd store and pursued him saw his feet as shadows where he crouched in terror behind a freestanding shelf unit popped their fire selection levers to full auto and hosed the rack with thirty rounds apiece blowing images of rap groups cw stars and gospel music groups to shreds as they destroyed all that stood between them and their target the gunman himself took close to forty hits in the few seconds that he remained standing against the onslaught and when they got to him they found him as dead as ancient history meanwhile in the center of silliland amid a pile of squirming hostages a man rose in majestic thunder with his ak a conan a shaka zulu an attila as if hed just crushed his enemy driven them to the sea and heard the lamentations of their women and in character he shouted a medieval bellow of warriorhood as if he dared anyone to shoot him they shot him anyway could this really be happening possibly it wasnt really happening you know it was so unlikely that it almost certainly wasnt happening but it seemed to be happening colonel obobo closed his eyes held them tight shut and when he opened them yes dammit it still seemed to be happening the monitors leaped to life as andrew nicks restored the malls security cameras with the click of a mouse and the imagery poured into the command van the assembled police officers watched as the young men of brigade mumbai opened fire on the crowd the contrast between the muzzle flashes and the unlit darkness of the crowd was so marked that the imagery resolved itself quickly enough into abstraction the piercing stab of the flash essentially blowing all detail out of the backdrop so that the screens only showed whitehot light and jumble incomprehensible to the eye colonel should i send in swat asked major carmody find jefferson somebody else said where the hell is that guy why isnt he doing anything colonel it would probably be a good idea to tell swat to blow the doors and meanwhile i think we ought to alert the fbi and our own snipers on the roof to engage where the fuck is jefferson came another cry he was bitching all day about standing around and now the partys started and hes out to lunch but obobo said nothing he seemed utterly baffled by the craziness on the screens above him after all who could make sense of that insanity finally he said i dont want undue risk visavis the hostages lets let the situation clarify before sir theyre shooting the hostages for gods sake said carmody we have to stop them i dont want to judge hastily maybe theyre bluffing maybe this is another warning maybe theyll stop shooting i see no need to further agitate them sir i what was wrong with these people when he spoke with his calm deliberation his firm perfect eye contact his empathy and compassion welling in his voice he expected to be listened to it had always been that way thats all gentlemen he said thats my decision now you all wait until it clarifies and then contact me mr renfro call my car will you please ill be outside with that he turned grabbed his coat and left the room for a moment the officers stared at each other stupefied then one by one they went back to the monitors i think someone said we must have some people in there i dont know where they came from but that sounds more like a gun battle than a massacre all watched as fleet swat operators blackclad and bent aggressively as if their posture alone could protect them entered the screens from various angles shooting as they moved their laser beams also vivid slashes against the confusion darting this way and that the monitors captured two swat heroes blowing the hell out of a terrorist in a cd shop and then on another screen a man in the center of the crowd was brought down by multiple hits good fucking shooting someone said there was some kind of blast from up top somebody said somehow the snipers blew the skylight and i think theyre firing too jesus christ said carmody he turned to mr renfro im going to send swat in for backup he said almost tentatively youll be violating the colonels orders said renfro but without much conviction his pasty white face normally so flaccid displayed strain through tightened jowls and harsh cords standing out on the neck but maybe you should and a tide of phlegm rose in his throat and he cleared it with a growl of breath urggghhhh i dont know ii just dont know all units carmody said into his throat mike you are authorized to close and engage as soon as swat deploys im authorizing first responders to set up triage units at each entranceway and have stretcher teams and gurneys ready to deploy when and if the mall is secure alert all emergency medical sites to prepare for incoming under siren but we have no idea as to casualty figures yet it could be considerable theyd better get all their people in and suited up ambulances larry someone said and get ambulances to the entrances to ferry the wounded do that asap then it was quiet for a second until a majors voice arose from the darkness as the battle on the screens played out with the swat guys shooting from standing from moving from kneeling pushing in getting closer go babies go he said maahir had more or less forgotten about jihad and martyrdom hed forgotten everything except for the sex part he liked killing too and taking money from the wallets of the dead but the best part was the sex and further sex and rape to him were the same thing or at least in his experience always had been when the order came from the imam he alone among the gunmen did not unsling his weapon to open fire instead with his strength his majesty his fearsome warriors vitality he strode through the crowd as the kneeling mortals rolled away from him screaming and begging for mercy scum no warriors here this day hah death did not frighten him as he had faced it and dealt it many times and not just for jihad secretly he didnt give a fuck one way or the other for jihad it was just that jihad offered the best opportunity for brigandage which was his calling for loot which was his love and for flesh which was his obsession particularly on the wrenlike bones of a child virgin he knew exactly where the child was he smashed and pummeled his way to her now she was his and he had never seen one like this chinese so pale so frightened so delicate he loved the tendrils of her tiny ears the perfection of her mouth a rosebud yet to open the length and smoothness of her arms the grace of her hands and fingers he imagined her naked in fear of him obedient to his will forced to this blasphemy or that and the result was a tumescence as hard and gigantic as a mountain he would have her he reached her cowering in the arms of her ancient protectormother aunt grandma whateverand he kicked that old biddy aside freeing the child for his taking he bent reached her clasped his strong hand on her frail biceps and pulled her to him and the lights went out bigtime except behind his eyes where soviet rockets detonated filling the night sky with incandescence he blinked his way back to reality the old bitch had hit him hard with her bag swung fullcrescent around her head and it had landed with such force he realized now she must have filled it with lead but just as his vision restored itself she hit him again flush to the head and his mind filled with stars it was as if the heavens had collapsed on his skull and he experienced a moment of utter stupidity and then a tide of other bitches swarmed on him the audacity of them the fury the arrogance none alone had the strength to prevent him from blowing snot from his nostrils but taken together their weight and squirmy ripping rage kept him flat longer than he expected he bucked he writhed he shouted finally he bit some limb that presented itself and was rewarded with the sound of a scream and the taste of hot blood and he got a leg free to kick someone away he shimmied to the right and then he rose screaming the mob of women rolling off him hyenas vultures exiled old lionesses with driedup ovaries scavengers of the plains he would kill them all he snatched his rifle up eyes blazing with hatred and screamed in somali whores and sluts now i shall rip hearts from your bodies before i fuck them and then noted the constellation of red dots upon his chest fireflies actually they were laser dots followed immediately by mm bullets that struck him so hard and fast they felt like the coming of rain and he had a last sad sense of the long topple to earth nikki was looking for the sniper she called chicago who seemed to be all over the place she spotted him in a crowd of snipers roughly at racine halfway up the western shore of lake michigan film on the snipers film on the snipers she screamed and in another second or two he had fallen away and in the second after that a shear of light blew a hole in lake michigan unleashing a sharp hit of percussion felt even by her jesus i got it screamed larry the camera vet who had just recorded the only image of the skylight demolition which would be seen around the world for the next seventytwo hours theyre assaulting nikki yelled even as she watched chicago reassemble himself at the shattered hole in the glass lake and begin the hunt for targets go go goddammit she commanded and because she was so fast the wusscopter led the mad airborne charge of media helicopters heretofore locked in obedient formation at three thousand feet as it broke and scattered theirs not to reason why theirs only to get really cool vid for a network feed down down down through the faltering dark capn tom took the wusscopter so hard and fast that each of the three other occupants rose slightly from their seats feeling the impression of weightlessness the two camera jocks held on for dear life but nikki the warrior princess and mary tyler moore from hell was screaming go go go get us to the exit goddammit tom go then she turned back in the craft to the two older men get out there we need some fucking pictures being yelled at by an enflamed and enraged nikki was actually a lot more frightening than freefall under the guidance of a slightly drunk exmarine in his sixties and so they squirmed forward and started shooting and since they were first they got the only good feed under the right lens and in sharp focus of mike jeffersons illegal swat team racing into the mall through entrance se guns hot and loaded and in another thirty seconds the doors all of them at this entrance sprang open and a human tide of refugees poured out simultaneously columns of ambulances red lights flashing began to course toward that entranceall entrances in factfrom different directions medics and docs disembarked setting up triage stations while gurney teams stood by waiting for the doorway to clear as the hostages continued to rush from the building nikki whats going on asked an anchorman whose name she had momentarily forgotten well it appears that even as the terrorist leader ordered his men to open fire swat elements of some sort some outside the building led by snipers on the roof assaulted the terrorist team possibly theres a gunfight going on in the amusement center right now but the hostages have either been freed or have made some kind of escape that crowd of people you see pouring out of the southeast entrance those are fleeing hostages and you can see that medical personnel have moved into place to handle the wounded i dont know if the news is good or bad i dont have a casualty report i dont know whats going on inside yet but events here at america the mall appear to have reached their crescendo she heard the anchorman say we have yet to receive acknowledgment of an assault from command we have no idea where those swat members came from we dont know whos inside nikkis phone buzzed nikki swagger she said answering it im out im out screamed the voice and she recognized it as amanda birkowskys the clerk in purses bags and whatnot amanda can i put you on air i dont care i just wanted to thank you nikki switched to marty and said put me on live i have a witness and marty was fast for the first time in his life nikki swagger wufftv i am talking to a witness amanda birkowsky who hid in a store throughout the ordeal amanda can you tell us what happened we heard shots and screams and then right away some kind of explosioni dont know what happened as if somebody blew something upand then more shots it was a gunfight just like in the movies then the hostages went racing by and i ran with them and the doors were all open and people hiding in the stores all up and down the corridor came rushing along and were out now did you see any casualties i saw people crying i heard gunfire behind from all directions i dont know how many were hit or killed but i just want to say thank you thank you thank you to those brave policemen who came in and fought for us oh they were so brave amanda find a first aid station make sure youre okay call your mom and please please relax and rest and thank you for your courage and help of course that feed over the images of chaos below the images of the detonation and then of the swat team penetrating went national in about thirty seconds and international in about thirty more pm pm nadif and khadar were almost certainly the most harmless of the somali gunmen thus the universe awarded them the cruelest deaths in accordance with its policy of punishing the meek the most savagely now that hell was breaking loose they found the idea of shooting the innocent somewhat disturbing it was one thing to be in combat as both had been where the targets were fleeting and shadowy another to simply blast people in blue jeans and baseball caps even if as white devils their faces were indistinct blurs and expressed no emotion whatsoever yes they fired in a somewhat haphazard fashion from the hip passiveaggressive to the end more or less sloppily pumping out a round a second as the white people rose and rushed in total panic by them but neither could find it in their heart to kill and so they angled their shots slightly upward blasting the facade of the secondtier balcony about one hundred yards across the silliland park from where they stood a large explosion from above frightened them and drove them back and then also from above someone shot nadif in the leg not a serious wound but it drove the two of them back even farther in seconds it seemed that american frogmenninjas were among themhow on earth had they gotten there so fast with guns with long piercing red beams that sought to supply death to whomsoever they touched they watched as maahir emerging from a sea of angry women was brought down by a host of red dots that had bullets attached magically both young men panicked but in different ways nadif decided to climb to heaven while khadar awarded himself a boat trip it actually was a log hed been eyeing the log flume ride for some time finding it unbearably interesting the water was so blue and smelled so fresh it had no alligators algae dead fish or oil slick in it he raced up the ramp to what he had concluded was its starting station and found himself in some sort of loading area where a lot of logs were lined up bobbing in the bluegreen liquid it occurred to him to climb into one and hide and wait until he was arrested but he somehow knew that wasnt what was called for he wished he had figured out how to make the logs go along the track where at a certain point they were magically hoisted uphillbut water doesnt run uphill does it pushed through a tunnel then sent zooming down a whirlwind of twists and turns wheeeee but he had no idea instead he leaped into the water which was warm as piss and tried to run toward the upward mechanism fifty or so feet away figuring that stairs were somehow under the froth and that he could get up the ramp and out of harms way alas his splashing attracted ninjas who rose to the platform he himself had just occupied and they yelled at him almost desperately in a language he didnt understand without hesitation he unslung his baby kalash and made as if to fire though he couldnt remember if the safety was on or not and immediately the water around him broke up into a disturbance of geysers and spray as his hunters fired first and he was pulled down into the bluegreen urine amid bubbles and from somewhere a gushing red cloud as for khadar his choice of death ride was the wild mouse he did not actually have time to get in a car and go for a ride even if hed known how to run it but he made his way over fences and through an artificial garden easily enough to the structure of the device itself a steel latticework that rose four stories toward the skylights he began to climb clearly for maintenance purposes the supporting network of beams and buttresses had been engineered to allow a fairly athletic fellow access to any portion of the track and so up he scooted graceful and nimble propelled by the power of lean strong muscles and thin long bones up up he went climbing to the hump of the highest hill with the idea he supposed of getting up there unnoticed and lying flat on the track he had a brief fantasy in which this strategic move allowed him to escape and he disappeared into minneapoliss somali community acquired fake papers married had children and a long and happy life but he had been noticed unfortunately by a sniper it was mcelroys last kill and the one that would haunt him the others were armed and had been dropped as a lifesaving necessity as duty compelled but this guy was wide open from the back his rifle hung by sling over a shoulder and for all the world he looked like nothing more menacing than some kind of hautebourgie recreational climber the guy who reads outside magazine and shops at rei and tells everybody he wants to do mount mckinley then the matterhorn and as for the hindu kush well well see thered been a guy just like that in the cleveland field office at the same time the guy was armed and he was heading vigorously to an elevation from which he could do violence to swat guys and citizens so mcelroys pause lasted less than a second and was shortened even further by his spotter saying dave target on roller coaster structure about ten oclock looks to be over a hundred it wasnt so radical a downhill angle so mcelroy didnt hold low but rather let the crosshairs settle between the shoulder blades as he began his press and maybe theyd passed a little beneath that ideal spot when the trigger broke the results were pathetic of course the gunman didnt fall immediately he was too strong and limber his feet went one of his arms spasmed out and he hung for maybe three seconds by one arm and one of his legs twitched then his final four fingers yielded on the death grip he slid off into gravity the tip of his shoe hit a strut and flipped him backward and he fell almost horizontally striking the earth backside first so that his legs and arms splayed outward in the dust that rose from the flower bed whose buds he crushed great shot said the spotter thats three or is it four he was three but its like prairie dog shooting said mcelroy in that it gets thin fast ray could see no one left to shoot and by this time from somewhere swat operators had broken into the amusement park and were clearing hed watched them take down a big guy in a scrum of angry women pursue another into a store where a double burst of full auto suggested game over and finally his vision was provoked by rapid movement on the periphery and he saw a gunman in midfall from the top of the roller coasters biggest hill to hit and bounce and then go limp in a flower bed yells reached him from the operators below clear left tangos down clear right tangos down clear in center i think all tangos down check tangos be careful shoot if you see movement the swat team moved through the melancholy ritual of mopup never fun for anybody and then nick heard we are clear we are clear many civilians down get medical in here fastest someone from command came over the net this is command clear for medical clear for medical get those medics in there and begin to assist the wounded all aid stations wounded incoming okay ray said to lavelva as he reloaded a fresh mag in his kalash now im going into the place where i think this kid is hiding you stay here you stay down do not move fast do not go down on your own this is a tricky time you could get shot by some hot dog real easily do you hear ray you dont have to do this thing well im closest ray its over let them police take that boy thats their job let em do it for once you just sit here by me and rest we get some french fries he smiled i hear you yes i do but thats not how it works i have to finish this thing im closest maybe he knows secret ways out or places to hide maybe he means to set up and kill a lot of people one last timewhatever the sooner he is put down the better and as it has worked out i represent sooner im going with you said lavelva sweetie this is tactical entry closequarters battle you need to know what youre doing and i cant be thinking on you im giving you a marine corps order you sit down over there and wait till the good guys arrive he turned went back to his iphone mcelroy and anyone else im now going into first person shooter after this kid and whoever cruz this is memphis take off your scarf and whatever youre wearing on the outside you have a white tshirt on its marine od webley you direct all first responders not not i say again to engage an armed figure in an od tshirt theres a young african american woman here too said ray lavelva she is tops she was with me the whole way she should not be engaged either she will be sitting outside unarmed with her hands in plain sight get that webley im putting it out now said webley they should be up there soon ray go get em im off good luck marine said mcelroy im on you with backup far as i can go ray clambered up but lavelva tried one last time ray why are you such a goddamned hero heroes die young and hard and leave their girlfriends all swole up with weepy snot on their faces maybe so but i have ancestors to answer to from china no much worse from arkansas the shooting had stopped andrew turned to face the grave demeanor of the imam who also realized that it was almost time andrew felt a little like another one of his heroes hitler in the fuhrerbunker with the russian peasant army up above he rose went to the game console pushed a button and a memory stick popped out which he in turn dropped into a buffered envelope already addressed and stamped he sealed it and handed it over to the imam you will be all right i will take you to the doorway you will go up your pilot will land and you will be gone in the mess no one will even notice its going to get way crazy around here then you drop that in a canadian mailbox and it goes to a canadian letter drop for wikileaks theyll know what to do with it a little editing a little tightening add a timeline and some production values and you have the greatest fps game ever made you have the greatest story ever told it will live for a million years do you understand i do my brother but it is not too late you can come with me nah never in the cards i always knew and im prepared narrative rules it needs a climax weve got a hero im the villain of the piece we need a duel he and i must fight to the death whichever one of us goes down itll make the narrative complete wikileaks will patch that stuff in from cnn and from all the cell phone vid dont worry so be it then my friend if i see allah ill say hello to him for you and hope there are some virgins left i will see you in paradise or hell whatever the two men hugged yet there was nothing left to say and time was short the imam turned with his treasure exited the back door andrew picked up his ipad checked to see that it was receiving wireless feeds from all the gun cameras selected number four and brought it up he saw what the gun muzzle of the man stalking him saw which was the steady progress down rio grande toward the fps store where he andrew awaited andrew picked up his own ak the one without the gun camera and slung it he turned and slipped into the interior corridor raced past doorways and finally pushed one in and stepped into the back of a payless shoe store a group of women crouched in horror nearby are you the police one of them asked not exactly he said ray did a quick passby on the first person shooter doorway saw that the store inside appeared to be empty he ran a last check on the ak making sure he was cocked and unlocked then went in hard and low cqbstyle gun at the shoulder moving erratically eyes dilated so wide in the scan for data you could have landed a plane in them posters of ubermenschen with the latest in stylized assault rifles stood heroically on all the walls like in some sort of waffenss fantasyland as well as a couple of bulletin boards that tracked i killer tournament progress quotes from battle gurus like napoleon bedford forrest jeff cooper sun tzu all very nerd technowar the place however didnt have that marine smell of sweat but the scent of something else plastic wrapping most of the free spacedark and shadowy without lightswas given to racks of games in the center of the room he prowled around them going in low coming up in shooterready position finger aching to fire at every shadow or hint of substance but the only thing to behold were the games themselves neatly racked cover outnot just fpses but every war game known to man from every war known to man for every style of computer known to man no sign no sound no movement he declared the place cleared the door to some interior chamber stood behind the cash register counter and he went to that kicked it hard went in lowprofile and again was met by silence and stillness perceiving a gloom penetrated by the glow of electron light it was the room of screens the lair of the beast it felt empty too but ray dashed from position to position to make sure yes clear now he freed his concentration up to assess this had to be the hq of the mission on the wall security feeds lit screens that showed mostly empty corridors except for the first level where frenzy was the mode of the day medics hustled the wounded were attended to swat guys offered perimeter security and everyone tried to help and get a hold on what exactly had transpired who were good guys who bad the whole law enforcement crime scene drill but on the other wall he saw an odd array of camera feeds displaying well nothing all seemed still the images were black or horizontal and meaningless though occasionally there was the blur of boots and shoes hustling by or the nothingness of a wall a few inches away what the fuck was this one seemed more agile than all the others number four and he looked closely and saw a pair of shoes new balances the same model he was wearing and jesus christ those were his shoes this little fucker had clamped a wireless camera on the rifles he looked and behind the muzzle of his kalash he saw a neatly milled unit connected to the barrel by some kind of clamp and the unit held a lens among all the tactical geegaws mounted on the akvertical foregrip a receiver with a picatinny rail new iron backup sightshe hadnt even noticed it he pointed it at the screen and got that infinity of mirrors thingwhere the camera records itself recording itself over and over again and the image diminishes in size as it sinks toward nothingnessbut kept it moving so if andrew was watching he wouldnt tumble to the fact that ray had tumbled to the fact the game lavelva was so right in his sick mind this strange genius boy had invented in real time and space the biggest first person shooter in the world and had recorded it with wireless video for some editor in some bunker to put together some giant cyberdeath tournament based on imagery from todays adventure in slaughter but now he realized for the first time i know something he doesnt i know that he knows where i am and what im doing at all times thats how he knew i was coming through that door even now on the move hes receiving my feed hes laughing at me waiting for me to come he set the rifle down pointing to nothing and moved to a central chair in a mesh of star trek consoles wired into everything by a jungle of cord hanging behind them and went and crouched at the big screen of what appeared to be the mother computer the image still seemed to hold the security system main menu and he quickly slid the mouse around until hed nested it on elevator access punched enter saw some flickers and heard some clicks and finally an icon lit up explaining elevators enabled then escalators enabled but he noted the doors had already been opened huh the phone on the desk rang he paused waited finally picked it up youre the hero someone said is this andrew ray said youd better give yourself up the place is full of cops theyll shoot you in a second ill take you alive god you are a hero you are fucking john wayne this is so cool i could never have written this look kid youre going to ride the needle for sure no lie but thatll take years and for all those years you and i both know youll be god to millions of people as fucked up as you are but not nearly as resourceful youll love every second of it and youll love the hatred everyone else pours on you and you will have the time of your life dont pretend thats not what this is all about youve got it wrong duke its not about that im shallow but not that shallow its about the game and the game needs a big bang finish so you better come for me before all those minneapolis ice fishermen get up to this floor and shoot me to swiss cheese its so much cooler if you kill me or we kill each other and give the thing a gleam of mythic tragedy by the way if you want to find me heres a subtle hint im in the movie complex give yourself up i cant were at the hyper level of the game i have to see who wins pm pm andrew was disappointed in the popcorn it had gone cool and stale and had toughened somewhat now a good employee of the regal theater chain a true professional would have stayed on station keeping the popcorn hot throughout the massacre because you never could tell when somebody would want some fine freshly popped popcorn you just cant find good help these days he sat in one of the megaplexs fifteen auditoriums down the hall a quartermall rotation over to mississippi from first person shooter watching a flow of images above him it was an old favorite and he was happy to see that the roboscreening mechanism had kept the images onscreen even if the human part of the system seemed to have failed though you wouldnt want to judge a whole program on just one example in this movie lots of gunfire lots of dying lots of smart snarky talk the hero in an undershirt with a jersey accent it was pretty good maybe the best in the series even if some of the conventions of audience appealthe cute rotund black cop for examplewere by now a tiresome trope he would have fastforwarded through them if it were possible now and then he looked at his ipad which still received the camera feed from number four that is the gun muzzle view of the hero who was now stalking him giving andrew the mans precise location he doubted he would show up in an undershirt no no andrew imagined some swat captain in a black combat outfit maybe with a wool watchcap and one of those mikes bent around his face probably a dad never done this before scared to death the whole way yet in the obdurate squareness of mindset utterly committed to the rules give yourself up yeah right you have the right to remain blah blah blah and blah the guy should have warriorpure thoughts at this time he should be thinking kill this little motherfucker but no not in modern america he was probably thinking will i get in trouble because i snapped at commander jackson a few minutes ago will this count as overtime will i be so hung up in paperwork im not free to go on my caribbean cruise with the unit next week should i hire an agent for the movie version or should i write a book first and if so where would i find an actual writer to put the words on paper that kind of thinking could get you killed andrew checked again the guy was outside the movie theater running his gun muzzle over the box office now the camera bounced hard as he made a dash to that structure took cover behind it and tracked the gun muzzle through the door scanning the vast but abandoned refreshment stand peering hard into the darker lounge areas where sofas and chairs had been set up in pathetic imitation of the typical american living room then another dash as he moved into a position to scan the corner closet where the maintenance people ran their operation seeing a few tippedover garbage cans on wheels dumped sweeper brooms stacks of toilet paper for the johns and vats of soap for the sinks no paper towels though this theater complex clearly had those awful blowdry things nothing there our hero crept around the corner and at last confronted the long corridor off which each of the auditoriums was sited the guy had to know that he andrew was in one of them would he get it right would he go by trial and error would reinforcements arrive would he call for backup hmm probably hed go straight ahead because he had to realize that andrew knew the mall forward and backward and might know all kinds of escape routes and could even yet this late in the game make a getaway so he had to move fast and close the distance make the arrest or the kill andrew chuckled softly this was really cool it was working out so much better than hed thought even if the kill number looked as though it would be the one disappointment hed thought those kids would do a better job but it seemed that so many of them had been secretly taken down that the remaining guys could never get any heavy fire going and the few that were left sort of wimped out at the end and werent willing to aim and kill systematically as they had been instructed no you really couldnt get good help anymore his back to the wall ray slid down the corridor under art deco goldenmovieage affectations posters of improbably beautiful human beings another abandoned garbage can on wheels to the first door in one of the auditoriums before him the kid andrew lurked probably set up behind the seats waiting for someone to pop in silhouetted in the glare of the door lit from the front by the glow of the screen andrew would blast him down then maybe escape by some predetermined route only he knew yet if ray didnt press the boy might vanish just the same and the little bastard was so smart and had all this stuff so wired maybe hed actually have figured out some way to beat the game ray looked at the signs jutting into the hallway each a minimarquee bearing the name of the flick on display inside sure junior might play on that too that was him nihilistic but in a funny way hip ironic thought everything was a joke even saw himself as a comedian as he took down the system on its biggest day it wouldnt be worth it if he had to do it as some little arab commando type cornily shrieking his allegiance to allah no andrew was too cool for that hed do it but the trick was to do it insouciantly with some kind of snarky comedy element so that no matter how it turned out his followersthered be millions in the way these things workedwould get the joke smile at it and hold a special regard in their heart for the great andrew nicks cool to the end cooler than dylan and eric cooler than cho cooler than jared ray heard movie music blaring from the theater he was closest to looked up saw it was some disney family comedy no way andrew would be caught alive much less dead in such a travesty of happyfam cliche ray realized its become a pop quiz on movie irony to have a chance at him i have to know which theater hes in to know that i have to decipher the names and meanings of the movies and decide which one would best express his sensibility too bad roger ebert isnt here to advise me he read the titles and he knew of course had to be no other that was it that was the one it was fifth in line on the lefthand side ray sidled up to it trying to figure how to he knows im here hell know exactly when im coming through because hes extrapolating from the imagery of my guncam thats the gig and that gives him a onesecond start on the action curve and thats the one second he uses to dust me i pop in blink cant see he lays the front sight and jerks off three fast ones from pointblank range and im down he goes out the back or whatever maybe he kills himself but thats what the narrative demands he and i together at last rays back and andrews got him laurel and hardy martin and lewis scorsese and de niro andrew and ray ray had about two seconds or so to decide what to do and he looked up and down the corridor for inspiration while loud thriller music came out of the room just beyond the doors singing the adrenalgoosing rhapsody of syncopated fx destruction of shots and blasts and falls and deaths in time with a percussion line holding the back beat while the guitar chords moved forward relentlessly on toward armageddon or at least the and end ray let his muzzle rise to the marquee above the entrance so that andrew so near so ready for this knew that he was here at last ready for his closeup the imam made it to the stairwell leading to the roof he climbed the metal stairs hearing his steps echo into nothingness and reached the door itself he pulled his phone from his jacket went to contacts and punched the number no need for an answer the pilot would feel the vibe of the phone in his pocket drop down and the imam would run twenty feet to the open door lunge inside and off theyd go running low and without lights next stop canada then the long secret trip home then infinite glory the love of the faith the thrill of being mohamed atta without the inconvenience of a fiery martyrdom and then finally years and years of glory beyond the loveliness of death and the embrace and adoration of allah himself he opened the doorit clicked easily from the inside according to fire department regulationsand stepped onto the roof the sun had set leaving an apocalyptic purple smear across lowhanging clouds like a wound in the wall of the universe itself signifier of end times a cold breeze struck him filled his lungs with hope and yet the spectacle before him was so extraordinary he could not but respond with utter fascination it was like a scene from a war of the last century where airmen fought in planes with double wings looping and swirling close at hand missing each other by inches skidding this way and that birdlike and deft a true flock of death machines the craft of course were helicopters not biplanes and now at the moment of climax theyd lost all sense of propriety and were swooping and jockeying for position hovering low then darting away the air was aswarm with them not so much as objects of defined specificity but as presences blurs of weight and motion lit by red and white lights against the material of their construction while the beating of their rotors buffeted him powerfully the sounds of the many petroldriven engines throbbed loudly contributing their own vibrations to what he felt as he entered the maelstrom he hunched down next to the door itself contained in a tiny shacklike structure on the edge of the vast roof one of many such abutments rises and abstractions that made the roof its own kind of featureless wilderness in the mostly dark he pulled out a flashlight scrunched it on and began to wave it aware of how tiny a signal it was in the immense cauldron of airborne activity yet the angel watched over him one of the whirling birds immediately detached itself from the mass overhead and though he couldnt identify it by type he knew by the purposeful dive on his orientation that it was his ticket to mecca first person shooter andrew crouched behind a row of seats that yielded a perfect angle on the doorway into the auditorium gun in one hand ipad delicately balanced on his left knee he saw what his opponents gun muzzle covered the man looked up to the marquee again rifle already mounted so andrew saw the name of the film playing behind him on the big screen then he saw the muzzle come down he saw the man point it at the door steel himself a last time and make ready for this most basic yet most dangerous of all fps exercises the tactical entry the camera closed on the door losing detail in blur and at that precise moment andrew rose lifted rifle to shoulder shifted his view from virtual to real the gunsight before him was not electrons in cyberspace but cold eastbloc killing technology at the apogee the genius mikhail kalashnikov had achieved and exactly as the door flew open ten feet from where he crouched in the seats and the man came in low and hard and straight to andrew andrew shot him three times putting three pills at about three thousand per deep into his center mass but exactly as andrews focus clarified he saw that he had not shot a man moving low and fast but a garbage can on wheels with an ak and gun barrel minicam secured at the plastic rim and at that moment the man revealed himself behind the door frame and andrew light being faster than sound or bullets saw three huge flashes blossom from his cupped handsclassic isosceles like all the books saidand then he found himself lurching backward catching clumsily on an armrest and twisting into the chair very wet three deep and throbbing wounds beginning to generate enormous pain in seconds a face loomed before him the face of a kind of halfchinese guy with a crew cut knocking his gun away and talking into a phone saying mcelroy i got him hes hit bad get medics up here fast im in theater five in the movie complex he looked down at the young man who coughed and said i thought id get bruce willis but i got keanu fucking reeves the turbulence pitched the wusscopter to the right badly and only capn toms skills eroded or not kept them airborne even as the man cursed goddamn him it was the kpop traffic copter beelining by them and missing only by inches as it descended toward the vast roof beneath them both camera jocks cursed too the brush with death particularly bitter in their mouths and minds as the danger part was supposed to be over but nikki alone watched the traffic bird diminish as it descended tom she said what kind of copter is that i dont recognize the type moving so fast i could hardly tell i think its an alouette a french bird they use em for agricultural spraying and do they use em for media nikki asked sharply well now that you mention it i cant recall she saw the small agile helicopter settle on the roof adjacent to what was barely recognizable as some kind of shack that housed a door hes terrorist she said suddenly hes fake hes here to help somebody get away moment of silence in the chopper despite the crescendo of noise pouring in from all sides and the waves of turbulence flushing through the open doors what to do what to do nikki knew get over there on top of him dont let him take off weve got to stop him and call fiveoh get cops here fast and you guys get those cameras running goddammit capn tom veered hard right on rotor pitch upped the rpms on his big bell engine and began a vietnamlzunderfire power dive toward his prey the helicopter settled twentyfive yards away its rotors pushing the air out like swells of ocean and the imam stepped into their full force then stepped back lowered adjusted and solidified his posture and began the short run to the aircraft it looked like some kind of large mechanical insect its vivid bulb cockpit somehow representing eyes its delicate landing struts folded legs its frail pipelike fuselage standing for thorax and the whirling blades in their blur representing the flashing of wings he saw haji beckoning him forward and he got to the thing used the landing strut as a footrest and hoisted himself upward and into the empty seat praise be to allah he looks after us he screamed and though the other man could not possibly hear him he smiled back squeezing him firmly on the wrists then turned his attention back to the controls before him and the flight outward but at that second another presence was suddenly upon them in horror the imam looked up and saw through the encompassing bubble another helicopter settle over them sealing them in a little coffin of airspace the strange craft being larger and faster able to impose its will on them go go he screamed you must go but the pilot above was agile with his heavier machine and when haji meant to zoom forward somehow the intruder beat him to the space and infringed upon his angle preventing him and so it went sideways and backward and the imam watched in horror as hajis face clenched into despair yielding to the look of the hunted go up he will not stand against you the imam screamed unaware of the fundamental stupidity of ramming the enemy copters skids with his own aircrafts whirling rotors but that is indeed what happened either by intention or imprecise maneuver and the smaller alouette shook spastically as its rotors broke apart on the struts beneath the wuffcopter huey and unstabilized began to chase its own tail as it spun finding a last surge before it gave over to its death spiral the imam screamed as the jaws of hell on this earth opened wide and the flames were so hot so very hot stop talking snapped ray youre hit in both lungs and bleeding out and im going to try and stop the bleeding relax think about something nice the medics will be here soon andrew laughed jokes on you he explained i wasnt in it for the money or the chicks but the glory as of tomorrow im the most famous man in the world and nobody will ever remember your name memo for next time always play the supervillain heroes are so last week he laughed again then winced as intent ray peeled the shemagh off andrews neck and tried to stanch the welling blood from the three mm entry punctures seeing that it was basically hopeless feeling despite the circumstances the depression he usually felt when someone bleeds out helplessly making ugly sounds twitching before going slack forever you might think im telling you to shut up ray said where are those goddamn guys you need transfusion surgical clamps and clotting agent fast where the hell are they he looked at the dying boys eyes and saw merriment you had to give it to him no contrition no bullshit andrew to the end keep fighting ray said you can stay around on willpower concentrate do not let yourself die fight goddammit the medics will be it doesnt matter andrew said tomorrow my game goes up on ipads and nintendo dss and their clones all over the world you cant stop it now ray held the scarf wadded hard against the wound producing the most blood outflow seemed to slow it for a bit but so hydraulic is the human body and so critically injured was the boy that the blood simply found another exit point and thus another wound increased its outflow in response thenan appalling thunderclap split the air accompanied by an instant flash of megaheat and illumination the flame sucked the air out of the auditorium that vacuum effect and then the flareup subsided and oxygen became again available ray breathed hard at the coolness even as he shielded andrew with his own body then turned to see that at the far end of the theater the roof had caved in under the thrust of a flaming machine a helicopter its bulb canopy shattered into a constellation of spiderweb fracture its struts bent melted or sheared its two passengers mute as the fire ate their corpses damn said andrew i hate it when that happens suddenly fbi people were all around ray and someone had grabbed him and pulled him out of the theater as medics squadded on andrew to perform services too late to matter how did you know how did you know someone in a helmet and goggles was yelling into his ear incomprehensibly i dont which theater the fed demanded he could have been in any of them ray gestured upward as more emergency personnel and other swat people ran by him the marquee on theater read the minneapolis film society presentsone night onlyhits of the eighties die hard yippiekiyay mf finally someone threw a sheet over dead santa mr renfro understood aggression is the key all right he said i am speaking for the colonel no officer is allowed to speak directly to media all media contacts will be cleared through this office i say again no media contact except through the superintendents office now get me this major jefferson fast excuse me sir who are you asked kemp i think i will control press access to fbi personnel in this instance no special agent this is a minnesota state police initiative i speak for the colonel on media relations and if need be i will get on the phone and get a court gag order on you in three minutes time and if you dont believe me you just watch it happen thus in time the official hero of the event mike jefferson was brought into renfros corner of the incident command trailer renfro cleared the room out before speaking to him congratulations he said now lets get to it heres the bargain you and i know that the colonel didnt exactly distinguish himself today so i am going to give you what you want i am going to get him the hell out of here that was always the plan anyhow this just accelerates it sir i shut up major i dont have time to argue i speak with the full authority of the colonels office here is the reality the media love him you know why as well as i do they yearn to credit him with a brilliant operation thus we will give them what they want he came up with the idea of these secret assaults and you followed it his plan worked out brilliantly he outthought and outfought this nutcase kid and all the somali gunmen thats the narrative get it he froze like a popsicle said jefferson if it werent for that sniper and some marine superman cutting their firepower in half and some genius kid in dc outcyberpunching that nasty little punk youre looking at a thousand dead citizens the colonel came up with a brilliant plan if you go to the media with another narrative they will destroy you and itll do you no good ill even tell you what the countermove is the colonel is so brilliant he knew that if he let you work up an assault plan it would be too compromised by ego turf overthinking politics grudges and pc considerations so he played you perfectly and when you had to act you didnt have time for any of that bullshit and so what you came up with was simple direct and effective a swat classic the ideal he wouldnt let you fail he put you in a position to succeed which is all any manager can do youre just not smart enough to see the nuance of the great ones genius are you trying to be funny and dont you think the race card will fall out of heaven and land on your skull youll be one of those jealous envious underlings who cannot stand that a black man outperformed them they will hound you until you are disgraced and your professional life is over my way he gets a big dc job and is gone he thanks and decorates and recommends you and you are golden forever whatever it is you choose to do you fucking spin guys you are the fucking ruination of the world you take everything thats real and decent and you twist it to some end in some game nobody even knew was on the table said jefferson nicely said but it is what it is welcome to the world we live in not the world we want to live in its a pretty good world for you jefferson dont forget that youll get a promotion and the sincere gratitude of colonel obobo its the best deal anyone will ever offer you nobody had stopped them from approaching and now they just stood there as hundreds of people raced by each with a call to make a story to tell a wound to be bound a loved one to contact nobody paid any attention to mr and mrs girardi they stood there as escapees from the mall flooded toward them okay said mr girardi showtime he threw off his lumpy overcoat to reveal a nicely tailored doublebreasted coat reached into his pocket and pulled out a stack of business cards folks he said jack scheister of the law firm scheister amp jackell folks youve gone through an ordeal and somebody should pay for it he started handing out cards to people most of whom were in such a state of shock they took them scheister amp jackellattorneys at lawhour law line we sue they rue folks his wife was saying as she handed out the cards im monica jackell you should be compensated for your time your pain your anguish and were here to see you get your justice and your cash three months later ray and molly sat in the bar of a restaurant in washington dc they were going to get married shortly and would be flying back to saint paul for the ceremony to which every hmong in america had been invited even old bob lee was flying in for this one mcelroy and his wife were coming as were nick memphis jake webley and will kemp lavelva would make it if she could get leave but she was in her third week of marine basic so it was doubtful but tonight before the week of marriage craziness started was just for them the order of the night was martinis vodka variant slightly dirty absolut no bullshit about shaking or stirring just whatever the bartender preferred ray didnt even know it was friday pretty late since she worked hard as did herecently appointed head instructor of sniper tactics for the fbi under ron fields out in quanticoand she in the legal department of the department of energy if you saw them youd see two asian american yuppies well preserved representing diversity on secure career paths but not unusual in the cosmopolitan dc restaurant scene look said molly its your sister indeed it was on the television the strikingly pretty girls face filled the screen over a network insignia and she earnestly reported the president today appointed colonel douglas oboboand a cutaway showed the handsome police executive shaking hands with the president in the white house media roomsuperintendent of the minnesota state police as the new and first black director of the federal bureau of investigation the colonel received nationwide attention on black friday last november when he led the response to the terrorist attack at america the mall in suburban minneapolisand the camera showed footage that nikkis cameraman had actually shot the vast americashaped building bleeding smoke and fire into the night as an ocean of ambulances and other emergency vehicles blinked lights around itand devised a daring secret assault plan that was credited with minimizing casualties in that horrible event only thirtyseven died and fewer than two hundred were wounded against figures that could have been vastly higher then the president spoke i know of no american who has served his country better in time of crisisand in time without crisis in the ordinary ebb and flow of law enforcement dutiesthan doug obobo he is one of the finest police officials in the nation without a doubt and i fully expect him to bring those attributes of courage intelligence and creativitybut most of all empathy and compassionto our premier federal law enforcement agency the two men shook hands as flashbulbs popped thats not quite the way i heard it said ray well gosh she said what do you know i mean its not like you were there or anything and they both laughed richly not the first laugh they had shared by any means but far far from the last
