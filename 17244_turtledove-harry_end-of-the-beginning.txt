harry turtledove end of the beginning days of infamy commander minoru genda walked past the front entrance to iolani palace fairy terns almost whiter than white floated through the blue blue hawaiian sky the flag of the newly restored kingdom of hawaii fluttered on five flagpoles above the latevictorian palace seeing that flag made genda smile the hawaiians had gone out of their way to accommodate both britain and the united states with the union jack in the canton and red white and blue horizontal stripes filling the rest of the field much good it did them the japanese officer thought white men economically dominated the kingdom of hawaii for years before america overthrew it and brought the islands under us control well things were different now the stars and stripes no longer flew over iolani palace the building no longer housed the legislature of the territory of hawaii as it had for decades king stanley owana laanuiking by the grace of god and much more to the point by that of the emperor of japanreigned here now along with his redheaded queen cynthia and where king stanley reigned major general tomoyuki yamashita whod commanded the japanese army forces that conquered hawaii ruled japanese soldiers stood guard at the top of the stairs leading up into the palace they werent big menfew of them had more than a couple of inches on gendas fivethreebut with their businesslike arisaka rifles they didnt need to be at the base of the stairs stood a squad of the revived royal hawaiian guard putting the tall men at the bottom and the small men at the top minimized the size difference between them king stanleys guardsmen wore pith helmets and blue coats with white belts purely ceremonial uniforms for purely ceremonial soldiers they carried bayoneted springfieldsthe japanese had captured them by the thousand from the us armybut genda had heard the rifles magazines held no cartridges the royal hawaiian guards came to an even stiffer brace as genda strode by them he nodded back politely acknowledging the compliment he turned a corner and then another one heading for the back of the palace more guards both hawaiian and japanese stood there another stairway led up into the building and a shorter narrower set of steps led down into iolani palace genda chose that stairway in the nineteenth century the basement had been the servants quarters it had also housed the storerooms where the kahilithe feathertopped royal staffsand the palace silver service the wine and other necessities were kept because at the last minute the architect had added a walled dry moat around the palace the basement rooms had fullsized windows and werent nearly so dark and gloomy as they would have been otherwise in front of one of the rooms along the wide central corridor stood two japanese sailors in landing rig their usual blues modified by blackpainted steel helmets infantrymens belts ammunition pouches and canteens and white canvas gaiters like the sentries outside they carried arisakas yes sir you wish one of them asked when genda stopped and faced them he gave his name adding i have an eleven oclock appointment with admiral yamamoto he didnt need to look at his watch to know he was ten minutes early being late to a meeting with the commanderinchief of the combined fleet was inconceivable both men saluted hai they said in unison the sailor whod spoken before opened the door for him admiral isoroku yamamoto worked at a plain pine desk nothing like the ornate wooden dreadnought in king david kalakauas library on the second floor of the palace the one general yamashita used genda thought that most unfair yamamoto outranked yamashita and should have taken over the finer work area but he hadnt done it he was in hawaii only temporarily and hadnt wanted to displace the permanent garrison commander yamamoto got to his feet as genda walked in they exchanged bows yamamoto was only slightly taller than genda but had a wrestlers stocky wideshouldered body sit down sit down he said now how are you feeling better i hope you look stronger than you did and you have more color too im much improved sir thank you genda said as he did sit hed had pneumonia when the japanese navy squared off against the us forces trying to retake hawaii despite the illness hed come up from akagis sick bay to the bridge to do what he could to help the japanese carriers against their american opposite numbers he didnt take credit for the victory but hed taken part in it more than a month after the fight he was starting to feel like his old self though he hadnt got there yet glad to hear it i was worried about you yamamoto said with gruff affection genda inclined his head most of a generation younger than the admiral he was yamamotos protege hed planned the biggest part of the pearl harbor operation and the invasion of hawaii hed planned themand yamamoto had rammed the plans through turning them into reality and now they were meeting in the basement of iolani palace the americans have been very quiet since we stopped them genda remarked hai yamamoto nodded i think they will stay quiet a while longer too i am going to take this opportunity to go back to japan now that hawaii is settled for the time being we have to talk with the army about what to do next australia india and of course theyll want to take another bite out of china and theyll expect our help with that so they will genda agreed the americans had offered to keep selling oil and scrap metal to japanif she got out of china war even a risky war like the one against the usa had seemed preferable to the humiliation of bowing to another countrys will did the yankees tell britain to leave india and her african colonies not likely did the yankees hesitate to send in marines when one of their little neighbors got out of line that was even less likely but they thought they could order japan around bitterly genda said we dont have round eyes we dont have white skin true enough yamamoto nodded again following gendas train of thought but weve shown the world that that doesnt matter he set both hands on the cheap pine desk as a young officer hed lost the first two fingers of his left hand at the battle of tsushima in the russojapanese war hed lost two fingersbut the russians lost most of the fleet that sailed halfway around the world to meet the japanese and they lost the war genda had had his first birthday in like any of his countrymen though he knew what the russojapanese war meant it was the first modern war in which people of color beat whites and now the japanese were beating the americans and the british and the australians too yamamoto said i hope i dont have to come back too soon american radio broadcasts make it very plain the united states is not abandoning hawaii i hoped the usa wouldi hoped our victories would make them see they could not win and so make peace but that hasnt happened karma neh they have more people and more resources and more factoriesmany morethan we do my guess is that they will try to bring all of them into play that will take some time we will be building too genda said stoutly hai yamamoto said once more but that was only acknowledgment not agreement for he went on they can build faster than we can i hope what we have done here in the eastern pacific has bought us the time to take and use the resources we need to stay a great power in the modern world i hope so but time will tell weve done everything we set out to do here genda said so we have nowis it enough yamamoto seemed determined to be gloomy he looked toward the west back in tokyo they think everything is wonderful they think the united states is at deaths door they do not understand the enemy they may have read sun tzu but they do not think what he says applies to them oh no they are far more clever than he such sarcasm flayed what clausewitz was in the west sun tzu was in the eastand had been for more than two thousand years a military man disregarded the ancient chinese generals thoughts on strategy and tactics only at his peril genda said surely things are not so bad as that notheyre very likely worse yamamoto said be thankful youre well away from tokyo its a poisonous place these days some of the poison comes from success which makes it sweeter but its no less deadly on account of that deadlier probably in the long run because success is the kind of poison that makes you blind if the germans knock the russians out of the war genda began yes thats what the army is waiting for if the northern beast dies theyll jump on the carcass and tear off slabs of siberia if the wehrmacht has a foothold in the caucasus theyre getting close to stalingrad stalins not one step back speech after rostov fell sounded desperate yamamoto only shrugged those broad shoulders well see what happens thats all the germans were at the gates of moscow last winter and they got thrown back theyre after oil now we have ours if they can get theirs i hope they havent overreached thats all they keep the americans and the british busy too genda said which works to our advantage that made yamamoto smile he stood up and bowed to genda who hastily returned the gesture i might have known you would think clearly with men like you here hawaii will be in good hands he bowed again a little more deeply dismissal genda left his office as if walking on a cloud the man he admired more than anyone else in the worldthe man all japan admired more than anyone else in the worldapproved of him most of japan knewor rather knew ofadmiral yamamoto from gushing newspaper and magazine articles genda knew the man himself and found him all the more admirable for the acquaintance trying to suppress a silly grin genda went up the stairs from the basement he got to the top at the same time as cynthia laanui the newly crowned queen of hawaii came down the back stairs from the ground floor of iolani palace your majesty genda said in english carefully keeping the irony from his voice hello commander genda how are you today the queen knew him by sight he was one of the four officerstwo from the japanese navy two from the armywhod chosen her husband from among the possible candidates for the restored hawaiian throne stanley owana laanuiking stanley nowwas the first candidate whod made it plain he would cooperate with japan genda didnt think queen cynthia knew how simple the selection criteria were he didnt intend to enlighten her either better now thank you he said he read english well but unlike yamamoto spoke less fluently cynthia laanui smiled at him she was without a doubt the first redhaired queen the kingdom of hawaii had ever had the smile packed a punch she was somewhere between twentyfive and thirty with green eyes freckles and from the neck down an abundant profusion of everything a woman ought to have i want to thank you for everything youve done for my husband she said king stanley was at least twenty years older than she was genda didnt think she was his first wife why hed married her was obvious why shed married him wasnt not to genda but she seemed to care about him glad to help him genda said he is good man he wouldnt have bet more than fifty sensay a dime in us moneyon that but it was polite and it gave him the excuse to keep talking with this striking woman she was only a centimeter or two taller than he was too she wore a distinctly unqueenly sundress of thin cotton when she nodded everything else moved in sympathy and the dress showed it off genda hoped he didnt notice too obviously she said hes a very good man hawaii needs him especially now did she believe that or was she being politic genda would have guessed she believed it if she was so naive she was liable to get badly hurt good man yes do many good things genda said agreement was always safe and as long as king stanley did exactly what japan told him to do the occupiers wouldnt object if by some chance he turned out to be good too gendas agreement won him a smile brighter than the hawaiian sunshine from queen cynthia he felt as if a bomb had gone off in front of him and hed got flashburned im so glad you think so she breathed hed never found the simple act of breathing so admirable before they chatted a little longer then after another dazzling smile she went back into the palace genda knew he needed to return to his duties he waited till shed gone all the way up the stairs though there was a zero swelling in joe crosettis windshield joe peered through the grumman wildcats gunsight cant lead the son of a bitch too much but if i dont lead him enough ill miss too the thought was there and then it was gone if you got close enough you damn well wouldnt miss he waited till the hated enemy filled the bulletproof glass then jammed his thumb down on the firing button atop the stick his wing machine gun roared tracers tore into the jap the enemy plane went up like a torch and plunged toward the pacific the pilot didnt have a prayer of getting out maybe he was dead from the burst of fire anyway nailed the bastard joe yelled exultantly he swung the fighter back toward the carrier navigating over the trackless ocean wasnt easy but he managed there was the welcoming flight deck dead ahead he brought the wildcat down toward the carriers stern this was the tricky part down the planes tailhook caught an arrester wire and the machine jerked to a stop he was down and he was safe a voice spoke in his earphones well mr crosetti that wasnt too bad reality returned with a bump harder than the one with which hed landed his wildcat turned into a pumpkin like cinderellas carriage actually into a humble texan advanced trainer the flight deck became a yellow rectangle outlined on concrete the arrester wires stretched across it were the mccoy though this was only the second time hed landed using them his flying instructor a lieutenant junior grade named wiley foster went on i liked your attack run on the target you got a fouroh on that one thank you sir joe said dont thank me yeti wasnt finished foster answered your landing was okay but nothing to write home about youre not supposed to set down as hard as you would on a real flight deck not yet you need to convince me you can make smooth landings before you do rough ones yes sir sorry sir joe wanted to claim hed come down that way on purpose but he hadntand the flying instructor wouldnt have cared it he had as for your navigation lieutenant foster paused significantly sorry sir joe repeated sounding as miserable as he felt hed struggled with navigation right from the start a lot of the cadets at pensacola naval air station were college grads or had at least some college joe had graduated from high school but he was working in a san francisco garage when the japs bombed pearl harbor he understood engines from the ground up but his geometry and trig were barely enough to let him keep his head above water when it came to figuring out how to get from a to b and back again and if he ever had to ditch in the vast unforgiving pacific odds were he wouldnt keep his head above water long it could have been worse foster allowed ive seen cadets try to head for miami or new orleans or atlanta but it could have been a hell of a lot better too if you want carrier duty youd better keep hitting the books hard yes sir i will sir joe said fervently carrier dutythe chance to hit back at japan as soon as he couldwas the reason hed signed up as a navy flying cadet in the first place lieutenant foster slid back the canopy he and joe climbed out of the texan the flying instructor was a lanky sixfooter he towered over joe who barely made fiveseven that might have mattered if they were bashing at each other with swords who cared how big a pilot was joe had heard southerners say its not the size of the dog in the fightits the size of the fight in the dog what the japanese had done since december proved the same thing but joe wasnt inclined to give a bunch of goddamn japs credit for anything he eyed the texan with a mixture of exasperation and affection it was a big step up from the sedate stearman biplane on which hed done his primary flight training no sooner had that thought crossed his mind than a yellow peril buzzed by overhead the navy painted all its stearmans a luminous yellow to warn other pilots that trainees were in the air yes the texan was a long step up from a yellow peril it was a monoplane with a real metal skin not the doped canvas covering a stearman it had a machine gun in the left wing rootthe one joe had used to blast away at the target another plane towed it had bomb racks too it could do a pretty good job of impersonating a warplane but it was only an impersonation the texans engine put out half the horsepower of a wildcats its top speed was only about twothirds of the navy fighters that that all made it much more forgiving than the genuine article was only a detail to joe groundcrew men came out to detach the planes tailhook from the wire and get it out of the way so another cadet could land on the yellowoutlined carrier deck lieutenant foster said how soon do you think youll be ready to solo in a texan joe blinked he hadnt expected that question from foster especially not after the instructor reamed out his navigation but it had only one possible answer sir im ready to take a swing at it right this minute if you want me to foster had blond hair a lock of which kept falling down on his forehead and an awshucks smile that probably put the girls in mind of gary cooper it put skinny swarthy joe crosetti in mind of the nob hill nobs who looked down their straight noses at dagos like him but the officer didnt give him a hard time because of his last name or his looks foster said i approve of your spirit mr crosetti the navy needs more men who dont hesitate but if the flesh doesnt quite measure up to it youre better off waiting and the country would be better off if you did too joe must have looked stubborn or maybe angry because the flying instructor sighed and went on how many memorial services have you attended since you got here uh a few sir joe admitted hed been to more than a few and he was sure wiley foster knew it as soon as cadets started getting up into the air they started finding ways to kill themselves one midair collision between yellow perils had wiped out two cadets and two instructors cadets had crashed on the runway theyd gone into the swamps around pensacola naval air station a kid took a stearman out over the gulf of mexico and never came back no one ever found a trace of himhe was missing and presumed dead all the same joe said that wouldnt happen to me he had faith in his own indestructibility lieutenant foster clicked his tongue between his teeth thats what they all say sometimes its the last thing they say he eyed joe you dont believe me do you i can swing it joe said stubbornly foster looked down at the card on which hed recorded joes marks for the session maybe you can by god next time you go up youll go up by yourself thank you sir joe wanted to get all excited he did get all excited but he didnt let most of it show he was damned if hed act italian in front of somebody who looked the way wiley foster did he did head back to the barracks at the next thing to a dead run when he first got to pensacola he and his roomie had shared a tent some cadets still slept under canvasno enormous handicap in the steamy pensacola summertime but he and orson sharp had graduated to better things by the time he got to the twostory brick barracks building he was drenched in sweat san francisco hadnt come close to getting him ready for florida heat and humidity his father was a fisherman hed gone out of fishermans wharf with his old man on weekends and during summers before he landed the job at scalzis garage till he got here though hed never understood what a lobster went through when you dropped it in boiling water heat and humidity or not he took the stairs two at a time he ran down the hall and threw the door open orson sharp sat in a chair by his bunk studying navigation the cadet from salt lake city was big and fair and eventempered he didnt swear and he didnt drink coffee let alone beer sharp was the first mormon joe had ever met joe sometimes thought he was too good to be true though he never would have said so how did it go sharp asked looking up from his book joes enormous grin probably said everything he needed to say but he spelled it out just the same lieutenant fosters going to let me solo next time i go up i cant wait his roomies pleasure seemed entirely unalloyed thats terrific i know you were hoping but i dont think you expected it quite so soon nope he liked my firing run at the target i think thats what clinched it slower than he should have joe remembered sharp had flown this morning too how about you my instructor let me take it up by myself today sharp shrugged in wry selfdeprecation i lived joe fought down a stab of jealousy his roommate had soloed in a stearman a week before he had too sharp did everything well and didnt fuss about anything he was so unassuming you almost had to act the same way around him joe walked over and stuck out his hand way to go congratulations thanks buddy orson sharps hand was almost half again as big as his when the cadets played football sharp was a lineman joe played end or defensive back he was quick but he wasnt big were getting there sharp added yeah joe said weve still got instrument flying to do on the link trainers on the ground and then up in the air and i suppose theyll give us some flight time on ffs too the navys last biplane fighter had stayed in frontline service till less than two months before pearl harbor joe tried to imagine ffs mixing it up with zeros perhaps mercifully the picture didnt want to form now the ff was a laststep trainer joe added two more words and then and then we see where they assign us sharp said did you put down vc on all three lines on your preference questionnaire way back when carrier duty you bet your you bet i did around his roomie joe didnt swear very much either you oh sure sharp answered if they dont give me that i dont care what i get everything else is a booby prize im with you joe didnt give a damn about patrol planes or flying boats no that wasnt truehe hated jap flying boats because one had dropped a bomb on the house where his uncle and aunts and cousins lived but he didnt give a damn about piloting an american flying boat or anything but carrierbased air preferably fighters i hope we do end up together orson sharp said seriously weve made a pretty good team so far uhhuh joe nodded i better get some more of that navigation under my belt too or else im not going anywhere he pulled his own book out of the metal footlocker by his bed and sat down in a chair he knew his roomie would give him a hand where he had trouble hed helped sharp through some of the mysteries of engine maintenance they did make a pretty good team look out hirohito joe thought and dove into the book lieutenant saburo shindo rarely got excited about anything some people said the navy pilot was a cold fish he didnt see it like that to his way of thinking most people got excited over nothing he stood on the akagis flight deck and looked around pearl harbor the view here wasnt what it had been before japan and the united states went to war then the american ships in the harbor were tied up alongside piers or rested easily at anchor now they were nothing but twisted blackened rusting metal some of them still leaked oil into the water shindo could see several of those rainbow patches the mineral stink of the fuel oil fouled the tropical breeze the third wave of japanese planes over oahu had sunk two american destroyers in the channel leading out from pearl harbor to the pacific trapping the rest of the us pacific fleet inside the harbor and letting the japanese pound it to pieces at their leisure shindo nodded to himself the americans would have tried to sortie against the japanese strike force they probably wouldnt have had much luck not without carrier support but just as well they hadnt got the chance japanese naval engineers had got the destroyers out of the channel only a few weeks before the failed american invasion shindo was glad they had now akagi had somewhere local to make repairs without worrying about american submarines the antitorpedo net was back in place at the mouth of the channel shindo laughed unpleasantly the yankees hadnt bothered with torpedo netting for individual ships last december they hadnt figured anyone could rig torpedoes to run in the shallow waters of pearl harbor japan taught them otherwise the devastation here proved that devastation held sway on land too ford island in the middle of pearl harbor had been palm trees and ferns where it wasnt us navy installations now it was rubble with greenery poking through hardly anything held greenery in check for long here the americans had fought house to house in pearl city north of the harbor the town where navy personnel and the civilians who worked for them lived was as battered as the island and the land to the east was worse the americans had stored their fuel there and japanese bombs sent the oil and gas up in smoke shindo vividly remembered the smoke the funeral pyre of us ambitions in the pacific the great black greasy plume had stayed in place for weeks till the fires finally burned themselves out nothing grew there shindo wondered whether anything ever would ford island and pearl city had seen war the tank farms had seen hell near those fuel tanks had stood the us navy repair facilities the yankees wrecked those themselves when they realized they werent going to be able to hold oahu japanese engineers were full of professional admiration for the job their american counterparts did it made operating pearl harbor as a base for the japanese navy much hardermuch harder but not impossible as if to underscore that akagis flight deck vibrated under shindos feet metallic clatters and bangs came from below a dive bomber had got one home on the carrier during the fight north of the hawaiian islands the bomb penetrated the flight deck near the bow and exploded in the hangar luckily just about all the ships planes were in the air defending akagi or attacking the enemys carriers otherwise things would have been even worse damagecontrol parties had got steel plates over the hole in the flight deck so the carrier could launch aircraft that was the essential the indispensable repair everything else had waited the crew was attending to the rest now as best they could here in hawaiian waters zuikaku much more badly damaged than akagi had had to limp back to japan for repairs that left her sister ship shokaku the only undamaged japanese carrier in the eastern pacific shindo muttered to himself shokaku s fliers and sailors had less experience than akagis in a crisis no less a personage than admiral yamamoto thought a crisis unlikely any time soon the americans had hurt the japanese carrier force japan had crushed the americans two of the three us carriers that had sailed from the american mainland lay on the bottom of the pacific now the third hurt worse than either akagi or zuikaku had barely staggered back to the west coast whatever invasion fleet followed behind the carriers and their escorts had also run for home we smashed them shindo thought complacently if they come back here again well smash them again thats all a tall horsefaced officer came up onto the flight deck from below seeing shindo he waved and walked toward him shindo waved back then saluted as the other man drew closer how are you feeling fuchidasan he asked better day by day thanks commander mitsuo fuchida answered hed come down with appendicitis during the fight with the americans hed completed his attack run brought his bomber back to akagi gone straight to sick bay and parted with the inflamed organ glad to hear it shindo said hed led akagis fighters during the last wave of the attack on oahu and in the recent battle against the yankees north of hawaii fuchida had been in overall command in the first wave and also illness or no in the fight where hed come down sick its over i got through it they patched me up fuchida said as more clanging and banging came from the hangar deck fuchida smiled akagi can say the same thing i wish it werent taking so long shindo grumbled a thoroughly businesslike man he didnt notice fuchidas joke till it was too late to respond keeping his mind on business he looked north and east i wonder what the americans are doing with that beatup flattop of theirs shes under repair up in seattle fuchida answered ah so desu i hadnt heard that shindo said i just found out a few hours ago myself fuchida said one of our hks spotted her theyre amazing aircraft enthusiasm filled his face and the big flying boats were remarkable planes flying out of what had been the pearl city pan am clipper base they could reach the west coast of the usa for reconnaissance work or even to drop bombs fuchida had flown on one in a threeplane raid on san francisco that no doubt accounted for a good part of his enthusiasm it also made shindo jealous as could be fuchida was very able nobody would have quarreled with that shindo certainly didnt because he was so able he sometimes got to do things he wasnt strictly entitled to do sitting in the copilots seat of an hk was one of those sure enough none of what shindo thought showed on his face that was true most of the time but he made a special point of it now the two of them served together but they werent close friends the way fuchida and minoru genda were and fuchida had two grades on shindo letting a superior see what you thought of him was never a good idea all shindo asked then was what else are the yankees doing in seattle working around the clock seems like fuchida answered its that way whenever we get a look at one of their ports they havent given up if they want another go at us they can have it shindo said well give them the same kind of lesson we did six weeks ago he paused eyeing fuchida now the other naval aviators face was the sort of polite blank mask behind which anything could have hidden shindo decided to press a little to see what was there were just about back up to strength here with aircraft and pilots in numbers yes fuchida said do you think the replacements fly as well as the men we lost are the bombardiers as accurate so that was it shindo said theyll get better as they get more flying time i was thinking the same thing not long ago about shokaku s crew i hope so fuchida still sounded worried we dont have the fuel to give them all the practice i wish they could get saburo shindo grunted that unfortunately was true blowing up the tank farms had hurt japan as well as the usathough the americans surely would have fired them to deny them to the invaders as things were the japanese in hawaii didnt have the fuel to do all the patrolling by air or water shindo would have liked to see theyd spent gasoline and fuel oil like a drunken sailor to get through the last battle now they had to bring in more a ship at a time it wasnt a good way to do business not when the merchant ships were short of fuel tooand not when american subs would be hunting them how soon will we be able to start using the oil weve taken in the dutch east indies shindo asked im afraid i havent got the slightest idea fuchida answered maybe commander genda would know but i dont if its not pretty soon why did we go to war shindo grumbled because if we hadnt gone to war we wouldnt have any oil coming in at all fuchida said and you cant very well worry about using or rationing what you dont have however much shindo would have liked to argue with him he didnt see how he could jim peterson stood in the chow line with his mess kit and spoon the rice and vegetables the japs doled out to american pows in labor gangs werent enough to keep body and soul together that didnt mean he wasnt hungry and didnt want the meager supper oh no for a little while after he ate it hed feel not quite so bad hed seen what happened when people got too weary to give a damn about food the japs didnt let them rest they worked them just as hard as anybody else and beat them if they couldnt keep up and if the pows died under such treatmentwell tough luck japan hadnt signed the geneva convention as far as her soldiers were concerned surrender was the ultimate disgrace having surrendered the american soldiers and sailors on oahu were essentially fair game plop the man four in front of peterson got his miserable supper plop the man three in front plop two in front plop the guy right ahead of peterson and then plop he got his for ten or fifteen seconds the world was a glorious place he had food he hurried off to eat it cradling the mess tin to his chest like a miser with a sack of gold a lump of gluey rice and anonymous greens about the size of a softballthat was what he was getting all excited about he knew it it shamed him it made him disgusted at himself but he couldnt help it that was how much his body craved even the scanty nourishment the japs gave him for this i went to annapolis he thought bitterly as he shoveled glop into his face as fast as he could hed been a navy lieutenant on the enterprise coming back to pearl harbor after delivering fighter planes to wake island hed roared off the carriers deck to do what he could against the japaneseand promptly got shot down hed thought his wildcat was pretty hot stuff till he ran into his first zero it was also the last one hed faced in the air one was plenty one had sure been plenty for him he managed to bail out and came down on a golf course near ewa the marines airfield west of pearl harbor hed done his damnedest to get back in the air his damnedest turned out to be no damn good lots of pilotsmarines army and navy menwere in line ahead of him all they needed were planes the japs did a hell of a job blowing those to smithereens on the ground japanese mastery of the air in the invasion was absolute since peterson couldnt fight the japs in the air hed fought them on the ground as a common soldier hed even been promoted to corporal before the collapse he still had the stripes on the sleeve of his ragged shirt nobody would use him as an officer on the ground which was only fair because he hadnt been trained for that he would have got people killed trying to command a company nobody in his shooting squad knew hed been an officer no sooner had he thought of the squad than he thought of walter london up came his head like a bird dogs where was london there sitting on a boulder eating rice like everybody else peterson relaxedfractionally london was the weak link in the squad the guy most likely to disappear if he saw half a chanceand if the other guys didnt stop him that was what shooting squads were all about the jap whod come up with the idea must have got a bonus from the devil if one man escaped all the others got it in the neck that violated all the rules of war of course but the japs didnt care anybody whod seen them in action had no doubts that they would get rid of nine because the tenth vamoosed the sun sank behind the waianae range oahus western mountains the labor gang was widening the road that led to kolekole pass from schofield barracks why the road needed widening peterson couldnt see hed been stationed in the kolekole pass for a while during the fighting not many people wanted to get there and he couldnt imagine that many people ever would but it gave the pows something to do it gave the japs an excuse to work themto work them to death very often peterson laughed not that it was funny working the prisoners to death was probably no small part of what the japanese had in mind he finished the last grain of rice in the mess kit he always did everybody always did he remembered when hed left food on his plate in the enterprises wardroom no more no more he got to his feet he topped six feet by a couple of inches and had been a fine rangy figure of a man now he was starting to look more like a collection of pipe cleaners in rags hed lost somewhere close to fifty pounds and more weight came off him every day he didnt see how but it did peterson made a point of walking right past walter london and scowling at him most pows were scrawny wretches london was skinny but he wasnt scrawny he was a wheelerdealer a man who could come up with cigarettes or soap or aspirinfor a price always for a price the price was commonly food a stream ran down from the mountains close by the side of the road pows rinsed their mess tins and spoons in it getting them as clean as they could dysentery wasnt bad here but some men suffered from itand more weakened by hard labor exhaustion and starvation came down with it all the time you did what you could to stay clean and to keep your stuff clean what you could do often wasnt enough there were no huts there were no beds there werent even any blankets in hawaii that mattered much less than it would have a lot of other places peterson found some grass and lay down other men were already lying close by if they felt cold in the middle of the night they would roll together and use one another to keep warm he woke in the morning twilight with a japanese guards boot in his xylophone ribs the jap wasnt kicking him just stirring him to get him up and moving if he kept lying there though he would get kicked he scrambled to his feet and bowed to the guard satisfied the jap went on to prod the next closest american awake peterson took his place for morning lineup till the men were counted they got no breakfast they formed up in rows of ten which made it easy for the guards to count them or that should have made it easy some of the japs seemed to have trouble with numbers as big as ten maybe peterson was just being rude in thinking so but it looked that way to him a lot of the camp guards seemed to be peasants from the japanese back of beyond they were ignorant and mean and reveled in their petty authority over the americans about one morning in three something went wrong with the count this was one of those mornings americans muttered to themselves when no guards were looking their way fuck up a wet dream somebody behind peterson said he couldnt remember the last time hed had a wet dream when you were slowly starving to death dreams of pussy went right out the window the japanese sergeant in charge of the labor gang wasnt a bad guy at least he could have been worse he plainly had orders about how much he was supposed to feed the pows and how much work he was supposed to get out of them like just about every jap peterson had seen he conscientiously obeyed his orders past what he had to do he wasnt cruel for the sake of being cruel he didnt beat people or behead them just because he felt like it and he didnt let his men do anything like that either now though he looked about ready to explode shooting squads he yelled one of the handful of english phrases he knew ice ran up petersons back it always did when the prisoners got that command as usual the first thing he did was look around to see where walter london was he didnt spot him right away telling himself that didnt mean anything he joined his comrades in misery along with them he silently counted off one two three four five six seven eight nine no ten wherever london was he wasnt here oh fuck somebody said very softly it seemed more a prayer than a curse how did he get loose petersons voice was also soft but very grim theyd kept a watch on london through the night taking turns gapped out of their exhausted sleep the man they worried about of course hadnt had to watch himself hed slept like a baby till last night hed slept like a baby i had the last watch a guy from oregon named terry said naked fear widened his eyes until you could see white all around the iris i guess maybe i fell asleep again on account of the jap kinda poked me awake this morning i didnt think anything about it till yeah till somebody broke in you just put all our necks in the noose god damn you too late to do anything about it the assholes gone peterson sounded even wearier than he feltno mean trick under the laws of war a sentry who fell asleep at his post could go up in front of a firing squad he didnt take his buddies to perdition with him though here came the japs no chance to sneak in somebody from another group that had already been counted the japs might have trouble getting to eleven without taking off their shoes but they knew nine and they knew nine wasnt ten they started pointing and yelling and jabbering in their own language the gangboss sergeant tramped up he had no trouble getting to nine and not to ten either the pows stood at ramrodstiff attention the sergeant might not have been a bad guy but he lost his temper now peterson even felt a moments sympathy for him hed probably get in dutch because of the escape too zakennayo he yelleda handydandy allpurpose japanese obscenity baka yaro he tacked on for good measure idiots that also didnt fit the situation too badly but cussing wasnt enough to satisfy him he walked up to the closest pow in the shooting squad and slapped him in the face hard he might not normally have beaten people but things werent normal now japanese noncoms belted their own privates when they got mad the privates took it without blinking and went on about their business the prisoners had to do the same or else they would get shot on the spot wham wham wham the sergeant wasnt real tall but he had a bulls shoulders he didnt hit like somebodys girlfriend when she got mad he was trying to knock you ass over teakettle peterson had just time to brace himself before he got it his head whipped to one side he refused to give the jap the satisfaction of staggering though he tasted blood in his mouth the damn jap came back along the row smacking everybody again he screamed at the americans it was all in japanese but he illustrated with gestures he did excellent impressions of being hanged being shot and having his throat cutthe last complete with gruesomely authentic sound effects then he pointed at the pows this is going to happen to you peterson had figured it would happen right there it didnt the sergeant told off three guards and had them march the nine remaining members of the shooting squad back to opana the northernmost point on oahu to the pow camp where theyd been held since not long after the fighting stopped the men got no food and no water whenever one of them stopped for any reason the japs set on him with their rifle butts after a day of that peterson decided he would take off when they stopped for the night if they shot him trying to escape he didnt figure hed lost much and they were going to do in his buddies anyway so he couldnt get them into any worse trouble disappearingif he couldlooked like his best hope he never got the chance the japs herded the shooting squad into waimea on the north coast just as the sun was going down the men spent the night in one cell of the town jailall of them crammed into one cell the cell naturally had not been made with nine men in mind they filled it to overflowing and piled onto one another when they lay down nobody fed them but because the cell had been built by americans and not by japanese it boasted a coldwater sink and a toilet jim peterson drank till he thought water would start coming out of his ears he washed his face and hands too everybody else did the same thing and none of them had heard a toilet flush for a hell of a long time when morning came the japs herded them out theyd already used the sink again expecting that they wouldnt get any water the rest of the day they turned out to be right about that and because they didnt seem demoralized enough to suit their captors the japs quickmarched them north and east along the highway towards opana now even slowing down meant a goose with a bayonet or a kick or a rifle butt in the kidneys or the ribs or the head of course quickmarching the prisoners meant the guards had to quickmarch too but they were well fed and they hadnt been killing themselves with hard physical labor they might have been tired by the time they got up to opana peterson felt ready for the boneyard and the japs were ready to give it to him too everybody from the shooting squad went into punishment cells they werent big enough for anybody to stand up or lie down in them the prisoners spent ten days in them with only a little rice and a little water on which to stay alive when peterson finally did emerge from his cell he could barely stand everybody else in the squad was just as bad off an officer strode up to them with an interpretera local japin tow that worried peterson all by itself if the japs had something to say that they wanted the pows to understand it wasnt going to be good news hand on the hilt of his sword the officer snarled in japanese you have failed in your obligation the interpreter said because you have failed you will be punished no longer will you be allowed the light duty you have enjoyed up till now peterson didnt laugh in the mans face if he had the officer might have used that sword to cut off his head he still wanted to live though right at that minute he couldnt have said why another furioussounding spate of japanese you will be sent to road building in the kalihi valley the local jap said this is your unbreakable sentence he might have been sending them off to devils island the officer growled one more time the interpreter left it untranslated which might have been just as well the officer drew himself up straight which would have been more impressive if hed been taller than fivesix like the rest of the men in the shooting squad peterson bowed they knew what the jap wanted as the officer swaggered away with the interpreter in his wake peterson dared breathe a sigh of relief as far as he could see theyd got off easy road building was road building how could what they wanted him to do be any worse than what hed been doing already and where the devil was the kalihi valley anyway corporal takeo shimizu gathered his squad by eye you boys ready to go back to honolulu he asked yes corporal chorused the men under him of course they called out hai at the top of their lungs he was a noncom and they were only privates if they annoyed him he could slap them or punch them or kick them and no one above him would say a word no that wasnt quite true lieutenant horino the platoon commander would say well done keep your men disciplined certainly though no one above him would complain odds were he wouldnt smack them around he had a ready smile and a readier laugh hed been a while making corporal his superiors came right out and said they feared he was too easygoing for the job but hed fought and fought well in china before crossing the pacific to land on a beach not far from where he was now once he had the rank he kept his squad in line well enough even if he didnt thump his men as often as some other corporals and sergeants did with theirs lets go then he said his whole regiment had moved up from honolulu to the beaches near haleiwa on oahus north shore to defend against an american reinvasion it hadnt comethe japanese navy had made sure it wouldnt and couldnt now the regiment was returning to its previous posting this is pretty country its a shame to leave shiro wakuzawa said he wasnt wrongit was the sort of country where ferns sprouted from the dirt thrown up in front of foxholes where coconut palms the ones that hadnt been knocked over when the japanese shelled and bombed the beaches swayed in tropical breezes where the ocean was several improbably beautiful shades of blue but wakuzawa whod been a new conscript when he came ashore here was such a sunny fellow that he made even shimizu seem like a grouch an older private said i wont be sorry to get back to honolulu no whorehouses up here with his meager pay he couldnt afford to go to a brothel even once a month but several other soldiers who had no more money nodded shimizu didnt try to argue with them he also thought getting laid every once in a while was better than not getting laid at all getting laid regularly would have been better still wish for the moon while youre at it he thought he led the squad over to where the platoon was assembling everyone was clean everyone had all his gear everyone could stand inspectioneveryone already had stood shimizus inspection shimizu nodded to corporal kiyoshi aiso whose squad was also part of the platoon aiso nodded back he was thin and leathery and toughall in all a more typical noncom than shimizu colonel fujikawa the regimental commander condescended to speak to the assembled soldiers before they started marching down across oahu congratulations men you were ready for action he said i know you would have mown down the americans if they had dared return to oahu we will stay ready in case they decide to try again banzai for the emperor banzai the soldiers shouted the bugler blared out the order to advance the soldiers started to march be strong shimizu called to his men you were soft as tofu on the march up here i expect better garrison duty in honolulu had left all of them soft shimizu had suffered on the march up to haleiwa too but hadnt shown it in front of his men if he kept up a bold front he had no trouble ordering them around everything seemed easy when he started out he laughed at the mynah birds croaking and squawking in the rice paddies that had replaced most of the sugar cane and pineapple plantations past and through which hed fought hawaii hadnt come close to feeding itself before japan conquered it now it nearly could little bluefaced zebra doves and ordinary pigeons pecked at the growing rice there were far fewer of them than there had been when shimizu came ashore they were good to eat and people had got hungry enough to eat them and zebra doves in particular were very tame and very stupid and very easy to catch before long wakuzawa started to sing he had a fine musical voice and could stick to the tune even when the soldiers around himwho werent nearly so goodmade a hash of it singing helped the kilometers go by shimizu had done a lot of it on endless dusty marches through china the marches here werent endless thank heaven and they werent even dusty for the roads were paved but singing felt good all the same he thought so anyhow after wakuzawa had led the men in a couple of ballads popular in tokyo before they sailed for hawaii lieutenant horino said we are soldiers if were going to sing we should sing army songs army songs had only one thing wrong with them next to popular ballads they were dull singing about the infantrys branchofservice color and about dying for the emperor and living on inside his spirit wasnt nearly so much fun as singing about women and getting drunk and looking for a chance to get rich and women again even the tunes were dull they seemed more chants than proper songs how could you care about singing something like that after a while then the men fell silent once more lieutenant horino looked pleased with himself to his way of thinking hed stopped a minor nuisance corporal shimizu swallowed a sigh when he was singing he could do that and not notice the highway and each step along it nowthump thump thumpeach footfall was what it was the soldiers trudged through wahiawa like haleiwa farther north it wasnt anything special not very big not very rich it wasnt very rich by hawaiian standards anyhow but towns here never failed to remind shimizu that america was a much richer country than japan cars sat by the curbso many they couldnt go now because they had no fuel but ordinary people had been able to buy them in japan cars were for rich men some of the tires on these automobiles had gone flat some had been removed too sooner or later malaya would give japan rubber but she was desperately short of it now all those tires werent doing the people of hawaii any good not when they couldnt drive the cars on which the tires were mounted better they should help japan then in wahiawa as anywhere else civilians had to bow when japanese soldiers went by local japanese not only took it in stride they did it properly showing just the right amount of deference and respect whites and chinese and filipinos werent so good but orders were not to make an issue out of any bow that showed the right spirit a pretty blond woman in her late twentiesnot far from shimizus agebent as the soldiers went past he remembered seeing a pretty woman with yellow hair as his regiment marched up through wahiawa was this the same one how could he tell after several weeks hed seen a handful of missionaries in china but for them these people on oahu were the first whites hed ever set eyes on they were big hed seen that from the moment he landed when they started shooting at him but big didnt mean toughor not tough enough anyhow theyd fought hard but in the end theyd surrendered shimizus lip curled they deserved whatever happened to them after that he couldnt imagine anything but fighting to the finish at least then it was over you didnt give yourself up to the foe so he could do whatever he wanted with youand to you lieutenant horino strode along with one hand on the hilt of his sword let them see who their masters are he declared no one in wahiawa showed the japanese even the slightest disrespect the locals would have been crazy to do so whoever tried it would have paid and so would his or her family and friends and neighbors civilians didnt have shooting squads the way prisoners did but the occupying authorities would have come up with something to make people remember then the regiment trudged out of the town more rice paddies replaced cane and pineapple men muttered about sore feet no one would have had the energy to sing now shimizu didnt have the energy or the desire to order them to sing an army song he picked his feet up and put them down again over and over and over the regiment didnt quite make it into pearl city let alone honolulu before the sun went down colonel fujikawa looked unhappy hed also been unhappy when they failed to march from honolulu to haleiwa in one day youve got weak he grumbled he was probably right too oahu didnt offer marching opportunities the way say china did you could march forever in china after a lot of campaigns there shimizu thought he had this place wasnt like that you settled down and you patrolled in town and that was that if you did a whole lot of marching here you marched into the pacific as the men were settling down by the side of the road an enormous flying boat landed in pearl harbor and taxied up to the shore at pearl city i wonder what thats all about said senior private yasuo furusawa who was curious about everything no idea shimizu said if the brass wants us to know theyll tell us about it as long as its one of our planes i wont lose any sleep about it it must have been a japanese planeno gunfire erupted no bombs burst he ate rice assigned sentries and rolled himself in a blanket as soon as it got dark and weary as he was he lost not even a moments sleep by now jane armitage was used to japanese soldiers tramping through wahiawa she was used to bowing whenever she saw them she was used to keeping her thoughts to herself if she didnt someone might blab to the japs and what happened after that wouldnt be pretty and she was used to being hungry she hated looking into the mirror in her apartment the face that stared back was a strangers all cheekbones and chin and staring eyes only her yellow hair reminded her that she was really herself when she got into the shower her ribs stood out like ladder rungs she could watch muscles move on her arms and legs the only thing that kept her from complete despair was that everybody in wahiawa was in the same boatall the locals anyhow for the occupiers ate well enough to keep their weight on one scrawny wretch in a group of normal people would have drawn notice one scrawny wretch in a group of scrawny wretches they said misery loved company by god they had a point damn you fletch she would whisper once in a while when she was sure nobody could hear her exhusband had been an artillery officer at nearby schofield barracks hed sworn up and down that the us army would give the japs a black eye if they ever came anywhere near hawaii these days jane despised him more for being wrong than she did for drinking too much and generally for forgetting she existed except when he felt like a roll in the hay she couldnt brood for very long she had her vegetable patch to look after she was growing turnips and potatoes she hated what the work did to her hands they were hard and callused and scarred with short nails with permanently black rims there too though she wasnt the only onefar from it without the produce the locals grew they might well have starved to death the occupying forces wouldnt have shed a tear the japs might have laughed instead she hardly ever thought i should be teaching third grade any more the elementary school was closed by all appearances permanently the principal jane flinched away from that thought she still remembered the thunk of major hirabayashis sword biting into mr murphys neck when the japs caught murphy with a radio after they ordered all sets turned in but the dreadful sound and the memory came back to her even when she was weeding in the little plot of ground shed chop through some nasty plants stem and murphys head would leap from his shoulders blood fountaining impossibly red and his whole body convulsingbut not for long not for long your plot looks good four words returned her to reality bad as reality was it beat the stuffing out of what had been going on in her head she turned thank you mr nakayama she said she didnt have to bow to tsuyoshi nakayama he was just a local jap a nursery man not one of the invaders but she did have to treat him with respect he was major hirabayashis interpreter and factotum get on his wrong side and youd be sorry jane didnt want to find out how sorry she could be thank you for working so hard yosh nakayama told her he was about fifty but looked older his face tanned to wrinkled leather from a lifetime in the sun if everyone worked as hard as you we would have more to eat hed lost weight too he hadnt used his position to take special privilegesof which food came first these days well ahead of money or womens favors by all appearances he didnt much want the job he had that didnt keep him from doing it conscientiously jane saw a bug automatically she lashed out with a foot and squashed it nakayama nodded approval some people dont care enough to do things right he said his english was slow and deliberatefluent but not quite the speech of someone whod grown up with the language you are not like that well i hope not jane said if youre going to do something do it right he nodded again and actually smiled his teeth were very white except for a couple of glinting gold ones yes he said and went on to the next vegetable patch without another word yes jane wondered then why didnt my marriage work of course that had taken two and fletch hadnt exactly held up his end of the bargain jane wondered if he was still alive if he was he was probably a prisoner she shivered under the warm hawaiian sun the japs treated pows worse than they treated civilians and that was saying something gangs of prisoners occasionally shambled through wahiawa on their way to god knows what she didnt like thinking that fletch could be one of those skeletons in rags she didnt wish her exhusband anything particularly bad if she ever saw him coming up the street in one of those labor gangs she would she didnt have the faintest idea what she would do break down and cry most likely but if she broke down and cried about everything in hawaii that upset her these days shed have no time to do anything else she assassinated a weed instead platoon sergeant lester dillon was not a happy man the marines who served under him would have said he was never a happy man but a platoon sergeant was supposed to make his men feel as if hell wasnt half a mile off he wanted them more afraid of him and of letting him down than of the enemy he knew how that worked hed been a buck private himself in and his own sergeant had scared him a damn sight more than the germans did hed gone over the top time after time till a machinegun bullet took a bite out of his leg and put him on the shelf for the rest of what the politicians had insisted was the war to end all wars but his unhappiness here was at least as much personal as it was institutional his company commander captain braxton bradford had ordered all his noncoms not to go drinking in san diego bradfords logic was crystal clear yall go drinking off the base youll run into sailors hed saidhe was as southern as his name yall run into sailors youll fight em tell me im wrong and you can go none of the corporals and sergeants had even tried les knew he wanted to punch the first swabbie he saw one of his buddies another platoon sergeant named dutch wenzel said we wouldnt if those pussies hadnt blown the fight with the japs they did their damnedest captain bradford answered nobody can say any different no one contradicted that either it didnt matter what mattered was that the troopship carrying the regiment had had to hightail it back to the mainland after the navy lost marines didnt like running away even for the best of reasons there had already been a lot of brawls between angry leathernecks and sailors some of the sailors hadnt even been part of the failed attack on hawaii the marines werent inclined to be fussy and so dillon sat in the camp elliott ncos club soaking up a beer and pondering the unfairness of the worlda melancholy pursuit usually reserved for privates and other lower forms of life it wasnt so much that he minded drinking with his own kind he didnt but the decor left a good deal to be desired and the chances of picking up a barmaid were pretty damn slimthere were no barmaids only filipino mess stewards to take away empties and sometimes help the bartender by bringing out reinforcements when dutch wenzel walked into the club les waved to him wenzel ambled over he and dillon were two of a kind big fairhaired men with bronze suntans that said they spent a lot of time in the open wenzel was a few years younger too young to have got into the first world war but hed served in central america and in china and on several warships just like les bourbon over ice he called to the barkeep who waved back to show hed heard wenzel nodded to dillon aint this a lovely snafu what you mean youd rather be drinking in honolulu les said bet your ass wenzel replied and they wouldnt try and put hotel street off limits either wed riot if they did and so would the navy army too he added after a momentto a marine soldiers were hardly worth noticing we coulda done it dillon said draining his beer and holding up the glass to show he wanted another one if theyd landed us we couldve kicked the japs scrawny little ass oh hell yes wenzel said he paused while the bartender brought his drink and a new beer for dillon no doubt about it they beat the army yeah but they wouldntve had a chance with us not a chance he sounded as sure as if he were talking about the sunrise that the japanese had beaten the army might almost have been proof they couldnt beat the marines wonder how long itll be before we have another go at the slanteyed sons of bitches les said moodily and then answered his own question were gonna have to build more carriers first god only knows how long thatll take i hope they started em before we got whipped out there his friend said hell i hope they started before the bombs stopped falling on pearl harbor dillon nodded i wish they wouldve started a long time before that then we wouldntve had to worry about any of this in the first place yeah and then you wake up wenzel knocked back the rest of his drink he looked over to the man behind the bar and nodded the barkeep started making him another one he went on half the guys who joined the corps in the thirties did it because they were out of workno better reason than that most of em turned out to make pretty fair marines anyway dillon said hed signed up in a wartime burst of patriotism he didnt ask why dutch had if wenzel wanted to say he would but you didnt ask the marines werent the french foreign legion but they came closer than any other us outfit the oshima maru ran south before the wind that blew down from oahus hills the island rapidly receded behind the fishing sampan jiro takahashi tended the sails with more pleasure than hed ever taken in riding herd on a diesel engine up till hawaii changed hands the boat like all the sampans that set out from kewalo basin had had a motor when fuel dried up theyd had to make other arrangements i used to do this on the inner sea with my father when i was a boy jiro said you had to sail thennobody could afford an engine his two sons hiroshi and kenzo only nodded neither said anything jiro realized he might have mentioned his time on japans inner sea a time or twodozenbefore but that wasnt the only thing that made his sons surly theyd both been born here on oahu their japanese was all rightjiro had made sure of that with afterschool lessonsbut they both preferred english a language in which hed learned only a few swear words and other common phrases they liked hamburgers and hot dogs better than rice and raw fish kenzo was seeing a blond girl named elsie sundberg they were in short americans because they were americans they hated the japanese conquest of hawaii they hardly bothered making a secret of it they hadnt got in trouble for it but theyd had endless rows with their father jiro takahashi had been born near hiroshima hed come to hawaii when he was still in his teens before the first world war to work in the cane fields make himself some money and go home hed made himself some money enough to get out of the fields and go back to fishing which was what he knew best but hed never returned to japan hed married reiko settled down in honolulu and raised his family a sigh escaped him what is it father asked hiroshi who was standing by the rudder i was just thinking of your mother jiro answered ah im sorry his older son said and looked downcast so did kenzo their mother had died in the closing days of the fighting when the japanese bombarded honolulu the two of them and jiro had been at sea when they came ashore that whole district was nothing but wreckage and fire no one ever found reiko takahashis body even there jiro and his sons differed the boys blamed japan for bombing and shelling a defenseless city jiro blamed the americans for not giving up when their cause was plainly hopeless he remained proud to be japanese hed waved a rising sun flag when the japanese army held its triumphal parade through honolulu after the americans finally did surrender along with everyone else along the parade route hed gaped at the dirty ragged glum american prisoners herded along by japanese soldiers with wellpressed uniforms and gleaming bayonets the big hulking americans werent cocks o the walk any more he still made a point of delivering fancy fish to the japanese consulate on nuuanu avenue he was in short japanese to the core and glad about what his countrymen had done and being a father whose sons had ideas of their own and what other kind of father was there he wasted no chance to show the younger generation it wasnt as smart as it thought it was these islands are going to stay in the great east asia coprosperity sphere he said you saw what happened when the americans tried to take them back they couldnt do it theyll try again kenzo said you can bet your bottom dollar on it id rather bet a yenthats real money jiro said before kenzo could answer hiroshi spoke rapidly in english kenzos reply in the same language sounded hot hiroshi said something else jiros sons went back and forth like that whenever they didnt want him to know what was going on finally hiroshi returned to japanese fathersan can we please leave politics ashore theres not much room to get away from each other here and we all have to work together to bring in the fish perhaps a bit grudgingly jiro nodded all right well let it go he said hiroshi had been polite enough that he couldnt very well refuse without seeming churlish even to himself he spoke an obvious truth the fish do come first now both his sons nodded plainly in relief the truth jiro had spoken was truer than usual these days cut off from supplies from the us mainland oahu was a hungry place without all the sampans setting out from kewalo basin it would have been hungrier yet sampans werent the only fishing contraptions on the water nowadays either the oshima maru glided past a surfboard with a sail mounted on it to take it farther out to sea than the blond sunbronzed haole on it could have gone by paddling alone he waved to the sampan as it went by jiros sons waved back foolishness jiro said that wasnt fair and he knew it the sailboard wasnt foolish but it sure was funnylooking i think that haole is the fellow we saw coming out of eizo dois shop one time kenzo said i bet doi put the mast and sail on his surfboard the same as he did for the oshima maru could be jiro was inclined to think a little better of the white man on the surfboard if hed visited a japanese handyman before the war a lot of the haoles on oahu had tried to pretend the japanese didnt exist and had done their best to hold them down not letting them compete on even terms well that was over and done with now weve got a good wind behind us hiroshi said hai jiro nodded he liked the oshima maru better as a sailboat than he had when she was motorized she was silent now except for the thrum of the wind in the rigging and the slap of waves against her beamy hull no diesel roar not now no diesel vibration felt through the soles of the feet eitherjust the undulating motion of the sampan over the chop and no stinking diesel exhaust jiro didnt miss that at all the one drawback to traveling with the wind was the obvious one shed been faster with the diesel kenzo said were liable to be out two or three days finding a decent place to fish jiro only grunted not because his younger son was wrong but because he was right its not just that were slower either hiroshi said fewer fish close to oahu these days i think jiro grunted again he suspected that was also true there was a lot more fishing now than there had been before hawaii changed hands with american supplies cut off and with people desperate for any kind of food they took whatever they could get from the sea before the war he and his sons had thrown trash fish back into the pacific there were no trash fish not any more half a dozen flying fish sprang out of the water and glided through the air for a little ways before splashing into the sea once more they did that to escape the bigger fish that were trying to catch them the bigger fishaku and ahi and mahimahi and even barracuda and sharkswere what the takahashis wanted most kenzo dropped a hook into the water jiro didnt stop the sampan they werent far enough out to make this a really good place but if his son wanted to see if he could snag a fish or twowell why not and kenzo did too the line jerked he pulled in the fish ahi he said happily and then in english albacore his gutting knife flashed he tossed the entrails into the pacific the knife flashed again he cut strips of flesh from the fishs side and handed them to jiro and hiroshi then he cut one for himself they all ate the flesh was nearly as rich as beef not american food raw fish jiro jeered gently still good hiroshi said kenzo nodded jiro couldnt tease them too hard about that even if theyd preferred burgers and fries when they could get them theyd always eaten sashimi too kenzo said and its an awful lot better than what wed get ashore that might have been the understatement of the year rice and greens and not enough of either no jiro couldnt argue there kenzo went on and sashimis always better the fresher it is and it just doesnt get any fresher than this people who arent fishermen dont know what really fresh fish tastes like hiroshi said cut me some more please and me jiro said kenzo did he cut another strip for himself too before long there wasnt much left of the ahi all three of the takahashis were smiling jiro nodded to his older son hiroshi had hit the nail on the head people who didnt put to sea had no idea how good fish really could be waikiki beach straight ahead oscar van der kirk decided to put on a show he had a stringbag full of fish at his feet he made sure it was closed and tied to a peg hed set into his sailboard the peg was new something hed thought of only a little while before quite a few surfriders were taking sailboards out to sea these days oscar had been first though he didnt begrudge anyone else the use of the idea even if he might have made a nice chunk of change from it in peacetime war and hunger had laws of their own laws sterner and less forgiving than the usual sort for that matter oscar seldom begrudged anybody anything he was a big goodnatured fellow at the very end of his twenties the sun and the ocean had bleached his already blond hair somewhere between the color of straw and snow his hide by contrast had tanned such a dark brown that a lot of people wondered if he was part hawaiian in spite of that blond hair he could hear the waves crashing on the shore now soon they would lift the boardand him they would slam him down in the pacific and make him look like a prize chump if he wasnt careful too but he commonly was careful and skillful to boot hed scratched out a living as a surfriding instructora surfriding showoff if you likefor years before the japs came and even for a while afterwards the wave he rode as tall as a man started to lean toward the beach ahead he stood atop the sailboard like a hawaiian god one hand on the mast the other arm outflung for balance speed built as he skimmed along the crest wind in his face shifting water under the shifting board there was no sensation in the world like this nothing else even came close he knew quite a bit about other sensations too hed given surfriding lessons to a lot of wahines over from the mainland who were trying to recover from a broken heart or just looking for a romance that would be fun but wouldnt mean anything once they sailed away his good looks his strength and his awshucks attitude meant hed also given a lot of them lessons in things besides surfriding here came the beach the wave was played out mastered the surfboard scraped against sand some of the men fishing in the surf clapped their hands one of them tossed oscar a shiny silver coin as if he were a trained seal getting a sardine he dug the coin out of the soft white sand it was a halfdollar that was real money thanks pal he said as he stuck it in the small pocket on his swim trunks he took down the sailboards mast and boom and rolled up the small sail that propelled it farther from the sea than the surf fishermen a couple of japanese army officers watched him oscar muttered to himself he wouldnt have come in so spectacularly had he known he was under their cold stare he felt like a rabbit hopping around while hawks soared overhead then one of them tossed him a coin the oneyen silverpiece was about the size of a quarter and worth about as much when he picked it up he had to remember to bow to the jap the officer returned the bow much more elegantly than hed given it ichiban the jap said wakarimasuka oscar nodded to show he did understand ichiban was part of the local pidgin a kamaainaan oldtimer in hawaiipicked up it meant a number one or something like that thanks oscar said as politely as he could you never knew when one of these monkeys turned out to speak english thanks very much and sure as hell this one answered you are welcome if he hadnt gone to school in the states oscar would have been surprised they might even have been at stanford at the same time they werent far apart in age oscar carried the surfboard mast and rigging under one arm and the stringbag full of fish in his other hand he hoped these japs wouldnt give him a hard time about that just about all food was supposed to go into community kitchens share and share alike they allowed sampan fishermen enough for what they called personal use the rest of the catch they bought at a fixed price so much per pound regardless of what kind of fish it was so far the japs hadnt harried the men who fished from sailboardsthey didnt catch enough to make a fuss over but the occupiers could harass them if they wanted to they could do almost anything they wanted to to his relief this pair just nodded to him as he walked by maybe they admired the show hed put on and didnt bother him because of that maybe who the hell knew for sure with japs all he knew for sure was they werent going to worry about his fish that was all he needed to know too he had an apartment not far from waikiki beacha perfect place for a fellow who made his living surfriding the man who owned the building was a local japanese who lived on the ground floor oscar knocked on his door when the man answered oscar presented him with a couple of fat mackerel here you go mr fukumoto he said another week eh his landlord examined the fish okay another week he said in accented english oscar went upstairs to his own place he would have bet more business got done by barter than with cash these days money very often couldnt buy food once back in his apartment oscar put some of the fish in the little icebox in the cramped kitchenette that would feed him and his lady friend for a bit the rest of the catch stayed in the stringbag out he went bound for honolulu and especially for the oriental district there the section west of nuuanu avenue the markets in that part of town were fluctuating things popping up now here now there they were at best marginally legal oscar suspectedno he was suresome japanese palms got greased to make sure some japanese eyes looked the other way people who caught things and people who grew things traded and sold what they had money could buy food there all rightif you had enough of it with fish in hand oscar could almost name his own price for it but he wasnt out for cash or not primarily he traded some of his catch for tomatoes some for potatoes some for string beans and some for a small squat jug what he had left after that well greenbacks would do he could have got a ride back to waikiki but rickshaws and pedicabs stuck in his craw just because you paid a man to act like a beast of burden that didnt mean he ought to be one while thered been gasolineand diesel fuel for busessuch contraptions hadnt existed in honolulu they did now his own chevy was long since hors de combat but oscar didnt mind shanks mare he got back to the apartment a little before susie higgins came in susie was a cute strawberry blonde a divorcee from pittsburgh oscar had taught her to ride the surf shed taught him a few things too she had both a temper and an eye for the main chance theyd quarreled broken up and come back together a few weeks before her eyes as blue as a siamese cats lit up when she saw the potatoes spuds oscar i could kiss you she said and she did im so goddamn sick of rice you wouldnt believe it rice is a lot better than empty oscar observed my boss says the same thing susie answered though just a tourist shed landed a secretarys job after she and oscar parted the first time shed done it with talent too not with her fair tanned body as if to prove as much she added of course his wifes chinese so hes used to the stuff long as my belly doesnt growl too loud im not fussy oscar said i dont mind rice as many japanese and chinese places as ive been to id better not its not american susie said once in a while is okay i guess but all the time she shook her head i feel like my eyes are getting slanty forget it babe oscar told her you can eat rice till everything turns blue and you still wont look like a jap oh oscar you say the sweetest things was that sarcasm with susie it was sometimes hard to tell these days she and oscar cooked on a hot plate hed got that before the fighting ended and it was one of the smarter things hed done you couldnt lay your hands on one for love or money these days gas was as kaput as gasoline or diesel fuel but honolulu still had electricity a hot plate wasnt the ideal cooking toolfar from itbut it beat the hell out of a stove that didnt work now for another exciting evening susie said after she washed the dishes and he dried them we cant go out dancing because theres a curfew we cant listen to the radio because the japs confiscated all the sets so what does that leave cribbage she made a face there was of course another possibility but oscar didnt name it susie was or could be a holy terror between the sheets but she always liked to think it was her idea not that she was being pushed into it but then oscar snapped his fingers almost forgot he said and showed off the jug hed got that afternoon whats that susie suddenly sounded hopeful its okolehao oscar answered holy cow susie frowned in confusion oscar laughed but maybe she wasnt so far wrong its hawaii hooch maui moonshine they make the genuine article from ti root and itll put hair on anybodys chest hair would not have improved susies but he didnt feel like editing himself instead he went on god only knows how good this batch is but its booze want a slug you bet i do she said he poured her a knock and one for himself too they clinked mismatched glasses then sipped susies eyes got enormous she coughed a couple of times holy cow she wheezed and looked respectfully at the glass i dont think its very good but its sure as hell strong yeah oscar was also wheezing a little or more than a little a territorial senator from maui had once said that proper okolehao burned with a clear blue flame oscar didnt know about that he did know this stuff burned all the way down he took another sip maybe the first one had numbed him because it hurt a lot less this time susie higgins drank some more too wow she said and then how do you really say it oscar gave her the name again okolehao she repeated and nodded to herself well youre rightthat beats the dickens out of cribbage he poured himself some more then held out the jug and raised a questioning eyebrow susie nodded again here you go he said and gave her a hefty dose if i drink all that ill go all rightill go out like a light she said which didnt keep her from attacking the stuff she smiled at oscara slightly slacklipped smile doesnt taste so bad once you get used to it does it i dont know he said i think maybe the first knock put my tongue to sleep susie waggled a finger at him oh it better not have sweetheart or im gonna be real disappointed in you she exploded into gales of laughter oscar grinned back he gave himself a mental pat on the back yeah susie could be as raunchy as all getout as long asshe was doing the leading if hed said something like that to her it would have chilled her faster than a cold shower oscars bed was crowded for two but not too crowded as long as they were friendly his tongue he discovered in due course still worked fine so did susies they fell asleep in each others arms happy and more than a little sloshed fletcher armitage was an officer and a gentleman thats what they told him when he graduated from west point hed gone right on believing it when he got assigned to the twentyfourth divisions thirteenth field artillery battalion based at schofield barracks of course officers in hawaii were something like sahibs in british india with plenty of natives to do the scutwork for them if a gentleman was someone who seldom got his hands dirty fletch had qualified even before the fighting started things hadnt been perfect for him hed been sleeping in the base boq jane had the apartment theyd shared in wahiawa the divorce hadnt been final when the japs hit he didnt suppose it had gone forward since the occupation but so what he wasnt married any more and he knew it so what was he then another slowly starving pow that was all he wasnt too far from wahiawa himself right now some of the men in his gun crew had tried disappearing when the order to surrender went out fletch didnt know what had happened to them maybe theyd blended in among the civilians maybe the japs had caught them and shot them either way they were liable to be better off than he was work a japanese sergeant shouted one of the handful of english words the man knew the pows under his eye moved a little faster they were digging tank traps and antitank ditches putting prisoners to work on warrelated projects like that violated the geneva convention putting officers to work at all without their agreement also violated the convention fletch laughed not that it was funny the japs hadnt signed the geneva convention and didnt give two whoops in hell about it they figured the usa might try to invade oahu again and they were damn well going to be ready if the americans did theyd had god only knew how many thousands of pows sitting around in kapiolani park at the edge of waikiki and theyd sent out an orderwork or dont eat nobodyd been eating much but nobody had any doubts the japs would be as good or as bad as their word up went the pickaxe fletch had learned to let gravity do most of the work as it fell he still wore the shirt and trousers in which hed surrendered they hadnt been in good shape then and they were rags now he hung on to them even so a lot of the americans in the gang worked stripped to the waist he didnt want to do that with his red hair and fair skin he burned and burned and hardly tanned at all raise the pick let it fall raise the pick let it fall a scrawny pfc with a shovel cleared the dirt fletch loosened neither of them moved any faster than he had to slaves in the south must have found a pace like this just enough to satisfy the overseer and not a bit more every so often of course the slaves would have slacked off too much then simon legree would have cracked his bullwhip and things would have picked up againtill he turned his back anyhow the jap sergeant didnt have a bullwhip he had a fourfoot length of bamboo instead he would swing it like a baseball bat whenever he felt the need it left welts at least as bad as a bullwhips and could knock a man off his feet about twenty feet away from fletch an american keeled over without having been walloped man down three or four pows sang out at the same time if somebody went down and they didnt sing out theyd catch itthe japs would figure they were colluding in his laziness two guards strolled over to the fallen man one of them stirred him with his foot the prisonerone more bag of bones among so manylay there unmoving the other jap kicked him in the ribs he didnt even curl up to protect himself the jap kicked him once more harder he still didnt move maybe he was dead already if he wasnt the guards took care of it they bayoneted him again and again too fucking cheap to waste ammo on him the pfc with the shovel said out of the side of his mouth hey its more fun to stab the poor bastard fletch said also sotto voce he wasnt kidding hed seen the gusto with which the guards wielded their bayonets this pow was too far gone to give them much sport when they were satisfied theyd killed him they thrust their bayonets into the dirt to get the blood off them tidy sobs fletch thought disgustedly work the sergeant shouted again fletch workedagain as slowly as he could get away with his eyes kept going toward the dead man who still lay in the hole the americans were excavating what did hard work get you here what the luckless prisoner had got nothing else of course what did work that wasnt so hard get you the same damn thing only a little slower from the cockpit of his nakajima bn commander mitsuo fuchida spotted an oil slick on the surface of the pacific northwest of oahu excitement shot through him but only for a moment that wasnt the sign of a yankee submarine however much he wished it were it was only fuel bubbling up from the sumiyoshi maru an american sub had sunk her now that fuchida had found where shed gone down he flew his carrierbased bomber in a search spiral looking for the boat that had done the deed the sumiyoshi maru wasnt the first japanese freighter on the way to oahu the americans had sent to the bottom she was in fact the second ship theyd got in the past two weeks japanese forces in hawaii couldnt well afford such losses they needed food they needed fuel they needed aircraft to replace the ones theyd lost in the fight at the end of june they needed munitions of every sort as long as everything went smoothly the japanese could just about keep themselves supplied the locals had had a lean time of itliterally now though the islands were growing enough food on their own to keep people from starving that was a relief the american subs operating against japanese shipping though were anything but things would have been worse than they were if a couple of american torpedoes that squarely struck freighters hadnt been duds when planes from the lexington attacked the japanese task force north of oahu just after the fighting started a torpedo that hit akagi had been a dud too fuchida didnt know what was wrong with the us ordnance but something clearly was for now he kept scanning the pacific hed been in overall charge of air operations for both the invasion of hawaii and the defense against the us counterattack a lot of men with such exalted responsibilities wouldnt have gone out on ordinary search missions themselves fuchida liked to keep his hand in any way he could he called to his bombardier on the intercom see anything no commandersan the rating answered please excuse me but i dont how about you i wish i did fuchida told him that sub is probably fifty meters down and waiting for nightfall to surface and get away id do the same thing the bombardier said why stick your neck out when you dont have to well search a while longer fuchida said the sub skipper may not think the freighter got a radio message off before she went down if he doesnt he might figure hes home free and head back to the us mainland on the surface maybe the bombardier didnt sound as if he believed itwhich was fair enough because fuchida didnt believe it either it was possible but not likely the bombardier added hard work that implied the work was not only hard but pointless cant be helped fuchida said id love to bomb a us submarine if i have any kind of chance i will maybe it will persuade the yankees to keep their boats away from hawaii fat chance that wasnt the bombardier it was the radioman first flying petty officer tokonobu mizuki hed been listening in from the rear of the cockpit where he faced the way the plane had come he and fuchida went back a long way together long enough to let him speak his mind to his superior rare in any military and especially in the obsessively hierarchical japanese navy fuchida saw nothing but a little light chop on the surface of the pacific no trace of a wake no trace of exhaustnot that a subs diesel engine gave off much he eyed the fuel gauge he still had plenty left he intended to search as long as he could hed gone into battle with appendicitis and kept doing what he had to do till he landed aboard akagi if illness hadnt stopped him nothing less would there was a wake but that was no submarine it was a japanese destroyer also searching for the enemy boat fuchida waggled his wings to his countrymen down on the pacific he couldnt tell if they saw himthey werent going to send up a flare or anything like that the spiral got wider and wider still no sign of the submarine fuchida muttered to himself there in the cockpit he hadnt really expected anything different subs elusiveness was a big part of what made them so dangerous so no he hadnt expected anything different but he had hoped sir petty officer mizuki said ive got an idea ill listen fuchida said when night comes we ought to send some of those big hk flying boats along the course from here to the american mainland the radioman said the submarine will be on the surface then if one of our pilots spots it he can make a good bombing run fuchida scratched at his closely trimmed mustache slowly he nodded to himself thats not a bad notion he said someone else may have had it already but its not a bad notion at all radio it back to oahu if we send out the flying boats tonight the sub will still be close to the islands and well have a better chance of finding it commandersan ill do it but what are the odds the brass hats will pay any attention to a lousy rating mizuki spoke without bitterness but with an acute knowledge of how things worked how frankly he spoke told how much he trusted his superior who was after all a brass hat himself do this fuchida said after a little more thought radio it back to oahu do it in my name tell them i want it done if nothing happens if the flying boats dont find a sub well leave it there failure on something like that wont hurt my reputation but if it works if one of them nails the enemy ill see that you get the credit domo arigato mizuki said some officers stole credit when the men who served under them came up with good ideas fuchida wasnt one of that sort and the radioman knew it they acknowledge sir mizuki told him a few minutes later they promise theyll tend to it good fuchida said how does it feel to be a brass hat yourself i like it mizuki answered at once and i like it even better because im doing it under an assumed name he and fuchida both laughed inexorably the bombers fuel ran down fuchida hadnt seen any sign of the american submarine with a regretful sigh he turned the nakajima bn back towards oahu with the akagi anchored in the calm waters of pearl harbor landing aboard her was almost as easy as coming in on an ordinary runway she wasnt rolling and pitching the way she would out on the open sea it required precision but flying always required precision fuchida obeyed the landing officers wigwag signals as if the man on the flight deck were piloting the bomber the first arrester wire snagged the bombers tailhook and the plane jerked to a stop fuchida slid back the cockpit canopy and climbed out of the nakajima so did mizuki the bombardier emerged a little later he had to scramble up from his prone bombing position in the planes belly captain kaku came across the flight deck toward fuchida a good thought about the flying boats the akagis skipper said no guarantees of course but its worth a try thats what i thought when mizuki here proposed it fuchida set a hand on his radiomans shoulder kakus eyes narrowed the signal came in under your name yes sir fuchida agreed my idea was that no one would take a suggestion from a petty officer seriously with my name attached to it it might have a better chance of going forward irregular tomeo kaku rumbled then almost in spite of himself he smiled irregular but probably effective he nodded to the rating mizuki eh yes sir the radioman saluted well mizuki i think this will go into your promotion jacket the akagis skipper said mizuki saluted again thank you very much sir you earned it kaku said and he strolled off the petty officer turned to fuchida and thank you very much sir im glad to help mizuki but i didnt do it for you fuchida answered anything that will twist the americans tailsanything at allim for it good thats good mizuki said it doesnt look like theyre going away does it fuchida turned toward the north and east hed made that motion a good many times before the us mainland drew him the way magnetic north drew a compass needle he sighed and shook his head no i wish they were but they arent dillon lester a the supply sergeant behind the counter checked les dillons name off a list here you are you have now been issued an m helmet he handed dillon the new helmet and a fiber liner that went inside it what the hell was wrong with my old tin hat dillon grumbled hed worn the britishstyle widebrimmed helmet since he joined the marine corps during the first world war he stared suspiciously at the replacement which was much deeper looks like a damn pot or maybe a footbath bitch bitch bitch the supply sergeant said by his craggy weathered features hed been a marine at least as long as dillon for one thing the new model covers more of your head than the old one did for another thing orders are that we get rid of the old ones and wear these you dont like it dont cry to me talk to your congressman thanks a lot pal dillon said as well as being about the same age they held the same grade ill remember you in my nightmares go on the supply sergeant jerked a thumb toward the door make like a drum and beat it carrying the new helmet and the liner dillon did outside dutch wenzel had put on his helmet what do i look like les you look like hell if you want to know what i think dillon answered the new helmet doesnt have anything to do with it though youre my buddy all right wenzel gave him the finger then he pulled out a pack of luckies stuck one in his mouth and offered dillon the pack thanks dillon took a zippo out of his pocket and lit both cigarettes he sucked in smoke and then said what i want to know is how come theyre giving me a new helmet when im a couple of thousand miles away from anybody whos gonna shoot at me beats me maybe they think it makes you look cute wenzel shook his head nah theres gotta be a reason that makes sense you oughta go on the radio dillon said youd run benny and fred allen right off the air he looked at the new helmetthe m the supply sergeant had called it maybe they think theyre changing our luck or something i dont know why though honest to god weve used the old one for twentyfive years and there wasnt anything wrong with it like a lot of marines he was conservative almost reactionary about his equipment but wenzel went on cracking wise thats what they said about this broad on hotel street cant make that joke on the radio dillon said they both laughed dillon went on if we can get off the base this afternoon you want to go see a padre game wenzel nodded why not whos in town the solons theyre in second place dillon said the closest bigleague teams the cardinals and stretching a point the browns played just on this side of the mississippi and the mississippi was a hell of a long way from san diego pacific coast league ball was pretty good though a lot of the players had put in time in the majors a good many who hadnt the younger ones would sooner or later and some of the ones who wouldnt lived on the west coast enjoyed playing here and didnt give a damn if they ever went back east lane field lay right across harbor drive from the beach the pacific was right behind the thirdbase stands if you looked out past the leftfield fence you could see the santa fe railroad yard it was a long look it was down the line in left and to dead center outfielders who played in that park had to be able to run like the devil catchers on the other hand dillon and wenzel armed themselves with hot dogs and popcorn and beer les pointed to the backstop thats the goddamnedest thing ive ever seen in any ballpark anywhere and ive been in a bunch of em after a swig of beer his pal nodded whoever laid out this place musta had himself a snootful nothing was wrong with the backstop as a backstop that didnt mean nothing was wrong with it it stood only about twelve feet back of the plate dutch wenzel raised the bottle to his lips again not a hell of a lot of wild pitches or passed balls in this park thats putting it mildly dillon said the padres took the field the organist played the national anthem boots poffenberger loosened up on the mound for the padres hed had two or three years in the big leagues and hadnt particularly distinguished himself he got the solons out in the first tony freitas another bigleague retread took the hill for sacramento he gave up a leadoff single but the padre runner was out trying to steal when he argued the padres manager came out to yell at the ump too he waved his arms and shouted and carried on even though he had to know he didnt have a chance in hell of getting the umpire to change his mind who is that guy wenzel asked hes having a fit out there thats cedric durst dillon answered he played for the browns and the yankees back in the twenties oh yeah i remember himsort of dutch wenzel said hes gonna get his ass thrown out if he doesnt shut up watch your language buddy a man behind them said ive got my daughter here dillon and wenzel looked at each other they both shrugged a ballpark was no place for a brawl they let it go the man in back of them never knew how lucky he was the solons first baseman ambled over to the argument to put in his two cents worth pepper martin could do that because the veteran of the gas house gang also managed sacramento durst finally retreated to the thirdbase dugout and the game resumed poffenberger was sharp but freitas was sharper he hadnt done much in the majors but hed won twenty or more for sacramento five years in a row and was well on his way to doing it a sixth straight time the solons beat the padres to lane field wasnt far from the base as dillon and wenzel waited with some other marines for the bus that would take them back les said that wasnt bad nopenot half wenzel agreed sorta reminds you what were fighting for doesnt it yeah but the goddamn japs like baseball too les said when i was in pekingthis was before they took it overtheir soldiers had a team and theyd play against us theyd beat us some of the time too the bastards they had a pitcher with the nastiest curve you ever saw it just fell off the table fuck em lousy cocksucking monkeys wenzel said none of the marines standing around waiting for the bus told him to watch his language a couple of them including a captain nodded emphatic agreement the bus wheezed up belching black smoke les and the rest of the leathernecks climbed aboard with a clash of gears it got rolling again and took them back to camp elliott as always kenzo takahashi was glad to escape the tent where he and hiroshi and their father slept when they werent aboard the oshima maru living and sleeping under canvas reminded him that their apartment was only ashes and charcoal and that his mother had died in it and living under canvas with his father reminded him how different they were he laughed a sour laugh before the war came to hawaii he and hiroshi had desperately tried to get accepted as americans to the haoles whod run things here they were just a couple of japs dad never understood why they wanted to be as american as the blond blueeyed kids they went to school with he was always japanese first well now things had gone topsyturvy the japanese were on top theyd thrown the haoles out of the saddle dad was as proud as if hed commanded the army that fought its way across oahu and kenzo still wanted to be an american he laughed again even more bitterly than before he seemed doomed to swim against the current the blacksuited white executives who ran the big five the companies that controlled hawaii hadnt wanted or known what to do with japanese who acted american the imperial japanese army and navy didnt want them or know what to do with them either the two sides probably had more sympathy for each other than they did for people like kenzo several japanese soldiersa patrolcame up the street toward him he bowed holding the canvas sack he carried under his left arm the soldiers didnt acknowledge him though they might have beaten him up if he hadnt bowed they chattered among themselves in hiroshima dialect much like the japanese his father spoke his and hiroshis were a little purer because theyd studied with a sensei from tokyo after american school was done kenzo went past a couple of informal and not quite legal markets in the oriental part of honolulu when the official ration meant hunger and a slow slide toward starvation people with extra money or things to trade supplemented it when and as they could japanese soldiers and sailors sometimes traded in the markets too they got better food than civilians but not a whole lot better and their higherups no doubt got paid under the table to look the other way once kenzo got some little distance east of nuuanu avenue there were no more markets chinese and koreans and japanese ran them haoles went to them but didnt set up any in their own part of town kenzo didnt understand that but hed seen it was true haoles in honolulu mostly did their best to pretend nothing had changed since december houses were still well tended the white clapboard ones and the churches built in the same style seemed more likely to belong to a new england small town than to the tropical pacific lawns were bright green and for the most part short and neat here and there vacant lots reminded a passerby that war had touched this place almost all the houses that had stood on those lots were gone scavenged for wood and anything else people thought they could use more often than not neighbors to either side kept grass and shrubbery from running wild mynah birds eyed kenzo suspiciously as he turned up a curving street not much different from others in the neighborhood before december zebra doves would have puttered along the sidewalk but people were eating them even faster than they bred mynahs at least had the sense to be suspicious kenzo walked up a neatly kept entryway to a clapboard house much like its neighborsa palace compared to the cramped flat where hed grown up he knocked on the door a middleaged blond woman opened it hello mrs sundberg he said she smiled at hima slightly nervous smile but a smile even so hello ken she answered come on in everyone in school had called him ken all haoles everywhere did his older brother was hank to them not hiroshi most hawaiiborn japanese had an american name to go with the one theyd been given at birth except when he was with his father kenzo still thought of himself as ken more often than not some local japanese though had dropped those american names like live grenades after hawaii changed hands when kenzo did walk inside the new england feel only got stronger the overstuffed furniture the currier and ives prints on the walls and the bricabrac everywhere didnt go with the palm trees and balmy breezes outside he handed mrs sundberg the sack i brought you this he said as casually as he could she hefted it then looked inside plainly she didnt want to not right there in front of him just as plainly she couldnt help herself she was smiling even before she closed the sack thank you very much ken she said thats one of the nicest dolphins ive seen in a long time kenzo thought the name a lot of haoles used for mahimahi was dumb it confused the fish with porpoises cousins telling that to mrs sundberg would have been wasting his breath he just said i hope you like it when you cook it up im sure we will mrs sundberg sounded as if she meant every word of that no wonderpeople who werent fishermen or didnt know fishermen never got fish like that not these days she went on let me go put it in the icebox elsie will be out in a minute sure kenzo said and he didnt smile till mrs sundberg had turned her back bringing a goodsized fish every time he came to call on elsie wasnt quite a bribe but it did go a long way toward making her folks happier to see him the way to their hearts is through their stomachs he thought it was no joke either not when so many stomachs in hawaii were growling so loud these days mrs sundberg came out with a glass it her hand would you like some lemonade she asked sure ken said again thanks he sipped it was good lemonade persisted where so many things had vanished hawaii still grew sugar even if a lot of the cane fields had been turned into rice paddies since the occupation and the sundbergs had a lemon tree in their back yard what else could you do with lemons but fix lemonade hi ken elsie walked into the living room from the back of the house hi he could feel his face lighting up when he smiled hed known elsie since they were in elementary school together theyd been friends and helped each other with homework in high school she was a nicelooking blondenot gorgeous but nice she looked a lot like her mother in fact though kenzo never noticed that before the war shed been a tiny bit plump hardly anybody was plump any more a double chin now marked not just a collaborator but an important collaborator ill be right back elsies mom said and she was too before kenzo and elsie could do anything more than smile at each other here you are sweetie she gave elsie a glass of lemonade too the longer elsie and kenzo stood around drinking lemonade and gabbing with mrs sundberg the less time they would have by themselves elsies mother didnt say that was what she had in mind but she didnt have to calling her on it would have been rude instead kenzo and elsie just drank fast elsie handed back her empty glass in nothing flat well be off now mom have a nice time mrs sundberg said gamely elsie didnt giggle till they were out of the house she reached for kenzos hand before he would have reached for hers before theyd even got to the sidewalk my mother she said exasperation and affection mingling in her voice shes very nice kenzo knew better than to criticize mrs sundberg that was elsies job if he did it he might make elsie stick up for her which was the last thing he wanted he picked something safer to say how have you been were getting along one day at a time elsie disappointed him by taking that as a question about her whole family but he couldnt do anything except squeeze her hand a little she went on we trade lemons and avocados for whatever we can get to add to the ration moms always glad when you bring a fish i knew that its not like she doesnt show it kenzo said yes for him praise was safer than blame if he didnt bring something good whenever he called on elsie how would mrs sundberg look at him as nothing but a damn jap that was his bet they walked to the park at the corner of wilder and keeaumoku it hadnt been maintained the way most of the lawns had the grass was tall and shaggy weeds and shrubs sprouted here and there the seat had come off one of the swings only slightly rusty chains hung down from the bar but it was peaceful and quiet and a place where japanese soldiers were unlikely to come elsie didnt like being around them and kenzo didnt see how he could blame her some of the things hed heard he didnt want to think about that or about not being able to protect her if trouble started white paint was starting to peel off the benches in the park in peacetime somebody would have fixed that up quick as you please these days the honolulu city government or what was left of it had more urgent things to worry about most of them revolved around trying to persuade the occupiers to be a little less savage a little less ruthless than they might have been otherwise a bench creaked when kenzo and elsie sat down on it that wouldnt have been allowed to happen in better times either one of these days if things didnt get better somebody would sit down on it and fall right through when rotting wood gave way it might not take that long either hawaii was tropical if things werent tended they went to pieces pretty damn quick how are you kenzo asked again this time bearing down on the last word i dont even know any more elsie answered i was so disappointed when we lost those carriers i dont know how to tell you you dont need to so was i kenzo said i know but elsie paused figuring out how to say what she wanted to say without getting him mad she was considerate enough to do that which was one of the reasons he liked her finally she said nobody can tell by looking that you dont like the people whore in charge now with me its different she patted her short blond hair kenzos laugh was as sour as the lemonade would have been without sugar anybody who looks like me would have said the same thing before december i didnt really understand it then now i do elsies smile only lifted one corner of her mouth nothing like wearing the shoe to show how much it pinches i guess no now kenzo hesitated for a moment before he decided to add there are haole collaborators too you know oh sure theyre worse than the japanese ones if you ask me elsie didnt even try to hide her venom at least people who were born in japan can think its their own country in charge now that covered people like kenzos father it didnt cover the hawaiiborn japanese who also backed the occupiers there were some but elsie didnt mention them instead returning to whites who kowtowed to the japanese authorities haoles who suck up like that are just a bunch of traitors when the americans do come back they ought to string em up such talk might have been easier before the war now kenzo asked youve seen dead people havent you yes she nodded and shuddered few people on oahu hadnt these days even so though they deserve it i guess so kenzo wondered how hed got to talking about killing people with a pretty girl that wasnt what hed had in mind when he called on elsie a whitehaired lady wearing a broadbrimmed straw hat against the sun walked slowly through the shabby park she looked at elsie and kenzo sniffed and stuck her nose in the air as she walked on sour old biddy elsie said you know her kenzo asked ive seen her she doesnt live too far from us elsies sniff was a nasty imitation of the old womans the next thing she likes after the turn of the century will be the first oh one of those there are lots of older japanese people like that too kenzo said elsie started to say something he thought he could guess what it was that even old japanese in hawaii could like the way the war had gone he would have had a hard time disagreeing with her too but she didnt say it instead very quietly she started to cry it wasnt supposed to be like this she said kenzo wondered what she meant by it everything probably it wasnt i know he said hey i know he slipped an arm around her she clung to him as if he were a life preserver and sobbed into the hollow of his shoulder hey kenzo repeated hey it wasnt really a word just a noise to show he was there after a while elsie gulped a couple of times and raised her head her eyes were red the tears had made her mascara run and scored lines through the powder and rouge on her cheeks she stared at kenzo from a distance of about six inches oh hell she said it was as far as he could remember the first time hed ever heard her swear she went on i must look like a raccoon hed only seen pictures of raccoons and he didnt care about them one way or the other you always look good to me he said seriously it was easy enough to say to say seriously that was something else she noticed toohe could tell her eyes widened then careless of smeared makeup and runny mascara she let her eyelids fall ken she whispered he kissed her theyd kissed before but never like this her arms were still around him now she squeezed him too her lips tasted of salt that only made them seem sweeter to him somewhere up in a tree a chinese thrush was singing for a moment kenzo thought it was his own heart the kiss went on and on elsie made a little noise half a purr half a growl down deep in her throat kenzo opened his eyes the old haole lady was gone nobody seemed to be in the park but the two of them emboldened he squeezed her breast through the thin cotton of her sun dress she made that noise again louder this time her hand came down on his not to pull it away but to press him to her he set his other hand on her knee just below the hem of her dress her legs drifted apart but when he started to slide up the warm smoothness of her inner thigh she gasped and twisted away no she said i mean we shouldnt why not kenzo panted whos gonna know somebody might nine months from now elsie said kenzo didnt worry about nine months from now he didnt worry about nine minutes from now except about his chances of getting her down on the long grass but she shook her head no she repeated it wouldnt be right and you wouldnt respect me afterwards sure i would kenzo heard the whine in his own voice how many men had said the same thing to women over the years millionsit had to be millions how many had meant it maybe a few do i he wondered he wasnt sure elsie must have seen as much on his face tartly she said if thats all you want you can probably get it for a fish down on hotel street kenzos ears heated its not all i want he mumbled though he couldnt deny he did want it if hed tried the bulge in his trousers would have given him away he saw her eyeing the bulge which only made his ears hotter still but she let him down easy saying okay ken i believe you youre a good friend too too he wondered what was that supposed to mean did she mostly care about him as a friend or besides caring for him as a friend did part of her want to lie down on the grass with him there was a lot of difference between the twoall the difference in the world and he couldnt ask if you had to ask the answer was always the one you least wanted to hear there were ways to find out besides asking though he kissed her again and she didnt pull away but the kiss while sweet didnt feel like bombs going off inside his head i wish he said and then stopped what elsie asked i wish none of this stuff had happened but we were going together anyhow kenzo said that would be pretty good elsie agreed kenzo wondered if her folks would have let her go out with him if the japanese hadnt occupied hawaii but he had to admit to himself that maybe he wasnt being fair elsies mom and dad had never had any trouble about the two of them studying together on the other hand studying and dating were two different things now he was the one who kissed her with something close to desperation elsie gave back what he needed it wasnt fire or not quite it was fun but it was reassuring too he looked at her youre something you know that he said and then im glad were friends too her face lit up at least half by accident hed said the right thing youre all right ken she told him am i he said but coming from her he believed it from anybody else he wouldnt have he knew that he grinnedgrinned like a fool probably this is an awful nice park you know that he blurted elsie nodded much more seriously than the foolish thought deserved then they looked at each other and both started to laugh minoru genda had had a cot installed in his office not far from iolani palace before he took it over it had belonged to a us navy officer in japan it would have been large and luxurious even for a man of flag rank genda believed the previous occupant was a usn lieutenant that spoke volumes about the wealth each country enjoyed the cot was us issue and considerably more comfortable than anything the japanese military used genda smiled to himself quite a few japanese recruits had never slept in a bed with legs till they joined the army or navy hed come from a good family he hadnt had that embarrassment anyway thanks to the cot and to food he had sent in he didnt have to go back to his quarters nearly so often as he would have otherwise that meant he could use the time he would have spent going back and forth for work if he woke up in the middle of the nightand he often didhe didnt have to lie there uselessly staring up at the ceiling he could turn on a lamp and attack the paperwork that never stopped piling up or pore over a map wondering how the americans would try to be difficult next at the moment the yankees were doing what they could with submarines they seemed to have stolen an idea from the uboats that harried shipping in the atlantic if they could cut hawaii off from resupply from japan the islands would be much easier to take back they werent as good at the job as the germans they didnt have enough boats to send out wolf packs and their torpedoes left a lot to be desired but they were doing what they could and it was plenty to pinch if not to strangle sending a few of their subs to the bottom would work wonders for japanese morale it wouldif anyone could figure out how to do it so far the navy hadnt had much luck and the army was starting to grumble petty officer mizukis idea of sending hks up the track of an escaping enemy sub had produced an attack but no oil slick or wreckage on the surface the next morning either the enemy boat got away clean or the anxious pilot had attacked something that wasnt there the americans usually talked too much about their losses but they werent admitting theyd had any lately genda had been puzzling till nearly midnight over what japan could do to protect her ships when he lay down he looked forward to getting up before sunrise and getting right back to work no one had ever accused him of not doing everything in his power and no one ever would as things worked out he woke up long before he expected to at half past one airraid sirens started howling genda did his best to work them into a dream about an attack on the akagi but after a few seconds his eyes opened staring up into the darkness he needed another moment to remember where he was and why then he swore and jumped out of the cot the sirens kept wailing orders were to shelter in a cellar till the allclear sounded genda was not about to obey orders like that he threw on his trousers rushed downstairs and hurried out into the quiet streets to find out what was going on careful sir said a sentry outside the building where are the enemy airplanes genda demanded before the sentry could answer antiaircraft guns around pearl harbor opened up a fireworks display of traces and bursting shells lit up the western sky half a minute later the crump of bursting bombs added to the din zakennayo genda exclaimed in dismay theyre going after akagi american flying boats didnt have the astounding range of hks they would need refueling from a submarine to reach hawaii from the us mainland and probably another refueling to make it home again as long as the enemy flying boat found the submarine in the vastness of the pacific though that wasnt an insurmountable problem the yankees must have decided the same thing yes they were doing their best to make nuisances of themselves commander fuchida had laughed when he told of suddenly appearing over san francisco harbor in an hk and bombing us warships there now the shoe was on the other footand genda didnt like the way it felt long after the american raiders must have disappeared antiaircraft fire kept throwing up shells over pearl harbor shrapnel clattered down on honolulu streets and rooftops a chunk of steel falling from a few thousand meters would kill a man as dead as any rifle bullet realizing he couldnt do anything useful where he was genda went back into the office building and climbed the stairs as fast as hed descended them he flipped on the light in his office blackout curtains kept it from leaking out into the street right this minute that probably didnt matter having struck once the americans wouldnt be back tonight genda picked up the telephone get me pearl harbor he snapped when an operator came on the line who is this the operator sounded rattled are you authorized to be telephoning during an emergency this is commander genda genda said coldly put me through at once before i ask who you are uh yes sir now the operator sounded terrified genda wanted him to sound that way pearl harborensign yasutake here the youngster who picked up the phone at pearl harbor by contrast almost squeaked with excitement after giving his name again genda asked whats going on over there is the carrier all right uh yes sir a couple of near misses but no hits yasutake said and genda breathed a sigh of relief the ensign went on uh sir how did you know the americans would attack akagi because shes the most valuable target there why come all that way if youre not going to attack the most valuable target genda said and the yankees are bound to know shes there too he was sure oahuand indeed all the hawaiian islandscrawled with american spies a hidden wireless set in the mountains a few quick code groups and trouble i dont suppose we managed to knock down the american flying boat did we no sir or at least we didnt see any sign of it ensign yasutake answered genda sighed too bad still it could be worse they didnt hurt us badly either even if they did scare us out of a years growth youre sure akagi is all right oh yes sir no new damage yasutake said genda hung up for the next little while people would be running around like chickens that had just met the chopper one of the things the army would be screaming about was that the us flying boat managed to catch the navy napping and the army would have more of a point than genda wished it did his own phone rang in the aftermidnight quiet the jangle made him jump he picked up the telephone right as the second ring started genda here this is fuchida good to hear your voice im glad youre all right im glad akagis all right commander fuchida laughed i might have known youd already know but we were lucky gendasan no more than lucky if the americans had aimed better they could have done a lot of harm we have to get some of those electronic rangefinding sets out here from the home islands then we wont be blind to attacks till theyre on top of us that marched well with gendas thoughts ill do what i can he promised ill send a message to admiral yamamoto if anybody can get some of those sets out here hes the man i wish the americans werent ahead of us theretheyre already running while weve just started to walk walking is one thing fuchida said thinking we can stand around is something else again to that genda said the only thing he could hai jiro takahashi carried a plump ahi up nuuanu avenue toward the japanese consulate the rising sun had always flown above the consulate reminding him of the land hed left when he was younger than hiroshi and kenzo were now these days the rising sun waved above iolani palace and all over hawaii that made jiro proud even if it appalled his sons even before the war started jiro had brought fine fish to the consulate the men who served japan deserved the best and talking with them had given the fisherman a taste of home so hed been glad to do it since the war started things were different jiro was pleased that his fish helped keep consul kita and chancellor morimura from going hungry japanese soldiers in their dark khaki uniforms stood guard outside the consulate along with the palace and the leading warship in hawaiian waters it was one of the places where policy for the islands got hammered out a sentry pointed toward jiro here comes the fisherman he exclaimed by the way he said it it might have been takahashis name all the sentries called jiro the fisherman they bowed as he drew near konichiwa fishermansama one of them said that was laying it on thick the fisherman or fishermansanmr fishermanwas fine fisherman sama as jiro bowed back he said you boys must be hungry if you start calling me lord fisherman the sentries laughed were always hungry fishermansama said the one whod used the name before they probably were too japanese soldiers got better rations than local civilians but still ate lots of rice and not much of anything else the sentries came from the same class as jiro and from the hiroshima area too when he could he brought them something today though he bowed again apologetically please excuse me friends next time for you if i get the chance maybe the men inside will share this ahi with you he held up the fish fat chance two soldiers said at the same time one of them added those stingy bastards dont know how lucky they are to have you for a friend no i think im the lucky one jiro said the sentries only jeered but he meant it these are important people from the home islands and theyre glad to see me of course im lucky theyre glad to see your fish anyhow a sentry said were not going to convince him another one said lets just let him through hell find out for himself sooner or later they stood aside jiro walked past them and into the consular compound a clerk greeted him good day takahashisan how are you pretty well thanks id like to see consul kita if i may jiro held up the ahi again to explain why im so sorry but the consul isnt here right now the clerk said hes still out on the golf course he wont be back till this evening the golf course jiro muttered he knew kita was fond of the western game but hed never understood why whacking a ball with a stick till it fell into a hole what was the point besides giving you an excuse to waste time whenever you felt like it chancellor morimura is in though the clerk said helpfully im sure hed be glad to help you he was looking at the ahi not at jiro maybe the sentries knew what they were talking about after all tadashi morimura was studying a map of pearl harbor when the clerk led jiro into his office morimura was tall and handsome with a long face and an aristocrats cheekbones and eyebrows he couldnt have been more than thirty good to see you takahashisan he said rising and bowing thats a handsome fish you have there do you want me to take charge of it till the consul comes back yes please jiro said morimura didnt take it in his own hands interesting hands for his left index finger was missing the first joint he called a clerk who carried it off to the refrigerator had he dismissed jiro right after that the fisherman might have decided the consular staff did value him for his fish alone but the chancellorwho held a title that sounded impressive but could have meant anythingsaid please sit down takahashi san im glad to see you i was thinking about you earlier today as a matter of fact about me jiro said in surprise as he sank into a chair haiabout you morimura nodded do you know osami murata jiro shook his head gomen nasai but im afraid i dont could you tell me who he is hes a broadcaster a radio man morimura said he usually works out of tokyo where he lives but hes here in hawaii now hes doing some shows about the islands since we took them away from the americans you would be a good man for him to interview you could tell himyou could tell all of japanwhat things are like they would hear me back in japan jiro said thats right morimura smiled and nodded his smile was exceptionally charming it made his big eyes light up theyd hear you all over the world in fact thats how shortwave radio works all over the world me jiro laughed at that i cant even get my boys to pay attention to me half the time didnt they pay attention when you were in the nippon jiji morimura asked slyly well some takahashi didnt want to say what kind of attention hed got from hiroshi and kenzo after they saw his interview in the japaneselanguage newspaper theyd warned him against being a collaborator how can i be a collaborator japan is my country he thought but his sons didnt see it that way well set up an interview tadashi morimura said are you free tomorrow afternoon takahashisan i ought to be out catching fish jiro said uncertainly morimura winked at him jiro blinked had he really seen that the chancellor said cant you send your sons out on the oshima maru by themselves for one day jiro was flattered that the consular official remembered the name of his sampanflattered almost to the point of blushing and coughing and stammering like a schoolboy i suppose i could he said and knew that he would hiroshi and kenzo would be astonished when he didnt want to put to sea with them hed never been a man to shirk work and say what they would about him they couldnt claim he had but they were no happier with his company than he was with theirs their hearts wouldnt break to make a fishing run without him if they brought in a good catch they wouldnt let him forget it either he shrugged broad shoulders hed survived worse things than that what time would you want me here morimurasan he asked come at two o clock morimura answered but not here go to the kgmb studio thats where he will want to do the interview have you got the address im sorry but no not speaking english and not caring for the music kgmb played jiro had no idea where the station was morimura gave him the address it wasnt too far from the consulate ill be there he promised and he was his sons both stared at him when he told them to take the oshima maru out on their own but they didnt argue very hard or ask very many questions that saddened jiro without much surprising him nobody could stay sad for long around osami murata what no fish for me he exclaimed when morimura introduced jiro to him im so insulted im going to commit seppuku he mimed slitting his belly then laughed uproariously now takahashisan lets figure out what were going to talk about when we get you in front of the mike he was a whirlwind of jokes and energy jiro could no more help being swept along than his sampan could have in a gale he wasnt even nervous when murata plopped him down in a chair in front of a mike in a room whose likes hed never seen before the ceiling three of the walls and even the inside of the door were covered by what looked like cardboard egg cartons noticing his stare murata said stuff deadens sound he pointed to the fourth wall which was of glass and let jiro see into the adjoining room those are the engineers in there if theyre very very good maybe well let them out again once the show is over did he mean it he mightsome of them were haoles and had surely been doing their jobs here before the japanese came or he might be fooling again trying to put jiro at ease nervous murata asked when jiro nodded the broadcaster poked him in the ribs and made funny faces haoles were often boisterous and foolish jiro didnt know what to make of a japanese who acted like that murata scribbled some notes then pointed to a light bulb that wasnt shining just then when that comes on well start all right hai jiro didnt know whether it was all right or not he didnt know which end was up just then the bulb lit up it was red this is osami murata your man on the go murata said glibly leaning toward the microphone ive gone a long way todayhere i am in honolulu in the kingdom of hawaii im talking with jiro takahashi whos been here a lot longer than i have say hello to the people back in the home islands takahashisan hello jiro said weakly here in hawaii his oldfashioned hiroshima accent was nothing out of the ordinary most japanese whod come here started out from that part of the country muratas elegant tones though told the world he hailed from tokyo they made jiro acutely selfconscious murata winked at him again it didnt help much the broadcaster said why did you move to hawaii all those years ago to work in the fields here jiro answered the money was better than i could get back home so i thought id try it and how did you like it hard work jiro exclaimed and murata laughed in surprise takahashi went on as soon as i could i got away from cane and pineapple i rented a fishing boat till i could finally afford to buy one put everything together and ive done all right for myself a man who works hard will do all right for himself wherever he is murata said jiro found himself nodding the younger man asked him did you ever think about going back to japan i thought about it yes but by then id married and settled down and had a couple of boys jiro answered with a shrug looks like im here for good karma neh hai murata said but japan has reached out to you and youre under the rising sun again what do you think about that hed mentioned the kingdom of hawaii but now he didnt bother pretending the islands were under anything but japanese control im glad jiro said simply japan is my country i want her to do well thats good thats what we like to hear murata said effusively and your family thinks the same way i lost my wife in the fighting but i know she would have agreed with me jiro said and that was true reiko was also from the old country and from his generation of course she would have been happy to see japan take over from the united states im so sorry to hear of your loss takahashisan osami murata sounded as if he meant it and what about your sons jiro might have known he would ask that jiro had known he would ask it answering it wasnt easy though carefully takahashi said i always tried to raise them as good japanese they went to japanese school every day after american school was over they learned to read and write and they speak with a better accent than the sorry one ive got youre just fine the way you are takahashisan murata said easily if he noticed that jiro hadnt really said how his sons felt about the japanese occupation of hawaii he didnt let on one of the men on the other side of the glass gave him a signal he nodded to show hed got it then turned back to jiro do you have anything to say to the folks back home only banzai for the emperor and that im proud to be a japanese subject again jiro answered thank you jiro takahashi murata said the red light went out the broadcaster leaned back there thats done i think it went well arigato youre welcome jiro said automatically they really heard me in japan they really did unless the atmospherics are just horrendousand theyve been good lately murata said im glad chancellor morimura arranged for you to meet me youre exactly what we needed nobody had ever said anything like that to jiro before the way i talk he began murata waved that away dont worry about it not everybody comes from tokyo this is better it will remind people the whole country is together here the whole country a slow smile spread over jiros face being part of japan again feels good osami murata smiled too it ought to he said and set a hand on takahashis shoulder you dont want to be an american do you i should hope not jiro said quickly hiroshi and kenzo had other ideas but at least he hadnt had to come out and say so on the radio when jim peterson looked at the junglecovered koolau range from a distance hed always thought how lush the mountains seemed now up at the end of the kalihi valley to drive a tunnel through them he had a different view of the jungle green hell when he thought of a jungle he thought of trees full of tasty fruit of animals making a racket and common enough to be easily caught what he thought of and what he got in the kalihi valley were two different things nobody had done much with the valley till the japs decided to drive a road up through it and to tunnel through the mountains almost all of the trees in the valley were oahu natives and they didnt have much in the way of fruit as for the animals hed seen a few mongoosesmongeese skulking through the ferns every now and then he spotted a bird up in the trees and that seemed to be it he and his companions in misery had little chance to supplement the tiny rice ration the guards doled out it was live on that or die actually it was live on that and die a man couldnt possibly do hard physical labor on what the japanese fed him not if he was going to last very long of course if a man didnt do hard physical labor on what they fed him theyd kill him on the spot that put the pows in the kalihi valley in an interesting position green hell again it rained a lot of the time up in the mountains when it didnt rain water dripped from the trees petersons clothes started to rot and fall apart even faster than they had when he was in a less muggy part of the island some of the men he worked with men whod been in the valley longer were next to naked odds of getting anything from the japs two chancesslim and none the prisoners slept in bamboo huts thatched with whatever leaves and branches they could throw on top it was about as wet inside the huts as outside the bunks were better than lying in the mud but only a little jesus peterson said looking down at his hands as light leached out of the sky theyd been battered and callused before he got here they were worse now the japs here pushed pows harder than they had anywhere else this was punishment work what prisoners did if the occupiers decided not to shoot them whether that was a mercy was an open question somebody got up and shambled off toward the latrine trench most of the men whod been here for a while had dysentery some of the new fish had already come down with it peterson hadnt yet but figured it was only a matter of time jesus he said again and then god damn walter london to hell and gone amen said gordy braddon who came from his shooting squad and if that son of a bitch was in hell screaming for water id give him gasoline to drink ethyl no less yeah peterson said savagely wasnt for him wed be his voice trailed away even without londons escape their predicament wouldnt have been anything wonderful but it would have been better than this anything would have been better than this hed had that thought before hed had it several times since the surrender in fact every damn one of them hed been wrong if he turned out to be wrong againim a dead man he thought he might easily end up a dead man even if there was nothing worse than this he knew that too and when he flopped back onto the bunk and closed his eyes he sure as hell slept like a dead man a jap banging a shell casing with a hammer made him pry his eyes open the next morning groans rose in the hut from those with the energy to give them not everybody sat up despite the racket of iron smashing against brass the japs came in and started kicking people that got most of the pows up and moving one scrawny fellow just lay there the guard whod been shouting at him and booting him gave him a yank he fell on the groundplop the guard felt of him then straightened up shinde iru he said and jerked a thumb toward the door as if to add get rid of the carrion poor jonesy said somebody behind peterson he wasnt a bad guy although the dead jonesy couldnt have weighed more than a hundred pounds four pows carried him out peterson was one of them they were all just shadows of their former selves and fading shadows at that the graveyard didnt have individual graves just big trenches flies buzzed around them even though the japs did put down quicklime after a fresh corpse went in thump in fell the dead jones they tried not to put him on top of anybody else but the trenches were filling up despite the lime the stench was bad could be one of us next a bearer said stubbornly jim peterson shook his head as long as were strong enough to carry we wont die right away i aim to last till the us of a comes back how long do you figure thatll be the other man asked him he didnt say ever which was something peterson shrugged damfino im gonna stick it out thats all the japs are putting us in graves but im gonna spit on one of theirs by god even saying that was taking a chance if one of the other three corpsehaulers ratted on him to the japs they might kill him out of hand but they probably wouldnt he couldnt do anything to them no matter what he said odds were theyd just beat him up and put him back to work till he couldnt work any more we better get back he said if we arent at the lineup they wont feed us that got his companions in misery moving losing out on food was the worst thing that could happen to you here worse even than a beating food kept your motor turning over assuming you wanted to go on living that was good as peterson and the other three walked back men from another hut came past them with a dead body even skinnier than jonesys had been peterson heard the final thud as it went in he didnt look back the count for his hut was fouled up as it often was when somebody died the japs always got all hot and bothered when they saw fewer men than they expected they knew jonesy was dead but that somehow didnt seem to matter they had to fuss and fume and gabble and wave their hands till they remembered that so many live guys minus one dead guy equaled the number of guys swaying in front of the hut rain started coming down when the pows finally trudged off to get their morning rice this wasnt liquid sunshine up here in the mountains when it rained it rained like a son of a bitch petersons shoes squelched in the mud it leaked in through growing gaps between uppers and soles pretty soon those shoes were just going to fall apart he didnt know what hed do then no actually he did know hed damn well go barefoot for the first few minutes after food hit his stomach he felt almost like a human being he headed for the tunnel site gangs whod got there before him had built the road up to the mountains it wasnt paved but it was heavily graveledusable in all weather without a doubt if the tunnel ever went through the japs would have a shortcut between honolulu and kaneohe on the east coast of oahu did they care were the pows working on the tunnel for its sake or just to work on something till they dropped some of each was petersons guess from his point of view it hardly mattered whether the japs cared about the tunnel or not the pows were going to work till they dropped guards didnt carry picks and shovels they carried rifles and sometimes axe handles if they didnt like the way a pow was moving theyd whack him with one or the other or sometimes haul off and kick him a prisoner couldnt strike back if he did the guards would bayonet him and let him die slowly they knew which wounds would kill in a hurry and avoided those there werent that many guards peterson sometimes thought a concerted rising here might succeed if it did though so what the prisoners would still be stuck at the ass end of the kalihi valley and the japs could easily seal off the outlet whereupon everybody here would starve since living off the land was impossible damned if we do damned if we dont he thought they didand they were damned peterson grabbed a pick and shouldered it like a springfield torches and candles threw the only light once peterson and his gang got into the tunnel shadows swooped and leaped as men trudged past the flickering flames roman slaves sent to the mines must have looked on scenes like this peterson wondered whether anyone since had the sound of picks biting into volcanic rock drew him onward shovelers loaded the chunks the pickmen loosened into wicker baskets haulers lugged the spoil out of the tunnel one basketload the pows argued about which job was worst because they argued they switched off every so often there was the face of the excavation peterson swung up his pick and brought it forward when he pulled it loose basalt or granite or whatever the hell this stuff was came with it a shoveler used his spade to get the stuff away from petersons feet peterson swung up the pick again as it did on a road gang work had a pace here prisoners growled at anybody who worked too fast they had reason to growl if one guy did it the japs would expect everybody else to why give the slanteyed monkeys the satisfaction of busting your balls for their lousy tunnel besides a lot of pows couldnt do anything more than they were doing if the japs made them work harder theyd die sooner than they would have otherwise up forward thunk pull clatter pause up forward thunk after a while the work like a lot of work developed its own rhythm peterson fell into the almost mindless state any endlessly repetitive labor can bring on not thinking was better if time just went by he didnt dwell on how tired or how hungry or how filthy he was and then he brought himself up short so suddenly that he almost slammed the pick down on his own foot aside from the selfinflicted wound that would have earned him a thumping from the guards to them anybody who hurt himself was trying to shirk and they made wouldbe shirkers sorry but if they were serious about wanting this tunnel to kaneohe wouldnt they be using a lot more dynamite and maybe jackhammers and a lot less of this hand labor out of ancient days of course they would anybody with an ounce of sense would the japs didnt have a lot of their own bulldozers but they sure used the ones theyd captured here to fix up airstrips and to dig out field fortifications they were bastards yeah but they werent stupid bastards which meant the tunnel washad to bedesigned first and foremost to work pows to death that made perfect sense and nothing else did and if he hadnt been so weary and starved he would have seen it right away it also made no damn difference not in what he had to do the air stank of sour sweat and rock dust and burning fat the rubble on the tunnel floor poked and gouged his feet through the soles of his shoes what would happen when the shoes gave up the ghost things would get even nastier that was all up forward thunk pull clatter pause up forward lieutenant saburo shindo looked out across the airstrip at haleiwa it was beautiful no doubt about that green grass a creamy beach and then the blue blue pacific what worried him were the things the blue blue pacific hid he forgot about the view and glowered at the mechanics hed summoned dont tell me it isnt an authorized modification he snapped i want a bomb rack on my zero and i want a bomb rack on every zero at this airstrip wakarimasuka yes of course we understand lieutenantsan one of the mechanics answered but think of the drawbacks what happens if you get into a dogfight with an american plane think how much the weight and drag of a bomb would hurt you if i run into an american i can dump the bomb shindo said but i need something to let me go after submarinesor surface ships if the yankees stick their noses into these waters again youre not going to tell me the bomb rack will slow me down much by itself are you his glare warned that theyd better not tell him any such thing and the chief mechanic shook his head oh no sir but what about a malfunction how could you land on a carrier with an unreleased bomb carefully i suspect shindos voice was dry had the mechanic been an officer he would have had plenty to say his face made that very plain since he was only a rating sir thats not funny had to suffice i didnt say it was shindo answered what other way would you expect me to land after those conditions and after i get downbecause i will get downthe first thing i will do is come after the thumbfingered idiots who mounted a malfunctioning piece of equipment on my plane so it had better work the first time and every single time after the first do you understand that the mouthy mechanic bowed so did all his friends they had to know shindo wasnt kidding if something went wrong with the bomb rack he would come after them probably with his sword and no japanese military court was likely to convict an officer for anything he did to ratings good shindo nodded coldly to them you cant tell me theres no scrap metal to do the job either hawaii has more scrap metal than a dog has fleas they bowed again their faces showed nothing nothing at all shindo knew what that meant they hated his guts but discipline kept them from showing it for a moment that tickled himbut only for a moment a mechanic who didnt like a pilot had a million ways to take his revenge planes broke down a million ways if an accident wasnt quite an accident whod know yes whod know especially if the evidence if there was any evidence lay at the bottom of the pacific shindo bowed back it went against his grain but he did it the mechanics flicked glances at one another domo arigato he said their eyebrows sprang up like startled stags superiors were not in the habit of thanking inferiors so warmly he went on we all serve the empire of japan and we should always do everything we can to help her hai several of the stolid men in coveralls spoke up the word could have been no more than acknowledgment but he thought it was also agreement they did love the empire no matter what they thought of him and they had to know he felt the same way about his country good he told them very good take care of it we never can tell when the americans will come sneaking around again they did what he told them if they did it more for japan than for him he didnt mind if anything that made it better if they did it for japan they were likelier to forget their anger at him a couple of days later though he did get a telephone call from commander fuchida whats this i hear about fitting bomb racks to your fighters up there fuchida asked shindo slowly nodded to himself i might have known he thought mechanics had more ways than sabotage to make their displeasure felt gossip could be just as dangerous its true sir shindo told the senior air officer i want to be in a position to kill a submarine if i spot one i cant dive like an aichi but ill get the job done he waited if fuchida said no to whom could he appeal commander genda not likely not when genda and fuchida were two fingers of the same hand captain toda would he overturn a ruling his air experts had made again not likely admiral yamamoto shindo was not the least bold of men but he quailed at that besides yamamoto was back in japan and would surely defer to his men on the spot but fuchida said all right shindosan go ahead and do it the more versatility we can give our aircraft here the better off well be thank you sir shindo said in glad surprise i had the same thought myself he hadnt not really his own ideas centered on finding new ways to strike the enemy keeping a superior sweet never hurt though especially when hed just given you what you wanted ive been subhunting myself but i havent had any luck nobodys had a whole lot of luck hunting subs and the army isnt very happy with us on account of that fuchida said anything that gives a plane that spots a sub a chance to sink it sounds good in my book we agree completely this time shindo was telling the truth he and fuchida talked a little while longer before the senior officer broke the connection a smile of satisfaction on his face shindo hung up too he started to get up and throw the news in the mechanics faces so they thought they could go behind his back did they well they had another think coming after a couple of steps shindo checked himself he laughed an unpleasant laugh better if he kept his mouth shut let the mechanics find out for themselves that fuchida had come down on his side they would soon enough then they would spend some time worrying about whether he knew what theyd done he laughed again yes letting them stew was better he could tell when they learned what fuchida had said theyd worked on the bomb racks before that but in slow motion all at once they got serious about the project things that shouldnt have taken very long suddenly didnt take very long only a few days later than they would have if theyd worked flatout from the start they had the racks on every zero at haleiwa shindo was the first man to test one he didnt want any of the people he led doing something he wouldnt or couldnt do himself he had the armorers load a light practice bomb into the rack and took his zero up it did feel a little sluggish with the bomb attached the mechanics were right about that the problem wasnt bad though he picked a target not far from the airstrip a boulder poking up through the grass did duty for a surfaced submarine he thumbed the new button the mechanics had installed on the instrument panel the bomb fell free he didnt hit the boulder but he frightened it a sub made a much bigger target and he would have been carrying a much bigger bomb if hed put that bomb so close to a submarine he was sure he would have hurt it back to the airstrip he went there wasnt a lot of fuel for practice groundcrew men guided his plane back to its camouflaged revetment in spite of the fuel shortage he told his pilots i want all of you to get as much practice as you can this is important the better you get when it doesnt count the better youll do when it does the pilots nodded almost in unison most of them were veterans of the pearl harbor strikes that had opened the war in the pacific they knew what meticulous planning and preparation were worth let me find a submarine shindo thought let me find one and ill give it a nasty surprise were those the craters of the moon down there joe crosetti knew better but the bombing range had sure as hell taken a beating he held the texan in a dive watching height peel off the altimeter when he got down to feet he released the bomb that hung beneath the trainer the texan wasnt a dive bomber any more than it was a fighter but it could impersonate either joe pulled back hard on the stick to bring the planes nose up and get it out of the dive when you were down to half a mile off the ground you didnt have much margin for error even in a plane a lot more sedate than one you would take into combat not bad mr crosetti the instructor saidabout as much praise as he ever gave take her back to the base and land her aye aye sir joe had to look around to figure out where he was and in which direction pensacola naval air station lay that didnt matter much herehe had plenty of landmarks to guide him back with only ocean between his plane and a carrier it might not be so good some guys seemed to have a compass between their ears they always knew right where they were and how to get where they were going without fuss muss bother or visible calculation joe suspected orson sharp was like that his roomie was a strange bird but a damn capable one he wished he could find home as automatically as he reached into his pocket for a halfdollar but navigation didnt come easy for him that didnt mean he couldnt navigate only that doing it was hard work he put the texan down in a landing he was proud of if hed been that neat when he soloed in it but he had more experience now the more experience he got the more he realized how much it mattered i know you want to be a fighter jockey the instructor said as they climbed out of the texan yes sir joe agreed thats fine the older man told him but if you dont get what you want you can strike at the enemy in a dive bomber too if anything you can strike harder fighters fight other airplanes dive bombers fight the ships that carry airplanes yes sir joe said again it wasnt that the other officer was wronghe wasnt but joe had had his heart set on flying a fighter since before he volunteered for the naval aviation program oh sure a dauntless could make a jap battlewagon or carrier very unhappybut it was such a lumbering pig in the air next to a wildcat okay the instructor sounded wryly amused no doubt he knew just what joe was thinking fighter pilots got the glory and glory could look mighty good to a kid getting close to finishing flight school joe hustled back to his dorm room to work on trig problems hed have to turn in that afternoon no navigation wasnt easy for him that just meant he had to sweat it out the hard way the door flew open in burst orson sharp joe stared at him joe in fact dropped his pencil his roommate looked excited and sharp was usually cool as a cucumber whats up joe asked you havent heard sharp demanded nope joe shook his head if i had would i be asking you no i guess not the kid from utah nodded to himself word is were going to have one of the pilots off the yorktown talk to us this afternoon wow joe forgot all about trigonometry this was bigger news than any navigation problem the yorktown lay at the bottom of the pacific somewhere north of hawaii the japs had sunk her in the failed us attack against the islands not many of those guys left orson sharp nodded i should say not they had to ditch in the ocean and hope a destroyer would pick them up that wasnt the only reason there werent many yorktown pilots left japanese fliers had taken a savage toll on them sharp didnt mention that and joe didnt dwell on it cadets werent in the habit of ditching classes anyhow but the hall where the pilot would speak was packed tighter than a cable car with a tourist convention in town the navigation instructor whose class the pilot was taking was a dour lieutenant commander named otis jones hed pulled every string he knew how to pull to get sea duty but he was still here that no doubt helped make him dour all the same joe was convinced hed been born with a lemon in his mouth now he said gentlemen it is my privilege to present to you lieutenant jack hadley formerly of the uss yorktown soon to return to one of the carriers now building lieutenant hadley hadley came out and saluted jones the cadets gave the fighter pilot a standing ovation he eyed them with an awshucks grin he wasnt much older than they were some of them might have been older than he was thanks guys he said like his cleancut blond good looks his flat vowels said he came from somewhere in the midwest being around cadets from all over the country had made joe way better at placing accents than hed ever needed to be back in san francisco hadley went on why dont all of you sit down again and if you dont mind too much im gonna do the same thing no matter what lieutenant commander jones said hadley wasnt going back to sea right away he walked with a pronounced limp and carried a cane a nasty burn scar showed below his left shirt cuff joe wondered how far up his arm it went and what other wounds his summer whites concealed when jones brought him a chair he sank into it rather stiffly and sat with his left leg the bad one out straight in front of him thank you sir he said to jones who nodded brusquely and sat down himself at a frontrow desk hed saved with a homemade reserved sign jack hadley looked out at the crowded room again youve got to remember gentlemen i dont have a whole lot of experience against the japs myself but what ive got is more than most americans have so heres how it looks to me first thing you need to remember is the japs arent a joke forgetting that is the fastest way i know to get yourselves killed all the jokes we made up till last year about them being little bucktoothed guys with funny glasses flying planes made out of tinfoil and scrap ironall that stuffs a bunch of hooey theyre lousy backstabbing soandsos yeah but theyre awful good at what they do they flew rings around us out there he paused a look of intense recollection on his face joe wondered exactly what his minds eye was seeing whatever it was it didnt seem pleasant hadleys left arm twitched a little maybe that meant something maybe it didnt the injured pilot was the only one who knew for sure after a silence that lasted a few seconds too long for comfort hadley went on the japs are no joke and their planes are no joke either youve probably heard a thing or two about what the zero can do he paused again this time waiting for nods when he got them he resumed well everything youve heard is true thats one hell of an airplane its faster than a wildcat it climbs better and it can turn inside you like you wouldnt believeand a wildcats pretty maneuverable all by itself if you try and dogfight a zero you are fitting yourself for a coffin dont do it you wont do it more than once again he seemed to look at something only he could see this time he explained what it was they told me the same thing im telling you i didnt want to listen i figured no jap in the world had my number shows what i know he gathered himself dont dogfight them he repeated if youre taking notes write that down if youre not taking notes write it down anyway he tried the awshucks grin again it came out strained youve got two edges and only two a wildcat can outdive a zero you can make a firing run from above and behind or if youre in a lot of trouble you can dive out of there and most of the time youll get away joe waited to hear what the other edge was while he waited he underlined what hed written about not dogfighting but hadley seemed to have dried up lieutenant commander jones had to prompt him lieutenant huh jack hadley came back to himself from wherever hed gone oh sorry sir i was thinking about battle damage you might say yeah battle damage was he talking about what had happened to himself to his airplane or to the whole fleet the usa sent against hawaii did it matter hadley gathered himself again theres one other thing you can do to at least help keep those monkeys off you a pilot named jimmy thach thought it up and the thach weave does some good anyway he briefly described the system explaining how a threatened planes sharp turn away from the enemy would alert the other pair in a fourplane element to turn towards it and give them a good shot this isnt perfect not even close he finished it takes really tight teamwork and a lot of practice to work well but it does give us some kind of chance against a superior airplane and we hardly had any before he took questions then several people joe among them asked about the thach weave hadley painfully levered himself to his feet and drew diagrams on the blackboard they helped joe hadnt been able to visualize the tactic well from words alone the circles and arrows helped him see what needed doing whether he could do it and do it in coordination with other pilotswell that might be a different question but he was practicing formation flying too so he figured hed get the hang of it then orson sharp said sir would you tell us about your ditching before hadley said anything he sat down again again his bad leg stuck out in front of him he reached out and touched that stiff knee id already got this by then damn bullet came in from the side the armor in the seat is good the stuff in the cockpits not so hot tell you the truth that damn jap filled the plane full of holes my engine was starting to cook thank god those radials are aircooled though a liquidcooled engine wouldve lost its coolant and frozen up on me long before and idve gone into the drink too far from home as it was i nursed her back toward where our ships were at i was hoping we still had a working carrier but no such luck every time the flames got going in the cockpit id use the extinguisher to putem outmostly he looked down at his burned arm joe couldnt tell if he knew he was doing it i put her in the water as slow and smooth as i could hadley said then i pushed back the cockpitthat still worked great in spite of all the damage id takendragged myself out and managed to inflate my life raft a destroyer picked me upand here i am he gave them that farmboy grin one more time he made it sound easy how much fear and pain hid behind the smiling facade enough so that even somebody like joe crosetti whod never seen combat could tell they were there but since jack hadley pretended they werent everybody else had to do the same thing could i do that joe wondered he hoped so but he was honest enough to admit to himself that he had no idea jane armitage stood in line to get what the community kitchen in wahiawa dished out for supper as usual what plopped onto her plate would have been the butt of a catskills comics joke the food here is lousyand such small portions she got a boiled potato bigger than a pingpong ball but smaller than a tennis ball some greens that might have been turnip tops or might have been weeds and unusually a chunk of fish a little larger than a book of matches by the way the fish smelled it hadnt been caught yesterdayor the day before either jane didnt complain wahiawa was as near in the middle of oahu as made no difference it wasnt very far from the pacificnothing on the island wasbut fish of any sort seldom got away from the coast too many hungry mouths especially in honolulu other people were as glad to see the treat as she was isnt that something was what she heard most often she sat down at one of the tables scattered around the elementaryschool playground and dug in the fish had an undertaste of ammonia that went with the way it smelled if shed got it in a restaurant before the occupation she would have angrily sent it back now she ate every crumb all of the nondescript and rather nasty greens and every bit of potato she didnt lick the plate when she was through but some people around her did haoles mostly sat together so did local japanese so did chinese so did filipinos so did wahiawas handful of koreansas far away from the local japanese as they could not all the local japs collaborated with major hirabayashi and the occupiersfar from itbut enough did that people from other groups were leery about having too much to do with them jane sat and listened to the chatter around herin english and otherwise blaming the local japanese for all the troubles in wahiawa wasnt fair some of them really did see japan as their country more than they saw the usa that way how could you blame them when a lot of haoles had gone out of their way to make it plain they didnt think japs were as good as they were and besides the local japanese werent the only collaborators sitting one table away from jane was smiling sammy little whod sold jalopies to servicemen from schofield barracks before the invasion he hadnt quite been a loan shark but his interest rates were as high as the law allowed and a lot of his cars were lemons he was still smiling these days with next to no gas on the island he didnt sell cars any more but the japs were glad to buy what he had for them jane hated him much more than she did someone like yosh nakayama smiling sammy didnt remember or care that he was supposed to be an american if the russians or the ethiopians or the argentines had invaded hawaii he would have sucked up to them too egypt outside of alexandria montgomery jane got tantalizing bits of conversation from the table on the other side of her she tried to listen without paying obvious attention somebody over there either had an outlawed radio or knew someone else who had one news that wasnt japanese propaganda did circulate in spite of everything the occupiers could do to stop it she swore under her breath they were talking in low voices and she couldnt hear as much as she wanted what was going on outside of alexandria had the germans broken through at last or had montgomery somehow held them she couldnt make it out she looked back toward the pans and kettles where the cooks had fixed the evening slop she hoped for dessert even though she knew what it would be if this nightmare ever ended shed taken a savage oath never to touch rice pudding again for the rest of her life hawaii still had sugar and it had some rice boil them together till they were something close to glue and there was a treat that counted as one only because there were no others jane looked down at her arms every time she did she thought she was a little skinnier than before how long could that go on before nothing was left of her or of anyone else not forever and she knew it too well and so she didnt despise even the sweetish library paste that went by the name of rice pudding calories were calories wherever they came from but the cooks gave no sign of having any dessert at all to dish out today she swore again not quite so softly she was so tired of being hungry all the time and she was just so tired had it been less than a year ago that shed walked into a restaurant and ordered a tbone too big to finish she hadnt thought anything of it she hadnt even asked for a bag to take home the leftovers christ what a fool i was had she eaten beef since the japs occupied wahiawa she didnt think so she carried her plate and silverware to the dishwashers everyone took turns at that one of the women was saying something to another one when she walked over to them they both clammed up before she could hear what it was they started again when she walked off and got too far away to make out what they were saying her stomach knotted and for once it wasnt the wretched food were they gossiping about her about somebody she knew somebody they knew she knew about whatever was happening outside of alexandria whatever it was shed never know they didnt trust her enough to let her in on it before the war shed talked with her thirdgraders about the difference between freedom and dictatorship shed talked about it yeah but she hadnt understood it the difference lay in what people said to one another and in what they didnt say when other people might hear it lay in trust and trust in wahiawa was as dead as comfortable american rule over hawaii if the united states came back if the stars and stripes once again flew over the school and the post office and schofield barracks would that trust return how could it once it was so badly broken but if it didnt would the islands ever really be free again fletch armitage was sick of digging he would have been sick of digging even if he werent doing it on starvation rations he looked like a skeleton with callused hands the japs didnt care if he got too weak to dig they wouldnt put him in the infirmary till his strength came back theyd just knock him over the head the way you would with a dog that got hit by a car then theyd give his shovel to somebody else and use that poor miserable bastard up too and why not as far as they were concerned prisoners were fair game they had tens of thousands of them if they worked pows to death they wouldnt have to worry nearly so much about plots and escape attempts skeletons with callused hands didnt have the energy or the strength to try anything drastic all the energy they had was focused on staying alive and they had to put all their strength into the work if they didnt the japanese noncoms who lorded it over them made them pay this was going to be a gun emplacement it was nicely sited on the south side of a low hill to make it harder to spot from the norththe probable direction of any invasionbut thered be an observer at the top of the hill to guide the firing hed be hard to spot too especially once they got done camouflaging his position running a phone line between the one place and the other would be easy as pie fletch had a thoroughly professional appreciation of what the japs were doing right here he didnt appreciate having to work on it making him do that went dead against the geneva convention the japs were proud that they hadnt signed it anybody who complained on that particular score caught hellor even more hell than anybody else caught odds were the phone line the japs used to link the top of the hill and the gun emplacement would be captured american equipment they were using as much of what theyd grabbed here as they could and they were fortifying oahu to a faretheewell the united states had put a lot of men a lot of equipment and a lot of ships in hawaii having done that the americans smugly decided no one would have the nerve to attack them here and look what that got us fletch thought turning another shovelful of earth the japs labored under no such illusions they knew the usa wanted hawaii back if the americans managed to land they would have to fight their way south an inch at a time through works their own countrymen had made every time fletch stuck his shovel in the ground he gave aid and comfort to the enemy he didnt like feeling like a traitor he didnt know what he could do about it though if he didnt do what the japs told him to they would kill him it wouldnt be as neat or quick as knocking him over the head either they would make him suffer so nobody else got frisky ideas isogi the closest jap noncom shouted like everybody else who heard him fletch worked faster for a while he didnt look back to see if the bandylegged bugger was yelling at him in particular he just sped up looking back suggested to the japs that you had a guilty conscience it gave them an excuse to wallop you as if they needed much in the way of excuses ten minutes later fletch did look back over his shoulder the jap was standing there spraddlelegged his back to the pows taking a leak fletch promptly eased off he wasnt the only one who did one of the fellows in his shooting squad was a tall sandyhaired guy from mississippi named clyde newcomb lord almighty he said wiping his sweaty face with his filthy sleeve now i know what bein a nigger in the cotton fields feels like fletch dug out another shovelful of dirt and flung it aside i do believe id sell my soul to be a nigger in a cotton field right now he said as long as it was a cotton field on the mainland well yeah far as the work goes i would too newcomb said i wouldnt ask moren about a dime for it neither but thats not what i meant nobody ever treated me like a goddamn nigger till i stacked my springfield and surrendered we aint nothin but dirt to the japs an lowgrade dirt at that so you southern guys treated niggers like dirt fletch didnt care much one way or the other but anything you could talk about helped make time go by and that was all to the good youre agitatin me newcomb spoke without heat but seriously you gotta let the niggers know whos boss you dont and pretty soon theyll start thinkin theyre just as good as white folks you mean like the japs here in hawaii started thinking they were just as good as haoles fletch asked whites here hadnt lynched local japanese the way whites lynched negroes in mississippi theyd found other not quite so brutal ways to keep them in their place even so they were paying now for what theyd done then if the japs here had been treated better there would be fewer collaborators these days clyde newcomb gave him a funny look yeah kind ofonly niggers really are down lower than we are fletch took it no further what was the point newcomb was so blind to some things he didnt even know he couldnt see them and were supposed to win this war god help us did the japs have clodhoppers like newcomb running around loose maybe they did some of these guards sure acted as if a rifle was far and away the most complicated thing theyd ever had to worry about fletch hoped so if the other sides yahoos didnt cancel out ours we were in a hell of a lot of trouble another load of dirt flew from fletchs shovel and another and another every so often a noncom would yell at the pows to hurry up again and they would for a little while or till he turned his back even if newcomb didnt know his ass from third base it was the rhythm of a cotton field but of a cotton field back in slavery days before the civil war nobody here worked any harder than he absolutely had to the overseers knew it as well as the slaves they made an example out of somebody who moved too slowly to suit themor maybe somebody chosen at randomalmost every day and they were more savage than the overseers of the american south negro slaves had been expensive pieces of property overseers back then could get in trouble for damaging them none of the japs cared what happened to pows here the more of them who dropped dead the happier they seemed a whistle blew when the sun went down the work gang lined up for the little lumps of rice and greens that wouldnt have been enough to keep men alive if theyd lain around doing nothing then they slept exhaustion made bare ground a perfect mattress fletch closed his eyes and he was gone when he dreamt he dreamt of jane that hadnt happened in a while but he didnt dream of her naked and lively in the bedroom the way he had after they first broke up he couldnt remember the last time hed dreamt of janeor even of a hotel street hookerthat way this dream was even more excruciatingly sensual and filled him with an even more desolate sense of loss he dreamt of jane naked and lively in the kitchen she was fixing him the breakfast to end all breakfasts half a dozen eggs fried over mediumjust the way he liked themin butter a dozen thick slices of smokerich bacon hot fat glistening on them a foothigh pile of golden flapjacks slathered in more butter yellow as tigers and real vermont maple syrup wheat toast with homemade strawberry preserves coffee as much as he could drink cream sugar oh god he made enough noise to wake himself up he looked down to see if hed come in his pants he hadnt he was damned if he knew why not corporal takeo shimizu led his squad on patrol down king street the japanese soldiers marched in the middle of the street there was no wheeled traffic to interfere with them except for rickshaws pedicabs and the occasional horsedrawn carriage or wagon it was another perfect honolulu day not too hot not too muggy just right shiro wakuzawas eyes swung to the right i still say thats the funniestlooking thing i ever saw he remarked have you looked in a mirror lately shimizu asked the rest of the squad laughed at wakuzawa but it wasnt cruel laughter as it would have been in a lot of units shimizu hadnt said it intending to wound hed just made a joke and the soldiers he led took it that way and wakuzawa wasnt far wrong the water tower decked out with painted sheet metal to look like an enormous pineapple was one of the funniestlooking things shimizu had ever seen too senior private yasuo furusawa who had a thoughtful turn of mind said whats even funnier is that it stood up through all the fighting he wasnt wrong either after bombing pearl harbor japanese planes had also pounded honolulus harbor district the aloha tower down right by the pacific was only a ruin but the water tower which had to be one of the ugliest things ever made still stood on the patrol went japanese soldiers and sailors on leave scrambled to get out of their way since shimizu was on patrol he could have asked them for their papers if he felt officious some of them probably didnt have valid papers if he wanted to make his superiors smile on him catching such miscreants was a good way to do it but shimizu was a long way from officious and didnt like sucking up to his superiors he enjoyed a good time himself why shouldnt others feel the same way civilians bowed shimizu marched his men through one of the unofficial markets that dotted this part of honolulu they were technically illegal he could have caused trouble for the locals by hauling in buyers and sellers but againwhy you had to go along to get along and he didnt see how a trade in fish and rice and coconuts did anybody any harm besides this market was within sight of iolani palace if the guards didnt like it they could close it down shimizu snickered the japanese soldiers and naval landing troops at iolani palace were just as much a ceremonial force as the hawaiian unit with whom they now shared their duty they probably werent good for much that involved actual work corporalsan do those hawaiian soldiers have live ammunition in their rifles private wakuzawa asked they didnt used to but i hear they finally do shimizu said were pretending theyre a real kingdom so it would be an insult if they didnt neh i suppose so wakuzawa said are they reliable though senior private furusawa answered that before shimizu could as long as we outnumber them theyre reliable everybody in the squad laughed shimizu included it looked that way to him too this is like manchukuo only more so he said the soldiers nodded at that they all understood it manchukuo had a real army and a real air arm not the toy force the king of hawaii boasted but the soldiers and fliers obeyed the japanese officers on the spot not the puppet emperor of manchukuo and if they ever decided not to japan had more than enough men in manchukuo to squash them flat the hawaiians were impressivelooking men many of them were more than a head taller than their japanese counterparts but the american defenders of oahu had been bigger than shimizu and his comrades and much good it did them he thought on marched shimizus squad every so often he looked back over his shoulder to make sure his men were parading properly he didnt catch them doing anything they shouldnt they always pointed their faces straight ahead and kept them impassive if their eyes slid to the right or the left every now and then to look at a pretty girl in a skimpy sun dress or a halter topwell so did shimizus no woman back in japan would have let herself be seen dressedor undressedlike that a japanese captain stepped out from a side street salute shimizu exclaimed and smartly brought up his own right arm if anyone saluted poorly or in a sloppy way the officer could land the whole squad in trouble if shimizu hadnt seen him and the men marched past without saluting he didnt care to think about what would have happened then aside from the beating he and his men would have got his company commander probably would have busted him back to private how could he have lived with the disgrace well it hadnt happened the captain saw the salutes he must have found them acceptable for he went on about his business without ordering shimizus men to halt keep your eyes open shimizu warned later well be going through hotel street there will be plenty of officers there outside the bars and the fancy brothels a lot of them wont care that theyre on leave if you dont spot them if you dont salute theyll make you sorry wakarimasuka hai the soldiers chorused it was a rhetorical question by now theyd had plenty of time to learn to understand the vagaries the vanity and the touchy tempers of the officers under whom they served and since those officers had essentially absolute power over them mere understanding wasnt enough they had to placate and propitiate those officers like any other angry gods they got their own back by coming down hard on the people over whom they ruled furusawa pointed to a haole man in his twenties he didnt bow corporal no eh shimizu said well hell be sorry he raised his voice to a shout you he also pointed at the white man the fellow froze he looked as if he wanted to bolt but he feared the japanese would do something dreadful to him if he tried he was absolutely right about that he also realized what he hadnt done he did bow now and spoke with desperate urgencyin english since he knew no japanese that wouldnt save him shimizu tramped up to him and barked your papers he spoke in japanese of course it was the only language he knew his tone and his outthrust hand got his meaning across the local man pulled out his wallet and showed shimizu his drivers license it had his photograph on it shimizu gave him a stony glare even so the white man reached into the wallet and pulled out a tendollar bill shimizu made it disappear fast as lightningit was more than the army paid him in two months despite the bribe he slapped the man in the face the way he might have slapped one of his own soldiers whod done something stupid the white man gasped in surprise and pain but after that he took it as well as a soldier might have satisfied shimizu nodded coldly and went back to his men come on he told them get moving down the street they went he looked back over his shoulder once the white man was staring after them eyes enormous in a cloudpale face hotel street was as raucous and lascivious a place as ever shimizu wished he were visiting it on leave and not on patrol music blared from the open doorways of half a dozen dives some of it was japanese the rest the syrupysweet tunes of the west shimizu had heard that americans found japanese music peculiar he knew he thought western music was strange harriedlooking military policemen tried to keep some kind of order drunk soldiers and sailors wanted no part of it every so often the military policemen knocked a couple of heads together even that accomplished less than it would have anywhere else the americans are foolish to attack our ships senior private furusawa said if they dropped bombs on hotel street they could wipe out all our forces everybody in shimizus squad laughed for it was funny but the laughter quickly stopped for it also held too much truth here you a military policeman pointed at shimizu come take charge of this man he shook a sozzled sailor who giggled foolishly so sorry sergeantsan but were on patrol and we still have a lot of ground to cover please excuse me shimizu said because he and his men were on duty of their own the military policeman had no choice but to nod shimizu didnt smile till the fellow couldnt see him any more saying nobeing able to say noto one of the hated military police felt wonderful forward he called and the patrol went on oscar van der kirk and charlie kaapu sat in a waikiki saloon drinking what the bartender alleged to be primo beer hawaiis native suds had never been a brew to make anybody forget fancy german beeror for that matter even schlitz this stuff tasted more like bathwater after the university of hawaii football team got clean in it charlie had a different opinion so he asked the man behind the bar how sick was the horse when he pissed in your bottles funny the barkeep said funny like a crutch you try getting fucking barley these days for beer brewed from rice this aint half bad beer brewed from rice is sake isnt it oscar said sort of i have some of that in case any japanese officers wander in the bartender said by the way he said japanese officers he meant japs but he wouldnt say that not around people he didnt completely trust oscar knew he and charlie werent informers but the barkeep didnt fiddling with his black bow tie he went on there are some real hops in this though its doing its best to be beer honest thats not very good charlie said and then incongruously give me another one will you me too oscar said as he emptied his glass primos closer to real beer than what they call gin or okolehao is to the real mccoy these days you got that right brother charlie kaapu made a horrible face yeah well you dont want to know some of the shit that goes into them the bartender set up two more beers four bits he said oscar slid a halfdollar across the bar the bartender scooped it up oscar raised his glass mud in your eye he said to charlie same to you the halfhawaiian surf rider replied they both drank they both sighed this primo wasnt good even if it wasnt so bad as it might have been charlie sighed again we ought to do something different he said like what oscar asked just getting along is hard enough thats the point charlie said thats why we ought to do something different back when oscar was at stanford his philosophy prof would have called that a non sequitur somehow he didnt think charlie would appreciate philosophy what have you got in mind he asked we ought to go back to the north shore charlie said we havent been up there in a hell of a long time oscar stared at him are you out of your goddamn mind he exclaimed the last time we did go up there we damn near got killed just thinking about it brought back gutwrenching bladdersqueezing raw terror yeah i know his hapahawaiian buddy looked vaguely embarrassed maybe he was remembering fear too but he went on thats another reason to go back its like when you fall off a horseyou get back on again right i guess oscar was vague about horses his fathers construction business had been completely motorized by the time he was born dad went on about a competitor whod thought trucks were only a passing fad and stuck with horsedrawn wagons hed gone broke in short order sure you do if charlie kaapu had any doubts he hid them very well besides the surf down here is rotten i want something i can get my teeth into get your face into you mean if you mess up oscar said charlie gave him the finger they both laughed oscar took another sip of moreorless primo besides were not just surfriders you know were fishermen too charlie grimaced waste time he muttered a handy phrase that could apply to anything you didnt like he too took a pull at his miserable excuse for a beer nobody shooting at us up there nowadays you hope oscar said god only knows what the japanese are doing up there these days though he didnt say japs in front of the barkeep either hey come on dont you want to get away from all this for a while or are you married to that gal of yours charlie laced his voice with scorn it struck home too oscars ears heated you know im not he said he and susie were getting along pretty well which was nice but it wasnt married he jabbed a forefinger in charlies direction if we go up to the north shore how are we gonna get there even if we could find gas my chevys got a dead battery and four flats hell it probably doesnt even have flats any more the way the japanesealmost slipped thereare stripping the rubber off cars these days charlie clucked reproachfully and here i thought you were such a big smart haole what do you mean you were the guy who thought up sailboards charlie said we can go on them catch fishhe evidently didnt mind when he was doing it for himselfsleep on the beach have a hell of a time no huhu he made it sound so easyprobably a lot easier than it really would be and he tempted oscar and oscar knew damn well he was tempted he gave back the strongest argument against the trip he could think of what do you want to bet the surf will stink bet it wont charlie retorted its october by now man you can get some good sets up there he wasnt wrong the waves hadnt been that high last december which had disappointed oscar and charlie but no doubt relieved the japanese invaders oscar wouldnt have wanted to try to get a landing craft over thirtyfoot breakers and no doubt the japs hadnt wanted to either storms could start up in the gulf of alaska this early and waves from those storms had a straight shot over the pacific all the way down to waimea bay charlie kaapu gave him a slightly sloshed grin come on oscar dont be a grouch we pull this off we talk about it forever you want to be a fisherman all the goddamn time go ride a sampan if you do maybe oscar would have said no if he hadnt had some beer himself but he had and he didnt like coming back to waikiki every day any better than charlie did ill do it he said lets leave tomorrow now youre talking now youre cooking with gas charlies grin got wider and more gleeful cant change our minds if we go right away oscar wasnt so sure he would have to tell susie when he did she was liable to change his mind for him charlie didnt begin to get that oscar didnt think charlie had ever stayed with a girl more than a couple of weeks charlie no more understood settling down than a butterfly understood staying with one flower all the time that wasnt in a butterflys makeup and it wasnt in charlie kaapus either how much of it was in susies nature there was an interesting question oscar told her that evening over steaks shed cut from a tuna hed caught and tomatoes hed acquired for another smaller fish he stumbled and stammered more than he wanted to she looked at him for a while just looked at him with those eyes that always reminded him of a siamese cats the mind behind the eyes was often as selfcentered as a cats too but all she saidall she said at first anywaywas have fun he let out an elated sigh of relief thanks babe he breathed have fun susie repeated and if im still here when you get back well pick it up again and if im notwell this was fun too mostly anyhow and if that wasnt praising with faint damn oscar had never run into anything that so perfectly fit the bill he wondered if he ought to tell her to stay shed laugh at him she was no damn good at doing what anybody told her to he also wondered if he should can the whole thing with charlie the trouble with that was he didnt want to and if he did can it susie would get the idea she could run roughshod over him whatever else that would be it wouldnt be fun i hope youre still around he said after that calculation all of which took maybe a second and a half he wondered if he ought to add anything and decided not to it said what needed saying susie cocked her head to one side i kind of hope i am too she said but you never can tell she didnt yell i look out for number one first last and always but she might as well have it wasnt anything oscar didnt know drop susie anywhere and shed land on her feet that was one more way she was like a cat she did the dishes as well as she could with cold water and without soap neither she nor oscar had come down with anything noxious so it was good enough he dried hed become domesticated enough for that as she handed him the last plate she asked you want one for the road sure he said eagerly and she laughedshed known he would they always got on well in bed this time seemed special even for them only afterwards while he wished for a cigarette did oscar figure out why this was or might have been the last time susie leaned over in the narrow bed and kissed him trying to make me want to stick around are you she said so he didnt have to worry about was it good for you too tonight not that he was going to worry about much right then anyhow he rolled over and fell asleep when he got up the next morning she was already out the door heading for her secretarial job in honolulu no goodbye kiss then and no early morning quickie either but a notegood luck xoxoxomade him hope shed still be here when he came back from the north shore breakfast was cold rice with a little sugar sprinkled on it it wasnt corn flakesand it sure as hell wasnt bacon and eggsbut it would have to do hed just finished when charlie kaapu banged on his door ready the hapahawaiian demanded yeah oscar said they grinned at each other then hurried down to waikiki beach as usual since the occupation surf fishermen were already casting their bait upon the waters they moved aside to give charlie and oscar room enough to get their sailboards into the pacific for a wonder they also stopped casting till the two boards were out of range how many times have you just missed getting hooked by the ear when you went out oscar asked missed this big haole reeled me in once bastard was all set to gut me for a marlin till he saw my beak wasnt big enough charlie kaapu said oscar snorted waste time fool they both laughed once they got out past the breakers they set their sails oscar was used to sailing out a lot farther than that to get to a stretch of the pacific that hadnt been fished to death instead of running with the wind today he swung the sail at a fortyfive degree angle to the wind and skimmed along parallel to the southern coast of oahu charlies sailboard glided beside his you want to talk about waste time talk about fishing charlie said since when dont you like to eat oscar said eating is fine fishing is work would be worse if i didnt get to surfride there and back again that qualifier was as far as charlie would go oscar knew the native hawaiians had fished with nets and spears if that hadnt taken the patience of job he didnt know what would but charlie like too many hawaiians and hapahawaiians these days was willing to work only on what he enjoyed and was convinced haoles would run rings around him everywhere else they sailed past diamond head these days an enormous rising sun floated from the dead volcano so much for the kingdom of hawaii oscar thought he didnt say anything about that charlie kaapu had no use at all for king stanley laanui though he thought the redheaded queen cynthia was a knockout from the pictures oscar had seen of her he did too the empty road struck oscar like a blow there was still traffic in honolulu even if it was foot traffic instead of automobiles here there was justnobody no tourists heading up to see the mormon temple near laie no japanese dentist off to visit his mom and dad at the little general store they ran no nothing not hardly charlie saw the same thing whole island seems dead he said and spat into the pacific yeah oscar nodded the otherworldly pace at which things happened when you were under sail only added to the impression the landscape changed only very slowly the emptiness didnt seem to change at all and then it did oscar and charlie passed a long column of japanese troops marching east they passed them slowly too for the japs marched almost as fast as they sailed a couple of japs pointed out to sea as the sailboards went by oscar said im almost even glad to see those guys you know what i mean i know what you mean charlie said i aint glad to see them any which way were lucky the bastards arent shooting at us oscars head whipped back toward the coast if he saw japs dropping to one knee or even raising their rifles he was going to jump in the water theyd been known to kill people for the fun of it but the soldiers in the funnycolored khaki uniforms just kept trudging along after another moment oscar figured out what made the japanese uniforms seem funny they were of a shade different from the us army khaki he was used to that was all slowlybut not slowly enough after charlies commentthe soldiers fell astern of the sailboards we dont want to go ashore where they can catch up with us charlie said and oscar nodded once more when they rounded makapu point oscar saw that the lighthouse there had been bombed that pained him the light had been welcoming and warning ships for a long time to see it ruined was another sign of how things had changed oahu itself changed on the windward coast oscar and charlie got spatters of rain almost at once and then more than spatters it rained all the time here the air felt thick and hot and wet the way it did back east on the mainland the sea began heaving erratically like a restless beast everything he could see on the shore was lush and green the koolau range rose steeply from the sea the volcanic rocks would have been jagged but jungle softened their outlines they might almost have been covered in emerald velvet remembering a paleontology class he pointed to the mountains and said they look like giant teeth from an iguanodon charlie kaapu looked not at the koolau range but at him what the hell you talkin bout he asked oscar decided the world could live without his similes he quickly rediscovered why they called this the windward coast the wind kept trying to blow him and charlie ashore long stretches of the coastline were rocky not sandy he had to keep fighting to claw his way out to sea kaneohe peninsula was the last obstacle he and charlie got by before putting in for the evening they barely got by it too if they had to put in there they could have at least as far as the beach went but what had been a marine base was manned these days by japanese soldiers oscar had no desire to get to know them better wrecked american flying boats still lay along the beach like so many unburied bodies none of them had engines on their wings various other bits were missing from this machine or that one as the japs had all over hawaii theyd taken whatever they could use light was fading when charlie pointed to a small stretch of sand beyond kaneohe oscar nodded they both guided their sailboards up onto the beach whew oscar said sprawling on the sand im whipped hard work charlie agreed the phrase translated literally from the japanese had become part of the local language dont have much in the way of fish either before hed grumbled about the indignities of fishing oscar saw no point in reminding him of that he just said we wont starve he checked his match safe matches are still dry we can make a fire and cook what weve got they gathered driftwood for fuel the rain had stopped which made things easier charlie kaapu walked along the edge of the beach every so often he would bend down he came back with some clams here he said we do these too the clams werent very bigonly a bite or so apiecebut anything was better than nothing after that oscar and charlie lay down on the sand that would have been comfortable enough if it hadnt rained several times whenever it did it woke oscar up he thought about taking shelter but there was no shelter to take the night seemed endless some fun charlie kaapu said as they put their sailboards back into the water oscar couldnt help rising to that whose idea was this he inquired sweetly charlie sent him a dirty look they spent all day beating their way northwest along the beautiful but often forbidding coast but they didnt worry about food for long charlie caught a big ahi less than an hour after they raised their sails how hungry are you he asked oscar what do you mean want some raw the way the japs eat it sure why not ive done that a few times carefully because the water was still rough oscar guided his sailboard alongside charlies the hapahawaiian passed him a goodsized chunk of pink flesh he haggled bitesized pieces off with a knife they werent neat and elegant the way they would have been in a fancy japanese restaurant he didnt care the flesh was firm and rich and hardly fishy at all might almost be beef he remarked its okay but it aint that good charlie said the hawaiian side of his family would never have seen a cow till whites brought them to the islands some time in the nineteenth century charlie no doubt didnt worry about that one bit he just knew what he liked locally born japanese often preferred hamburgers and steaks to raw fish too nowadays a lot of them were probably pretending to a love of sushi and sashimi they didnt really have because the surfers had to tack so much they made slow progress they needed two and a half days to round kahuku point near opana oahus northernmost projection oscar whooped when they finally did all downhill from here he said and so it was as far as the wind went but getting back to the shore to sleep that night was an adventure all by itself big waves pounded the beaches oscar and charlie took down their masts and sails before surfriding in oscar would have liked to go in with the sail up but if something went wrong it would have cost him his rigging in surf like that he would have been stuck with no way to get back to waikiki but lugging his surfboard down the kamehameha highwaya distinctly unappetizing prospect charlie kaapu did the same thing so oscar didnt feel too bad charlie was more reckless than he was they ate fish and clams on the beach charliereckless againpried some sea urchins off the nearby rocks too he cracked them with a stone to get at the orange flesh inside japs eat this stuff he said oscar never had but he was hungry enough not to be fussy the meat proved better than he expected it wasnt like anything hed tasted before the iodine tang reminded him of the sea what we ought to do is see if we can get some of those plovershe pointed to the shorebirds walking along the beachand cook them i wish they were doves instead charlie said doves are too dumb for anybody to miss em the plovers werent they flew off before oscar and charlie could get close enough to throw rocks at them oh well oscar said worth a try he and charlie got to waimea bay the next day again they took down their rigging before going ashore the first time oscar looked back over his shoulder as he rode toward the beach no jap invasion fleet this time no americans with machine guns in the jungle back of the beach either once up on the golden sand they left their masts and sails there as they went back into the pacific they solemnly shook hands made it charlie said oscar nodded and then they paddled out again the waves werent the threestorybuilding monsters they were when the north shore was at its finest they were oneandahalf or twostory monsterssuitable for all ordinary purposes and quite a few extraordinary ones skimming along at the curl of the wave or under the curl in a roaring tube of green and white was as much fun as you could have out of bed and not so far removed in its growing excitement and intensity from the fun you had in bed this is why were here charlie said after one amazing run oscar didnt know whether he meant this was why theyd come to the north shore or why theyd been born either way he wasnt inclined to quarrel part of the excitement was knowing what happened when things went wrong oscar was catfooted on his surfboardbut even cats slip once in a while then they try to pretend they havent done it oscar didnt have that chance he went one way the surf board went another and the wave rolled over him he had time for one startled yip before he had to fight to keep from drowning it was like getting stuck in gods cement mixer for a few seconds he literally didnt know which end was up he got slammed into the seabottom hard enough to scrape hide off his flank it could have been his face hed done that before too the roaring and churning dinned in his earsdinned all through him he struggled toward the surface the ocean didnt want to let him up his lungs hadnt quite reached the bursting point when he managed to grab a breath but they werent far away either then another mountain of water fell on him no halfdrowned pup was ever more draggled than he was when he staggered up onto blessedly dry land charlie kaapu was trotting down the beach to capture his truant surfboard some wipeout buddy charlie called you crashed and burned tell me about it oscar said feelingly he looked down at himself man im chewed up wanna quit charlie asked oscar shook his head you nuts this is part of what we came for too thanks for snagging my board any time charlie said not like you havent done it for me not like maybe you wont very next wave he came up and slapped oscar on the back being careful to pick an unabraded spot youre okay ace youre a numberone surfrider waste time oscar said trying to disguise how proud he was lets go the pacific stung his hide when he went out again as if to remind him what it could do he didnt care he was doing what he wanted to docharlie was right about that they rode the waves till they got too hungry to stand it then went into waimea the little siamin place where theyd eaten on december was still open the local jap who ran it spoke no more english than he had then the soup had changed a bit the noodles were rice noodles now and the siamin was loaded with fish instead of pork it was still hot and filling and cheap and good once theyd eaten they went back out to the ocean they rode the surf till sundown then went back for more siamin three days passed like that then not without regret oscar said i better head back he waited for charlie to tell him how pussywhipped he was but his friend just pointed west and said lets sail all the way around we can ride the surf other places too deal oscar said gratefully not only was it a dealit sounded like fun and he hadnt looked forward to beating his way back along the windward coast anyhow kaena point in the far west had been the only part of oahu where roads didnt reach though the islands narrowgauge railroad did round the point as oscar and charlie sailboarded by they watched pows slowly and laboriously building a highway there poor bastards charlie said oscar nodded they were doing it all with hand tools that had to be killing labor oscar wasnt sorry to leave the prisoners behind they reminded him how bad things really were in hawaii these days being able to catch his own food being out on the ocean so much had shielded him from the worst of it so had having a girlfriend at least as selfreliant as he was he and charlie had made it down the coast almost as far as waianae when they got another reminder of the warthis one to oscars surprise by sea instead of by land a convoy of several nondescript even ugly marus shepherded along by two destroyers chugged past them well out in the pacific plainly bound for honolulu those dumpy freighters might have been carrying anything rice ammunition spare parts gasoline for all oscar knew they might have been crowded with soldiers they were too far away for him to tell he watched them for a while so did charlie neither said anything what could you say those ships showed how times had changed and then times changed again one of the freighters blew upa deep flat crump that carried across the water a great cloud of black smoke sprang up from the stricken maru perhaps half a minute later another ship got hit smoke also rose from that one though not so much did you see that holy jesus theres a sub out therethere must be eeeyow oscar and charlie were both making excited noises so fast oscar didnt know which of them was saying what the japanese destroyers went nuts they had been sheep dogs now they were wolves on the prowl for a snake inor rather underthe grass they darted this way and that one of them fired a gunat nothing that oscar could see both torpedoed freighters settled in the water one quickly the other more sedately planes with meatballs on the wings and fuselage buzzed off oahu and around the convoy also searching for the american submarine they had no better luck than the warships did that freighters still burning oscar said after a while oil or gas charlie said oil i betgas and it would really have gone skyhigh thats no skin off my nose the japs wouldve kept it all themselves anyway yeah oscar said nice to see the united states hasnt given up i mean we know that but its nice to see charlie nodded i want to see em blow king stanleyhe laced the title with contemptout of one of his own guns serve him right a zero buzzed low over the two of them the pilot could have shot them up if he wanted to either because he thought they had something to do with the torpedoed freighters or simply for the hell of it but he didnt he just kept going oscar breathed a sigh of relief he and charlie kept going too though much more slowly on toward honolulu platoon sergeant lester dillon looked around with a distinctly jaundiced eye well here i am at this goddamn camp pendleton place and i didnt make gunny to get here he said dutch wenzel nodded gloomily me too and i got the same beef you know what happened les we got screwed and we didnt even get kissed damn straight we didnt dillon said course the whole navy got screwed wasnt just us a second look around the enormous new marine base did little to improve it in his eyes camp elliott had been crowded as a sack full of cats no doubt about it but camp elliott had been right down in san diego not far from the ballpark not far from the movie theaters not far from the ginmills not far from the whorehouses once you got off the base you could have yourself a good time what are we going to do for fun around here les asked mournfully beats me dutch said got a butt on you im out of white owls sure dillon handed him the pack then stuck a camel in his own mouth tobacco smoke soothed but not enough the powers that be had carved camp pendleton out of the northwesternmost part of san diego county another name for what theyd carved it out of was the middle of nowhere san clemente lay a little way up the coast oceanside a little way down the coast neither could have held more than a couple of thousand people both were towns where they rolled up the sidewalks at six o clock after blowing a sorrowful smoke ring dillon asked how many divisions of marines they gonna put in here who you think i am fdr dutch said they dont tell me shit like that any moren they tell you having established his lack of credentials he got down to seriously guessing sure looks like its big enough for three easy dont it les nodded about what i was thinking he tried to imagine somewhere between forty and fifty thousand horny young men with greenbacks burning a hole in their pocket descending on san clemente and oceanside the picture refused to form there was a limerick about a little green lizard that bust that was what would happen to those quiet seaside towns he laughed not that the locals would think it was funny the japs invaded hawaii and now weve invaded california heh wenzel said well if the guys who grow flowers and the little old ladies with the blue hair dont like us tough beans let em go clean out those slantyeyed bastards by themselves a flying boat sailed past out over the pacific les dillon took a long look to make sure it was an american flying boat the japs had paid the west coast a few unwelcome calls but he recognized the silhouette nothing to get excited about this time this whole campaign is a bastard he said grinding out his cigarette under the heel of his boot how come just cause weve gotta go a couple thousand miles before we can get hold of hirohitos finest dutch said good start les agreed but even getting there isnt enough weve got to find some kind of way to beat down their air power otherwise were screwed again we cant even land if we dontor i wouldnt want to try it if theyve got planes and we dont fuck neither would i wenzel agreed thatd be a mess wouldnt it theyd make waddayacallitsukiyakiout of us yeah dillon watched a car roll south down pacific coast highway idly he wondered who had the clout to get gasoline the highway was pretty quiet these days he looked past it to the beach and the ocean how many times you figure were gonna invade this goddamn place till we get it right his buddy answered which drew a grunt and a laugh and a nod from dillon wenzel added thing is when we do it for real we only get the one chance that wasnt strictly true if a us landing on oahu failed the americans could always lick their wounds and try again the country could yeah but the marines who got ashore in that failed effort would never try anything again afterwards les didnt want to think such gloomy thoughts to keep from thinking them he said lets go over to the ncos club and have a beer twist my arm dutch wenzel held it out les gave it a yank dutch writhed in wrestlingring agony son of a bitchyou talked me into it all the buildings here had the sharpedged look of brand new construction most of them still had the fresh almost foresty smell of wood newly exposed to the air too not the ncos club not any more it smelled the way it was supposed to of beer and whiskey and sweat and mostly of tobacco cigarette smoke predominated but pipes and cigars had their places too the blue haze in the air was also comforting and infinitely familiar noncoms sat at the bar and at tables and talked about the things that had been on noncoms minds since the days of julius caesar if not since those of sennacherib how their families were doing where they were going next and how tough it was likely to be what idiots the brass were those last two not entirely unrelated and how new recruits were obviously the missing link between apes and men that darwin had sought in vain a gunny whose fruit salad went all the way back to the blue yellow and green ribbon commemorating the mexican campaign and the occupation of veracruz was expatiating on the latter topic sweet jesus christ boots nowadays dont know enough to grab their ass with both hands he said gesturing with a highball glass in which ice cubes clinked i swear to god the army wouldnt want some of these pissweeds and were supposed to turn em into marines he didnt bother keeping his voice low heads bobbed up and down all over the club les among them nobody except another gunnery sergeant of equally exalted status could have presumed to disagree with him dillon who came close both in rank and in years wouldnt have thought of it for a moment as far as he was concerned the gunny was only speaking gospel truth but another veteran noncom said gonna need to put a lot of marines on the beach if were gonna do the job up to us to make these damnfool boots into the kind of marines they need to be some of them wont make the grade though said the gunny whod been around since dirt some of them cant make the grade well run them off there wont be that many the other man said the restll do the job even as is were gonna have the damn army landing right behind us or maybe even with us everyone bristled at that though it was too likely to be true from what les had heard the japs had four or five divisions in hawaii defenders needed fewer men than invaders hed seen that for himself when he bumped up against the krauts in the great war there just wouldnt be enough marines to go around so much for germany first he said yeah well i dont care what fdr saysi think the japs screwed that one the first time they bombed san francisco les was inclined to agree with him by the nods and the grim silence that followed so was everybody else in the ncos club no matter what the president might want it was personal now between the usa and japan hitting hawaii was one thing and bad enough but killing people on the mainlandno overseas enemy had done that since the war of everybody was hot and bothered about it not even a president as powerful as franklin delano roosevelt could afford to ignore americans screaming their heads off if those navy pukes can just get us to hawaii this time well do the rest of the job les said put us on the beach and well take it from there nobody argued with him either sailboard under his arm oscar van der kirk let himself back into his own apartment he didnt yell honey im home it was half past three in the afternoon susie would be at her secretarial job the only question was whether she still lived here oscar looked in the closet her clothes still hung there he nodded to himselfthat was good but then he realized it wasnt the only question after all when she came back would she bring anybody with her she wouldnt know he was here that could prove interesting hell with it oscar said if hed been the sort to borrow trouble he wouldnt have spent most of his time since graduating from college as a beach bum whatever happened would happen and hed figure out what to do about it when it did if it did instead of borrowing trouble he hopped in the shower he had more salt on him than an order of cheap french fries he couldnt recall the last time hed had an order of fries cheap or not they were growing potatoeshe knew that salt was not a problemone of the few things that werent but he didnt want to think about what they might use for grease these days the water was cold he didnt care hed got used to that it just meant he didnt dawdle the way he would have back when things were easy he hopped in sluiced himself off and got out putting on clothes he hadnt worn too often lately felt good too he sat back on the edge of the bed to wait for susie he didnt remember going from sitting to lying he didnt hear her key in the lock next thing he knew she was shaking him hey she said look what the cat dragged in so you made it back did you yeah he yawned then gave her a kiss her lips were red and tasted of lipstick somehow she kept getting her hands on the stuff did you and charlie have a good time she sounded amused she might have been a mother talking to an eightyearold boy oscar nodded anyway after another yawnhe hadnt realized how tired he washe said yeah again this time he added the best part was off the west coast on the way back we got to watch an american sub blow two jap freighters to hell and gone susies eyes lit up that is good she said it didnt make the papers herewhy am i not surprised she wrinkled her nose and looked like a kida happy kid hasnt even made the rumor mill yet she went on and thats a little more surprising how have you been oscar asked its damn good to see you again im okay she answered i missed you she wrinkled her nose again in a subtly different way this time as if annoyed at herself i missed you more than i thought i wouldand what kind of jerk am i for telling you something like that i missed you too oscar admitted must be love he said the word lightly he didnt want to leave himself open for one of the snippy comebacks she was so good at lightly or not it was the first time either one of them had said that word susie looked yeah she said softly must be she leaned toward him this time the kiss went on and on some time a good deal later oscar remarked this is how we said goodbye and now its how we say hello good thing it doesnt get boring susie poked him in the ribs it better not buster and not too long after that he showed her it hadnt even though hawaii was nominally an independent kingdom once more general tomoyuki yamashita hadnt given up his office in iolani palace if king stanley laanui didnt care for thatwell too bad that was yamashitas attitude anyhow the commanding general could not only outface the king of hawaii he could also summon a mere navy commander like minoru genda whenever he pleased both the hawaiian palace guards and their japanese opposite numbers came to attention and saluted as genda went up the front stairs and into the palace he outranked them anyhow general yamashita was working in the gold room in the second floor not even he had had the crust to keep for himself either the library or the royal bedchambers once king stanley and queen cynthia got settled into the palace the gold room which looked over the front entrance had been the palace music room whatever instruments had been in there were long gone replaced by utilitarian office furniture that seemed dreadfully out of place in such a splendid setting yamashitas scowl seemed out of place in that sunny room too as soon as genda came in the general growled those stinking yankee submarines are starting to pinch us this time they cost us oil and rice and what is the navy doing about them not a stinking thing not that i can see we are doing everything we can sir genda replied we are doing everything we know how to do if hunting submarines were easy they wouldnt be such dangerous weapons that only made yamashita more unhappy still how are we supposed to defend those islands if we cant supply them he exclaimed sir the americans arent doing exactly what we expected them to genda didnt sound happy either we looked for them to go after our principal warships instead as you say theyre trying to hurt us economically the way the germans are trying to strangle england yamashita had dark heavy eyebrows that gave him a fearsome frown all right thats what theyre trying how in blazes do you stop them i have some good news sir replied genda whod saved it as a miser saved gold oh whats that general yamashita sounded deeply skeptical one of our hks on patrol northeast of the islands spotted a us submarine cruising on the surface the seaplane attacked with bombs and cannon and sank it no possible doubt the pilot reports yamashita grunted all right theres one he admitted even one is good newsi wont try to tell you any different but how many submarines have the americans got in these waters how many more are they building and how many have we sunk minoru genda needed a distinct effort of will to hold his face steady those were all very good questions he didnt have precise answers for any of them he knew what the approximate answers were though too many too many and not enough respectively we are doing everything we can sir he repeated before long well have some of that fancy electronic rangefinding gear in the hks that should help our searches while the enemy is on the surface maybe yamashita said what about when hes submerged how will you find him then thats when he does his damage neh hai genda said but subs are slow while submerged and have only limited range on their batteries they do most of their traveling surfaced if the americans come back here how do we beat them back with no fuel for tanks or airplanes yamashita demanded by the emperor how do we beat them back with no fuel for ships answer me that sir we are making our best effort genda said the only thing he could if we had not made our best effort here we would be fighting the war now in the western pacific not between hawaii and the american mainland all that got him was another grunt from the general i suppose the army had nothing to do with the conquest of hawaii yamashita said with heavy sarcasm the way genda remembered things the army hadnt wanted much to do with hawaii the army was worried about russia and about keeping as many men as it could in the endless china adventure admiral yamamoto had had to threaten to resign before the stubborn generals would change their minds the benefits of their change of mind were obviousnow and now of course they found new things to complain about genda knew only too well that he couldnt explain that to general yamashita the other man not only outranked him but belonged to the service he would be maligning what he did say once more was sir we are doing everything we can do everything we know how to do if you can suggest other things we should be doing we will be grateful to you that made yamashita no happier zakennayo he burst out youre supposed to know what to do about submarines if you ask me about tanks or artillery i can give you a sensible answer all i want to know is why are you having a harder time now than you were against the american aircraft carriers aircraft carriers are easier to find than submarines sir genda answered and once we find them we sink them were better than the americans are arent we better with submarines too yamashita asked pointedly with them probably genda replied though he wasnt altogether sure of that at detecting them at hunting them please excuse me sir but there the answer is less clear the americans have had more combat experience in those areas than we have both in the last war and in this one faugh yamashita saidmore a disgusted noise than a word were getting the experience all rightgetting it the hard way all i have to tell you commander is that wed better put it to good use yes sir recognizing dismissal when he heard it genda got to his feet and saluted yamashita sent him out of the gold room with an impatient wave with more than a little relief genda left yamashita hadnt really called him in to confer hed called him in to rake him over the coals and from the army commandants point of view he had every right to do so the navy was supposed to protect the supply line between hawaii and the rest of the empire of japan if it didnt if it couldntthen we have a problem a serious problem here genda thought unhappily he was heading for the koawood stairs to make his escape when someone said commander genda isnt itin english he stopped and bowed yes your majesty he answered in the same language why are you here today queen cynthia laanui asked military matters your majesty genda said which was true but uninformative the redheaded queen knew as much too she gave him an exasperated sniff thank you so much she said her sarcasm more flaying than yamashitas because it came from a prettier face in a softer voice let me put it another way commanderwhats gone wrong this time you never come to the palace when things are going well do you i should not discuss this genda said why not now the queens eyes flashed dangerously why shouldnt i know whats going on isnt hawaii allied to japan if anybody ought to be kept informed dont you think my husband and i should you genda stopped he couldnt just come out and say youre an american she was of course a fine healthy specimen of an american too but if she was playing the role of queen of hawaii to the hilt i am the queen i could order you sent to the dungeons that dangerous flash again then half a second later cynthia laanuis eyes flashed again in an altogether different way it happened so fast genda wasnt sure the two flashes werent really onewasnt sure in fact that he hadnt imagined both of them except he hadnt she repeated i could order you sent to the dungeons her nose wrinkled and her laugh rang sweet as frangipani i couldexcept we havent got any dungeons and nobody would follow the order if i was dumb enough to give it details details she laughed again on a slightly wrier note genda laughed too and surprised himself when he did it he bowed your majesty he said and meant it more than he ever had before with either of the hawaiian puppet monarchs he surprised himself again by telling her about the freighters that had gone down in the channel between kauai and oahu oh that queen cynthia said and he could not doubt she already knew about it as if to confirm as much she went on that storys all over honoluluprobably all over oahuby now you couldnt keep it a secret if you tried not when people on the island could see the smoke she leaned forward a little not to be provocativeshe was provocative enough just standing therebut as a friend would in conversation with another friend or is the secret part that it bothers you more than you want to let on hai genda said before he realized he should have answered thats none of your business thenrealization piled on realizationhe saw that wouldnt have helped either only an immediate convincing denial would have done him any good and he couldnt give her one is it so very bad she asked quietly he shook his head he wanted to shake himself like a dog shaking off cold water no not so very bad he answered and searched for wordsnot because his english was bad but because he wanted to be most precise things are not quite so good as we would like your majesty this is hontoit is true but we fight a war things in a war go exactly how we want almost never do you see oh yes im not a child commander genda bowed once more not trusting himself to speak cynthia laanui might be a great many things but a child she definitely was not the flowered sun dress she wore left no possible doubt of that just as he straightened her nose wrinkled in amusement again only after that did her face politely go almost expressionless she knows what im thinking that alarmed genda who did not want his japanese colleagueslet alone a gaijin womanable to read him like that he occasionally visited officers brothels on and near hotel street like most of his countrymen he was much more matteroffact about that than americans were what else was he supposed to do here so far from home but lying down with a whore was one thing lying down with a woman who might be interested in you for your own sakethat was something else again and what would lying down with a queen be like foolishness moonshine he thought queen cynthia laanui hadnt been much more than polite if she was a friendly person that didnt mean she wanted to do anything but make conversation with him did it she said thanks for leveling with me she paused for a moment to make sure he understood then went on do please let me know whats going on from here on out things will work out better for everybody if you do do you think so genda couldnt have sounded more glum more dubious if hed tried for a week queen cynthia laughed once more which only made his question seem gloomier than it had im not mata hari commander she said im not going to seduce your secrets out of you she cocked her head to one side or should i how am i supposed to answer that genda wondered frantically he bowed again that was safe it was polite almost reflexively so for him and it bought him time to think having bought it he knew he had better use it wisely whatever your majesty wishes of course he murmured this time cynthia laanui threw back her head and chortled well commander that proves one thing for sure she said and her voice suddenly held no mirth at all youve never been a queen or a king either no your majesty i never have he said and fled iolani palace faster than the american fleet had fled before the triumphant japanese earlier in the year kenzo and hiroshi takahashi took the oshima maru out of kewalo basin by themselves their father had another radio talk scheduled his words would go back to japan and all over the world kenzo wished more than anything else in the world that he would just keep quiet whatever kenzo wished he wasnt going to get it dad likes being a celebrity he said bitterly he was at the rudder hiroshi trimming the sails they would trade off later by now dealing with the sampans rigging and the way she went under sail was second nature to both of them though neither had known anything about handling a sailboat before oahu ran out of diesel fuel even for fishermen baptism by total immersion kenzo thought not an idea that would have occurred to him had his father stayed in yamaguchi prefecture instead of coming to hawaii his brother only shrugged dads made his choices weve made ours right this minute i have to say his look better another measure of the choices he and kenzo had made was that they both used english some men even of their fathers generation had become fluent in it but jiro takahashi remained at home only in japanese in english he understood yes and no and thank you and most obscenities except for throwing in an occasional oh jesus christ and the like he didnt speak any though were getting away kenzo said only thing is i wish to god we didnt have to come back again hiroshi chuckled cant very well sail to san francisco from here i know kenzo sounded as mournful as he felt ive thought about it we might be able to catch enough fish to keep us goingwe probably could but she wouldnt carry enough water to get us there now hiroshi stared at him you have thought about it i said so didnt i kenzo looked back over his shoulder the faster oahu receded behind him the better he liked it i even went to the library to dope out which way the winds blow between here and there but ill tell you what really put the kibosh on things for me yeah his brother said yeah kenzo nodded you know what theyre doing with the japanese on the mainland right theyre throwing em into camps how imperial japanese propaganda here in hawaii thundered about that at first kenzo had thought it was a lie by now he was only too sure it was true the us navy would probably sink us the minute they spotted uswere japs right the japanese dont want japs who think theyre americans and neither do the americans a fairy tern white as snow with big black eyes glided along with the oshima maru after a while the bird perched at the top of the mast damn hitchhiker hiroshi said yeah kenzo left it there hiroshi hadnt tried to tell him he was crazy or to say the navy would treat them fine if it found them sailing northeast kenzo wished his brother would have in that case he might have been wrong the way things were he knew damn well he was right land slowly slid under the horizon when you traveled under sail nothing happened in a hurry but for the slap of waves against the hull and the sound of the wind in the sails and the lines the oshima maru was ghostquiet it was as if time itself had been yanked back to some earlier more patient centuryand which one mattered very little men had been sailing like this for three thousand years probably longer the tern flew away a frigatebirdby comparison almost as big as a light planesoared by overhead its red throat sac was small now not full of air and big as a kids balloon the bird was looking for lunch instead of a mate frigatebirds were pirates if they had their druthers they let other birds do the hard work of diving into the sea then robbed them of their catch hiroshis head followed the frigatebird across the sky thought for a second it was an airplane he said sheepishly uhhuh kenzo had made that same mistake himself a time or two he almost let it go there but he asked what he wanted to ask whose if it was a plane i figured it would be japanese and hoped it wouldnt his brother replied you same thing not this time though cause i knew from the start it was just a bird talk of planes brought kenzo back into the middle of the twentieth century but not for long there were no planes overhead so he forgot about them all he saw now but for the sea and the occasional bird were a few masts from other sampans with rigs as new as the oshima marusand as old as time on he went farther from oahu than he would have needed to go before the war turned everything upside down back then fish had been part of what oahu ate now they were a vital part of what the island ate and the sampans skimmed every fish they could from the pacific even the ocean couldnt keep up with that kind of fishing forever what happens when we have to go so far out to sea that travel time really cuts into how much we can bring back kenzo wondered not for the first time as usual only one answer occurred to him we get even hungrier thats what as his father had taught himsomething he preferred not to rememberhe looked for lots of boobies and other birds diving into the sea that would tell him where the fish were likely to be if that frigatebird was still anywhere in the neighborhood no doubt it was doing the same damn thing hiroshi suddenly pointed to starboard whats that huh kenzos head had been in the cloudsexcept there were no clouds he looked to the right himself something floated on the pacific there gauging distance wasnt easynor was telling how big that thing was just looks like a piece of junk to me he said doubtfully i dont think so hiroshi shaded his eyes with the palm of his hand steer over that way will you okay kenzo did the breeze which had been remarkably strong and steady ever since they set out didnt fail now hed half expected it would just from the innate perversity of the world hiroshi swung the boom to catch it to best advantage the approach didnt happen in a hurry anyway it was close to ten minutes later before hiroshi said see yeah kenzo answered thats a life raft or im a haole his brother said yeah kenzo repeated he waited till theyd sailed a little closer then cupped his hands in front of his mouth and yelled ahoy the raft anybody there god only knew how long it had floated or where it had started out it might hold a sunshrunken corpseor no one at all he felt like cheering when a head popped up into sight it was he saw a blond head an american head he thought excitement tingling through him whore you the fellow croaked fishermen out of honolulu kenzo answered well do whatever we can for you he waited to see if hiroshi would say anything different hiroshi said not a thing the american flierhe couldnt be anything elsesaid thank god he had several days growth of beard the stubble glinted redgold in the sunshine as the oshima maru skimmed closer kenzo saw his eyes get wider and more avid and then they widened again in a different way the man ducked back down into the raft this time he came up holding a youre japs he yelled you stupid fucking asshole kenzo screamed back his brother stared at him in horror at the time he wondered why later he realized cussing out a guy with a gun wasnt exactly phi beta kappa but furious still he went on were americans god damn you or we will be if you fucking let us by then they were within easy range even of a pistol the man in the raft lowered the gun i think maybe you mean it he called across the narrowing stretch of water you couldnt sound that pissed off if you didnt right kenzo said tightly if hed had a pistol he wasnt sure he could have kept himself from shooting the flierhe was that angry he and hiroshi helped the man into the sampan the flier was more battered than hed seemed from a distance his coveralls were tattered and torn and bloody he gulped water as if hed thought he would never see it again maybe he had when he spoke again his voice had changed timbre jesus he said and then thanks guys if theres anything burt burleson can do for you you got it he paused who are you anyway im ken kenzo answered this is my brother hank he thought their japanese names were best buried at the moment what happened to you burleson also shrugged about what youd figure recon in a pby we got bounced and shot up four five days ago managed to break away into some clouds but we were on fire pretty good by then pilot tried to put her in the water it wasnt pretty i was tail gunner i think i was the only guy who got out his face closed in on itself till the two of you saw me i wasnt sure i had the clean end of the stick either well do what we can for you kenzo said again get you ashore some kind of way without anybody seeing have any food burleson asked i managed to catch a mackerel with the line they gave me but raw fish aint my idea of fun kenzo and hiroshi both broke up then kenzo didnt know about his brother but he felt on the ragged edge of hysteria the flier stared from one of them to the other wondering if theyd gone off their rockers maybe they had at least a little carefully kenzo said next to what youll get on oahu raw fish is pretty good we are japanese hiroshi added we grew up eating the stuff we dont mind it so much and its a hell of a lot better than going hungry burleson contemplated that he didnt need much contemplation before he nodded yeah no argument took me a while before i caught anything were gonna finish our run too kenzo said we cant go back to kewalo basin without a catch people will wonder why if we do i was hoping you would think of that hiroshi said neither of them had used a word of japanese since burleson came aboard they hadnt been speaking japanese before either but now things had changed it was a language they could share if they had to it was also dangerous because the flier still had the on his hip he seemed tractable enough now do what you need to do sure he said ill help best i can i know how to gut fish everybody goes fishing in minnesota minnesota all kenzo knew about the place was that it bumped up against canada and it was cold as hell in the wintertime youre a long way from home you better believe it burleson said i was thinking that when i was in the raft there well i got another chance now thanks guys he couldnt have put it any better than that and even though he was a long way from at his best he did help with the gutting when the takahashi brothers brought in their catch kenzo offered him a strip of prime ahi flesh heretry this its a lot better than mackerel burleson tasted warily then ate with real enthusiasm damned if youre not right ken its not sofishylike but its still fish thats pretty funny eh steak and lamb chops dont taste the same kenzo said and then wished he hadnt he couldnt remember the last time hed had either but burleson nodded so he supposed hed made his point after a while the american flier said youre not throwing anything back are you not these days hiroshi answered we used to sure but now it gets eaten as long as its not poisonous like we said before nobodys fussy if there were any fussy people they starved a long time ago kenzo added what are you going to do about me burleson asked drop you on a beach somewhere and say good luck kenzo told him what else can we do well take you to kewalo basin if you want to surrender to the japanese theyll have soldiers there to take charge of the catch burt burleson shuddered no thanks ive heard about how they treat prisoners you guys know anything about that weve seen labor gangs the pows in em are pretty skinny i dont think they get fed much kenzo said the soldiers who run em can act pretty mean too all that was true if he told burleson how big an understatement it was the flier might not believe him what he did say seemed plenty okay ill take my chances on the beach burleson said and then umcan you pick one close to a place with lots of white people so i blend in better so they wont turn me in he meant but kenzo and hiroshi both nodded it was a legitimate point hiroshi said dont trust a haole too far just because hes a haole there are more japanese collaborators yeah but there are white ones and chinese and filipinos too terrific burleson said bleakly sounds like were gonna need to clean up this jointclean out this jointonce we get it back yeah maybe kenzo said and tried not to think about his father for somebody whod sneered at raw fish burt burleson put away a hell of a lot of it kenzo didnt begrudge him floating on the pacific wondering whether youd live or die and sure your buddies were already dead couldnt have been much fun kenzo waited till sundown to start the oshima maru back towards oahu he wanted to get there in the wee small hours when people were least likely to see burleson splashing ashore he steered by the stars he and hiroshi had both got pretty good at that burleson stayed awake which surprised kenzo a little when he asked about it the flier laughed and said i slept as much as i could in that goddamn raftwhat else did i have to do i can stay awake for this besidesanother laughnow i can see where im going not where ive been like in the pby the moon crawled across the sky oahu came up over the northwestern horizon pretty much where kenzo had expected it to be he steered for ewa there were japanese everywhere on oahu of course with the population a third japanese there wouldnt be many places without them he wondered if burleson realized that but he would do what he could for the flier he almost ran the oshima maru aground doing it that wouldnt have been so good which was putting it mildly but burt burleson went over the side with a muttered god bless you guys he struck out for the beach which wasnt very far kenzo steered away from the coast to give himself some sea room dawn was staining the sky with salmonbelly pink when the sampan came into kewalo basin nobody got excited about that sampans went in and came out all the time as usual japanese soldiers took charge of the catch they paid kenzo and hiroshi by weight and winked at the fish the brothers carried off for personal use the noncoms in charge of the details got fish from the takahashis and other fishermen to make sure they didnt fuss about things like that one hand washed the other everything good out at sea spot anything unusual this sergeant asked what could we spot its just lots of water kenzo sounded as casual as he could hai lots of water the sergeant drew the kanji for ocean in the air it combined the characters for water and mother you understand oh yes kenzo said a mother of a lot of water the sergeant laughed at that kenzo added but nothing else the japanese soldier asked no more questions if you paid enough or had clout you could still eat well in honolulu if you had enough clout you didnt have to pay through the nose commander mitsuo fuchida fell into that category when he had commander genda along with him the proprietor of the mochizuki tea house bowed himself almost double and escorted them to a private room thank you for coming here gentlemen you honor my humble establishment which does not deserve the presence of such brave officers he laid the ceremonial on with a trowel bowing again and again fuchida had to work to keep a smile off his face no matter how formal the man acted his accent was that of an ignorant peasant from the south the impulse to smile faded after a moment starting as a peasant the fellow would have had trouble rising this high had he stayed in japan kimonoed waitresses fluttered over fuchida and genda as the two of them sat crosslegged at the low japanesestyle table sake one of the girls asked yes please fuchida said she hurried away he eyed the menu we can get anything we wantas long as we want fish genda shrugged ive heard this place used to have fine sukiyaki but beef he shrugged again karma neh shigata ga nai fuchida answered which was selfevidently true it couldnt be helped the sushi and the sashimi here are goodand look theyve got lobster tempura if were going to be honored guests we ought to make the most of it whats that saying the americans use eat drink and be merry because tomorrow genda didnt finish it but fuchida nodded he knew what his friend was talking about back came the girl with the sake that was brewed from rice and there was finally just about enough rice to go around in oahuand on the other islands of hawaii though they mattered much less to the japanese fuchida and genda both slurped noisily from their cups the stuff wasnt bad though it wasnt up to the best back in the home islands after the food came the waitresses knew enough to withdraw and let the japanese officers talk in peace fuchida spoke without preamble were going to have to fight the americans again yes it seems so genda dipped a piece of tuna into shoyu heated with wasabi he sounded as calm as if they were talking about the weather can we fuchida was still blunt i dont expect them to come after us right awaytheyre busy in north africa for the time being genda answered fuchida nodded and sipped at his sake again the usa had shipped an enormous army around the cape of good hope and up to egypt along with montgomerys british force theyd smashed rommel at el alamein and were driving him west across the desert fuchida ate some sushi he smiled barbecued eel had always been one of his favorites but again the smile would not stay did you notice one thing about that attack gendasan ive noticed several things about itnone of them good for us genda replied which do you have in mind that it didnt use any american carriers fuchida answered what the yankees have left theyre savingfor us im not worried about what theyre saving genda said im worried about what theyre building admiral yamamoto was right about that he invoked yamamotos name as a bishop might invoke the popeand with just as much reverence weve given them lumps twice now we can do it againif they dont cut us off from supplies fuchida said you sound like youve been listening to general yamashita genda said sourly i got an earful of that at iolani palace not long ago i have no more use for the army than you do those people are crazy fuchida said with a distinct shudder but even crazy people can be right some of the time what worries me is we can beat the americans two or three more times beat them as badly as we did in the last big fight and what will it do for us buy us more time till the next battle thats all genda said theyll just go back to building and we cant do much to stop them but if they beat us even once if that happens were in trouble he drained his little sake cup and poured it full again they have a margin for error and we dontthats what youre saying fuchida said genda nodded vigorously hai thats exactly what im saying except you said it better than i did wed better not make any errors then fuchida said we havent yet not big ones anyhow genda agreed and the americans have made plenty but were already doing about as well as we can the americans arent not yet theyre still learning and theyre getting better fuchida went bottomsup with his sake cup were in hawaii and they arent thats how its supposed to work and thats how its going to keep on working he hoped he sounded determined and not just drunk hed poured down quite a bit he wondered if he would have a headache in the morning he wouldnt be surprised if he did well there were still plenty of aspirins genda said theres a legend from the west where every time the hero cuts off a dragons head two more heads grow back thats what worries me in this fight the image fit the war against america much too wellso well in fact that mitsuo fuchida got drunk enough to have no doubts whatsoever hed regret it in the morning after pensacola naval air station the naval training station outside buffalo jolted joe crosetti in lots of ways first and foremost was the weather the chilly wind of lake erie was like nothing hed ever known it was only autumn too winter would be worse orson sharp whod switched stations and squadrons along with him took it in stride cant be too much nastier than what im used to he said it was already a lot nastier than san francisco ever got joe had hardly ever worn a topcoat a windbreaker was usually all you needed where he grew up he was glad of his topcoat here he had long johns too and expected to wear them flying out over the lake felt strange he was used to large expanses of water the pacific and then the gulf of mexico were both magnificent each in its own way but the idea of being up over water as far as the eye could see and knowing it was fresh water for a californian that seemed as alien as mars then there was the uss wolverine shed started life as a coalburning sidewheeling excursion steamer but shed been decked over to give aspiring carrier pilots somewhere to do endless takeoffs and landings without impeding the war effort by tying up a ship that could actually go into combat she wasnt pretty but she got the job done the same held true for the grumman ffs the cadets were flying zeros would have slaughtered them but they were a lot hotter than texans and to joes amazement lake erie could grow some perfectly respectable waves that meant the wolverine pitched and rolled just the way a real carrier would out in the pacific it also meant the apprentice pilots had to obey the landing officer as if he were god one of the instructors had said following the landing officers directions is the most important thing you can dothe most important have you got that youd better have it gentlemen if you dont youll kill yourselves and youll cost the country thirtyone grand for a wildcattwice that and then some for one of the new hellcats if you happen to draw themand thats not even adding in the five cents youre worth when you fly up to the stern of your carrier you are a machine he is the man in charge of the machine you are under his control he can see your approach much better than you can he can correct it much better than you can if you trust your own judgment instead of his youll be sorrybut not for long some guys knew better some guys always knew better you didnt get to be a pilot training for carrier operations if you didnt think pretty well of your own judgment so far this squadron had had one guy crash on the wolverines wooden flight deck one guy slam headon into the training carriers stern and one guy fly his ff into lake erie because they did what they wanted to do and not what the landing officer told them to do two of them were dead the fellow theyd fished out of the drink was still training with the rest of the cadets he wouldnt make that mistake again whether hed make some different mistake well at least he had the chance to find out joe lined his biplane fighter up on the carriers stern theyd even built a little island on the port side to give her smokebelching stacks somewhere to go and to make her seem more like the warships she was impersonating andalso portsidetheyd built the little platform at the stern from which the landing officer directed traffic another ff was in front of joe the obsolescent fighter touched down on the flight deck tires smoking for a moment then taxied along to the far end and roared up into the sky again getting everybody as many repetitions as possible was the point of the exercise seeing that spurt of smoke made joe check his own landing gear again yes hed lowered it the landing officer would have waved him off if hed tried anything dumb like landing with it up he knew that even so its my neck he muttered there were the wigwag flagsfor him this time the landing officer dipped the flags to the left joe straightened out the ff the landing officer straightened too and held out both flags level with his shoulders joe was going the way the other man wanted him to i am a machine the naval air cadet told himself the landing officer runs me i do what he says it wasnt easy he wanted to fly the way he wanted to fly hed spent all this time learning to do that now he had to suppress a lot of the trained reflexes hed acquired in the past months the wigwag flags moved in tiny circles in the landing officers hands speed up joe obediently gave the grumman biplane a little more throttle those circles stopped the landing officer urged him up a little the ffs stick went back its nose rose then suddenly the flags dropped joe dove for the wolverines deck any carrier landing was a controlled crash the trick was making controlled the key word not crash the ffs tires hit the timbers of the flight deck on a real carrier a working carrier the planes tailhook would have snagged a wire and brought it to a halt here joe bounced down the deck and then off again he gunned the engine and rose into the sky yet once more officers on the training carrier would be grading his performance he thought hed done pretty well that time they didnt always agree with him after three more landings and takeoffs he got orders to return to the land base regretfully he obeyed he thoughthe hopedhe improved every time he wanted as much practice as he could getthis was as close as he could come to the real mccoy finding his way across the gray waters of lake erie also proved interesting thewolverine steamed well out of sight of land he needed to use some of what hed learned in navigation before he found new york again he hoped it was new york anyway if hed fouled up it might be pennsylvania or ontario ending up not just in the wrong state but the wrong country would have damaged his career it probably would have meant he didnt have one but nohe hadnt screwed the pooch this time that was the shoreline south of buffalo where he belonged he breathed a sigh of relief he also tried to suppress the little stab of worry that went through him whenever he did this out in the pacific he wouldnt have a shoreline to recognize if he was going to find the enemy and find his way back to his own carrier again hed have to be able to use the navigation they were trying to pound into his head can i he wondered he hoped so he thought soas long as he had a little while to think while he was doing it the japs may not give you that kind of time joe he said in the cockpit are you sure you want to go on with this but that had only one possible answer he nodded he didnt need to speak hed been doing this for most of a year now hed torn his life to pieces to do this he wasnt about to back away from it now and if that meant he had to take a few chances once he got up there he shrugged then it did that was all his commissioning wasnt very far away he didnt give a damn about becoming an officer for the sake of becoming an officerthough that would have his immigrant parents walking on air what he gave a damn about was that becoming an officer becoming a pilot would give him the chance to fly off a real carrier and take the war to the japs hed been waiting for that chance ever since pearl harbor it was so close these days he could taste it he wanted it bad by now coming down on dry land seemed routine instructors had talked to the cadets about stuff like that warning them against overconfidence joe had heard about guys who flew their planes into the ground just out of carelessness he watched what he was doing but he had to make himself watch it that probably wasnt so good no landing officer with wigwag flags herejust him and the ff and the runway he landed smoothly enough and taxied to a stop as he killed the engine he laughed at himself three years earlier this plane had been on a carrier if war had broken out then say over the sinking of the panay it would have been in the front line against the japs nowadays nowadays it was good enough to train in of course japan probably hadnt had zeros three years earlier either things happened in a hurry nowadays and that was that another grumman biplane came in and taxied up right behind joes orson sharp climbed out of it way to go roomie he said you made those circuits and bumps look mighty good yeah joe still sometimes had trouble believing his roommate was pulling for him as hard as he seemed to but sharp nodded oh yeah we do em here we can do em anywhere he didnt ask about his own performance part of that was because joe had been in front of him in the queue and couldnt have seen him and the other part was that the mormon kid unlike joe was confident about everything he did up there he wasnt a showoff or anything but he was good and he knew it groundcrew men took charge of the fighters joe and sharp walked side by side to the administration building next to the field by now joe was used to having his roommate tower over him once you got up in the air size didnt matter any more anyway when they got inside instructors separated them joes raked him over the coals for not following the landing officers signals fast enough the gimleteyed men aboard the wolverine had wasted no time radioing their complaints back to the base they never did joe took the heat and tried not to show how it stung actually he thought hed done pretty well hed done his damnedesthe knew that if it wasnt good enough hed just have to try to improve you couldnt argue you had no excuses for anything less than perfection a couple of cadets had complained and alibied when instructors criticized them joe didnt know where they were these days he did know they werent cadets any more when his own reaming was done his instructor barked any questions yes sir joe replied the instructors eyebrows rose more often than notmuch more often than notthat was the wrong answer but the instructor couldnt presume ahead of time go ahead he said his voice chilly as the weather sir weve lost a lot of carriers in the pacific joe said my question is when do we start getting replacements ah the instructor relaxed joe had found a question he could safely ask it wasnt one about his own performance something approaching warmth entered the older mans voice as he replied well mr crosetti you have to understand i dont know a whole lot more than you do herenot officially anyway yes sir joe said eagerly i do follow that but youre hooked into the grapevine and im just a dumb cadet i dont get the time of day let alone the juicy stuff the instructors face crinkled into a wide smile joe hadnt been sure it had room for that much amusement but it did the officer said were not talking weeks but were not talking years either he caught himself i take it back from what i hear the first one is only weeks away but were looking at next summer before we have enough hulls in the water to go back and take another shot at the japs next summer joe weighed that normally seen with the impatience of youth it would have seemed a million miles away but when he looked ahead at everything he still had to do to win a place on one of those carriers well that doesnt sound too bad lieutenant saburo shindo had always slept lightly lately hed been dozing and catnapping more than really sleeping he didnt like that at all air raids came every few nights now and he expected them even on nights when they didnt come worry kept him awake when sirens didnt tonight though the alarm was real zakennayo he snarled as he ran for a shelter trench what good is it to have this fancy electronic warning if we cant shoot down the enemy airplane once we spot it as if to mock him a couple of antiaircraft guns near the haleiwa airstrip started barking wasting ammunition he thought scornfully they had about as much chance of hitting that stinking flying boat as he did if he stood up and threw rocks at it through the guns racket he caught the steady purr of the floatplanes engines the americans made good motors by comparison a lot of japanese aircraft sounded like flying washing machines crump crump bombs fell not too far away yankee raiders hadnt hit haleiwa for a few nights this was the least of the airstrips on oahu as it had been when the americans held hawaii maybe they thought they would catch us napping maybe they were right too a few more explosions these more distant shindo wanted to hop in his zero and go after the enemy seaplane but night fighting was a risky business only now beginning to get specialists even in europe where thered been more of it than anywhere else if he took off here hed be flying blind he wouldnt have radar technicians who could guide him to his target the way english and german nightfighter pilots did he wouldnt have a swarm of targets to go after either just one seaplane on a nuisance raid and hed have a devil of a time getting down again too with all the fields on oahu blacked out at night no he had to stay where he was and do a slow burn that no doubt was what the americans had in mind they knew how to get what they wanted damn them more bombs fell somewhere far off in the distance schofield barracks wheeler field even honolulu but for those distant explosions the night was eerily silent as most oahu nights were sound could carry a long long way the allclear sounded shindo went back to his tent he was too angry and too disgusted to sleep he thought he might have had a chance to doze offbut before he could he thought about what the army officers stationed in haleiwa would say he could hear them laughing behind their hands as they asked why the navy couldnt keep the yankees away from hawaii hed heard those questions before he knew what the answer was the pacific was too big to let anybody keep an eye on every square kilometer of it the americans had found that out in the biggest possible way almost a year earlier now they were impressing the same lesson on the japanese shindo shrugged the americans could be nuisances they were nuisances but they werent going to catch japan napping with a major attack on hawaii that wouldnt and couldnt happen by now the japanese had picket boats out facing the panama canal as well as the us mainland if the americans wanted another crack at these islands they would have to take it against defenders who were alert and ready but even that knowledge didnt soothe shindo enough to let him sleep he fumed about tonights raid and tossed and turned till morning painted the eastern horizon golden then he went to the mess and got rice with bits of salt fish in it and a cup of tea like tobacco tea was a precious import even japanese military personnel below officers rank had trouble getting their hands on any some of them had taken to coffee instead that was locally grown though not in large amounts shindo thought it was nasty but it packed the same jolt as tea or even more so it had its uses a telephone call came in from honolulu just after shindo finished that early breakfast since he was expecting it he sounded properly subordinate to commander fuchida yes sir he said we will make a sweep to the north oh yes sir if we spot anything well do our best to shoot it down or sink it good fuchida said it would be excellent if we could show that we are making the americans pay i understand sir what shindo understood was that fuchidas superiors were breathing down his neck but shindo like any fighter pilot did want to be up in the air going after the enemy he told the armorers to load a kg bomb on the rack hed had installed under his zeros belly if he met a submarine he wanted to be able to punish it the bomb wouldnt handicap him against the lumbering american flying boats he was likely to meet in these waters it would have against wildcats but he didnt expect to run into wildcats wildcats meant carriers close by and there were no american carriers close by away he went up into the sky certain officersnot fuchida to his creditcomplained about how much gas searches used up they didnt think enough about the cost of not searching as shindo flew in a widening spiral over the pacific he breathed in oxygenated air with the taste of rubber that taste and flying would always be linked in his mind for some men it was the smell of gasoline for others the throbbing roar of the engine not to shindo for him that taste said it all he wanted to spot the enemy he wanted to kill the enemy if he saw a flying boat he wanted to shoot it down if he saw a submarine he wanted to sink it hed flown too many searches where nothing turned up the thought had hardly crossed his mind when he spied motion in the air out of the corner of his eye he started to swing his zero in that direction then stopped laughing and swearing at the same time that wasnt an enemy flying boatthat was another japanese fighter plane on a search spiral of its own no one except the americans would have been happy with him had he gone after it and shot it down that the other pilot might have shot him down instead never crossed his mind he respected the ability of every man he faced not taking your opponent lightly was the best way to live to a ripe old age but without false modesty shindo expected to win every aerial combat he entered so did any good fighter pilot without that touch of arrogance you couldnt do your job well he felt like a peregrine falcon on the prowl for pigeons but there were no pigeons he kept one eye on the fuel gauge if he had to go home hungryagainhe wouldnt be a happy man there what was that four kilometers below down on the surface of the pacific it wasnt a pigeon but it might be a duck it was somebodys submarine sliding along on the surface as if it didnt have a care in the world somebodys yesbut whose japan had subs in these waters too to go after american warships if the yankees tried to invade hawaii again but if the submarine was american saburo shindo didnt want clodhoppers from the army looking down their noses at his service sinking an american sub would be a good way to shut them up for a while he put himself between the sun and the boat and went down lower for a closer look anyone in the conning tower would have to look up into that glare and would have a hard time spotting him attacking out of the sun worked against other airplanes it ought to be just as good against a submarine if he attacked shooting down his own sides plane would be bad bombing his own sides sub would be disastrously worse but he knew the lines of japanese submarines very well he had to this one looked different in these waters anything not japanese had to be american shindo didnt dither dithering was in his nature even less than in most fighter pilots as soon as he was sure that boat belonged to the enemy he dove on it hed never trained as a bomber pilot his zero didnt have dive brakes on the wings the way aichi dive bombers did the design team that made the fighter hadnt figured it would need those big slotted flaps he couldnt dive as steeply as an aichi pilot could either his plane wasnt built to handle the stress of pulling out of a dive like that he did the best he could with what he had the submarine swelled enormously shindo saw someone on the conning towerand then all at once he didnt the boat started to slide beneath the waves theyd spotted him but acceleration wasnt the only thing pulling his lips back from his teeth in a predatory grin too late they were much too late he worked the bombrelease button that was as much a makeshift as the rack under the zeros belly it wasnt an original part of the instrument panel it did what it was supposed to do though the bomb dropped free shindo pulled back on the stick wrestling the zeros nose up before it went into the pacific too the fighters airframe groaned no it wasnt made for this kind of work but the nose did lift shindo swung the zero into a tight turn so he could see what hed done when he did he pounded a leathergloved hand down on his thigh the bomb had hit maybe ten meters aft of the conning tower men were swarming out of the sub which was trailing smoke and sinking fast shindo went around for another pass by then the american sailors had got into several inflatable life rafts his thumb found the firing button on top of the stick the zeros machine guns chattered back when the fight for hawaii was new shindo had let an american pilot hed shot down parachute safely to earth thinking back on it he had no idea why hed been so soft he shrugged there inside the cockpit he tried not to make the same mistake twice a couple of sailors in the rafts fired pistols at his plane had he been down there he would have done the same thing but he was up here instead and so he shot up the rafts till they sank till blood turned the pacific red this was why hed come out here if an american flying boat rescued those sailors they would make more trouble for japan and if they managed to reach oahu or another island antijapanese locals of whom there were too many were likely to take them in nobody would have to worry about either of those unfortunate developments now quietly pleased with himself shindo flew back towards oahu a long column of boots marched through the mud in a driving rainstorm of the sort southern california chambers of commerce pretended this part of the country didnt get lester dillon had spent enough time at camp elliott to know better the youngsters who wanted to be marines looked thoroughly miserable dillon was miserable too but he didnt show it as far as they were concerned he was immune to vagaries like weather if rain hit him and ran down the back of his neck if his boots squelched in the mudwell so what he was a platoon sergeant at the moment he was a platoon sergeant who craved coffee with brandy in it but these puppies didnt need to know that i cant hear you he shouted pitching his voice to carry even through the downpour the boots had been singing a marching song understandably the downpour dampened their zeal dillon understood that all right but he wasnt about to put up with it they werent supposed to let anything dampen their zeal that was part of what being a marine was all about if rain could do it coming under fire would be infinitely worse coming under fire was infinitely worse but they had to act as if it werent they roared out the song through the rain little bird with a yellow bill sat outside my window sill coaxed him down with a crust of bread and then i smashed his fuckin head i still cant hear you dillon shouted but not so angrily they were loud enough to wake the dead now and they were getting tougher when they started training this tramp through the rain and muck would have prostrated them now they took it in stride few physical challenges fazed them any more that too was part of what made them what they ought to be but it was the easy part a lot of themfarm boys and factory workershad been in good shape before they started training but being in good shape while necessary to make a marine wasnt enough would they stick together would they think of their buddies their unit as more important than themselves would they throw away their lives to save their buddies if they had to knowing those buddies would do the same for them would they go forward where staying safe required hanging back if they managed thatif they managed it without fussing about it without even thinking much about ittheyd be proper leathernecks dillon couldnt remember how hed absorbed the lessons he needed to have he knew damn well theyd been in place before he ever went over there what he saw in france what he did there only confirmed what hed already had sergeant one of the boots said yeah dillon growledhe wanted them to think he was god and an angry god at that this is fun the youngster said that flummoxed dillon in all his years in the corps he didnt think hed ever heard the like its not supposed to be fun goddammit he said after that momentary amazement this isnt a picnic it isnt a lark those nip assholes are gonna fuckin kill you if they get half a chance theyre good at it that means we gotta be even better you hear me maggot yes sergeant the boot bellowed you hear me had to be answered at top volume lest worse befall worse would bloody well befall here any which way drop down and give me fifty pushups dillon growled fun my ass yes sergeant the boot shouted again he was a big blond widefaced kid named kowalski fifty pushups in the rain in the mud with a heavy pack on his back were no joke he was filthy and damn near dead by the time he finished them dillon wasnt sure he could have done them himself kowalski though plainly would sooner have died for real than failed that was a marines way of thinking too he bounced to his feet after the last one panting and scarlet but ready to go on with the march still having fun dillon asked him by his expression the kid wanted to say yes but he wasntquitethat dumb no sergeant he said loudly okay dillon said get it in gear after a hot shower and a clean uniform he told the story that evening over a beer in the ncos club dutch wenzel shook his head as if he couldnt believe his ears fun he said what the fuck is the world coming to beats me dillon answered how much fun will he think it is when his pal gets shot in the guts how much fun will he think it is when he does its a job for chrissake we gotta do it and we gotta do it right but fun for crying out loud dutch easy maneasy wenzel raised a placating hand youre preaching to the choir here okay okay it rocked me though i tell you les shook his head too he still couldnt get over it fun dont blame you dutch said even for a boot thats pushing it heyi heard something pretty good though tell me dillon urged maybe itll help me get the taste of this out of my mouth i hear we launched a new carrier dutch told him gotta start making up for what the japs nailed last summer les nodded thats a factand youre right that is good news what are they calling this one essex wenzel answered there are supposed to be more in the pipeline too thered better be dillon said you gotta figure were going to lose some on the way in we need to smash whatever theyve got and have enough left over to handle their landbased air if we dont we shouldnt even start yeah well you know that and i know that but do they know it back in washington wenzel said beats me dillon said ill tell you one thing thoughwere gonna find out jane armitage found it hard to believe was more than a month old christmas and new years had passed quietly what was there to celebrate and one day one month here was a lot like another oh it was a little warmer in the summer a little rainier in the winter but both times only a little she remembered ohio you didnt have any trouble telling summer from winter in columbus in wahiawa you could lose track without a calendar flowers bloomed butterflies danced and bees buzzed snow when the school was open shed had to teach special lessons about snow the thirdgraders couldnt have understood half the christmas carols if she hadnt downtown wahiawa such as it was had suffered since the japanese took over all the stores that sold new clothes new dishes new furniturenew anything when you got right down to ithad gone bellyup new stuff had come from the mainland and nothing came to hawaii from the mainland any more except the occasional airplane full of bombs much as jane approved of those she didnt want to buy one and take it back to the apartment secondhand places now those flourished if you wanted a toaster or a dress or something to read you got it secondhand used goods if not abundant were at least available jane sometimes felt like a ghoul when she sorted through them for a lot of them came from the households of people whod died in the fighting but what could you do those luckless souls had no further use for their goods and the people who were still alive desperately needed them when jane saw a copy of murder must advertise in the secondhandbook shop she had all she could do not to jump for joy she liked mysteries in general and dorothy sayers in particular and shed never read that one showing eagerness though would have run up the price nothing was fixed these days everything depended on how much the seller thought heor in this case shethought the buyer would part with jane picked up a cookbook she didnt particularly want cookbooks made good cover everyone was obsessed with food these days she poked around through the store before casually adding the mystery to the cookbook how much for these two louise she asked louises jaw worked she might have been chewing gum except there was no gum to chew fifteen dollars she said after making whatever arcane calculations she made those calculations worked she wasnt as skinny as most people in wahiawa fifteen jane squeaked thats outrageous and it was she hadnt expected louise to say more than ten the bookstore owner shrugged she chewed on the gum that wasnt there twelve then she said reluctantly and you wont jew me down another dime im not made out of money jane protested louise shrugged again jane asked how much for each of them that boiled down to how well had she hidden her reaction when she saw murder must advertise if louise thought she was mostly after the cookbook she won if the other woman knew she wanted the mystery she didnt still more jawworking followed louise was calculating what the traffic would bear eight for this one four for the other she said at last she wanted more for the cookbook jane didnt cheer even if she felt like it instead she looked disappointed thats too much she said sending a longing glance toward the book full of recipes for chinese chicken wings and polynesian pork chops and bananas on the half shell and fish with pineapple sauce and suffering bastards take it or leave it louise had the business manners of a snapping turtle sighing jane put the cookbook back on the table where shed found it i guess i can afford this one she said tapping the mystery i sure wish youd done it the other way though louise looked smug jane gave her a fivedollar bill and got back two halves in change she left the store in a hurry before louise figured out she was really ready to jump for joy the japs had confiscated radios a bomb had fallen on the local movie house making time go by was one of the hardest things you could do these days a good book would kill several hours if it was good enough you could read it more than once too jane could hardly wait to get back to her place open up the novel and be transported from oahu to a larger cooler foggier isle but she hadnt slipped the surly bonds of reality yet up the street came a work gang of american pows herded along by japanese guards with bayoneted rifles she eyed them with horrified fascination as always they reminded her how things could have been worse she was thin they were emaciated her clothes were worn they still had on the tattered remnants of whatever theyd been wearing when they surrendered she made do with coldwater showers without soap by the way they lookedand smelledthey hadnt bathed for more than a year some of them stood defiantly erect and marched as if on parade at schofield barracks others plainly were on their last legs and could barely stagger along one of them fell down in the middle of the street two japanese guards stood over him screaming what had to be curses when he didnt get up they started kicking him they paused after a minute or so to see if he would rise he tried but couldnt get past his knees they kicked him some more and paused again when he still didnt get up two of them bayoneted him he groaned and thrashed and bled janes nails were short these dayswhose werent but they bit into her palms anyhow the japs didnt put the pow out of his misery they left him there to die slowly then laughing they got the rest of the prisoners moving again it wasnt fletch jane thought as she willed her hands to uncurl whenever prisoners of war went through wahiawa she couldnt help scanning their faces to see if she spotted her exhusband as decrepit and shaggy as the pows were these days he might have stumbled past her without her even recognizing him she wondered why she bothered she had no idea whether he was alive she didnt love him any more even if she did what could she do for him nothing less than nothing and if the japs here found out she was an officers wifeeven if she and fletch had been getting a divorcethey might make things unpleasant for her more unpleasant she thought with a shiver but she couldnt help looking getting a divorce wasnt as final as lawyers made it out to be she wished it were by the time the guards were out of sight the prisoner theyd butchered had stopped moving sooner or later someone would drag the body out of the street jane looked away from it as she scurried back to her apartment what worried her was how little the atrocity upset her shed already seen too many others marching up the kamehameha highway was more fun than paving it or building gun emplacements for the japs that was how fletcher armitage measured his life these days he wasnt quite so exhausted when he marched as when he worked he didnt starve quite so quickly either these were things to treasure though he wouldnt have thought so before december he understood einstein better than hed ever dreamt of doing there was bad and then there was worse what would have looked like the worst thing in the world to him before the japs overran oahu now didnt seem bad at all if that wasnt relativity what the hell was it when the pows worked the guards pushed them hard why not the japs didnt do any road work or digging themselves but when they marched the pace stayed bearable if the japs made the prisoners doubletime they would have to doubletime themselves and they wouldnt have cared for that one bit a few of them were actually plump fletchs standards about what constituted a proper human form had changed radically since the surrenderso radically he didnt altogether realize it himself the americans with whom he labored seemed normal to him they were after all the people he saw every minute of every day he forgot how scrawny they were because they surrounded him but they made the japs some of whom were prewar average and a handful even heavier than that seem grotesquely obese by comparison why didnt they fall over dead from carting that extra weight around all the time intellectually fletch knew hed had that much flesh himself once upon a time emotionally he didnt wouldnt couldnt believe it if everyone who mattered to him seemed made of sticks and twigs then anyone who didnt had to have something wrong with him wahiawa ahead somebody said hot damn that wasnt fletch it was a texan named virgil street he added who gives a damn anyways we went through this lousy place fallin back when we still had guns in our hands goin through it forwards doesnt mean anything on account of the japs got the guns now fletch kept his mouth shut wahiawa meant something to him he wondered if hed see jane he also wondered if shed care if she saw him not likely he feared he never had figured out why she dumped him he hadnt seen it coming that he hadnt seen it coming said a good deal about him but one of the things it said was that he wouldnt understand what it said he still loved her as much as he had before if only he laughed he had a picture of the jap sergeant who bossed the work gang letting him fall out for a hearttoheart with his ex it was right next to his pictures of santa claus the easter bunny and the tooth fairy and even if the sergeant did would jane listen to him that was another fat chance she hadnt wanted to hear a word he said not after she threw him out of the apartment suddenly and powerfully he wanted a drink thinking of jane made him think of bourbon hed done a hell of a lot of drinking after she dumped him what with forcibly separating him from hooch the japanese invasion might have saved him from turning into a lush shit he muttered without even thinking he could have named a dozen pretty damn good officers all the way up to bird colonel who drank like fish if that wasnt a great army tradition he didnt know what was he would sooner have sacrificed his liver for his country than what he was going through now as the pows came into wahiawa the guards strung themselves out along either side of the slowmoving column when they were out in the country the guards mostly relaxed prisoners couldnt very well run and couldnt disappear for long here though there were side streets to duck down houses and apartments to break into all sorts of places to hide the japs werent dummies they could figure that out as well as white men could they could do all kinds of things as well as white men could and maybe better back before the shooting started fletch wouldnt have believed it any more than any other us army officer would have to him japs had been little bucktoothed monkeys who could turn out cheap copies of just about anything but who flew planes made from tin cans and didnt have the balls to fight a real war he knew better now he laughed again bitterly one whole hell of a lot knowing did him one run nine die shouted a corporal who spoke english of a sort everybody in each shooting squad automatically looked around to see where the other men whose fate was tied to his were and what they were doing each squad had one or two guys reckoned less reliable than the others you wanted to be sure they couldnt light out for the tall timber fletch caught streets eye they nodded to each other everything seemed under control if anybody held their shooting squad together they were the ones fletch had an idea about how to lead having been an officer street was a man who commanded respect regardless of rank there were soldiers like that fletch was glad the two of them got along into wahiawa they came civilians on the street bowed to the approaching japanese that was ingrained into everybody by now local japs filipinos koreans chinamen haoles you had to show respect the world hadnt shown japan respect before and everybody was paying for it now wahiawa looked poor it looked like a mainland town where the factory had closed down and everybodyd been out of work for a long time everybody wore shabby clothesnot so bad as the rags the prisoners had on but shabby people looked fearful too as if expecting something worse would happen if they werent careful they were bound to be right too you move the corporal yelled hustling them along move fletch did if he didnt move they would bayonet him on the street and laugh while they did it his legs and especially his feet hurt he kept telling himself it was only because hed done too much work for too long on too little food he kept telling himself that yes but he had more and more trouble making himself believe it he was starting to get beriberi not only werent they feeding him enough they were feeding him the wrong kind of not enough a blond woman on the sidewalk bowed to the jap soldiers was that jane excitement then dejectionit wasnt this gal was older and tougherlooking hed seen worse though he laughed at himself his interest in women right now had to be purely theoretical he didnt think he could get it up if he had a crane to help he laughed again whats funny virgil street asked anything that made a day go by a trifle better was to be cherished fletch explained the other pow snorted hell buddy way we are now a clappedout fiftycent whored turn up her nose at us even if we could get it up aint that the sad and sorry truth fletch looked down at himself he doubted he weighed a hundred twenty pounds and at least ten pounds of that were dirt along with everybody else in this sorry outfit he smelled like the monkey house in the zoo he would have killed for a sirloin a baked potato and pie a la mode hedy lamarr dancing the dance of love in the altogether forget about it and then he did see jane and he stumbled and almost fell on his face he recognized the sun dress she had on shed bought it on a shopping trip down to honolulu and crowed about the price for days she was very tan her hands looked like hell they were almost as battered as his own she saw him too her jaw dropped her mouth shaped an o her eyes widened she didnt say a thing though he started to scream her namehe started to but caught himself before anything more than a gurgle escaped his lips if he showed he knew who she was what would happen to her shed catch it from the japs odds were shes alive anyway and she doesnt look too bad maybe shed started to call him too if she had she also had too much sense to finish i love you he mouthed and wondered if she could read lips he must have slowed down a guard whacked him across the shoulder blades with a length of bamboo he staggered but kept his feet the bastard would have kicked him if hed gone down could he have got up after a couple of good licks he hoped so anyhow if he couldnt well that would have given jane something to watch wouldnt it you move the jap corporal yelled again on he went he had no choice ships passing in the night he thought jane stared after him he looked back over his shoulder once to see but their ship had taken a torpedo and sunk back before the war started whatever he saw now wasnt it just debris floating on the surface two tears ran down his face he wiped them away with his skinny filthy sunburned forearm when he looked back over his shoulder jane was gone had she ever really been there he knew damn well she had whatever the japs had done to him theyd never been able to make him cry all alone in the apartment shed shared with fletch once upon a time jane armitage lay on the bed theyd also shared once upon a time her shoulders shook she sobbed into the pillow he was alive she supposed she should have been glad she was gladand then again she wasnt wouldnt he have been better off dead shed seen plenty of pows shed imagined seeing fletch that way that only went to show the difference between imagination and reality a brighteyed skeleton with a ginger beard and hed seen her too for that little stretch of time it had been as if hed never got drunk as if shed never talked to a lawyer if he could have broken out of that sorry pack she would have she didnt know what she would have done whatever he wanted probably he was either still lurching along or at hard labor somewhere only a couple of miles away right now in the movies she would have figured out a way to go to him and comfort him and feed him and get him away from the people who were making his life a hell on earth it would have been easy as pie and the japs wouldnt have caught on at least not till too late then they would have been left gnashing their teeth and shaking their fists as she and fletch rode off into the sunset together real life unfortunately didnt usually come with a hollywood ending the japs were a lot tougher and smarter than the villains in the movies she didnt have the faintest idea how she could spirit fletch away from the work gang he was in or even how she could get him any food if she did get fletch away what could she do with him stash him here in the apartment then he could never go out and she could never have anybody in anyone who spotted him could blackmail her forever and a ration that wasnt adequate for one wouldnt come close to feeding two theyd both starve and hed probablyno certainlywant to sleep with her again and that moment of surprise on the sidewalk aside she didnt want to sleep with him oh maybe once out of pity but no more than that for gods sake and trying to get him out and failing would lead not to one horrible death but two shit she said all at once understanding why hollywood endings were so popular they were a hell of a lot better than the way things went when the cameras werent rolling before the japanese occupied hawaii jiro takahashi had never been a man of any great consequence here oh he did his work and he paid his bills and he had some friends who thought he was a pretty good fellow but that was about it he could go anywhere without having anyone pay special attention to him it wasnt like that any more hed been on the radio several times hed had his words and opinions featured in hawaiis japaneselanguage press and hed even had his picture and his translated words show up in honolulus englishlanguage papers now his fellow japanese said hello takahashisan and bowed when he went by or they called him the fisherman like the sentries at the consulate they asked his advice for their problems they did favors for him and tried to have him get favors for them from the consul and his henchmen they treated him like an important person like a doctor or lawyernot like a real fisherman he loved every minute of it hed had haoles bow to him as if he were a senior japanese officer they probably wanted him to do them favors too the only trouble being that he had no english and hardly any haoles spoke japanese but getting respect from people whod looked down their noses not just at him but at all japanese before things changed was as heady as strong sake the only people who seemed unimpressedto put it mildlywith his rise in the world were his sons hiroshi and kenzo did their best to act as if nothing had changed or to wish things hadnt once when they were out in the oshima maru and no one else could hear kenzo asked why couldnt you just keep your head down like most people father whats that supposed to mean jiro answered his own question before kenzo could it means youre still full of sour grapes thats what you think the americans are gone for good kenzo said you think you can call them all the names you want but they havent gone away theyre sinking more and more ships these days their planes come over more and more often what will you do when they take oahu back youll be in more trouble than you can shake a stick at thats what theyre back on the mainland to jiro the us mainland was as far away as the moon how can they come back here do you think im afraid of the bogeyman youd better think twice they arent the bogeyman father hiroshi backed kenzo theyre real he spoke with a somber conviction jiro couldnt dismiss however much he wanted to oh yes he still tried to laugh it off and i suppose youve talked to them and they told you just what theyre going to do neither of his sons said anything they only looked at each other the breeze shifted with automatic attention jiro turned to the rigging every bit as automatically hiroshi swung the rudder a few degrees to port he and kenzo had become good sailors even if they liked the united states too well they proved right about one thing the americans werent going away jiro had thought they would after the beatings japan gave them wouldnt they see they didnt have a chance and give up evidently not us seaplanes buzzed over honolulu or pearl harbor dropped bombs and flew away under cover of darkness or a submarine surfaced fired a few rounds with its deck gun and disappeared under the sea again or a sub didnt surface but put a torpedo into a japanese freighterand again disappeared a couple of times the japanese had sunk a marauding us submarine the papers and the radio trumpeted those triumphs to the skies hiroshis sardonic comment was that they wouldnt get so excited about it if it happened more often that hadnt occurred to jiro and he wished it hadnt occurred to his son either it made an uncomfortable amount of sense was there a kami in charge of bad timing if there was the spirit had its eye on the oshima maru right that minute no sooner had jiro worried about how japan was really doing than kenzo said it sounds like the russians are still giving hitler a hard time the japaneselanguage papers that were the only ones jiro could read had done their best to talk around that but they couldnt get around the brute fact that germany had got into stalingrad had fought a terrible battle there and had lost it jiro did his best to shrug it off and even to counterpunch hitler has his war and we have ours did you see how our bombers hit australia again more haoles getting what they deserve our bombers kenzo shook his head they werent mine father please excuse me youre japanese too jiro said angrily i look like you i speak japanese yes his younger son answered but i speak english too i was born in america im glad i was born in america that silly girl youre going with has you all confused jiro said kenzo glowered at him elsies not silly shes about the least silly girl i ever met im not seeing any haole girl and i feel the same way kenzo does hiroshi said jiro went back to tending the sails his sons just wouldnt listen to reason one thing growing up in america had done to them it had taught them not to respect their parents the way they would have in japan he and his wife had done everything they knew how to do but america corroded good moral orderthat was all there was to it you dont know how lucky we are that weve come under the emperors rule jiro said that got squawks from both his sons the squawks took some little will to turn into words kenzo got there before hiroshi some luck if we didnt catch most of our own food wed be as skinny as the rest of the poor soandsos in honolulu the ration ordinary people got was less than extravagant the americans are sinking the ships that bring in rice jiro said chancellor morimura told me so himself and besides we dont have white men telling us what to do any more doesnt that count for something we have japanese soldiers and japanese sailors telling us what to do instead hiroshi said if we dont do it they shoot us the americans never did anything like that you havent got the right attitude jiro scolded his boysnow men with minds of their ownboth nodded he didnt know what to do about them he feared he couldnt do anything commander mitsuo fuchida bowed to his opposite number from the army good to see you again he said lieutenant colonel murakami bowed back in precisely the same way their ranks were equivalent and you he said slyly adding kingmaker fuchida laughed along with commander genda and one of murakamis colleagues theyd chosen stanley laanui to head the restoredon paper anyhowkingdom of hawaii that though probably wasnt why murakami had come to the akagihad actually set foot on a navy shipnow fuchida waved him to a chair in his cramped cabin there was no other kind on the carrier even captain kaku was pinched for room what can i do for you fuchida asked before answering murakami looked to the closed watertight door that gave them privacy how long have we got before the americans attack hawaii again he asked why ask me fuchida replied the americans are the ones who know you can ring up president roosevelt and get the answer straight from him instead of laughing murakami grimaced thats not as funny as it sounds fuchidasan there was a telephone operator who passed on information to the americans by calling california in the middle of the night when no one was paying attention to what she did she will not call california any moreor anywhere else either he spoke with a grim certainty i never heard anything about that fuchida exclaimed you wouldnt its not something were proud of but im telling youin confidence i hope murakami waited fuchidas hai was yes i understand not yes i agree he recognized murakamis ploy the army officer was telling him something he didnt know now murakami hoped to hear something he didnt know bargains often went along routes like that when fuchida said no more than hai murakami sighed we do need this information he said reasonably we have to defend this island toowith our airplanes and with our soldiers if the americans manage to land that was polite what he meant was if the americans smash our carriers since he was aboard one of them he couldnt very well come out and say so commander fuchida also sighed when they build enough so they think they can beat usthen they will come domo arigato murakamis thanks were a small masterpiece of sarcasm and when will that be they have commissionedwe think they have commissionedtwo new fleet carriers as well as some light carriers fuchida answered that was payback for murakamis bit of news up till now the navy had held the information close to its chest by the way the army officers eyes widened it was certainly news to him two he said i knew of one but he in turn surprised fuchida but not so much the yankees hadnt kept quiet about essex maybe they wanted their own people to know they were building ships so they could retaliate theyd been much more secretive about the other big carrier and the smaller ones i think our intelligence is reliable here fuchida said zakennayo murakami muttered two and light carriers how soon will they have more that wasnt quite fearful anticipation in his voice but it came close there i cannot tell you not for certain fuchida did his best not to remember admiral yamamotos worries over how fast the americans could build things once they got fully geared up most experts in japan thought yamamoto an alarmist but he knew the usa welland he was yamamoto one disagreed with him at ones peril what is your best estimate what is the navys best estimate murakami was nothing if not persistent summer fuchida spread his hands dont ask me for anything closer than that murakamisan because i cant give it the army officer looked discontented general yamashita is already assuming summer i was hoping you could tell me more he didnt say i was hoping to win points for myself if you did tell me more but it hovered behind his words please excuse me but i am not a bonz to lay out the future for you fuchida said hoping he hid his irritation will the navy be ready murakami asked that did it fuchida was a patient man but even patience had its limits no of course not he snapped were going to go out against the americans in a couple of rusty old tubs and theyll sink us just like that he snapped his fingers lieutenant colonel murakami turned red he had brains enough to know when hed been given the glove his colleague lieutenant colonel minami was all too likely to have taken fuchida literally all right all right i know youll do your best murakami said but will your best be good enough it always has been so far pride rang in fuchidas voice he was still affronted anyone who doesnt think it will should transfer out of this kingdomwhich wouldnt be a kingdom if the navy didnt know what it was doing murakami blushed again im not going anywhere he said though fuchida had been careful not to challenge his personal courage when the navy officer didnt push it any further murakami went on speaking of being stationed in a kingdom heres something that may amuse you king stanley has asked for some airplanes so hawaii can have an air force as well as an army youre joking fuchida said lieutenant colonel murakami shook his head and thinking about it fuchida wasnt all that surprised king stanley was vain he would be the sort to want a toy air force to go with his toy army fuchida asked what did general yamashita say to that yamashita from everything hed seen had a short fuse but murakami surprised him answering yamashitasan consulted with the foreign ministry and they said to keep the hawaiian happy if he could do it without causing us trouble so king stanley is getting half a dozen of our most decrepit hayabusas the hawaiian air force fuchida had to smile at that he would have screamed bloody murder though if king stanley had demanded zeros as far as he was concerned the hawaiians were welcome to hayabusas the peregrine falcon was the armys chief fighter plane it was even lighter and more maneuverable than the zero but armed with nothing more than a pair of riflecaliber machine guns a sopwith camel rising to fight the red baron in had had just as much firepower handled well a hayabusa gave good service even so he didnt want to criticize the plane to murakami who was not an aviator but he would almost rather have gone up in a sopwith camel murakami was smiling too for reasons of his own do you know what the kings biggest challenge is tell me fuchida urged im all ears finding pilots small enough to be comfortable in the cockpit fuchida did laugh then hawaiians were bigger than japanese as the two sets of guards at iolani palace proved the naval officer said a good thing hes sticking to hawaiians and not using whitesalthough local japanese would solve his problem for him general yamashita suggested that murakami said the king was polite about turning it down but he did he wants hawaiian pilots flying for him he has his pride too no matter how foolish it is i suppose he does fuchida agreed much good pride would do the puppet king of hawaii with or without a few fighter planes to call his own he would go on doing what japan told him to if he didnt if he didnt the kingdom of hawaii would suddenly need a new sovereign anyone who wanted to hold an outdoor ceremony in buffalo in marcheven at the end of marchwas rolling the dice there was a backup plan then had the weather gone south or rather in buffalo gone arctic joe crosetti and his fellow cadets would have received their commissions in the castle an impressivelooking crenellated building in the eastern part of the front the park that nestled up against lake erie the castle as far as joe was concerned had only one thing wrong with it it was the headquarters of the buffalo girl scouts he could hardly imagine a less martial place to become an officer in the us naval reserve but the weatherman cooperated the day dawned bright and sunny the mercury was in the upper forties in san francisco that would have been frigid at noon everybody from less temperate parts of the country kept assuring him it wasnt bad at all since he wore a warm wool uniform he couldnt argue with them too much memorials to buffalo units that had fought in the civil war and the spanishamerican war were scattered over the park they were probably easier to spot at this season of the year than in high summer when leaves would have hidden many of them from view seeing them reminded joe of what he was at last becoming fully a part of so did the tall bronze statue of oliver hazard perry the folding chairs for the ceremony were set up in front of it this is a good place for doing what were doing joe said to orson sharp sharp nodded ill say we have met the enemy and they are ours he quoted joe had forgotten that he suddenly laughed and the enemy he was fighting was england and shes the best friend weve got yeah the young man from utah laughed too and do you remember who his younger brother was afraid not joe admitted hed done okay in history but he hadnt set the world on fire matthew perrythe guy who opened up japan sharp said holy jesus joe said boy he never knew how much he has to answer for did he he should have left it closed that would have saved everybody a lot of trouble places gentlemen places someone called in an officialsounding voice places were in alphabetical order joe sat up near the front his roomie toward the back the mayor of buffalo made a speech praising all the bright young patriots who passed through his city on their way to knocking the stuffing out of the axis it sounded like every other political speech joe had ever heard until his honor pointed to the bridge spanning the niagara river at the north end of the front thats the peace bridge he said this end is in the united states the other end is in canada we want peace all through the world but we will have to win this war before we can get it along with the other cadets joe applauded most of the clapping sounded dutiful joes was a little more than that the mayors words echoed what hed been thinking himself what would oliver perry have made of a peace bridge between the usa and what was still a dominion of the british empire and what would matthew perry have made of a war between the united states and what had been a backward hermit kingdomespecially of a war the japanese looked to be winning at the moment which of the old sea dogs would have been more surprised after the mayor sat down another speaker limped up to the microphone the cadets greeted him with a hand much more heartfelt than the one theyd given his honor lieutenant zachary gunston was a buffalo native like jack hadley hed also been a wildcat pilot in the battle in the north pacific the summer before also like hadley hed had to ditch his fighter and a destroyer had plucked him from the drink he pointed out to the cadets its up to you to carry the ball he said my buddies and i we took it as far as we could go we didnt quite have the machines we needed and we didnt quite have the techniques we needed either youve learned in your training a lot of what we had to find out the hard way your ships will be better your planes will be betteri hear the fighters aboard the new carriers are a long step up from wildcats but in the endhe pointed againits going to be up to you and what youve got inside you we made a mistake gunston went on we figured the japs were patsies pushovers weve been paying for that mistake ever since we made it theyre tougher and smarter than we ever dreamt they could be now its going to be up to you to teach em a lesson no matter how tough they are no matter how smart they are nobody suckerpunches the united states of america and gets away with it nobody am i right or am i wrong right the word came out as a fierce growl from the throat of every graduating cadet joe felt like a dog snarling at another dog on the streetand god help that other sorry mutt too okay then gentlemen i think you are about ready to be commissioned now lieutenant gunston said please rise raise your right hands and repeat the oath after me along with his classmates his squadmates joe crosetti did pride tingled through him if he had to blink rapidly several times to keep tears from forming and running down his face he wasnt the only one beside him another kids eyelids were marching doubletime too when the oath was complete gunston looked out at the brandnew officers welcome to the navy ensigns youve got a big job ahead of you joe looked down at the gold stripe on his sleeve he was as junior an officer as possiblean ensign with no senioritybut he was by god an officer crosetti the fishermans son an officer in the us navy if this wasnt one hell of a country he didnt know what would be congratulations ensign crosetti said that youngster beside joe whod also been blinking he was blond and handsome and looked as if he came from a main line family maybe he did but he wasnt any more an ensign than joe was thanks ensign cooper same to you joe said nobody was ragging on anybody today and who your father was what he did for a living or how big a bankroll he had didnt matter the way it looked to joe that they didnt or shouldnt matter was a big part of what the war was about twisting he looked back towards orson sharp he couldnt see his roomie too many other newly minted officers stood between them guys were starting to move around and find their special friends even when joe did he had trouble seeing past the taller people in his class but he knew about where sharp would be and headed back there sharp was coming up toward him they clasped hands weve been waiting a long time joe saidit seemed like forever since hed volunteered now we get to wait some more the ensign from utah finished for him we have to get a ship we have to get trained up on whatever we fly whether its a wildcat or one of these new jobs lieutenant gunston was talking about and we have to wait till enough carriers are ready to give us the best shot at licking the japanese every word of that was eminently sensible joe liked it no more because of that if anything he liked it less youre no fun he said i know said sharp who laughed at the wetblanket reputation hed had all the way through the training program before too long though the japs will say the same thing yeah joe said watching some of the pilots whod come to hawaii as replacements lieutenant saburo shindo wondered how theyd ever made it out of flight school they had trouble finding haleiwa let alone landing at the airstrip there a few of them might never have made the acquaintance of their airplanes before these flights or so it seemed to shindo when he finally couldnt stand watching any more he got on the telephone to commander fuchida moshimoshi the head of the japanese naval air effort said fuchida here this is shindo fuchidasan what the devils happened to flight school since we went through it mitsuo fuchida laughed not all together comfortably by all ive heard from japan nothing much has happened to it then whats wrong with the chowderheads its turning out shindo demanded plenty of the americans we faced were good pilots we had better planes and that helped a lot but we had better fliers too these people yes a zero is better than a wildcat but its notthat much betternot enough to let these people go up against wildcats with good pilots and hope to beat them theyre about the same as we were when we got out of flight school fuchida said no shindo denied the mere possibility but fuchida said hai the difference shindosan is that we had plenty of combat experience against the chinese and the russians who flew for them before we took on the americans we were veterans we were ready shindo thought about it had he been that green when he left the flight school at kasumigaura he didnt want to believe it hed certainly thought he knew what he was doing of course so did these gaswasting idiots maybe he said most grudgingly with some experience theyll do fine fuchidas voice was soothing and remember the yankees have taken worse combat losses than we have if they come at us theyll have more inexperienced pilots in the air than we do i suppose so shindo still wasnt happy have you seen these new ones though they havent had much time up there and they sure fly like it fuel still must be tighter than a mouses asshole back in the home islands eryes fuchida a straitlaced sort made heavy going of the comparison he continued it shouldnt be with the dutch east indies in our hands thats why we fought the war in the first place if the problem isnt fuel the programs gone to the dogs shindo said its as simple as that i tell you some of these people arent ready to fly combat missions against pilots who know what theyre doing get them as ready as you can shindosan and do it as fast as you can too fuchida said things are stirring in the united states the yankees keep launching new carriers and theyre supposed to be getting new fighters too youre full of good news today shindo said where are our new fighters fuchida didnt answer that shindo knew why too the replacement for the zero had been on the drawing boards for a couple of years it seemed unlikely to come off the drawing boards any time soon the army was starting to get a new fighter the hien with an engine based on the one that powered the german me was a much tougher plane than the hayabusa but it was also much less reliable needed skilled mechanicsalways in short supplyto keep it running and was available in much smaller numbers than the older machine one thing that will give the new pilots flight time is antisubmarine patrolling fuchida said the more enemy boats we can sink the better off we are you know that i know something about it shindo said despite the sub hed sunk the yankees hadnt left hawaiian waters they kept on with their part of the war as if nothing had happened americans owned more stubbornness and more courage than shindo or most japanese had expected all we can do about this is the best we can fuchida said i constantly work with the destroyer skippers so they can do a better job of attacking the american boats the problem is not easy ask the americans themselves or the british if you dont believe me they have it in the atlantic i have more urgent things to worry aboutlike why my socalled replacement pilots arent as good as they ought to be shindo said and another one occurs to me too when the americans try again theyre going to throw more ships and planes at us than they did last time neh commander fuchida was silent for a moment i dont know that for a fact he answered cautiously when he did speak shindo gave him a scornful snort i dont know it for a fact either but its the way to bet eh yes probably fuchida admitted all rightwere thinking the same way then shindo said when we came to hawaii we hit with everything we had the americans didnt the last time and it cost them it was three carriers against three last time we only have two in these waters now if they bring more than three two may not be enough when do the reinforcements come and how many will there be mitsuo fuchida was silent quite a bit longer this time well thats not such an easy question to answer shindosan with another snort shindo said im afraid you just did things are difficult fuchida sounded defensive not a good sign the americans in australia are bombing the southern coast of new guinea as heavily as they can and the british are kicking up their heels in the indian ocean admiral nagumos raid a year ago didnt clear them out of there they bombed rangoon and even singapore not long ago i hadnt heard that shindo said we dont go out of our way to advertise it fuchida said shindo grunted the other officer went on but what it boils down to is our carrier forces are stretched thinner than we wish they were wonderful shindo said sardonically the americans are building new carriers as fast as they can arent they he didnt wait for an answer not that fuchida tried to deny it instead not trying to hide his anger he plowed ahead where the devil are our new carriers fuchidasan weve launched taiho fuchida told him shes supposed to be a step up from shokaku and zuikaku a step up from japans newest strongest fleet carriers would make taiho a formidable ship indeed but launching a carrier and putting her into action were two different things as shindo knew only too well when will we be able to get some use out of her he asked unhappily fuchida answered early next year i hear wonderful shindo said again with even more sarcasm than before all right then let me ask a different question sir when do we get zuikaku back its been a long time since she limped off to the home islands to get fixed up now there i really do have good news fuchida said she is ready to return to duty now well finethat is good news took them long enough but it is shindo agreed so we still have the same six fleet carriers that started the war plus a few light carriers for small change what can the yankees throw at us he refused to count taiho she would be worth somethingwith luck worth a lotlater on but not yet they have hornet if shes been repaired by now they have ranger they have wasp they also have some light carriers and they have whatever new fleet carriers theyve built we are just about certain of two shindo brightened thats better than i thought they have two oceans to cover too but the british help them in the atlantic and cause us trouble in the indian ocean fuchida said this is a world war shindosan and their advantage is that they can join hands theres too much space between us and germany to make that easy on our side hai shindo said the germans had managed to get their fancy aircraft engine and the drawings that went with it to japan by submarine such ventures were all too rare though while america and england might have been in bed with each other shindo sighed if only the russians had gone down yes if fuchida said heavily that seemed unlikely to happen now for a while there after the disaster at stalingrad it had looked as if germany would go down instead but the germans were nothing if not resilient theyd stabilized the front and even regained a lot of ground that fight had a long way to go it remained up in the air even so the quick german victory on which japan had pinned so many hopes was nothing but a pipe dream and while germany and russia remained locked in a death embrace russia and japan were neutral that created all kinds of ironies russian freighters from vladivostok freely crossed the pacific to the west coast of the usa even though japan and america battled to see who would dominate the ocean japan did nothing to interfere with those ships when they got to seattle or san francisco or los angeles they took on american planes and tanks and trucks and munitions the russians would use against germany japans ally then they sailed back across the pacific and japan still did nothing to interfere it was a strange business it was also one for which shindo had no taste he went back to the things over which he did have some control fuchidasan can you get me some extra fuel up here i dont know fuchida answered cautiously why do you need it i want to take these puppies up and let them get some practice dogfighting me shindo answered once they see i can shoot them down whenever i please or near enough theyll start to realize they dont know everything there is to know that would be good fuchida said i cant promise you anythingyou know how tight the gasoline situation is but ill try we cant fight the americans if we dont have the gas to train our pilots shindo said yes i understand that fuchida replied but we cant fight them if we dont have the gas to get our planes off the ground either the more we use beforehand the less were liable to have when we need it most this is no way to fight a war shindo said commander fuchida didnt contradict him fuchida said nothing to reassure him either in jim petersons military education hed never learned the difference between dry beriberi and wet somehow the instructors at annapolis hadnt thought either kind important enough to put on the curriculum that only went to show they hadnt realized slowly starving to death might form part of a naval officers career only goes to show what a bunch of ignorant bastards they were peterson thought as he lay in the miserable bamboo hut in the kalihi valley it was raining of course it was raining as far as peterson could see it always rained in the valley the roof leaked since the japs didnt let the pows use anything but leaves to cover it and didnt give them much time even to put on more leaves that wasnt the worlds hottest headline either looking around he had no trouble telling the wet beriberi cases from the dry men who had wet beriberi retained fluid they swelled up in a grotesque and horrible parody of good health swollen or not though they were starving too prisoners with dry beriberi by contrast had a lean and hungry look like mine peterson thought through his usual haze of exhaustion the pins and needles in his hands and feet were redhot fishhooks and spikes the really alarming thing was he could have been worse off when cholera went through the camp a few weeks earlier he hadnt caught it hed buried some of the dark shrunken corpses of men who hadafter he put in his usual shift at the tunnel of course cholera killed with horrifying speed you could be normal in the morningwell as normal as pows got which wasnt veryand shriveled and dead by the afternoon one nice thing cholera scared the japs too several guards had died just as fast as any prisoners beriberi by contrast didnt bother them at all why should it they had plenty to eat and the right kind of food not just a starvation diet of boiled white rice and not much else peterson looked around hoping to spot a gecko pows ate the little lizards whenever they could catch them sometimes they roasted them over little fires more often they didnt bother when you were in the kind of shape they were in raw meat was as precious as any other kind you know what gordy braddon asked from beside peterson the tennessean was as skinny as he was with knees wider than his thighs a nasty abscess ulcerated one calf pretty soon the medical officer would have to cut it out to keep it from going gangrenous a puckered red scar on petersons leg showed where hed gone through that ether chloroform the japs had them they laughed when the medical officers asked for some the medical officers were lucky to get iodine let alone anything more tell me peterson said after a while beriberi sapped the will as well as debilitating the body sometimes even conversation seemed more trouble than it was worth were gonna leave one man dead for every foot of tunnel we drive braddon said peterson contemplated that again he took his time he couldnt help taking his timehis wits wouldnt work fast no matter how much he wanted them to one man he said after the slow calculations were complete were liable to leave five or ten men dead for every foot of tunnel his companion in misery took his own sweet time thinking about that wouldnt be surprised he said at last god damn walter london to hell and gone yeah even in his present decrepit state peterson didnt need to think that over before he agreed with it he managed a graveyard chuckle well you know what the japs say always prenty plisoner at the rate pows were dying in the kalihi valley he wondered how long there would be plenty of prisoners of course this place was specifically designed to use them up a lot of men who went into the everdeepening tunnel shaft lasted only a few days the ones who managed to get past that dreadful initiation to life here did betterif survival was better which didnt always strike peterson as obvious all i want is to be alive when we take this goddamn place back braddon said reckon i get to pay these sons of bitches back then for what they owe me yeah thats what keeps me going too peterson agreed sometimes the idea of getting my own back is about the only thing that does keep me going he wondered whether the usa would be able to take hawaii back when hed been in the pow camp up near opana and the ordinary labor gangs hed had some connection with the outside world part of what he got was jap propaganda of course but not everything was here and there people had clandestine radio sets and heard the other side of the news not in the kalihi valley the japs hardly bothered with propaganda here because they didnt think the poor damned souls working on the tunnel were ever coming out if any of the prisoners had a radio no news from it had ever got to jim petersons ear he started to settle down for sleep a thrashing in the bushes made him pause a furious grunting made him scramble to his feet braddon jumped up too so did men in worse shape than either of them so did men in worse shape than either of them whod been sunk deep in exhausted sleep that grunting meant a wild pig was out there if they could catch it if they could kill it they could eat it the mere thought of a chunk of pork drove jim peterson harder than any japanese taskmasters bamboo club pigs did wander into the camp every once in a while looking for garbageor maybe looking to dig up bodies buried in shallow graves and do unto humans what humans were in the habit of doing unto them the pows had pigstickersbamboo spears with points made from iron smuggled out of the tunnel they hid them in the jungle if the guards found them they confiscated them and beat everybody in the nearest barracks to the guards anything that could stick a pig could also stick one of them the guards werent wrong either peterson dreamt of spearing a couple of them only the certain knowledge of what would happen to him and everybody else if he tried stayed his hand he grabbed a spear now and plunged into the dripping emerald jungle in the direction of the grunting before he got there it rose to a furious squealing for christs sake dont let it get away he shouted and ran harder than ever he found where the pig was by almost falling over it it was a boar as nasty a razorback as ever roamed the hills in arkansas two men had already driven spears into it and hung on to them for dear life a boars tushes could rip the guts out of a man almost as well as a bayonet could and a wild pig was faster and stronger than a jap with an arisaka peterson thrust his spear into the boars side much more by luck than by design the pointwhich had started its career at the end of a pickpierced the pigs heart the beast let out a last grunt one that seemed more startled than pained and fell over dead my god peterson panted meat the boar was almost as scrawny as the prisoners whod slain it hunger must have made it chance the camp just as the pows hunger had made them attack it more men ran up behind peterson by camp custom the prisoners whod done the actual killing got first crack at the carcass also by camp custom they took less than they might haveenough to fill their bellies once no moreand left the rest for their comrades who hadnt been quite so fast or quite so lucky peterson toasted his chunk of meat over a small fire he wolfed it down charred on the outside and bloodrareclose enough to raw to make no differenceinside in happier times people warned against pork that wasnt cooked all the way through they talked about trichinosis he couldnt have cared less he would have eaten that pig knowing it had died of the black plague his stomach made astonished and astonishing noises it wasnt used to such wealth he had to gulp against nausea once or twice meat was rich fare after rice and nowhere near enough of it for a little while the pins and needles in his extremities would ebb some of the men with wet beriberi would lose a little fluid from their limbs and from their lungs their hearts wouldnt race quite so hard whenever they had to move and then until the next time a pig got desperate or unlucky enough to fall foul of the pows things would go back to the way theyd been before you couldnt win the most you could do was stretch the game out a little by god ive done that he muttered he slept better than he had in weeks too soon though his next shift came it would have been killing work even with all the food he wanted all the time as things were as things were by the time he finished he wondered whether hed stretched the game at alland if he had whether hed done himself any favors jane armitage weeded her turnips and potatoes with painstaking care weeds grew as enthusiastically as everything else in hawaii she chopped and dug and chopped and dug and didnt notice tsuyoshi nakayama coming up behind her till he spoke oh hello she said hoping she didnt sound as startled as she felt what can i do for you nakayama might have been a gardener before hawaii changed hands he was still a gardener in fact and a damn good one but because he was major hirabayashis liaison man he was also a major power in wahiawa these days you had to be careful around him you dont have husband do you he asked now ice avalanched along janes spine had somebody else seen fletch had somebody ratted on her to the japs could you trust anybody at all these days it sure didnt seem that way im not married she said firmly and thanked heaven shed taken off her wedding ring as soon as she threw fletch out of the apartment it would have made a liar of her on the spot you dont have husband even in the army yosh nakayama persisted im not married jane said again and the divorce would have been final by nowwould have been final long sinceif everything in hawaii hadnt gone to hell the second the japs came ashore you sure nakayama said im sure if she had to shed show him the papers she did have they ought to be convincing enough even if the final interlocutory decree hadnt been formally granted she wondered why they called it that it was the decree that meant people werent interlocked any more the gardener who was also righthand man to the occupiers local commandant grunted if that wasnt an inscrutable noise jane had never heard one nakayama said maybe you should be careful for a while you have family you can go to jane shook her head i just moved here a few years ago she wished she could have the words back they didnt quite scream that shed come to wahiawa as part of a military family but that was the way to bet another grunt from yosh nakayama you go somewhere else for a while honolulu waimea anywhere she had no travel documents she thought about what was likely to happen if she ran into a column of jap soldiers when she didntor even when she did more ice formed under her skin im staying right here he sighed this time instead of grunting if i get you papers will you go if she left she would have to walk the thought shed had a moment before came back how much good would papers do her no thanks mr nakayama she said hed never been mr nakayama before the war if she talked to him at all then she called him yosh how could it be otherwise she was a white woman after all and he was just a jap now she knew how it could be otherwise she knew all right and wished she didnt yosh nakayama let out another sigh she had the feeling he was washing his hands of her but no for he said you change your mind you let me know right away right away you hear yes mr nakayama before the war she would have added chopchop pidgin for pronto never mind that nakayama didnt use pidgin but real englishslow sometimes clumsy but real english she would have said it just to keep him in his place in her mind and in his he shrugged his broad shoulders now he must have known she didnt intend to do anything of the sort off he went shaking his head she returned to weeding but the worm of worry wouldnt leave hed been trying to tell her something whatever it was she hadnt got the message the next morning she was about to go out to the vegetable plot again when someone knocked on the door she opened itand found herself facing three japanese soldiers two privates and a noncom youjane armitage in the noncoms mouth her name was barely comprehensible she thought about denying it but decided she couldnt yes what is it he spoke in japanese the two privates lunged with their bayonets the points stopping inches from her face she yelped and hopped back you come the sergeant said jane yelped again i havent done anything fletch god help me they must know about fletch you come the jap repeated maybe he didnt understand what she said maybemore likelyhe didnt care since the other choice was getting killed on the spot jane came the japanese soldiers marched her about four blocks to another apartment building one that had stood empty since wahiawa fell now it had bars on the windows and guards out in front a sign in japanese said something jane couldnt read three or four other parties of japanese soldiers were also coming up to the place each of them had a woman with it all the women were in their twenties or thirties all but one were white the other was chinese all of them were prettier than average a horrid suspicion flowered in jane what is this place she demanded you come the noncom pointed to the front door hed used just about all the english he had the soldiers prodded her with the bayonets she didnt think they drew blood but she didnt think they would hesitateat anythingif she balked either she took an involuntary step they prodded her again and she went inside eight or ten more women already crowded the lobby along with an equal number of soldiers to make sure they didnt go anywhere janes fear grew maybe this didnt have anything to do with fletch after all but that wasnt necessarily good news oh no not even a little bit yosh was trying to warn me sweet jesus he told me to get lost and i didnt listen to him and what was she liable to get for being stupid in the old days theyd called this a fate worse than death to her the phrase had always been one from bad melodrama now suddenly she understood just what it meant it wasnt so far wrong after all she looked around at her companions in misery about half looked as terrified as she felt they had to be the ones whod added things up the same way she had the others just seemed confused ignorance here was liable to be blissbut not for long one of the japs in the crowded lobby was a lieutenant she didnt remember seeing before you will listen to me he said in very good english it is not ah convenient for japanese soldiers in this part of oahu to travel to honolulu for comfort and relaxation so we set up a comfort house here you are chosen to man this house his english might be good but it wasnt perfect manning wasnt what the japs had in mind for them what they did have in mind nobody could keep any illusions any more the women started screaming and cursing and telling the lieutenant no in terms as certain as they could make them he let them yell for a minute or two then spoke in japanese to the soldiers by him they raised their rifles as one man they chambered a round those sharp clicks pierced the din like a steak knife cutting tender bloodrare prime rib even at that dreadful moment food came to the forefront of janes thoughts enough the officer said if you do this you will be well fed the term of service will be six months you will not be liable again if you do not he shrugged if you do not you will be persuaded id rather die one of the women shouted she got the words out only a split second before jane would have with another shrug the lieutenant barked an order in his own language two soldiers handed their rifles to other men then grabbed the woman threw her down on the floor and started beating and kicking her her screams and those of the other women filled the lobby the japanese seemed altogether indifferent they knew what they were doing too they inflicted the most pain they could with the least real damage when they finished the woman lay there crumpled and sobbing but not too badly hurt she was an object lesson and a frighteningly good one after yet another order the soldiers started taking women out of the lobby one by one some screamed and had hysterics the japs ignored that some tried to fight the soldiers didnt put up with any nonsense they grabbed the womens hands if that didnt do the job or if the women tried to kick they beat them into submission they didnt seem particularly malicious about it they might have been dealing with restive horses when it came to be janes turn she did her best to boot one of the japs right in the balls her face must have given her away because he laughed and hopped back and left her looking like a rockette with her foot way up in the air a second later his buddy punched her in the jaw had it been a prizefight the referee would have stopped it and called it a tko she didnt fall down and she didnt pass out but everything went blurry for a while after that when the japs hustled her along her feet walked her will her witsthey were somewhere far away she came back to herself sitting at the edge of a bed in a room with bars on the window i have to get out of here she thought and hurried to the door she was a little wobbly and the side of her face hurt like hell but she stayed on her pins the door opened when she thumbed the latch she hadnt been sure it would but japanese soldiers in the hallway leered at her when she stuck her head out no way in hell she could get by them she ducked back in a hurry down the hall a woman started to scream and then another a black choking cloud of fear filled jane i have to get away she thought again what she thought she had to do and what she could do though were two horribly different things shed just had the bright idea of using the bed for a barricade when the door opened too late again just as shed been too late figuring out what yosh nakayama was trying to tell her in strode the lieutenant who spoke english i decided i would start you out myself he said as if she ought to be honored why jane whispered we need comfort women he answered and i liked your looks he took a step toward her lets get it over with neh then you will know what you have to do no jane said but it wasnt no she screamed too adding to the chorus that had to make this building sound like one of the nastier suburbs of hell she did her best to fight too again her best was nowhere near good enough she took another shot to the jaw this time things did gray out for a little while she came back to herself with her jeans on the floor and the jap pumping away between her legs that hurt toothe pain was probably what brought her back he didnt care if she screamed but he slapped her when she tried to punch him a minute or a lifetime later he grunted and shuddered and briskly pulled out of her not bad he said getting to his feet and briskly doing up his trousers no not bad at all jane lay huddled on the bed why she asked again what did i ever do to you you are the enemy he answered you are the enemy and you have lost you do not ask why after that happens it is part of war he reached out and swatted her bare backside maybe i will see you again away he went as pleased with himself as any man is afterwards she lay there trying to decide whether she wanted to kill every jap in the world or just kill herself when the door opened again she gasped in horror and reached down with futile hands to try to cover herself but the soldier who came in although he stared and laughed only stared and laughed he carried a tray probably stolen from the elementaryschool cafeteria he set it down on the floor and went out dully jane eyed it it held more food and better food than shed seen in months the jap lieutenant hadnt lied about that for a little while jane didnt think she could eat she wanted to throw up no matter what her mind wanted she saw rice and vegetables in front of her almost without conscious thought she found herself eating the plate emptied in what seemed the blink of an eye the wages of sin are lunch she thought which went a long way toward telling her how punchy she was food even came ahead of putting her pants back on she was just starting to reach for the jeans when a noncom walked into the room he laughed to find her half dressed and gestured that she should lie down on the bed again no she said even though he carried a bamboo stick like the ones the jap guards used when they wanted to hurt pows but didnt want to kill them im not going to just give it to you maybe he spoke a little english maybe the look on her face told him she wouldnt cooperate either way he did what he wanted to do he whacked her with the stick again and again she tried to grab it but she couldnt she screamed but he ignored her when she did her best to knee him in the crotch he twisted to take it on the hip and slapped her in the face before long no matter how she fought he was in her slamming away to please himself without the faintest thought for her as anything but a piece of meat when she thought he was distracted she tried to bite him without missing a stroke he jerked his shoulder back her teeth clicked on empty air he smacked her again and came in the same instant out of the room he went whistling one of the japs unmusical tunes jane lay on her back his seed dribbling out of her onto the sheet if she fought every man who came in here shed be dead in nothing flat part of her said that would be for the best but she didnt want to die she wanted to live till the americans came back and then to have her revenge if she just lay there and let them have her maybe they wouldnt hit her but could she do that without losing her mind she had no idea of anything just then except how many places she hurt and how disgusted with life she was god damn you yosh she muttered why didnt you tell me what they wanted me for hed probably been too embarrassed to come out and say it middleaged local japanese were downright victorian but why oh why oh why hadnt she taken the hint and lit out for the tall timber oscar van der kirk paced his crowded little apartment like a tiger going back and forth in its cage for gods sake will you cut that out susie higgins said youre making me nervous he did stopfor about thirty seconds then he was going back and forth again somethings happened to charlie he said susie rolled her blue blue eyes how can you tell she said in tones obviously intended for sweet reason hes a surf bum hes even more of a surf bum than you are he doesnt know today what hell do tomorrowand he doesnt care either if he disappears for a few days or a few weeks so what maybe hes gone up to the north shore again or something not now oscars dismissal of that was altogether automatic itll be flatter than a pancake up there this time of year then hes got some other harebrained scheme going instead oscar shook his head i dont think so we were supposed to go out together this morning but he didnt show you can count on charlie if he says hell be somewhere hell be there maybe a shark ate him maybe one did oscar answered you can joke you dont go out there like i do it doesnt happen very often but it happens or maybe the japs got him susie snorted why would the japs want a halfbreed surfrider for crying out loud get serious he didnt answer he could think of some reasons hed had an encounter with an american sub skipper out there on the pacific maybe charlie kaapu had too or with the crew of a flying boat or who could tell oscar had never said a word to anybodysusie emphatically includedabout his meeting if charlie had any brains he would have kept his yap shut too the fewer people you told the fewer people could blab living under the japs had taught the people of hawaii what living under the nazis taught the people of france keeping your head down not drawing the occupiers notice was a damn good idea charlie didnt even tell me anything if there was anything to tell oscar thought that hurt his feelings even though hed just gone through all the reasons keeping quiet was a good idea and even though he hadnt told charlie about the sub logic none at all at least he could laugh at himself for realizing it susie was studying him shed never been to collegehe wasnt sure shed finished high schoolbut she was better at reading people than he was youve got that knightinshiningarmor look on your face again she said dont do anything dumb oscar you can end up dead easy me dont be silly he laugheduneasily some knight im just a surf bum myselfyou said so besides when did you ever see that look on me before when you took me in susie answered oh i knew what you wanted fair enoughthats the knights reward but a lot of people wouldnt have wanted to go on with it when things got tough you did you walked out on me he reminded her that wasnt on account of the japs we were driving each other squirrely susie said which was true she sent him a sidelong look but charlie cant give you what i couldor hed better not be able to anyway his cheeks heated as much in anger as in embarrassment he was no fairy if susie didnt have reason to know that her eyes sparkled shed wanted to get under his skin and she had but he wasnt going to write charlie off just because shed annoyed him stubbornly he said hes my buddy darn it i was going to go round his place see if anybody knows anything thats all safe as houses and then you wake up susie said which sounded a hell of a lot more caustic than yeah sure she looked at him again im not going to be able to talk you out of it am i she shook her head no of course im not you do have that look well for christs sake be as careful as you can you fool he managed a lopsided grin you say the sweetest things babe i didnt know you cared to his surprisehell to his amazementshe turned red this time damn you oscar sometimes youre an even bigger blockhead than usual she muttered he almost asked her what the devil she was talking about but he had the feeling that would be letting her win so he kept quiet when they went to bed that night she reached for him before he could reach for her she slid down and took him in her mouth till he was close to exploding then straddled him and rode him like a racehorse by the time she finished he thought hed just won the kentucky derby she leaned forward to give him a kiss her breasts pressing softly against his chest wow he said sincerely youve got something to remember me by anyway she said in case i never happen to see you again ill be fine he said susie squeezed him and didnt answer shed already given him her opinion when morning came she was out the door before him her job had regular hours which hed always despised and she had to get over to honolulu while he only needed to wander over to the shabby part of waikiki tourists jammed hard against the beach didnt think waikiki had any shabby parts the farther inland you went though charlies apartment building made oscars seem like the royal hawaiian hotel on the mainland stray dogs would have been sniffing at garbage on the corners in this kind of neighborhood here theyd probably been caught and cooked and eaten he didnt see any anyhow a woman who looked as if she worked on hotel street came out of the building hey oscar called to her you seen charlie any time lately who wants to know she eyed him oh its you you hang around with him maybe youre okay she stayed cagey though how come you wanna know he owes me a bottle of okolehao oscar answered which wasnt true but was plausible with liquor imports from the mainland cut off the stuff distilled from ti root was the best hooch around and correspondingly important you would want to find out about somebody who owed it to you yeah the woman said oscar knew what that hungry tone of voice meant she wondered if it was still in charlies apartment but her shoulders slumped as she went on i aint seen him since the cops took him away night before last plainly she figured that if the cops had him they had his okolehao too oscar would have bet the same way the cops he said what do the cops want with charlie if you know him you know he wouldnt hurt a fly that wasnt a hundred percent true when charlie had a few too many hed get into bar fights but even those were on the friendly side hed never ground a broken bottle into anybodys face or anything like that oscar didnt think hed ever gone to jail for one i dont know whats going on i just mind my business the woman dripped righteousness by the way her eyes darted now here now there she also minded other peoples business every chance she got she said maybe he couldnt pay his rent nah they just throw your stuff out on the street then oscar spoke from experience besides he catches fish way things are now thats a heck of a lot better than money beats me the woman shrugged i gotta go buddy they come down on me like you wouldnt believe if im late away she went hips working under her short dress cops oscar scratched his head were they doing the japs work for them or had charlie really gone and got himself in that kind of trouble it didnt seem like him but how could you be sure one way would be to go down to the police station and ask if you could bail him out if the cops said yes that would tell oscar some of what he needed to find out if on the other hand they said no in that case oscar was liable to buy himself the same kind of trouble his friend had whatever that was he remembered susies warning he alsowarmlyremembered her goodbye present did he want to take the chance of finding out what had happened to charlie it boiled down to would charlie take the chance for him he knew the answer to that as soon as he formed the question waikikis police station was small and run down the desk sergeant was a hapahawaiian who even in these hard times seemed to overflow his chair oscar didnt suppose cops missed many meals no matter what if a local japanese were on duty there he didnt know what he would have done but he did dare ask a man of charlie kaapus blood what had happened to him the sergeant didnt answer right away he looked atlooked throughoscar file cards riffled behind his impassive dark eyes he no doubt knew who oscar was and that oscar and charlie ran around together he might have needed to remind himself of that but he knew he said theyve taken him to honolulu his voice rough from years of two packs a day revealed nothing why would they want to do that oscar didnt have to fake astonishment whats he done what do they think hes done it cant be anything muchyou know charlie dont you sure the cop looked through him again you want to spring him right well of course i do oscar answered hes my pal can i bail him out im not broke by the way the sergeant touched his pocket he was going for cigarettes that werent there how many times had he made that gesture since hawaii fell from his sour expression quite a few bail him out he said i dont know about that it ah isnt only the police that are interested in him who else oscar knew hed better sound naive as if the idea were just occurring to him he said the uh japanese hed better not say japs around somebody who worked with them and for all practical purposes for them thats right hes been poking into places where he doesnt belong sounds like the policeman said so you can go there but his voice trailed away hed made the same calculation oscar had before oscar shivered thanks sergeant he said and left the station in a hurry into honolulu into honolulu he decided and started west his knees werent knocking but he didnt know why not he was scared green he and charlie had got caught in the crossfire between invading japs and americans right at the start of the war hed jumped into trenches when bombs fell not nearly far enough away going after his friend now though was consciously brave so this is what courage feels like he thought not letting anybody even me see how frightened i am maybe it would be all right honolulus police chief still doing his job under the japs had come out from california not too long before the war to shape up a corrupt force and hed done it the assistant chief was a fullblooded hawaiian cops came from every piece in the jigsaw puzzle of nations that made up hawaii but if the occupiers said hop the cops had to make like frogs the main station wasnt far from honolulu hale the city hall typewriters clattered as oscar went inside he wondered how the police got new ribbons or if theyd figured out a way to reink old ones by his looks the desk sergeant here was at least hapaoriental japanese chinese korean oscar wasnt sure the mans voice didnt give anything away as he asked what do you want buddy youve got a friend of mine in jail oscar said the sergeant raised an interrogative eyebrow not another muscle on his face moved reluctantly oscar named charlie kaapu that eyebrow jumped again higher this time oscar wondered if the desk sergeant would yell for help or if hed just pull a gun and hold oscar himself but all he said was sorry you cant have him how come i couldnt believe he got jugged hes the nicest guy youd ever want to meet what do they think he did anyway instead of answering the sergeant asked a question of his own mac you ever hear of the kempeitai oscar shook his head nope what is it japanese secret police and now im going to do you the biggest favor anybody ever did im not gonna ask you who you are get the hell out of here before i change my mind oscar got once he was out of the station he turned several corners as fast as he could in case the sergeant did send police after him but there was no sign of that oscar shivered he hadnt learned much about winter in california or heresusie laughed at how ignorant he was but winter winter unquestioned dwelt in him now the kempeitai the name wasnt chilling the way say the gestapo wasat least not to oscar butsecret police it was bound to be the same kind of outfit and it had charlie what had he done what did they think hed done what can i do to get him away oscar wondered miserably anything at all corporal takeo shimizu had just fallen asleep when an airraid alarm bounced him from his cot wearing the thin cotton shirt and breech clout in which hed gone to bed he grabbed the rest of his uniform and his shoes and ran for the trenches outside the barracks hall the yankee marauders probably wouldnt come close but nobody got old taking stupid chances antiaircraft guns started going off there were more of them in honolulu these days than there had been there needed to be more for the americans came over the cityand over oahu generallymore often than they had machine guns started hammering too tracers scribed iceblue and yellow arcs across the sky through the din of gunfire shimizu heard the deep growl of a flying boats engines and then the roar of bombs going off twenty minutes went by before the allclear sounded the guns had fired for most of that time though the american plane was surely long gone shrapnel pattered down out of the sky it might end up doing almost as much damage as the bombs muttering in annoyance shimizu went back to bed he hadnt been sleeping long before the airraid sirens screeched again zakennayo he said furiously why doesnt the baka yaro in charge make up his mind he found out why in short order more us aircraft were in the sky one or two hit honolulu while a couple of others caused a commotion at pearl harbor that meant another fireworks display off to the west what he wanted to see instead of more fireworks was a flying boat going down in flames he didnt get what he wanted after the usual delay he did get to go back to bed an hour and a half later a third wave of american planes came over honolulu by then he was so tired he wanted to stay in the barracks even though the building would fall down on him if it got hit shouts from officers got him moving shouts from him helped get the men moving huddling in the trench yasuo furusawa said they want to keep us from sleeping they know how to get what they want dont they shimizu growled the americans werent doing a lot of damage they couldnt not coming over in handfuls but they had all the japanese in honolulumaybe all the japanese on oahujumping around like fleas on a hot griddle he wondered if yet another set of us aircraft would hit honolulu just before dawn none did but a nervous gunner not far from the barracks opened up on something apparently imaginary the gunfire didnt wake shimizu shards of steel crashing down on the roof did he went to sleep again after that too which proved he was made of sternand very tiredstuff getting up at dawn did nothing to improve his mood the tea he gulped with his breakfast of rice and pickled plums didnt do nearly enough to pry his eyelids apart he couldnt get more either it came from the home islands which meant it was in short supply that he could have any at all meant a freighter must have made it in not long before only officers got all they wanted some officers shared the precious stuff with their men using it as a reward for duty well performed unfortunately neither shimizus platoon leader nor company commander seemed to have thought of that it was going to be a sleepy stupid day his squad dragged too even shiro wakuzawa who ordinarily was perky as you please dragged and slumped he said if the americans do that every night theyll drive us crazy they cant do it every night as usual senior private furusawa sounded surer of himself than his rank gave him any right to be why not shimizu said and yawned theyve been doing it more and more lately furusawa yawned too but politely turned his head away from his superior before he did but they need submarines to refuel their flying boats he said they dont have planes that can make a round trip from their mainland to hawaii even ours have trouble and theyre better how did you hear all that shimizu demanded i listen a lot i keep my head down i keep my ears open people who know things like to blab i suppose so shimizu wasnt sure he would understand things even if he heard them he was just a farmers son furusawa a city man had the education to make sense of what came his way so why are you commanding him and not the other way around shimizu wondered but that had an answer he understood experience and toughness mattered more in rank than education did still educationor maybe just raw brainsalso came in handy for three or four nights american flying boats stayed away but then they returned little wave after little wave disrupting the lives of the japanese stationed in and around honolulu shimizu really started to hate them then he had a certain amount of trouble not hating senior private furusawa too commander minoru genda stepped up over the steel doorsill and into the cabin that belonged to akagis skipper saluting he said reporting as ordered sir and then congratulations on your promotion rear admiral tomeo kaku bowed in his chair thank you very much he said even his hard features unable to hide his pleasure why dont you shut the door and then sit down i have news you need to know asking genda to close the cabin off from the corridor meant it was secret news excitement and curiosity building in him he obeyed he wanted to sit on the edge of the seat but deliberately sat back making himself seem relaxed evenespeciallyif he wasnt keeping his voice as casual as he could he asked whats up sir zuikaku is finally on her way back to these waters kaku answered sounding pleased with himself and with the world the decoded message came to me not ten minutes ago youre the first to know domo arigato genda bowed more deeply than his superior had im very glad to hear it about time too if you dont mind my saying so they took longer repairing her than they should have i agree admiral kaku said ive growled and fussed and fumed more times than i can tell you and its done me no good at all shigata ga nai genda nodded at thatsome things couldnt be helped kaku continued but shes on her way at last and shell be here in a couple of weeks id hoped they would send us taiho too but they say shell be shaking down for months yet with a shrug he repeated shigata ga nai too bad sir we could use her genda sighed everything hed heard about taiho said how much they could use her here among other improvements she boasted an armored flight decka first for a japanese carrierthat was supposed to protect her vitals from a kg bomb genda added we could use any more carriers they want to send us big or small the americans are definitely getting friskier i dont know what youre talking about kaku said deadpan he was so perfectly deadpan in fact that genda started to believe him then akagis skipper yawned a yawn that threatened to split his face in two the americans nuisance raids were more than a nuisance for him the carrier anchored at different places in pearl harbor every night to give the us flying boats a harder time finding and hitting her so far it had worked shed taken only incidental damage from near misses but admiral kaku had to be up on the bridge whenever she was threatened he wasnt a young man that lack of sleep must take a toll on him its not just here either genda said theyre starting to attack our picket boats every chance they get yes ive heard that too now kaku sounded serious and not at all happy they think they can clear them out and give themselves a better chance for surprise thats how it looks to me sir genda also thought the americans might be right japan sent out new sampans when old ones were lost but there were always delays and foulups the americans might be able to build a lane through which they could get ships close to hawaii undetected ive talked with commander fuchida hes talked with the people who handle our hks admiral kaku said we will have flyingboat patrols to cover the area no matter what we wont get caught napping thats good sir genda agreed and the more radar sets we can get our hands on the better they can see farther than the naked eye can i suppose so all these gadgets kaku said fretfully it wasnt like this when my career started out let me tell you in those days you really had to be able to see the enemy to hit him none of this business of sending airplanes over the horizon to drop bombs on his head yes sir ive heard admiral yamamoto say the same thing genda hoped that would keep his superior happy the difference was that kaku sounded nostalgic for days gone by while isoroku yamamoto always lived in the presentwhen he wasnt looking into the future of course there was only one yamamoto which was why he commanded the combined fleet men like kaku were absolutely necessary but were also easier to come by admiral yamamoto akagis skipper echoed musingly if it werent for admiral yamamoto we wouldnt be where we are now that was true of course it was also true that the japanese wouldnt have been where they were if not for genda himself he was the one whod persuaded yamamoto to follow the air strike against oahu with an invasion rear admiral kaku seemed unlikely to be in a position to know that he went on i wonder if we would be better off if we hadnt landed we wouldnt be stuck at the end of such a long supply line anyhow hai genda said and let it go at that as soon as he could he excused himself and went out onto the flight deck he found he needed fresh air even now the waters of pearl harbor stank of fuel oil spilled in the attack a year and a half earlier its rainbow gleam fouled patches of what should have been blue tropical sea he reminded himself that kaku was a good carrier officer that was true regardless of whether the older man understood grand strategy genda remained convinced that if japan hadnt gone for the united states with everything she had the americans would have come after her the same way with hawaii under the rising sunor even he smiled under its own flag once morethe usa didnt have the chance to him that counted for everything in the world thinking of hawaii under its own flag once more made him think of king stanley laanui and thinking of king stanley made him think of queen cynthia a much more enjoyable prospect i need to find an excuse to get over to iolani palace he told himself even if it meant conferring with general yamashita he needed to go over there she hadnt so much as kissed him he had no assurance she would then again he had no assurance she wouldnt either one of these days soon he intended to find out if she wouldnt if she raised a fuss the worst they could do to him was send him home he was sure of that and odds were they wouldnt even do so much not with the next fight against the us navy plainly right around the corner this is stupid oscar real alarm rode susie higgins voice youre going to get yourself killed and youre going to land everybody who ever heard of you in hot water which bothers you more oscar van der kirk asked you think i want the japs breathing down my neck youre nuts susie was one hardheaded gal oscar couldnt even say charlie kaapu hadnt done anything he didnt know that not for sure from what the police sergeant in honolulu said the japs sure as hell thought he had the kempeitai the more he repeated the name to himself the scarier it sounded would they knock on his door in the middle of the night the way the gestapo was supposed to do im just going to spread some fish around oscar said the way things are these days food works better than cash you cant even talk to the japs susie said which was largely true how are you going to get them to do what you want they wont even know who youre trying to spring he made moneycounting motions he couldnt very well make fishcounting motions there werent any ill manage he said with more confidence than he felt besides theyre bound to be using local clerks and such somebody will understand me if youre trying to give somebody something people always understand you not even susie tried to argue with that she only said youll get into more trouble than you know what to do with you said the same thing when i went to the police station oscar reminded her she wasnt impressed okay you were lucky once how come you think youll be lucky twice that was a better question than oscar wished it were trying to make light of it he said hey im lucky all the time babe ive got you dont i susie turned red she was a lot tanner than she had been when the war left her stuck in the middle of the pacific but the flush was still easy to see damn you oscar why do you have to go and say stuff like that she said angrily because i mean it he suggested she turned even redder then very suddenly she jumped up and dashed into the apartments tiny bathroom she stayed in there for quite a while and didnt flush before she came out her eyes were suspiciously bright she wagged a finger at him the way his mother had when he was four years old you know its funny what is oscar said whatever shed been doing in there it sure as hell wasnt laughing first time i saw you before you ever touched me or took me out on that surfboard or anything i knew i was going to go to bed with you she answered i wanted to get the taste of rick out of my mouth as fast as i could rick was the exhusband whose becoming ex her trip to hawaii had celebrated she wagged that finger again and dont you dare say anything about getting the taste of you in my mouth me i didnt say anything oscar answered as innocently as he could though shed done that all right hed slept with a lot of women getting over their exes in a tropical paradise that was one of the things a surfriding instructora surf bumwas for oh yes you did susie sounded fierce you said something sweet going to bed with you is easy the hard part is thinking i might might what might love you she said in a tiny voice oh oscar went over to her and put an arm around her you know what kiddo i might love you too you know what else i think we ought to wait and see what happens before we do anything if it looks like the japsll win and keep this place then we know where we are if the americans come and take it back then we know where we are too right now its just a mess how can we make plans if we dont know what the heck to plan for how can we make plans if you go sticking your head in the lions mouth but susie clung to him as if he were a surfboard and the shore a long long way away he kissed her but then he said ive got to do it hon nobody else is gonna give a darn about charlie but hes my friend she took a deep breath had she said if you loved me they would have had a row a few months earlier she probably would have now she swallowed it instead im not going to be able to talk you out of this am i nope well ill be here if you come back thats all she didnt wag a finger at him this timeshe poked him in the ribs now i suppose youll expect another fancy sendoff wont you bub huh wont you she poked him again who me oscar hoped he didnt sound like somebody about to drool on the shoes he wasnt wearing susie laughed at him so he probably did later that night they emphatically enjoyed each others company oscar slept soundly he went to honolulu hale the next morning life went on under the japanese people got married they bought and sold property they paid taxes on it they got peddlers licenses they sued one another most of the clerks whod worked for the us territory of hawaii went right on working for the japanese kingdom of hawaii there was a new department though special cases the sign above the door said it wasnt quite all hope abandon ye who enter here but it might as well have been several people in other safer queues looked up startled when oscar walked through that door a little old woman who seemed hapa hawaiian and maybe hapachinese made the sign of the cross a clerk who might have been of the same blood glanced up from the papers on his governmentissue desk the nameplate on the desk said he was alfred choi he gave a good game impression of never letting anything take him by surprise yes he said you wish i have a friend whos been uh jailed i dont think hes done anything and i want to help him get out if i can oscar said this is for the police or for a lawyer alfred choi said oscar unhappily shook his head choi looked at him as if noting the door through which hed come this man this friendhe made it sound like a dirty wordhas some connection to the occupying authorities uhhuh oscar admitted even less happily than hed nodded before give me his name charlie kaapu oscar wondered if choi was going to press a secret button that sent a dozen kempeitai men with pistols and samurai swords charging into the room nothing like that happened the clerk got up walked to a fourdrawer filing cabinet about ten feet away and went through the third drawer for a minute or so when he came back his face was grim you can do nothing he said i can do nothing no one can do anything the occupying authorities have dealt with him is hedead oscar didnt want to say the word or even think it alfred choi shook his head not yet he said which didnt sound good maybe he was trying to put on the squeeze oscar hoped so that was better than the alternative picking his words with care oscar said i catch a lot of fishmore than i need sometimes i have enough to eat thank you choi said i could take fish from you i could ah string you along he used the slang selfconsciously but since i have enough i tell you straight out i cannot do anything for your friend nobody can do anything for your friend his case is pau the hawaiian word for finished in common use in the islands sounded dreadfully final here could i talk to anybody else oscar asked do you want the kempeitai to talk to you alfred choi sounded abstractly curious as if he didnt give a damn one way or the other he likely didnt it was no skin off his rather flat nose i guess maybe not oscar said reluctantly i guess maybe not too this is wise the clerk pointed to the door you leave through the door you came in by oscar left through that door some of the people in the wider hall onto which special cases opened looked surprised anyone was allowed to leave he decided hed done everything he could possibly do for charlie kaapu he wished he knew what charlie had done or what the japs thought hed done and he wished he knew what theyd done to him the memory of halfraw halfburnt pork was just thata memoryfor jim peterson these days he was back to not so slowly starving on the usual kalihi valley rations back to working himself to death too many inches at a time he stood in the rain for morning roll call the japs who did the counting had umbrellas of course the pows the mere idea was a joke peterson hoped the count would go smoothly if it didnt the japs would probably just send the whole gang of them into the tunnel without breakfast prisoners starving so what time lost on the tunnel a catastrophe things seemed to be moving well enough when there was a commotion to the southwest the japanese had the escape route well blocked off every once in a while a pow grew desperate enough to try it anyway those who did usually got caught then they served as object lessons for the others watching them tortured to death a little at a time had given jim peterson more than one of his many nightmares this wasnt an escaped prisoner these were new damned souls come to take their places in hell along with his fellow sufferers peterson stared at the newcomers they arent soldiers somebody behind him said through the patter and plink of raindrops the man was obviously right instead of wearing tatters of khaki or navy blue they wore tatters of blue jeans and plaid or flowered shirts just because they were civilians didnt mean they hadnt seen their fair share of abuse and then some they were bruised and battered and beaten quite a few of them limped a lot of them had bloody mouths they showed missing front teeth that obviously hadnt been missing long one of the japs herding them forward smashed a fellow who looked half hawaiian in the head with a rifle butt for no reason peterson could see the man staggered and groaned but stayed on his feet peterson thought that blow would have felled an elephant but the japs had also put him in places where you died if you went down this looked like one of those places for the luckless prisoner somebody not far away muttered look how fat they are they werent fat not really not even the japanese guards with a couple of exceptions were fat but they had vastly more flesh on them than the filthy bearded skeletons already laboring in the kalihi valley shouts in japanese went back and forth between the soldiers bringing in the new prisoners and the guards in charge of the men already there those guards seemed about as delighted to see the new arrivals as a housewife would have been to find more mice marching into her kitchen peterson knew why too or at least one of the reasons why if this doesnt fuck up the count he said morosely several men standing within earshot of him groaned a jap guard looked their way they all pretended they hadnt let out a peep after a baleful stare right out of a gangster movie the guard looked away by a minorleague miracle the new prisoners didnt foul up the count too badly shouting in fragmentary english the japs got them to line up in ranks of ten that told the guards how many of them there were then the japs went back to counting the pows already there they only needed to do it twice before the answer satisfied them breakfast wouldnt have been more than fifteen minutes late to the japs that was fifteen minutes too long despite groans and curses from the pows they headed them off toward the tunnel mouth curses and groans didnt count for much against fit men fixed bayonets and live ammunition the japs drove the newcomers toward the mouth of the tunnel too the new fish didnt complain they didnt know they were missing breakfast and they didnt know what the devil they were getting into either wonder what the hell they did to get sent here peterson remarked mustve been something juicy gordy braddon said after a meditative moment he added theyre the first batch of civilians ever came here japs must want em dead bad yeahsame as us peterson said tightly braddon nodded what are we doing here asked the big halfhawaiian guy the jap had clouted with his rifle butt blood and rainwater ran down the side of his face if he noticed he didnt let on digging a tunnel through the mountains peterson found himself liking the newcomers coolness he added his name and stuck out a hand jim the newcomer repeated taking it im charliecharlie kaapu his grip was hard and firm why not he didnt have beriberi taking bites out of his strength not yet anyway if he stayed here very long he would what did you do that made em love you well enough to send you to this garden spot peterson asked some garden charlie said and laughed a loud raucous laugh the laugh of a man who couldnt be beatenor at least of a man who didnt know he could he went on they say i was spying for the united states yeah were you peterson didnt ask the question a fellow named seymour harper did peterson wasnt the only one who suspected him of snitching to the japs though nobodyd ever been able to nail that down for sure a couple of men coughed that was about as much warning as they could give the new guy without landing in trouble themselves it wasnt enough not really but charlie kaapu turned out not to need it he started to shake his head then grimaced and thought better of it shit no he answered what really happened was this jap majors girlfriend thought i was better in bed than he was he laughed again complacently you know these japs aint nothin but a bunch of needle dicks but she got mad at him one day and told him what she thought and the motherfucker went and grabbed meor he had the cops do it anyway gordy braddon said you had more fun getting here than we did thats for goddamn sure peterson found himself nodding he found himself smiling too and that wasnt something he did every day not in the kalihi valley it wasnt charlie was smiling too which only proved hed just got here so how do we dig this stinking tunnel they rounded the last bend in the road in front of the tunnel mouth jungle no longer hid the hole in the mountainside or the sorry collection of hand tools in front of it the tools would rust in the rain but the japs didnt care if a tool broke that gave them one more excuse to take it out on a prisoner peterson pointed at the picks and shovels and crowbars now you see it charliedevils island oh boy the halfhawaiian started singing heighho heighho its off to work i go in a melodious baritone peterson had seen snow white toowho hadnt but he hadnt felt like singing since he got here he still didnt inside the tunnel torches and kerosene lamps gave just enough light to move and work by there had been candles and lamps that burned palm oil or something like that no more pows stole them to eat the tallow and drink the oil you work if a jap overseer was going to know any english that was it this one a sergeant brandished a length of bamboo to make sure the prisoners got the message at one time or another hed already walloped everybody but the new fish at least twice in a low voice peterson said we dont go any faster than we have to charlie kaapus shadow swooped and dipped along the rough black basalt of the tunnel wall as he nodded no huhu jim he answered i get it but he and the rest of the newcomers still did a lot more work than any of the pows whod been there for a while that wasnt because they were more diligentjim peterson thought theyd all got the message about not pushing too hard with the worst will in the world toward the japs though they couldnt help themselves they were so many charles atlases alongside the skeletally thin malnourished prisoners of war of course a man with real muscles could outdo somebody who had nothing left between his skin and his bones after an eternity the shift ended charlie kaapu had got hit a couple of more times for not working fast enough to suit the guards you did good peterson told him as they stumbled back toward the camp and what would be their meager evening meal oh yeah charlie said how long till i look like you peterson had no real answer for that but he knew it wouldnt be long accompanied by a pair of stalwart petty officers commander mitsuo fuchida bicycled through the streets of honolulu the petty officers werent so much bodyguards as men who could get out in front of him and yell gangway to clear traffic most places he would have gone by car and his driver would have leaned on the horn that he didnt here was a telling measure of how tight fuel had got in honolulu panting a little he stopped in front of the building where minoru genda had his officestopped so abruptly that his tires drew black lines on the pale concrete of the sidewalk wait for me he told the petty officers i wont be very long they nodded and saluted fuchida charged up the stairs to gendas officeand then had to charge down again when a young officer said so sorry commandersan but hes not here this morning hes gone to iolani palace zakennayo fuchida snarled when he turned to go without another word the junior officer said sir youre welcome to use a telephone here to call him id better go see him fuchida said if hed wanted to telephone genda he could have done it from pearl harbor some things though were too important to trust to wiresor to junior officers the youngster raised an eyebrow when fuchida ignored him he sighed and went back to work that was fast sir one of the petty officers remarked when fuchida emerged from the building were not done yetthats why fuchida answered gendasans not here weve got to head back west over to iolani palace run interference again for me if youd be so kind yes sir they chorused if they sounded resigned then they did that was all what choice had they but obedience none and they knew it as well as fuchida did they got back onto their bicycles and started bellowing gangway some more that at least seemed as if it ought to be fun the way civilians scattered before them clearly declared who the conquerors were fuchida skidded to another stop in front of the palace the big hawaiian soldiers at the bottom of the front stairs came to attention and saluted as he hurried by them so did the japanese troops at the top of the stairs he paused for a moment to ask them wheres commander genda they looked at one another with expressions he found unfathomable after a longish pause their sergeant said is it very urgent sir you bet your life its urgent fuchida exclaimed would i be here like this if it werent stolidly the noncom gave back a shrug you never can tell can you sir youll likely find him in the basement the basement fuchida echoed in surprise the japanese soldiers nodded as one fuchida had assumed genda was here to talk with general yamashita who had his office on the second floor admiral yamamoto had used a basement office here but the commander of the combined fleet was long since back in japan to make things more annoying the front entrance didnt offer access to the basement fuming fuchida had to go down the stairs past the hawaiian soldiers again and pedal around the palace so he could go downstairs into the lower level what the devil was genda doing here and where in the basement was he likely to be that damned sergeant hadnt said hawaiian bureaucrats were using some of the rooms down there fuchida prowled past those the brown menand the whitegave him curious looks since admiral yamamoto departed japanese officers were seldom seen down here he looked into those open rooms and did not see commander genda fuming he yanked open the first door to a windowless room he foundand almost got buried by an avalanche of dustpans and brooms and other cleaning gear the americans called a place like that fibber mcgees closet fuchida thought the phrase came from a radio show he went down the hall and tried another closed door this time he was rewarded by a whiff of perfume a startled female gasp and a muttered obscenity he shut the door in a hurry but he didnt go awaythe obscenity had been in japanese maybe im wrong he thought but he wasnt commander genda came out of the small dark room a couple of minutes later still hastily setting his uniform to rights he looked put upon what wouldnt wait till i got back to the office he demanded irritably nothing i can talk about till were out of this place fuchida said and then with irritation of his own if you have to lay one of the maids here couldnt you do it when youre not on duty genda didnt talk about that till they were out of iolani palace even then he waved the petty officers whod come along with fuchida out of hearing range before saying im not laying one of the palace maids im laying queen cynthia oh jesus christ fuchida had from time to time thought of converting to christianity that wasnt what brought out the oath though a lot of japanese whod been exposed to western ways used it whether they took the religion of jesus seriously or not youre my friend i hope youll keep your mouth shut life would get more more complicated if you didnt genda said a commendable understatement occupying the islands was one thing occupying king stanley laanuis wife something else again fuchida could imagine nothing better calculated to show what a false and useless regime the restored kingdom of hawaii really was before he could express his horror genda asked and whats the news that made you come over here and hunt me down by the emperor it had better be important that brought fuchida back from disasters hypothetical to disasters altogether too real he also made sure the petty officers couldnt overhear before he answered the americans put two fish into zuikaku a couple of hours ago what thats impossible genda exclaimed sadly fuchida shook his head genda went on more moderately thats terrible fuchida could and did nod how did it happen will she sink genda asked how they dont know how they were getting close to oahu and wham fuchida said they dont think shell go downshe hasnt lost power and the pumps are working but shes not going to sail against the americans with akagi and shokaku either shes limping in to pearl harbor for emergency repairs and she may have to go back to japan again how could the americans have got a sub in the right place to torpedo her genda wasnt really asking fuchidahe was asking an uncaring world fuchida only shrugged dumb luck he said shigata ga nai obviously it cant be helped genda said it wouldnt have happened if it could be but ill tell you something fuchidasan it almost makes me wonder if the yankees are reading our codes what that shocked fuchida almost as much as gendas dalliance with the redheaded queen of hawaii dont be silly everyone knows our codes are unbreakable well yes that genda admitted the fact did a lot to ease fuchidas mind dreadful news though zuikaku we could really use her because the americans are building up for another go at us that gets plainer every day well be able to fly the planes off the airstrips here fuchida began genda was a small man and usually a mildmannered man as well his scowl now stopped fuchida in his tracks the only way that will do us any good is if we lose the fight on the ocean i dont want to lose the fight on the ocean he said i presume weve already screamed to tokyo that we need more carriers oh yes fuchida said whether tokyo will listen is probably a different story though they keep going on and on about how thin their resources are stretched our resources wont have to stretch so far if we lose hawaii thats for sure genda snapped cant they see that we need more carriers we need more trained pilots fuchida said the americans seem to turn out as many as they want why cant we admiral yamamoto always said we couldnt hope to match them genda replied that was the main reason we gambled so much in this attack so what they could do wouldnt matter he sighed but it turns out that it does matter its just taken longer to be obvious involuntarily fuchida looked north and east what do we do now the best we can genda told him what else is there you were doing the best you could with the queen neh if fuchida thought about such things he wouldnt have to think about the real troubles facing the japanese in hawaiifor a little while anyway its not quite like that genda said with more embarrassment than fuchida had expected from him shes very sweet really and her husband doesnt understand her at all how many men sleeping with other mens wives had said exactly the same thing fuchida wondered if telling genda as much would do any good since he doubted it he reluctantly put aside his own thoughts of king stanleys striking spouse duty was calling and in a strident voice weve got to get you back to pearl harbor as fast as we can commander genda sighed once more yes i suppose so you came out here to give me the news in person so you wouldnt have to use the telephone or the radio hai fuchida nodded sensible good security the story will get out anywaybad news always doesbut it will take longer this way well have the chance to come up with some propaganda of our own maybe even some genuine good news thats what admiral kaku thought fuchida turned to one of the petty officers okano yes sir the man came to attention im going to commandeer your bicycle for commander genda here he needs to go to pearl harbor right away fuchida said okano nodded and salutedagain what choice did he have fuchida went on see if you can borrow one or take one from a civilian if that doesnt work youll have to walk he can ride behind me sir the other petty officer said i dont mind the effect wouldnt be dignified but fuchida wasnt inclined to be fussy not now all right well do it that way then he said now lets get moving ensign joe crosetti gave his fighter plane a little more throttle the ff hellcat responded as if angels flapped their wings harder a slow grin stretched across joes face wow he said hed had some experience with wildcats now the ff wasnt hopeless against the zeroit could outdive the top jap fighter and could take a lot more damagebut it wasnt a match for the enemy plane either the hellcat the hellcat was a long step up it was faster than a wildcat it had bettermuch betterhighaltitude performance because its engine packed so much more power it was even tougher than the older american plane best of all it was his he didnt have a lot of time to get used to it before long theyd throw him into action against the japs he had to be ready he had to be and he intended to be he wouldnt be alone in the sky when the clash finally came that was the most important thing to remember when he looked aroundthe cockpit gave better visibility than a wildcats toohe saw a lot of other hellcats from the bunker hill flying with him in neat formation pleasure unalloyed filled his grin back when he volunteered to become a navy flier this was what hed had in mind roaring off a fleet carrier to take the war straight to the japs plenty of guys had volunteered with the same thing in mind most of them hadnt made it some washed out of training some crashed he crossed himself there in the cockpit remembering the funerals hed gone to and so many were flying other kinds of aircraft flying boats or transports or blimps on antisubmarine patrol off the coasts but here he was by god hed done what he set out to do and there just a few planes away flew orson sharp actually joe had been surer his roomie would get a place on a carrier than he had been about himself he was good he knew that not many whod gone through the program with him were better the big guy from salt lake city was one of the few the formation switched from a vee to line astern as they approached the bunker hill and landed one after another it was just like landing on the wolverine on lake erieexcept it wasnt that was practice everybody knew it you took it seriously you had to because you could get killed if you didnt but it wasnt the real mccoy all the same this was the bunker hill wasnt a converted excursion steamer and she wasnt on the great lakes that was the pacific down there destroyers and cruisers screened the carrier but they werent a one hundred percent guarantee no japanese sub could sneak in and find her she was in the warand so was joe his mouth twisted hed been in the war for a while now ever since that jap flying boat dropped a bomb on his uncles house after hitting san francisco harbor a lot of guys painted their wifes name or their sweethearts on the nose of their plane joes hellcat had two names on its nose tina and gina hed crossed the country on a train to get to his cousins funerals carrier landings were never automatic if you thought they could be it was your funeralliterally when joes turn came he followed the landing officers wigwags as if hed turned into a robot one wing was down a little he didnt think so but he brought it up he was coming in too steeply again he didnt think so but he raised the hellcats nose just the same down came both wigwag flags down came joe in the controlled crash that was a carrier landing one of the arrester wires caught his tailhook his teeth clicked together hard he was home he killed the engine pulled back the canopy and scrambled out of the plane men from the flight crew hauled the hellcat out of the way clearing the deck for the next landing it was all as smooth and practiced as a ballet as far as joe was concerned it was just as beautiful too he ran for the island so he wouldnt be in the way if anything went wrong when the ship wasnt launching or recovering planes he spent as much time as he could out on the flight deck the north pacific felt like home to him hed got to know it from the deck of his fathers fishing boat some of the guys who were firstrate pilots made lousy sailors not joe after a little boats rolling and pitching nothing the massive bunker hill did could faze him orson sharp had landed before him were getting there the mormon said joe nodded you better believe it hed wondered what kind of a sailor sharp would proveafter all his roomie had never even seen the ocean before he got to pensacola for flight training but sharp seemed to be doing just fine now when do you think well go after the japs sharp asked beats me why dont you get fdr on the phone joe said his buddy laughed at him he went on i dont think its gonna be real long though i mean look what were flying and look where were at it was sharps turn to nod when theyd signed up to train as pilots the hellcat existed only on the drawing board the bunker hill had been laid down but only just barely the usa hadnt been serious about the war till after the japs hit hawaii if it wasnt serious now though it never would be look at all the other carriers were going to have with us too joe added and his friend nodded again along with the bunker hill and the rest of the es sex classbig fleet carriers that could take on anything the japs builtthere were the repaired hornet the ranger brought over from the atlantic several light carriers built on cruiser hulls and even more escort carriers built on freighter hulls both classes carried far fewer planes than a fleet carrier the escort carriers with a freighters engines couldnt make more than eighteen knots but they could all get fighters and dive bombers and torpedo planes close to the enemy and that was the point of the exercise soon orson sharp murmured yeah joe heard the raw hunger in his own voice soon before the war kenzo takahashi had never thought he would call on a girl carrying a sack of fish flowers yes chocolates sure mackerel mackerel had never once crossed his mind chocolate had disappeared he doubted any was left on oahu flowers were there for the picking even now as far as they went hawaii had an embarrassment of riches down by the harbor hawaiian women still made leis and sold them for a quarter or a yen though japanese sailors were less enthusiastic customers than american tourists had been but you couldnt eat flowers although these days kenzo wouldnt have been surprised if someone had made the experiment fish made a much more practical present carrying them in a cloth sack let him worry less about people who might want to knock him over the head for the sake of a full belly even in elsie sundbergs neighborhood such a thing was a long way from impossible none of the cars parked in front of the neat houses here had tires any more by now the occupying authorities had confiscated them all none of the cars had batteries any more either the japanese had taken those too that didnt show though not with a closed hood when kenzo knocked on elsies front door her mother opened it she smiled hello ken come in she said thank you maam he did as always he had to shift gears in this neighborhood west of nuuanu avenue he was kenzo but this was the haole part of town all right he didnt really mind to his way of thinking an american needed to have an americansounding name he held out the sack i brought you folks these as always a gift of food was welcome when elsies mother said thank you very much she plainly meant it she went on we have some ripe avocados to give you when you go thatd be nice kenzo also meant it without knowing the sundbergs he wouldnt have had any for a long time let me get you some lemonade mrs sundberg was firm in her hospitalityand avocados and lemonade were about all she could offer she added elsie will be ready in a minute okay kenzo said the lemonade would be good one of these days maybe elsie would meet him at the door and just go out with him he shrugged he didnt plan on holding his breath the sundbergs clung to gentility with both hands they didnt have much else to cling to not with the japanese occupation knocking what had been the ruling race and ruling class over the head elsie came into the kitchen while he was drinking the sweettart lemonade she had a glass too by now that was part of the routine for their dates when they finished her mom walked them to the door saying have a good time we will elsie told her as soon as the door closed behind them she asked kenzo where do you want to go i was just thinking down to the park he answered weve seen all the movies on the island twice by now and there isnt a heck of a lot else to do we can talk and and stuff yeah and stuff elsie echoed in ominous tones she knew he meant necking as well as he did his ears got hot he took a couple of embarrassed shuffling steps but then she laughed and said okay well do that a couple of kids were playing on the slide and the surviving swings when they got to the park they sat down on a bench the grass was even longer and more luxuriant than it had been the last time they were there people had more urgent things than mowing it to worry about none of the greenery had been trimmed any time lately either how have you been elsie asked pretty good except for dad kenzo grimaced thats a big except though the more he talks to the japanese radio the more trouble he gets into with his big mouth whats he gonna do when the americans come back do you really think they will elsie asked with a bigger catch in her voice than she ever got after he kissed her he nodded id bet on it all those planes coming over at night and the subs around and all those kinds of things hed never said a word to anybody not even elsie about the flier he and hiroshi had rescued what she didnt know could help keep her safe he wondered how burt burleson had done once he got ashore the japanese hadnt bragged about capturing him anyhow that was something god i hope youre right elsie breathed wouldnt it be wonderful to get things back to the way they were before all this happened sure kenzo said most ways he thought would you still go out with me if things get back to the way they used to be he had to admit she might theyd been good friends before that wasnt quite the same even if he had kissed her once a cloud passed in front of the sun rain started coming down this was a little more than the usual liquid sunshine it rained hard enough to send the kids home that didnt break kenzos heart elsies sun dress clung to her kenzo admired the effect elsie caught him doing it and wrinkled her nose in mock severity doing his best to be gallant he said we can go under a tree if you want she shook her head it wont make any difference the waterll just drip through she was found to be right about that she went on i dont mind it its nice and warm and when it stops well dry out pretty fast okay kenzo said in the meantime he put his arm around her she slid toward him on the bench he kissed her what could be better than necking in the park even if it was raining actually he knew what could be better but elsie didnt want to do thator if she did want to she pretended not to like any other well broughtup girl kisses could take on a life of their own kenzo opened his eyes and came up for air after what seemed like forever elsies eyes stayed closed waiting for him to bend down to her again but he didnt instead softly he spoke her name however softly he spoke it wasnt the way a lover talked to his beloved her eyes came open too he pointed and said still in a low voice i think youd better get out of here three japanese soldiers were coming into the park they werent on patrol they werent carrying weapons and they werent marching what they were was fallingdown drunk one of them was singing something raucous they wont be any trouble elsie said but her voice lacked conviction the only way they wouldnt be any trouble was if they hadnt seen her kenzo hoped that was so they were pretty well sloshed but like so many things it turned out to be too much to hope for hey sweetheart kiss me too one of them called kiss my dick another one added they all thought that was funny kenzo didnt like the baying quality of their laughter not even a little bit elsies face didnt change for a foolish instant kenzo wondered why not then he realized theyd yelled in japanese he could go back and forth between the two languages without even realizing he was doing it elsie couldnt she didnt know how lucky she was either sweetheart he said youve got to get out of here right now that got through to her she scrambled to her feet but even then she asked what will they do to you if i take a powder whatever it is it wont be half as bad as what theyd do to you now get lost he swatted her on the fanny to make sure she got the point she yipped but she took off she was no dope either instead of heading for any of the sidewalks she went straight away from the japanese soldiers even though that was through some of the thickest bush come back where do you think youre going you stupid bitch we can catch her the soldiers shouted at elsie and at one another they pounded toward the park bench at a staggering lope one of them fell on the wet grass the other two hauled him upright again seeing that kenzo waited till the very last instant before he got up and ran he went in the same direction as elsie had wanting to stay between her and the soldiers if he went any other way they were too likely to forget about him and just keep on after her he thought they were too drunk to catch her but you never could tell he also thought they were too drunk to catch him the three stooges couldnt have put on a clumsier act than that pratfall of theirs but then he took a pratfall of his own tripping over a root and landing splat on his face worse yet he knocked the wind out of himself he was just lurching to his feet when one of the soldiers grabbed him let me go he yelled in japanese i didnt do anything they seemed momentarily startled to hear him speak their language one of them hit him anyway shut up you bastard the soldier shouted you told the girl to get away he couldnt have known enough english to be sure of that but he didnt need to be sherlock holmes to figure it out kenzo tried to twist free he didnt try to fight back one against three even three drunks was bad odds all he wanted to do was get away to his dismay he discovered he couldnt they hit him a few more times knocked him down and started kicking him that was bad he did his best to roll into a ball and protect his head with his arms then one of the soldiers said were just wasting time that stupid cunt is getting away they forgot about kenzo and pounded off after elsie this time kenzo lay there for some little while before he painfully pulled himself upright again he hoped hed bought elsie enough time to escape his biggest fear had been that they would decide she had got away and it was his fault in that case they might have stomped him to death he spat red he hadnt done a perfect job of covering up and that wasnt just rainwater trickling down his jaw breathing hurt too his ribs had taken a shellacking but he didnt feel knives in his chest when he inhaled so he supposed nothing in there was broken in the movies the hero recovered from a beating as soon as it was over life unfortunately didnt imitate hollywood kenzo felt like hell or maybe a little worse none too steady on his feet he lurched over to the water fountain in one corner of the park when he turned the knob water came out he washed his face it hurt he started to dry it on his sleeve but didnt for one thing his shirt was already pretty soggy for another he didnt want to get bloodstains on it they hardly ever came out clean all he could do was hope elsie had got home safe he wanted to find out if she had but he didnt do that either if he ran into those japanese soldiers again it might literally be the last thing he ever did and he didnt want to lead them to the sundbergs house instead he walked back to the tent he shared with his father and brother nobody stared at him so maybe he didnt look too bad or maybe people in honolulu had just got used to seeing guys whod been roughed up to his enormous relief his father wasnt in the tent his brother was hiroshi did stare at him and exclaimed jesus christ what happened to you so much for not looking too bad kenzo thought japanese soldiers he answered shortly could have been a hell of a lot worse i think elsie got away from them and ill be okay jesus christ hiroshi said again and then you gonna tell dad whats the use kenzo said if i did hed probably say it was my own damn fault he waited hoping his brother would tell him he was wrong hiroshi didnt kenzo sighed disappointed but not much surprised come on lets go lester dillon shouted as the marines in his platoon filed onto a bus move it you lazy lugs you want to keep hirohito waiting his company commander grinned at him thats pretty good captain bradford said thank you sir dillon didnt think it was all that funny himself but he wasnt about to say so not if his co liked it he did say about time we got another shot at those slantyeyed bastards you better believe it bradford agreed maybe this time the navyll hold up their end of the deal they damn well better dillon exclaimed if they dont if they dont i reckon theyll be too dead for us to complain about it braxton bradford said thats how it worked out last year anyways since he was both right and an officer dillon let it rest there this was a funny kind of war if the navy pukes didnt do their job if they got killed he and his buddies were pretty safe but if the sailors and flyboys cleared the japanese navy out of the way in the pacific the marines and the army got to land on oahu and tackle the japanese army it only stood to reason that a lot of them wouldnt live through the campaign but he was champing at the bit and so was every other marine he knew the armys opinion mattered to him not at all does this make me patriotic or just a damn fool hed got shot once and here he was eager to give a brand new enemy a chance to punch his ticket he looked inside himself he really was he climbed aboard the bus himself the last man to do so the door hissed shut the driver put the bus in gear diesel engine grumbling it started south one of the dozens maybe hundreds heading down from camp pendleton to san diego pendleton had the room to train marines by the tens of thousands san diego still had the port the convoy of buses had pacific coast highway almost to itself gasoline rationing had made civilian traffic disappear les saw only a handful of cars coming north most of the vehicles in the other lane were trucks painted olive drab the pacific was more interesting and prettier gulls and terns glided overhead waves rolled up onto the beach in hawaii surfriders would have skimmed ashore atop them nobodyd thought of doing that here every so often a lone man or a knot of two or three friends would stand by the edge of the sea with fishing poles dillon saw a lot of fishermen but he never saw anybody catch anything then the buses got down into san diego they rolled right past the park where the padres played the team must have been on the road because the ballpark was quiet and empty talk inside les bus got louder and more excited when it pulled into the harbor he didnt see any battlewagons or carriers tied up there theyd probably already put to sea the harbor was full of ungainly liberty ships and the destroyers that would escort them andeverybody hopedkeep subs away with a squeal of brakes that needed work the bus shuddered to a stop everybody out les said youve got a chance to stretch your legs so you better take it you think we were tight in here wait till we get on the damn troopship only difference between us and sardines there is they wont pack us in olive oil some of the marines laughed most of them didnt theyd been through last years abortive campaign and they knew this wasnt going to be a trip to hawaii on a luxury liner they did stretch and twist when they got down on the concrete les lowered his pack to the ground something along his spine crunched when he stretched he was older than the men he led he was in good hard shape for a man his age but every now and then his body insisted on reminding him that good hard shape for a man in his forties wasnt the same as it had been when he was in his twenties he hoped he would be able to keep up when they landed on oahu if they landed on oahu things had gone wrong once he hoped they wouldnt go wrong again but life didnt come with a moneyback guarantee too damn bad he thought my company form on me captain bradford called from a nearby bus well be boarding that ship since dillons bus stood between him and his company commander he couldnt see which ship bradford had in mind it didnt matter much liberty ships were as like as peas in a pod only a lot uglier bradford pointed again when les could see him valdosta liberty was stenciled in big white letters on the black paint at the freighters stern but for the name she could have been the alamogordo liberty or the missoula liberty or any of the others crowding coronado bay up the gangplank he went merchant seamen in dungarees crewed the ship he didnt much like that but he couldnt do anything about it the navy had trouble finding sailors for all its new warships let alone troopships but if trouble came would these civilians know what to do with the antiaircraft gun at the valdosta libertys bow hell with it he thought if they dont some of usll take over any japs want this ship theyll have to pay the bill for her captain bradford being an officer would share a cabin with his social equals dillon being a noncom went down into the bowels of the liberty ship with the rest of the marines the air down belowdecks felt still and dead it would only get worse theyd be sailing south so it would get hotter the men wouldnt have many chances to bathe odds were the galley would serve beans too all things considered id rather be in philadelphia dillon thought nobody gave a damn about his opinion he got his platoon settled in the cramped space available as best he could the first card games started even before all the men had slung their packs up onto their bunks the valdosta libertys engines came to life he felt them through the soles of his feet as well as hearing them the whole fabric of the ship vibrated then she began to move here we go again somebody said les nodded that summed it all up as well as anything kenzo takahashi moved like an old man by late afternoon he felt all the bruises and lumps the japanese soldiers had given him earlier in the day he kept walking all the same he had to find out if elsie was okay he flinched when he walked past a squad of japanese soldiers but he bowed too so they didnt bother him he might have been bruised but he wasnt wearing a scarlet letter he laughed at himself for remembering american lit at a time like this besides they were on duty not on leave and drunk and he wasnt walking with a girl which no doubt counted most of all he flinched again when he went up the sundbergs walk and knocked on the front door if elsie wasnt there if she wasnt there mrs sundberg would start screaming at him and how could he blame her the door opened elsies mom stared out at him then she said ken thank god and hugged him and kissed him on the cheek she pulled him into the house and called elsie kens here from the back of the house elsie squealed she came running up to ken threw herself into his armsshe almost knocked him overand gave him a kiss it wasnt the sort of peck hed got from her mother either it was the real mccoy and mrs sundberg who stood there watching didnt pitch a fit she beamed at him and elsie after the kiss ended elsie took a real look at him oh ken she exclaimed you got hurt its not too bad he said and that kiss made him less of a liar than he would have been a couple of minutes earlier im just glad you got away from those bastards thats all he bobbed his head toward her mother excuse me dont worry about it mrs sundberg said warmly elsie told me what you did thank you thank you from the bottom of my heart she eyed him too can i get you some ice probably too late for that kenzo answered ill be okay in a few days they didnt kick me in the teeth and my ribs are just sore nothings busted im so sorry elsie squeezed his hands in hers he shrugged not your fault those miserable goons he couldnt call them what he wanted to not in front of elsie and her mother they certainly are mrs sundbergs voice wasnt warm any more not when she talked about the japanese soldiers she turned to elsie im going to let the neighbors know kens all right too ill be back in a while i know the two of you have a lot to uh talk about he felt hed earned his american name out the door mrs sundberg went kenzo nodded to elsie hiya he managed she wasnt laughing she looked on the edge of tears they really could have killed you she said yeah well he shrugged again it hurt he went on they would have done some pretty horrible things to you too her face twisted you hear stories about things like that but you dont think they can happen to you then they door they almost do she looked down at the rug you hear stories about heroes too but you never think you know one anybody would have done the same thing kenzo said i dont think so elsie sounded almost angry i dont think you should be so modest either they could have killed you it wasnt that she was wrong on the contrary uncomfortably he said i dont like thinking about that any better than you like thinking about uh the other stuff okay elsie said that must have made sense to her what do you want to think about instead how about this she kissed him again the kiss took on a life of its own his arms tightened around her she molded herself against him he squeezed her backside pressing her closer yet she didnt try to pull away she just made a wordless sound of pleasure they finally broke apart but not very far elsie he began and stopped i know sweetheart its okay its better than okay she kissed him once more gently this time you risked your life for me that counts for a lot anything i can do to pay you back is pretty small stuff anything at all you dont have to do anything because of that he said i didnt do it to get paid back i know its better that way elsie said suppose i do it because i want to then this time he kissed her when his hand found her breast she didnt try to slap it away she just made that happy noise again he made one quite a bit like it but deeper after a while his heart pounding he asked what about your mom elsie laughed she wont be back for a while moms no dummy she didnt leave by accident dont worry about that im not worried about anything kenzo said which would do for an understatement till a bigger one came along come on then she took his hand and led him back to her bedroom a teddy bear almost the size of a threeyearold sat on the bed elsie set it on the floor with its back to the bed then she nodded as much to herself as to kenzo and pulled the sun dress off over her head she sat down on the edge of the bed to take off her bra and panties kenzo tried not to stare as much as he wanted to youre beautiful he whispered he got out of his own clothes in a hurry oh ken elsie said when she saw the bruises and welts on his ribs and his back and one thigh she jumped up and kissed them one by one so softly that her lips almost werent there is that better he didnt know what it did for the bruises what it did for the rest of him was obvious elsie giggled they lay down together it wasnt quite kenzos first time but it was his first time with anybody who mattered to him who didnt want him to go away as soon as he could so she could take on somebody else elsie sighed when his mouth found the pink tips of her breasts a little later with him poised above her she inhaled sharply be careful she said it hurts ill try he told her though nothing in all the world could have kept him from driving deeper then elsie bit her lip but didnt say anything more before long his world exploded in delight as he came back to himself he asked are you okay ithink so she answered they say its supposed to hurt the first time and they arent wrong but youre sweet she squirmed under him let me up i dont want to leave a stain on the bedspread when she stood up she laughed and said oopstoo late well cold water will get most of it out i hope me too he felt foolish and started getting dressed again elsie carried her clothes down the hall to the bathroom she walked spraddlelegged as if shed been riding a horse for a long time when she came back she had a wet washrag which she used to scrub at the red stain there she said after a bit thats better anyhow uhhuh kenzo didnt know what to do or say next he tried i think maybe i better go okay elsie said and then in a different tone of voice i hope to god i dont catch catch oh kenzo said neither of them had worried about that while it was going on i hope you dont too that would be terrible it would be complicated anyway elsie said if you knocked a girl up you either ran away and started over somewhere else or you married her kenzo couldnt run far not the way things were now he didnt want to marry anybody yet though he didnt suppose elsie would be too bad but she was dead right no matter who ran hawaii a japanese guy marrying a haole girl would cause complications theyd be different complications depending on whether the rising sun or the stars and stripes flew over the islands but theyd always be there he and elsie walked out into the front room well be careful she said he didnt know if she meant careful about her not getting pregnant or careful about going where japanese soldiers could cause trouble it struck him as a good idea either way sure he said so long he kissed her then went out the door he looked back when she closed it but didnt blow her a kiss or anything the neighbors didnt need to know neither did elsies momnot officially anyhow corporal takeo shimizu led his squad through the streets of honolulu it was a routine patrol nobody gave them any trouble by now the locals had learned to bow and get out of the way when they saw japanese soldiers they hadnt needed object lessons for quite a while the only thing even slightly unusual that shimizu saw was a local japanese man about the age of most of the privates in his squad who walked along whistling even though a black eye and a fat lip said hed been in a brawl and probably lost it shimizu almost stopped him and asked him what he was so happy about but in the end he didnt being happy wasnt against the rules he wasnt the only one who noticed the local whatever that guys been drinking i want some private wakuzawa said that was funny enough to make not only shimizu but also several other soldiers laugh wakuzawa was already the most cheerful man in the squad why did he need anything to make him happier yet better something like that should go to senior private furusawa who thought too much for his own goodor so it seemed to shimizu anyhow soldiers were drilling in a park they werent army menthey belonged to the special naval landing forces they wore olivedrab uniforms not army khaki and their boots were black rather than brown the navy officer putting them through their paces wouldnt be satisfied with anything less than perfection and didnt want to recognize perfection when he saw it you are not worthy of dying for the emperor he screamed at the sweating panting soldiers not worthy do you hear me hai captain iwabuchi the soldiers chorused then act like it damn you iwabuchi roared if we have to fight the americans we are going to make them drown in their own blood and how do we do that by making them drown in our blood hai captain iwabuchi the troops from the naval landing force repeated iwabuchi pointed toward shimizu and his squad look at those army men theyre soft theyre ragged do you want to be like them youd better not you have to want to die for the emperor you have to be proud to die for the emperor the man who does not fear death the man who welcomes death will surely be triumphant hai captain iwabuchi the navy men said once more shimizu was furious though of course he did not show it in the presence of a superior a navy captain ranked with the commander of his regiment or any other army colonel too not just a superior but an almost godlike figure despite that shimizus own opinion of the special naval landing forces was not high they made good enough occupation troops but when they had to fight other soldiers they didnt fare so well despite these drills the army did a much better job of training its men in infantry tactics than the navy did captain iwabuchi went right on yelling at his men they might not fight skillfully under a leader like that but they would fight hard they would fear him more than they feared the americans and they would have reason to an officer like that would kill anybody who he thought was hanging back well leave this place a ruin well never give in he shrieked a ruin do you hear me not one brick left on top of another hes not so tough yasuo furusawa said but he sidled up to shimizu and spoke in the next thing to a whisper taking no chances that the fanatical officer could overhear him i was thinking the same thing shimizu answeredalso in a low voice after a moment he went on nothing wrong with dying for the emperor mind you theres no better end for a japanese soldier its an honor its a privilege hed had all that drilled into him in basic training and he believed it even so the real point though is to make the enemy die forhis country first hai furusawa nodded i think thats just right corporalsan and i dont think it ever once crossed that captain iwabuchis mind no i dont either but all we can do about it is feel sorry for those poor navy men maybe it wont matter senior private furusawa said maybe the real navy will beat the americans on the sea the way they did last year of course they will shimizu couldnt show doubt about anything like that it would have been unpatriotic he did think captain iwabuchi couldnt have been much of an officer if he were he would have had shipborne duty instead he was stuck doing things that werent really a navy officers proper job serves him right shimizu thought even after his squad turned the corner he could still hear captain iwabuchi screaming at his men and haranguing them he might push them too far japanese military men were an enduring lot they had to be but even endurance had its limits he wondered if iwabuchi might suffer an unfortunateoh such an unfortunate accident every once in a while things like that did happen the rest of the patrol stayed routine shimizu approved of routine routine meant nothing was going wrong it also meant he didnt have to think for himself if he didnt have to think he couldnt make any mistakes if he didnt make any mistakes his own superiors couldnt start yelling at him they wouldnt be as bad as captain iwabuchi but all the same he didnt fancy an officer shouting in his face and maybe slapping him around he brought his men back to the barracks he made his report to lieutenant horino the platoon commander he mentioned marching past the park where iwabuchi was drilling his men he couldnt very well leave it out ah horino said and what did you think of that corporal captain iwabuchi is a very energetic man sir shimizu said carefully horino laughed he certainly is all right corporal you may go shimizu saluted and left in a hurry hed got his message across and hadnt got in trouble for it that would doand then some lieutenant saburo shindo was less glad to be at sea again than hed expected akagi and her escorting destroyers and cruisers steamed north so did shokaku some kilometers away they wouldnt have sortied if there hadnt been good intelligence that the americans were on their way again he wished zuikaku were with them theyd had three carriers the last time they faced the us navy and theyd needed all of them the yankees might not be very skillful but they didnt give up that worried shindo whod thought conquering hawaii would be plenty to knock the usa out of the pacific war karma he muttered that submarine skipper had got lucky hed heard some of his superiors wondering if the americans had broken japanese codes but he didnt believe it how could gaijin ever learn japanese well enough to do such a thing it had to be impossible akagi and shokaku steamed toward the biggest breach the americans had torn in the line of picket boats it stood to reason that the yankees would try to send their ships through there he would have done the same thing if he commanded the american fleet commander fuchida was pacing along the flight deck he nodded to shindo your planes will be ready to fight when we make contact oh yes sir shindo answered of course sir shindo paused then asked do we know how big the enemy fleet is not exactly fuchida answered our best guess is that its about the same size as the one last year maybe one carrier more even with only two carriers of our own we should be able to handle that why dont we know better sir shindo asked because most of the yards where the americans build carriers are on their east coast fuchida said we cant do reconnaissance there and neither can germany their ships have to come through the panama canal to get at us shindo said cant we count them once theyve got to the pacific weve tried we havent had much luck fuchida told him weve lost a couple of hks that tried to spy on the canal the americans patrol aggressively in that area we didnt get any worthwhile information either too bad shindo said which was as close as he would come to criticizing any of his superiors he wanted to know what he was up against meticulous planning was a big part of what made the hawaii operation so successful shigata ga nai fuchida said which was true enough he clicked his tongue between his teeth i do wish we had zuikaku here with us though well shigata ga nai there too if the yankees have the same number of carriers and the same kinds of planes as they did last year well beat them again well beat the pants off them before fuchida could answer the publicaddress system called his name commander fuchida report to the bridge immediately commander fuchida report to the please excuse me fuchida said and dashed across the flight deck towards akagis island what was going on shindo waited for his own summons to the bridge or perhaps for the klaxons of general quarters neither came which left him stewing in his own juices a couple of minutes later though akagi changed course to starboard he nodded to himself the skipper had found out something he hadnt known before and then the pa system brayed to life again all flying crews report to the briefing room attention please all flying crews report to the briefing room at once now it was shindos turn to run as if possessed he sprinted for a hatchway the briefing room was on the hangar deck below the flight deck the soles of his shoes clanged on the iron treads of the stairs a few fliers beat him to the briefing room but only a few he found a seat near the front so he could get the best look at the maps and charts and blackboards there more and more men came in after him all chattering excitedly they knew they were liable to be going into action before long they quieted when commander fuchida and commander genda walked into the room the man who led air operations and the man who planned them waited a few minutes to let the laggards crowd in then minoru genda spoke without preamble we have found the enemy ah shindo made the same noise as most of the men around him the boys in intelligence hadnt been altogether asleep at the switch then they really had known the americans were coming akagi and shokaku had sailed in good time to give the enemy a warm reception the americans are moving more or less along the path we anticipated genda went on a sampan just east of the ones the yankees have been attacking spotted their ships and broke radio silence to deliver the warning the signal cut off abruptly before the message was completed saburo shindo knew what that meant the yankees had spotted the sampan or traced the signal some good men some brave men were dead yasukuni shrine held some new spirits it appears the us fleet may be somewhat larger than we expected commander fuchida said we shall engage it even so of course the more damage we do to it the harder the time the americans will have landing on oahu banzai for the emperor banzai banzai the cry filled the briefing room shindo joined it oahu has received the sampans signal genda said mitsubishi gms are airborne and will assist us in our attack on us forces more banzais rang out shindo joined those too though less wholeheartedly the gm was fast for a bomber and could carry a large load a long way there its virtues ended it was gruesomely vulnerable to enemy fighters with gallows humor gm pilots called their plane the oneshot lighter for the ease with which it caught fire and a good deal of combat had proved highlevel bombers had to be lucky to hit ships moving far below some of the gms doubtless would carry torpedoes but their pilots didnt have the practice carrierbased bn fliers got range to our targets is about three hundred kilometers fuchida said we want to strike as fast as we can before they are fully prepared suggestion sir shindos hand shot into the air yes lieutenant fuchida said we ought to fly a dogleg to the east or west before proceeding against the enemy shindo said that way he wont be able to follow the reciprocal of our course back to the ship whether he picks us up visually or with his fancy electronics the idea seemed to take fuchida by surprise he talked with genda in voices too low for shindo to make out what they were saying then with some reluctance he shook his head if we had worked this out with shokaku beforehand it would be a good ploy but we cant break radio silence to discuss it and we cant have our planes arriving over the target after hers a coordinated attack is vital yes sir shindo wished hed thought of it sooner but he could see that fuchidas reply made at least some sense genda added even if the americans get through i believe our combat air patrol should be able to handle them their torpedo bombers are waddling death traps and we will be more alert for their dive bombers last time akagi had been damaged zuikaku badly damaged shindo hoped genda wasnt being too optimistic but the powers that be werent wrong when they said a quick hard blow would serve japan best ill be with you fuchida said remembercarriers first everything else is an afterthought strike hard for the emperors sake banzai banzai shindo shouted along with the rest of the fliers banzai a scowling regular navy lieutenant commander prowled the front of the bunker hills briefing room he sipped from of all things a glass of milk as he paced no one laughed at him it soothed his ulcer which hed got perhaps not least from contemplating the idea of a fleet carrier full of reserve pilots the japs know were here he said without preamble one of their damn little picket boats got off a signal before we sank her odds are good well be seeing bandits before too long theyll get their strike in on us before we can hit them that means we probably have to take a punch and then knock them cold are you up for it gentlemen yes sir joe crosettis hungry howl was one among many hed been waiting for this day more than a year and a half since december now the japs seemed likely to be within arms reach or at least within hellcats reachat last the urge to go out and hit them all but overwhelmed him after another swig from that glass of milk the briefing officer said well youd better be your aircraft have cost uncle sam a nice piece of change so has your training such as it is he had a long nose excellent for looking down add in whatever you happen to be worth and it comes to quite a sum try to bring it backunless you find a good reason not to of course that last sobering sentence reminded joe this wasnt a game they were playing for keeps and there might be reasons not to come home he refused to worry about it he didnt think it would or could happen to him questions the briefing officer asked nobody said anything for a little while all joe wanted to know was where are the japs the briefing office couldnt tell him that not yet by the looks on the other fliers faces they felt the same way then someone asked sir what do we do if we run into enemy planes on the way to their ships that was a good question attacking the japanese aircraft along the way might make it harder for the japs to strike the us carriers here but it would also lessen the americans chances of knocking out the enemy carriers the briefing officer frowned youll have to use your best judgment on that gentlemen if you think you can hurt them do it if you think youll have a better shot at their carriers by avoiding contact do that joe turned to orson sharp and whispered whatever we do we get the credit if it works out and the blame if it doesnt what else is new sharp whispered back a response more cynical than he usually gave for now take your places in your aircraft the briefing officer said you dont have long to wait id bet my life on that he was betting his life on how well some of the pilots could do against a foe who had smashed us fliers whenever they met not this time joe thought fiercely as he hurried to his hellcat the ff wasnt a particularly pretty plane the big radial engine gave it a blunt nose like that of a prizefighter whod stopped too many lefts with his face a jap zero looked a lot more elegant but the hellcat had almost twice the horsepower more firepower with its battery of heavy machine guns sturdier construction selfsealing fuel tanks and good armor protecting the pilot the pilot the words werent an abstraction to joe not any more that means me he raced across the planking of the flight deck and scrambled up into his plane he slid the canopy shut and dogged it the cockpit smelled of leather and avgas and lubricants intimate odors and mechanical ones all mixed together joe longed for a cigarette but smoking around oxygen and highoctane gas was hazardous to your life expectancy sailors in yellow helmets and thin yellow smocks worn over their tunics stood by to direct the planes movements when they took off sailors in red helmets and smocks waited near the carriers island they were crash crews and repairmen the only men in blue helmets and smocksthe sailors who handled the planes while staticleft on the flight deck were the pair poised to take away the chocks that secured the lead hellcat in its place pilots start your engines it wasnt the voice of god roaring through the loudspeakers but that of the executive officer on the bunker hill as on any ship the skipper was god and the exec was his prophet joe knew a horrid fear that his engine wouldnt catch that he would have to stay behind but it roared to life with the others the prop blurred into nearinvisibility joe eyed the instruments it wasnt a test this time he wasnt sitting in a simulator or a lardbutt trainer this was for all the marbles the sailors in yellow formed a line across the flight deck prepare to launch planes came the command from the island joe heard it both over the loudspeakers and through his earphones the last two men in blue took the chocks away from the lead plane a man in yellow walked backwards making comehither motions with his hands the hellcat followed also at a walking pace just in front of the island stood a man with a checkered flag in his right hand he made grinding motions with his left the lead planes engine sped up another roar came from the loudspeakers launch planes the man with the flag made more grinding motions the lead planes motor raced the checkered flag went down the ff raced along the flight deck dipped as it shot off the bow then gained altitude again and shot up to take its place in what would soon be the greatest assemblage of naval airpower the world had ever known plane after plane took off after what seemed forever but was only a few minutes joes turn came he followed the beckoning sailor in yellow to the center of the deck revved his engine higher and higher at the flagmans signal and whooped when the checkered flag dropped now acceleration slammed him back in his seat as the hellcat darted forward that sickening lurch when it went off the deck he hauled back on the stick and gave the plane all the throttle she had up she went hell she might have been doing the indian rope trick the way she climbed nothing hed trained in even came close but an ff wasnt a widowmaker the way some hot planes were she played tough but she played fair and the higher joe got the more of the us fleet he could see spread out below him with any luck at all theyd give the japs the biggest kick in the ass the world had ever known along with bunker hill essex and three more brandnew fleet carriers steamed toward hawaii so did the repaired hornet so did ranger she wasnt an ideal combat carrier but she could carry planes to make this big fist even bigger and so did five light carriers which could keep up with their bigger sisters no matter what and close to a dozen escort carriers which couldnt the baby flattops would get left behind in a fastmoving action but among them they brought almost as many planes into action as the essexclass ships joe spotted his element leader and took his place below and to the right of the other hellcat hed wanted to lead an elementorson sharp led one but wingman was what theyd given him and he knew he had to squash that gnawing jealousy hed been good enough to get here goddammit if he did his job well he might be leading an element pretty damn quick dive bombers and torpedo planes went into formation with the fighters the torpedo planes were new grumman avengers not the lumbering douglas devastators that couldnt get out of their own way and had failed so miserably the year before all hands all hands listen up everybody excitement crackled in joes earphones on the shortrange planetoplane circuit the officer went on weve got a bearing on the japsa cruisers recon plane found the bastards i got the word just before i launched range about maybe course thatll get us close enough to find em on our own anyway lets go hunting the fierce shouts that filled joes head made him want to snatch off the earphones but he didnt he added to the din like a swarm of beesa big swarm of beesthe us aircraft buzzed south mitsuo fuchidas bn felt different with a torpedo from the way a bn had with bombs slung beneath the long heavy torpedo made the aircraft a bit slower a bit clumsier he shrugged he would do what needed doing anyway patches of white fluffy cloud sailed past every now and again for the most part though the sky was clear and the sea below calm as the yankees had the year before theyd picked better weather to attack hawaii than japan had at the end of fuchida shrugged again the united states could pick and choose as far as he could see japan hadnt had a choice roosevelt had cut off metal shipments frozen assets and most important stopped the flow of oil all to dislodge japan from her rightful empire in china if shed bowed to us extortion she would have been americas puppet forever after better to fight to seize the chance to be one of the great powers in the world he peered ahead hoping to catch sight of the american ships that was foolish as a glance at his watch told him he and his comrades hadnt flown nearly long enough to put the enemy in sight he clicked his tongue between his teeth he didnt have so many comrades as he would have liked only about planes were winging their way northa third as many as had flown against hawaii at the start of the war in the pacific he wished zuikaku hadnt been hit that had to be bad luck didnt it her planes would have made this sortie half again as strong airplanes ahead the words in his earphones were quietly spoken but they might as well have been screamed now he would see what the americans had come up with this time when he found the enemy air armada he thought for a moment he was seeing spots before his eyes that many planes he bowed in the cockpit not to the oncoming yankees but to admiral yamamoto the commanderinchief of the combined fleet had said before the war started that japan would have six months or a year to do as she pleased in the pacific but things would get much harder after that conquering hawaii had stretched japans hegemony out to a year and a half and even a little more but yamamoto as usual seemed to know what he was talking about as more japanese fliers saw the americans questions dinned in fuchidas earphones he commanded the emperors aircraft as he had at pearl harbor and in the first fight in the north pacific most of the increasingly alarmed queries boiled down to do we attack the enemys planes or do we go on to strike at his ships to fuchida that had only one possible answer we go for the american carriers he declared over the allplanes circuit without carrier decks to land on airplanes here are useless if we sink the enemys carriers he cannot possibly invade hawaii press on the americans should have been thinking along the same lines so it seemed to him anyway but taking advantage of their numbers they sent some of their fighters against the japanese strike force even before fuchida called orders some of the zeros shot ahead to defend the precious torpedo planes and dive bombers theyre coming very fast fuchida thought the americans had been flying higher than the japanese part of that speed came from losing altitudebut only part alarm tingled through him the enemy had something new wildcats couldnt have performed like this neither could zeros fuchidas bn had a pair of forwardfiring machine guns plus another pair in the rear cockpit controlled by the radioman be ready mizuki fuchida called through the intercom what else am i going to be sir the first flying petty officer replied theyd been together a long time mizuki could get away with backtalk that would have sent a lot of ratings to the brig fuchida didnt answer some of the enemy fighters ahead he saw were wildcats but they werent the ones attacking the japanese the americans knew wildcats couldnt equal zeros they thought these new machines could and they might have been right a zero tumbled toward the pacific trailing smoke another simply exploded in midair that pilot at least probably never knew what hit him fuchida waited to see enemy fighters going down too he finally spotted one but only after several japanese planes were lost the melee with the zeros that had gone out ahead of the main force didnt last long the americans in the new fighters knew the planes that could hurt their ships were more important they bored in on the nakajimas and aichis when fuchida tried to get one of the americans in his sights he had trouble holding it thereit was that fast he fired a quick burst then threw the bn sharply to the left the new fighter zoomed by close enough to give him a good look at the pilot the plane bore a family resemblance to an oversized wildcat but had been refined in almost every way possible how powerful was the engine that drove it strong enough to leave zeros in the dust plainly that was not good news mizuki fired a burst too his snarls came through the intercom so he hadnt hit anything either maybe hed made the american pull away that would be something anyhow not all the beefy new american fighters were turning away compared to them the aichis and nakajimas the japanese strikeforce pilots flew might have been nailed in place dive bombers and torpedo planes fell out of the sky one after another a few pilots cried out over the radio as they went down more didnt have the chance then like a summer lightning storm the americans were gone the rest of the japanese no doubt as horrified and dismayed as fuchida they flew on what waited for them when they found the enemy fleet dont dogfight the japs use your speed use your firepower people had been telling joe crosetti that from the minute he started training hed believed it too but only in the way he believed in the pythagorean theorem it was one more thing hed learned in school the minute he saw zeros maneuvering he suddenly understood why everybody said the same thing about them the japs turned tighter than anything hed flown probably since graduating from yellow perils get into a dogfight with them and theyd turn inside you and shoot your ass off diving past them raking them with your machine guns standing on the hellcats tail to climb again for another divethat looked like a better plan joes element leader was as green as he was but he also remembered the lessons they zoomed past the zeros guns blazing and then went after the japanese dive bombers and torpedo planesvals and kates in the reporting code theyd learned zeros were supposed to be zekes but most pilots called them zeros anyway back in school some people couldnt remember what the big deal about the square of the hypotenuse was sure as hell some of the navy pilots here couldnt remember not to get into a turning contest with the fighters with meatballs on their wings some of them paid for it too im going down somebody wailed somebody else shouted for his mother but mommy couldnt help him now as joe made for a kate the plane with the torpedo under its belly opened up on him tracers zipped past the cockpit he swung slightly to the left expecting the kate to turn to the right but the pilota slightly horsefaced fellow with a mustachepulled his plane to the left instead that caught joe by surprise and left him without a good shot at the kate there was a flight of vals the dive bombers seemed to waddle through the air their fixed landing gear made them look like antiques theyd done a hell of a lot of damage to allied ships though joes element leader bored in on them he shot one down almost at once they were built tougher than zeros but a few rounds through the engine would do the trick joe got one in his sights the other thing theyd said in school was get in close he did the val almost filled his sights before he thumbed the firing button on the stick flames shot from the machine guns on his wings recoil made the hellcat seem to stagger in the air joe whooped when he saw chunks of sheet metal fly off the val trailing smoke the plane spun down toward the ocean more than two miles below got him joe yelled fucking nailed him a moment later a jap in another val almost nailed him hed forgotten vals and kates carried rear gunners all his combat training had been fighter against fighter the assumption was that if he could handle that he could handle anything and so he couldif he didnt do something idiotic he dove to get away from the gunner he tried to count how many japanese planes went down he couldnt too much was happening too fast but the hellcats knocked down a good many he was sure of that he was swinging around for another go at the kates when the squadron leader summoned the american fighters back to the dauntlesses and avengers they were shepherding this is just act one boys the officer said weve got carriers to catch thats the blowoff he was right and joe knew it all the same he hated to break away saburo shindo was calm to the point of being boring he knew as much he even cultivated the image it made him all the more impressive on the rare occasions when he lost his temperor seemed to for effect now though he felt shaken to the core hed just seen his zerosplanes that had dominated every foe they facedhammered as if they were so many russian biplanes he hadnt thought it was possible but these new american fighters could outrun outdive and outclimb his beloved aircraft by margins embarrassingly large how had the yankees done it that there were such swarms of the new enemy planes only made things worse the american pilots were raw he saw that right away he was able to take advantage of it almost at once getting on an enemy planes tail and sending a burst of machinegun fire into it but he couldnt stay on its tail for long because it ran away from him with effortless ease and the machinegun rounds didnt knock it down or set it on fire wildcats had been able to take a lot of damageand needed to by all appearances this new and bigger fighter was tougher yet he used his mm cannon against the next american he fought they did the trickthe enemy plane spiraled down toward the sea but they were slowfiring and didnt have a lot of ammunition if he ran dry with them he was in trouble and he could be in trouble even if he didnt a bullet slammed into his right wingfortunately out near the tip past the fuel tank watching another zero going down trailing a comets tail of fire reminded him how inadequate the selfsealing on those tanks was and getting hit by a burst might well make his plane break up in midair even if it didnt burn zeros were built light to make them faster and more maneuverable everything came with a price though if they got shot up they often paid that price a horrified voice in his earphones what do we do sir theyre tearing us up protect the strike planes shindo answered banking frantically to try to protect himself theyre the ones that matter were just along for the ride even as he spoke another aichi dive bomber caught fire and plummeted the pilot probably dead giving the order and having it mean anything were very different the americans dove on the aichis and nakajimas flailed them with those heavy machine guns they carried streaked away before the protecting zeros could do much and climbed to deliver another punishing attack then quite suddenly they were gone they closed up on their own torpedo planes and dive bombers and flew on to the south towards akagi and shokaku shindo belatedly realized that his fighters hadnt had the chance to attack the enemys strike aircraft the combat air patrol above the japanese carriers would have to defend them and the combat air patrol above the americans carriers would have to defend them shindos lips skinned back from his teeth in a savage smile no one from the indian ocean to the eastern pacific here had yet managed to keep japanese navy fliers from striking what they intended to strike and he vowed to himself no one would now but how many carriers did the yankees have to have launched so many planes that was also a belated question he should have wondered sooner but all he could do now was shrug however many there are well deal with them thats all we have to he flew on on akagis bridge commander minoru genda got reports from the radiomen monitoring signals from the japanese aircraft and what they could pick up from the americans quietly rear admiral tomeo kaku said gentlemen it appears likely we will soon be under attack i rely on our airmen to hold the enemy at arms length and on our crew to fight the ship if for any reason the airmen are not completely successful sir from everything im hearing this attack will be larger and more severe than the one we faced last year genda warned our intelligence estimates of what the americans could throw at us seem too low kaku shrugged karma neh things are what they are we cant change them now all we can do is our best and i know we will do that was he really as calm as he seemed if he was genda whose heart pounded beneath his tunic admired him tremendously he couldnt help saying i wish we had zuikaku with us so do i but kaku shrugged again the yankees got lucky and we got not so lucky thats karma too here we are and here they are and weve got to beat them with what we have not with what we wish we had the officer in charge of the recently installed radar set was a young studious lieutenant named tanekichi furuta whod studied engineering at the university of southern california sir he said to kaku we have a signal coming out of the north range is about a hundred kilometers and closing i understand the skipper said he nodded to genda we have about twenty minutes commander any last notions that will give us a better chance all i can think of sir is to tell the fighters above our carriers to hit the enemy strike planes with everything they have and to ignore the us fighters as much as they can genda answered they should already know that though very well kaku nodded again we will wait then and be ready to maneuver and to shoot down as many enemy planes as possible yes sir genda said gravely akagi carried a dozen mm guns and fourteen twin mm mounts she could put a lot of shells in the air her escorts could put up even more how much good would all that firepower do in the last fight facing what was plainly a smaller strike force two of the three japanese carriers had been hit japanese fliers had given better than they got though so that battle proved a success could they do it again would this one all ahead full admiral kaku called down to the engine room in time of need akagi could be handled almost like a destroyer and time of need was coming the ships ahead of the carrier started shooting a moment later so did the carrier herself puffs of black smoke appeared in the sky trailing smoke an enemy planeone of the ferocious new fighters everyone was talking about cartwheeled into the sea a great splash and the aircraft was gone banzai someone called but how many more planes would have to fall before this battle became a success one thing joe crosetti hadnt trained for was antiaircraft fire there were obvious reasons why not if such training got too realistic he might have had to practice bailing out if he could as the attack force neared the japanese fleet shell bursts appeared in the sky ahead of him and then all around him when one shell burst not nearly far enough below him it was like driving a car over a nasty pothole you hadnt seenhe bounced sharply down and then sharply up again so that his teeth clicked together only after he tasted blood in his mouth did he realize hed bitten his tongue a few seconds later he got another pothole bump and something clanged into his fuselage jesus he yipped anxiously scanning all the dials on the instrument panel at once nothing seemed wrong or out of place he still had fuel oil hydraulics that clang scared him out of ten years growth just the same only one thing to dotake out his moment of panic on the japs the little yellow slanteyed sons of bitches thought they owned the world they thought they had the right to own the world and to take whatever pieces of it they fancied joe was here literally to show them they were wrong here they came the us hellcats had ripped into the japanese strike force now it was the japs turn to try to knock down as many dauntlesses and avengers as they could before the dive bombers and torpedo planes struck at their ships nobody could say the guys who flew those zeros werent game nobody could say the bastards didnt know their business either they understood just what they had to do and they aimed to do it if wildcats and hellcats got in their way they fought them otherwise they went for the planes that mattered more hit em boys the squadron leaders voice rasped in joes earphones the best defense is a good offense this is what we came for joes element leader needed no more encouragement than that come on crosetti he called lets go hunting roger joe answered and stuck with the other hellcat when it zoomed out ahead of the american dive bombers and torpedo planes as if to tell the japs theyd have to go through the fighters to get where they wanted to go the japanese fighters flew in what joe thought of as a gagglenot nearly such a rigid formation as the americans used it put him in mind of boxing against a southpaw you werent sure what was coming next they looked as if they ought to be easy to pick off one at a time if they were so damn easy though how come theyd given american pilots two successive sets of lumps around hawaii to say nothing of the black eye in the philippines oh shit that was the voice of joes element leader and panic filled it joe saw why too a zero had put a cannon shell into one of his wing tanks selfsealing was all very well but nothing would have stopped that leak or that fire im going down he wailed and he did spinning wildly joe hoped to see a chute open but there was nothing nothing at alljust a hellcat falling toward the sea an instant later an avenger blew up that wasnt gasoline catching on fire that was the torpedo slung under the aircraft blowing up a jap fighter must have made a lucky shot joe looked around frantically for someone to latch on to he felt naked and alone up there the way anybody suddenly bereft of his comrade would have for the time being he had nobody to keep an eye out for him and then suddenly somebody was flying alongside of him the other american pilot waved as if to say hed lost his leader and was looking for somebody to link up with by the way the fellow flew he was content to stay a wingman that wasnt how joe wanted to become an element leader but one of the fastest lessons he got in combat was that nobody gave a damn about what he wanted some of the avengers had already started heading down toward the pacific for their torpedo runs they werent the hopelessly slow hopelessly clumsy devastators that had preceded them but they werent any real match for zeros either several japanese fighters dove after them when joe saw that he laughed a very nasty laugh the zero that could outdive a hellcat hadnt been born yet he pointed then shoved his stick forward his fighters nose dropped as he dove after the japs his new wingman stuck like glue he got on a japs tail and thumbed the firing button the zero caught fire it went straight down into the ocean yelling like a red indian he went after another one this jap must have spotted him at the last second because the fellow did a flick roll and squirted away like a wet watermelon seed shot out between your fingers one second he was there the next gone son of a bitch joe said frustration mixed with reluctant respect the zero really was as maneuverable as people said joe sure wouldnt have tried that getaway in a hellcat but it worked like a charm still in evading him the jap had to break off his attack on the avengers so joe figured hed done his job and his altimeter was unwinding like a son of a bitch he leveled off at under two thousand feet then pulled the stick back and climbed if hed had any japs on his tail he would have left them behind as if theyd nailed their shoes to the floor as he gained altitude he got a look at the japanese ships not far ahead hed spent more than a year studying silhouettes and photos and models from every angle under the sunand he still had a devil of a time telling destroyers from cruisers cruisers from battleships even the carrier was hard to spot and he was damned if he knew for sure which one she was but that wasnt his headache not really he needed to run out of planes before he worried about ships he looked around for more zeros to shoot up fuchida had known it would be bad the american air armada and the ferocious attack it got off against the japanese strike force had warned him of that but nothing in his blackest nightmares had warned him it would be as bad as this american ships stretched as far as the eye could see as far and farther fuchida knewfew men knew betterthe resources the japanese empire had available raw fear almost made his hand shake on the torpedo planes stick how were those slender resources going to stand against this a warriors iron steadied him japan had beaten the americans before one welltrained man who despised death was worth half a dozen of the ordinary kind so his countrys doctrine insisted and so it had seemed up till now if however the enemy opposed you with a dozen ordinary men he shook his head he would not think like that the japanese strike force had plenty even now to blunt the force of this attack he believed that he had to believe it the alternative was feeling that rising panic again commandersan the voice on the intercom belonged to his bombardier hai fuchida did his best to suppress what was going on inside him but he could still hear the tension even in that oneword response sir i was just thinkingits a shame we cant carry two torpedoes the rating said fuchida broke up right there in the cockpit he didnt think hed ever done that before laughter washed away the last of the fear domo arigato imurasan he said i needed that well just have to do what we can with what weve got from the rear cockpit mizuki the radioman said thats what the man with the little dick said when he went to bed with the geisha both fuchida and imura snorted fuchidas confidence having returned now soared how could his country lose when it had men who cracked silly jokes in the face of death the americans seemed intent on showing him exactly how japan could lose the destroyers and cruisers protecting the us carriersand were those battleships out ahead of them too threw up a curtain of flak the likes of which hed never seen before that didnt worry him so much though the antiaircraft fire would knock down a few planes but only a few you went ahead and did your job and didnt worry about it if you and an enemy shell happened to wind up in the same place at the same time that was hard luck and you couldnt do a thing about it but the yankees despite having dispatched such an enormous strike force against akagi and shokaku also kept a formidable combat air patrol above their own fleet wildcats and the new fighterswhose name fuchida did not knowtore into the attacking japanese planes mizukis rearfacing machine guns chattered scared the baka yaro off the radioman said triumphantly and he must have for no machinegun bullets tore into the torpedo plane fuchida allowed himself the luxury of a sigh of relief he hadnt even seen the enemy plane mizuki fired at two burning zeros plummeted into the pacific part of the problem was that the new american fighters looked a lot like bigger versions of the wildcats with which they mingled they were plainly descended from the planes with which fuchida and the japanese were familiar but any careless zero pilot who tried to take them on as if they were wildcats discovered hed made a mistakeusually his last one zeros could outfly the older american fighters but not these not these a piece of shrapnel clanged against fuchidas wing he glanced to the left he didnt see fire that deservedand gotanother sigh of relief from him then the curtain of antiaircraft fire eased hed brought his nakajima past the enemys screening ships a carrier loomed ahead it threw out its own flak of course tracers stabbed toward him he ignored them a torpedo run had to be straight ready he called to the bombardier ready sir imura answered a hair to the right sir if you please i think shell try to dodge to port when we launch fuchida made the adjustment the torpedo splashed into the sea the nakajima suddenly grew lighter faster and more maneuverable now fuchida wished he were only a spectator and a man who had to get out of there alive if he could but as the officer in overall command of the japanese air strike he had to linger and do what he could to direct his countrymen against the enemy and lingering in this neighborhood was asking not to grow old diving against a yankee carrier may the emperor live ten thousand years the radio call made fuchida look around to see if he could find the attacking aichi but the americans were spread out over so much ocean he couldnt spot it it might have been a good many kilometers away he didnt see any sudden great plume of smoke rising from a stricken ship either too bad he thought the pilot in this wildcat flew his plane as aggressively as if it were one of the new american fighters saburo shindo didnt mind that at all aggressiveness was a great virtue in a fighter pilotwhen he had the aircraft that could make the most of it this fellow didnt not against a zero shindo got on his tail and stayed there pumping bullets into the enemy plane till at last it caught fire and went down shooting down enemy fighters was the reason hed accompanied the japanese dive bombers and torpedo planes against the americans doing his job should have given him more satisfaction especially since he was good at it today he felt like a man snatching up whatever he could as he escaped a burning house he might hang on to a few trinkets a few toys but the house would still be gone forever two american fighters knocked down a nakajima just as it started its run against an enemy ship shindo was too far away to help or to draw off the american planes he could only watch helplessly that summed up how he felt about too much of this fight the japanese strike force from akagi and shokaku that had done such splendid work around hawaii was getting hacked to bits before his eyes one after another planes tumbled into the sea where would more highly trained highly experienced pilots and aircrew come from after these men were gone he had no idea he also had no idea whether he would live long enough for the question to be anything but academic to him the americans were hitting the strike force with everything they had and they had more than hed ever imagined he felt like a man whod stuck his hand into a meat grinder being an experienced fighter pilot had drilled the habit of checking six into him that let him spot an onrushing american plane in time to pull up and roll away the enemy zoomed by without being able to open fire on him had this fellow flown a wildcat shindo would have gone after him in turn but the yankee had one of the new fighters chasing them in a zero was like trying to fly up to the sun you could try sure but it wouldnt do you any good banzai the victory shout made shindo look around he hadnt heard it nearly often enough in this fight he felt like cheering himself when he saw a us carrier on fire and listing to starboard something had gone right about time too but how many carriers formed the core of this fleet however many there were they far outnumbered the half dozen japan had used to open the war against the usa his own country had been prepared to lose a third of that force if it meant a successful attack would the americans be any less ruthless in their counterattack it seemed unlikely shindosan are you still there this is fuchida yes sir im still here what are your orders weve done everything we can here i thinkand the americans will have done what they can do to us fuchida answered shindo wished hed left out the second part of the observation no matter how true it was the strikeforce commander went on time to return to our ships yes sir shindo repeated stolidly whether the japanese carriers were still there was anybodys guess shindo knew as much and no doubt fuchida did too that didnt mean the senior officer was wrong they had to try all of akagis antiaircraft guns seemed to be going off at once the heavy and the light together the din on the bridge was indescribable genda and the other officers had to shout to make themselves heard admiral kaku had the conn himself genda could do things the skipper couldnt his strategic grasp reached from hawaii into the indian ocean while he doubted tomeo kaku cared a sens worth about anything that happened beyond the ends of akagis flight deck but kaku handled the carrier the way a fighter ace flew his zero as if the craft were an extension of his own body genda admired his skill and knew he would never be able to match it himself not if he lived to be ninety machine guns blazing an american fighter raked the flight deck from no higher than the top of the island despite the bellowing antiaircraft guns the enemy escaped that is a brave man genda said zakennayo somebody else replied how many of our brave men did he just shoot up genda had no answer for that helldivers someone screeched genda involuntarily looked up though steel armor kept him from seeing the sky but then he didnt need to see to imagine dive bombers racing down towards akagi he was one of the men whod brought the technique to japan and hed brought it from the usa rear admiral kaku swung the wheel hard to port then even harder to starboard muscles in his shoulders bunched as he tried to force the carrier to respond to his will at once bombs splashed into the sea all around akagi but the first few missed so far so good genda thought then another shout pierced the racket on the bridge torpedo torpedo to port this isnt fair was what went through gendas mind too much happening all at once he and his countrymen had kept the americans offbalance through the first two fights in hawaiian waters now the shoe was on the other foot and much less comfortable this way cursing horribly kaku yanked the wheel to port again intending to turn into the torpedos path but either that took him into the path of the dive bombers overhead or the yankee pilots simply guessed with him and outguessed him three bombs hit akagi near the stern amidships and right at the bow the next thing genda knew he was on the floor one of his ankles screamed at him when he tried to put weight on it he hauled himself upright anyhowduty shouted louder than pain several men were down and wouldnt get up again the steel beneath his feet had twisted like cardboard and was awash in blood kaku still wrestled with the wheel he went on cursing for a few seconds then said something worse than the blackest of oaths she doesnt answer her helm if akagi couldnt steer kaku turned to the speaking tube to shout down to the engine room a ship could be guided crudely by her engines it wasnt much but it was what they had the torpedo hit then as near amidships as made no difference akagi had taken a torpedo from a plane off the lexington during the first strike against hawaii that fish like a lot of the ones the americans used in the first months of the war proved a dud this onewasnt genda found himself on the floor again getting up a second time hurt even more than it had the first all the same he did it once he was on his feet he wondered why hed bothered for a moment he also wondered if he could stand straight then he realized the problem wasnt his but akagis the ship had a list one that worsened every minute flames were shooting up through holes in the flight deck too men with hoses fought them but they werent having much luck my apologies commander admiral kaku said as if hed accidentally bumped into genda sir weve got to abandon ship genda blurted as if to underscore his words an explosion shook akagi maybe that was aviation gasoline going up or maybe it was the carriers munitions starting to cook off calmly tomeo kaku nodded you are correct of course i will give the order he spoke into the intercom which by some miracle still functioned all hands prepare to abandon ship this is the captain speaking all hands prepare to abandon ship bowing politely to genda he went on you should head for the flight deck now commander i see you have an injured leg give yourself all the time you need yes sir genda took one lurching stride towards a doorway twisted open what about you sir what about me kaku smiled a sweet sad smile this is my ship commander genda couldnt very well misunderstand that he did protest sir you should save yourself so you can go on serving the emperor japan needs all the capable senior officers she can find i know you younger men feel that way kaku said smiling still if that course seems right and proper to you then you should follow it as for me i have made mistakes here if i had not made mistakes i would not be losing akagi the least i can do is atone to his majesty for my failure sayonara commander after that nothing would change his mind recognizing as much genda bowed and limped away the last he saw of rear admiral kaku akagis skipper was fastening his belt to a chair so he would be sure to go down with his ship when genda got to the flight deck he saw more flames leaping up from the bomb hit at the stern come on boys over the side a petty officer shouted sounding absurdly cheerful swim away from the hull as fast as you can mind so the undertow doesnt drag you down when she sinks that was good sensible advice and the ships growing list made going over the side easier genda cursed when he hit the water even so that ankle was definitely sprained and might be broken he rolled over onto his back and pulled away from akagi with his arms american fighters strafed sailors in the sea bullets kicked up splashes only a few meters from him he swam past a dead man leaking scarlet into the pacific the blood would draw sharks but sharks at the moment were the least of his worries their antiaircraft guns still blazing destroyers circled the doomed akagi to pick up survivors some men clambered up cargo nets hung from the sides with his bad leg genda couldnt climb he clung to a line till sailors aboard the yukikaze could haul him up to the deck domo arigato he said when he tried to stand on that bad leg it wouldnt bear his weight he had to sit and watch akagi slide beneath the waves his face crumpled tears ran down his cheeks since he was already soaking wet only he noticed he looked away from the carrier that had fought so long and so well and noticed he was far from the only man off akagi doing the same she deserved mourningand so did admiral kaku whod never left the bridge an exultant voice howled in joe crosettis earphones scratch one flattop yells and cheers and curses rang out as the enemy carrier sank how do you like that you jap bastards joe shouted he looked around for more zeros and didnt see any some might still be airborne but not close to him hed made a few runs at sailors bobbing in the sea but decided he could hurt the enemy worse by shooting up his ships that felt like a real duel because the japs shot back for all they were worth watching sailors scatter was a hell of a lot of fun after hed made a couple of passes an authoritative voice sounded off attention hellcat pilots weve got a formation of bandits coming up from the south at about feet time to give them a friendly american welcome hey joe needed a few seconds to figure out where south was hed got all turned around in his strafing runs when he did he started to climb his new wingman still clung like a burr which was what a wingman was supposed to do he wondered who the guy was and from which carrier hed taken off there were the bandits buzzing along as if they didnt have a care in the world if they didnt they were about to joe had trouble recognizing ships but planes he knew he clicked through a mental card file bombers twinengined streamlinedthey looked like flying cigars bettys he thought they could carry bombs or torpedoes the point of the exercise as far as he was concerned was to make sure they didnt get the chance to use whatever they were carrying theyd seen the american fighters and started taking evasive action that was pretty funny they werent slow and they werent completely ungraceful but no bomber had a prayer of outdodging a fighter that wanted to come after it the bettys also started shooting they carried several machine guns in blisters on the fuselagealmost impossible to aim welland a mm cannon in a clumsy turret at the rear of the plane when joe got on the tail of one the jap in that rear turret started banging away at him the cannon didnt shoot very fast thered be a flash and a puff of smoke as the shell burst then a little while later another one joe fired a burst as he swung the hellcats nose across that turret the tail gunner stopped shooting wounded or dead with that annoyance gone joe sawed the hellcats nose across the bettys left wing root and squeezed off another burst sure as hell the bomber caught fire intelligence said bettys carried a lot of fuel to give them long range and that they lacked armor and selfsealing tanks it sure looked as if intelligence knew what it was talking about he went after another bomber and shot it down just the same way the poor bastard in the rear turret never had a chanceand once he was gone none of the weapons the betty carried could damage a tough bird like a hellcat except by luck joe knew a moments pity for the fliers trapped in their burning planes but only a moments they would have bombed his carrier if theyd got the chance and they would have yelled banzai while they did it too screw em still three miles was a hell of a long way to fall when you were on fire other us pilots found different ways of attacking the bettys some flew straight at the bombers and shot up their cockpits others climbed past them and dove like falcons stooping on doves the unescorted bettys were slaughtered watching taking part joe again felt tempted to pity but again not for long this was the enemy the only reason they werent doing the same thing to him was that they couldnt they surely wanted to trails of smoke and flame told of betty after betty going into the pacific they never had a chance they must have counted on getting close to the american fleet without being spotted they might have done some damage if they had the way things were it was a massacre lets head for home children the squadron leader said weve got one enemy carrier sunk one enemy carrier dead in the water and burning no other carriers spotted by the size of the enemy strike it probably set out from two ships we did what we came to do in other words weve cleared the way for things to go forward that sounded good to joe he wanted to shoot up some more japanese ships but a glance at the fuel gauge told him hanging around wasnt a good idea he had to find north again the same way hed had to find south when he went after the bettys he shook his head with amazement that approached awe two bettys for sure he thought hed got a zero and a kate one fight and he was within shouting distance of being an ace hed dreamt about doing stuff like that but hed had trouble believing it believe it or not hed done it he hoped orson sharp was okay hed looked around whenever he got the chancewhich wasnt very oftenbut he hadnt spotted his longtime roomie he kept telling himself that didnt prove anything one way or the other sharp was probably looking around for him too and not finding him on he went toward the north he wondered how much damage the jap strike force had been able to do less than it would have before it tangled with the american planes that was for damn sure and where would the japs land now both of their carriers were out of business would they go on to oahu maybe some of the zeros could get there but the vals and kates didnt have a chance oh too bad joe said and laughed he might have been speaking of the devil because he got a radio call on the allplanes circuit from a hellcat a few miles ahead of him heads up boys here come the japs on the way homeexcept they dont know home burned down every plane we splash now is one more we dont have to worry about later on joe didnt need long to spot what was left of the enemys air armada he whistled softly to himself the japs had had a lot more planes the first time the american strike force ran into them the us fleets antiaircraft guns and the combat air patrol must have done a hell of a job that looked like good news zeros still escorted the surviving dive bombers and torpedo planes hellcats roared to the attack joe took another look at his fuel gauge hed be pushing it if he gunned his bird real hardbut why was he in this cockpit if not to push it he saw a kate flying south as if it didnt have a care in the world was that the sneaky bastard whod given him the slip last time by jinking left instead of right he nodded to himself he thought so fool me once shame on you he said fool me twice shame on me he goosed the hellcat and raced toward the jap torpedo plane commander mitsuo fuchidas heart was heavy as lead inside him he knew the strike force he led hadnt come close to defeating and driving back the us fleet in words of one syllable the japanese had got smashed a glance at the battered remnants of the strike force was enough to tell him that far too many japanese planes had never got to the american fleet of the ones that had far too many hadnt got away and what would become of the ones that had done everything they were supposed to do that was another good question one much better than he wished it were hed seen the size of the american strike force when its path crossed his what had the yankees done to the japanese fleet were any flight decks left for these few poor planes to land on he checked his fuel gauge hed been running as lean as he could but he didnt have a chance of getting back to oahu with what was in his tanks and he knew it he hadnt said anything to his radioman and bombardier not yet no point borrowing trouble not when they already had so much maybe akagi or shokaku maybe akagi and shokaku still waited he could hope hope didnt hurt and didnt cost anything one of the handful of zeros still flying with the strike force waggled its wings to get fuchidas attention he waved to show hed got the signal the pilot yes that was shindo fuchida might have known he was too tough and too sneaky for the americans to kill pointed south fuchidas eyes followed that leathergloved index finger there in the privacy of the cockpit he groaned running into the us strike force coming and going struck him as most unfair though it wasnt really surprising not when both air fleets had to fly reciprocal courses to strike their enemies and return attention he called over the allplanes circuit attention enemy aircraft dead ahead that would wake up anybody who hadnt noticed then he added what was under the circumstances the worst thing he could say they appear to have seen us what do we do now commandersan petty officer mizuki asked we try to get through them or past them said fuchida who had no better answer how and what if they succeeded hope one of the carriers still survived hope some of the other ships in the japanese fleet still survived so he might be rescued if he ditched that struck him as most likely and also as a very poor best reaching the japanese fleet would be an adventure in itself here came the americans fuchida tried to get some feel for their numbers some feel for how many the combat air patrol over akagi and shokaku and the fleets antiaircraft had shot down it wasnt easy not with enemy planes spread out all over the sky ahead the shortest answer he could find was not as many as i wish they had brave as a daimyos hunting dogs the zeros shot ahead to try to hold the americans away from the aichis and nakajimas that might hurt enemy ships in some later fight if they still had a flight deck to land on but there werent nearly enough zeros to do the job a few american fighters engaged them that kept them busy while the other yankees roared on toward the japanese dive bombers and torpedo planes fuchida fired a burst at an onrushing american fighter that was more a gesture of defiance and warning than a serious attempt to shoot down the american his bn made a good torpedo plane the nakajima had also made a pretty good level bomber though it was obsolete in that role now it had never been intended to make a fighter after squeezing off the burst fuchida flung the aircraft to the left as he had on the way north then hed shaken off his attacker this time to his horror and dismay the enemy went with him without an instants hesitation the american plane carried half a dozen heavy machine guns not two feeble popguns like the bn bullets slammed into the torpedo plane oil from the engine sprayed across the windshield the bombardier screamed so did mizuki fuchida wondered why he hadnt been hit himself it wouldnt matter for long the plane was falling out of the sky and he couldnt do a damn thing about it still wrestling with the controls he shouted get out get out if you can the pacific rushed up to meet him he braced himself knowing it would do no good impact blackness a column of smoke guided saburo shindo to shokaku s funeral pyre the carrier burned from stem to stern destroyers clustered around her taking off survivors he supposed they would torpedo her before long she deserved a merciful coup de grace as a samurai committing seppuku deserved to have a second finish him after hed shown he had the courage to slit his own belly akagi was already gone shindo had found no sign of the proud carrier from which hed taken off that made things about as bad as they could be antiaircraft shells burst around him some of the ships down there feared he might be an american coming back for another strike baka yaro he snarled yes they were idiots but hadnt they earned the right he watched an aichi go into the sea not far from a destroyer the aircraft was lost but the crew might live few strike planes had managed to come even this far after two encounters with the us strike force and after the furious defense above the american fleet the japanese had taken a beating the likes of which they hadnt known since when the encounter with the korean turtle ships at the end of the sixteenth century no other comparison occurred to shindo but this had to be worse he thought about ditching too thought about it and shook his head unlike the nakajimas and aichis he had a chance to get back to oahu hawaii would need as many airplanes as possible to defend her japan certainly wouldnt be able to bring in any more if he could land his zero he should on he flew then a cruiser burned not far south of shokaku again lesser ships were rescuing survivors they probably should have been fleeing back toward hawaii too the americans were bound to strike again as soon as they could what the devil could stop them now this whole fleet lay at their mercy perhaps half a dozen other zeros remained in the sky with him shindo shook his head in disbelief those few fighters were all that was left of two fleet carriers worth of air power zuikaku was laid up at pearl harbor a sitting duck for american air strikes he hoped her air contingent had moved to land bases on oahu even if the planes were gone though half of japans fleetcarrier strength would have to be written off the yankees had put more fleet carriers into this strike than japan had leftto say nothing of their swarm of light carriers what are we going to do he muttered he had no idea whatever it was it would be under the armys aegis from now on japans naval presence in and around hawaii had just collapsed a man would have to be blind to think anything different shindo hoped he could see trouble clearly anyhow the engine on one of the surviving zeros quit maybe the plane had a small fuel leak maybe it had just flown too hard in the battle either way it wouldnt get back to oahu the pilot saluted as he started the long glide down to the ocean maybe he could ditch smoothly maybe a japanese ship would find him if he did but his chances werent good and he had to know it shindo wondered what his own chances were hed flown hard too he throttled back even more using just enough power to stay airborne soon he thought soon ill see the island and he did the engine started coughing not long afterwards but he got down on the haleiwa airstrip hed flown from there during the japanese invasion of hawaii now he would have to defend it against an american return hed never really expected jane armitage waited for nightfall wishing she were dead the way she did every day a couple of the women whod been dragooned into the japs military brothel had found ways to kill themselves part of her envied them but she didnt have the nerve to follow in their footsteps she told herself she wanted to stay alive to see the usa avenge itself on japan that was true but most of what held her back was simple fear she looked out through the barred window of her room another perfect late afternoon in wahiawa not too hot not too cold not too muggy not too dry blue sky a few white clouds bright sunshine this hell of a place was all the more hellish for sitting in the middle of paradise japanese soldiers hurried by wherever they were going they didnt have time to pause for a fast fuck some of them acted antsy jabbering away in their incomprehensible language sometimes even shouting at one another she hoped they had plenty to be antsy about a knock on the door that wasnt a horny jap soon yes but not yet that was supper she opened the door a tiny grayhaired chinese woman handed her a tray she didnt speak any english the japs made sure of such things how much practice had they had running brothels like this plenty plainly supper was better and there was more of it than if shed still been working her little vegetable plot she didnt care the rice and fish and cabbage tasted like ashes in her mouth she wasnt getting close to enough to eat for her sake oh no the japs just didnt want her to be too skinny to please her customers the chinese woman came back in a bit to take the tray to the kitchen she held up her hand with fingers and thumb outspread jane nodded dully next jap soldier or sailor in five minutes she took off the mens pajamas that were all they let her wear and lay down on the bed naked some days she couldnt stand it and she fought knowing fighting was hopeless the japs beat her up and then did what they wanted anyway today she didnt have it in her to fight if she did her best to believe it wasnt happening she could get through till they let her quit then she could go to sleep and have another day just like this one to look forward to another knock on the door this one peremptory jane didnt say anything she just lay there the door opened anyhow of course in came a jap he smiled at her nakedness she pretended he wasnt there and kept on pretending even when he dropped his pants and got on top of her he did what he did his weight was heavy on her his breath sour in her face he squeezed her breasts but not quite painfully hard it could have been worse it had been worse plenty of times a slightly better than average rape oh joy he grunted and jerked and then pulled out and got off her a stupid grin on his face up came his trousers out the door he went without a backwards glance half a minute later another one of those hereicome knocks she hadnt even had time to douche not that that would have done much against either disease or getting knocked up in came the next one an older man a sergeant she flinched inside and hoped it didnt show the older guys were more likely to be mean they fed off fear too this one let his trousers fall around his ankles in the middle of the little room and motioned for jane to get down on her knees in front of him she tried not to let him know she understood she particularly hated that she had to do it not let it be done to her she wanted to bite down hard every single time too only the fear of what theyd do to her if she did held her back when she kept acting stupid the sergeant yanked her out of bed and put her where he wanted her he was shorter than she was but strong as an ox he motioned that hed slap her into the middle of next week if she didnt get down to business hating him hating herself more she did at least he wasnt very big she gagged less that way she wished she had enough japanese to tell him what a little prick he was she hadnt got very far when he suddenly pushed her away that was out of the ordinary he waddled the three or four steps to the window pants still at half mast and stared out that was when jane realized the deep bass rumble she felt as much as heard was real was outside herself not the product of her own mind grinding itself to pieces the jap twitched as if hed stuck his finger into an electric socket he said something that should have set the peeling wallpaper on fire then still cussing a blue streak he pulled up his pants and dashed out of the room jane jumped to her feet and ran to the window anything that would make him give up on a blowjob halfway through was something she had to see and she did the sky was full of planes flying in from the northwest they were a long way up but they didnt look like any shed ever seen before that and the japs reaction made a sudden wild hope spring to life in her are they american she thought please god let them be american i stopped believing in you when you did this to me but ill start again if theyre american i swear i will antiaircraft guns in and around wahiawa started banging away the racket sounded like the end of the world but it was the sweetest music jane had ever heard whatever this was it wasnt just a nuisance raid like the one the year before there were dozens and dozens maybe hundreds of planes up there nobody could have sent so many without meaning business jane blinked from what she knew about the state of the artwhich as an officers more or less exwife was a fair amountnobody could have sent that many planes from the mainland at all bs that flew into hawaii did so unarmed with no bomb load and arrived almost dry just the same or they had in this was the state of the art must have changed while she wasnt looking and it had by godby the god she began believing in again with all her heart and all her soul and all her might the bombers started unloading on wheeler field and schofield barracks just the other side of the kamehameha highway from wahiawa the brothel shook the window glass rattled a not very badly aimed bomb would turn that glass into shrapneland might turn her into hamburger she backed away from the window tears streaming down her face all at once she wanted to live and if that wasnt a miracle what would be screams and cheers from other rooms said she wasnt the only one either then she heard another kind of scream one of pain not joy one of the women trapped there must have started celebrating even with a jap in her room that was foolish which didnt mean jane wouldnt have done the same damn thing more bombs burst and still more it sounded as if the americans were really giving it to the airport and the barracks kill em all jane yelled come on damn you kill em all kenzo and hiroshi takahashi had the oshima maru to themselves kenzo didnt know exactly where his father was at the japanese consulate the radio studio maybe even iolani palace his old man was in tight with the occupying authoritiesand in hog heaven the less kenzo heard about it the better he liked it hiroshi was at the rudder kenzo minding the sampans sailsor rather not minding them very well pay attention goddammit hiroshi barked stop mooning about your girlfriendshe isnt here yeah kenzo said but he couldnt stop thinking about elsie going to bed with a girl would do that he wasnt likely to forget the set of lumps those japanese soldiers had given him either if that had turned out even a little different they would have kicked him to death hed hoped his old man could do something about thatfind out who the soldiers were get them in trouble something no such luck the way his father looked at things the beating was his own damn fault if he hadnt got the soldiers mad at him they would have left him alone that theyd wanted to gangrape his girlfriend had nothing to do with anything pay attention hiroshi said again were not just running before the wind this time i know i know kenzo couldnt very well help knowing they had the wind to starboard they were sailing west to try their luck in the kaieiewaho channel between oahu and kauai they hadnt caught much sailing south lately those waters were getting fished out not so many sampans headed this way that was what hiroshi had concluded after listening to a good deal of fishermens gossip kenzo hoped his brother turned out to be right whats going on there hiroshi pointed north towards oahu huh kenzo had been thinking about elsie again his eyes followed hiroshis forefinger son of a bitch he said a swarm of japanese planes was rising from what had been hickam field near pearl harbor as the two takahashi brothers watched they shook themselves out into formation and flew north some kind of drill kenzo hazarded maybe hiroshi didnt sound convinced theyre always grousing about how they dont have a hell of a lot of gasoline though thats a lot of planes to send up on an exercise yeah but what else could it be kenzo answered his own question before his brother could maybe the good guys are getting frisky again the good guys hed thought of the usa that way even before the japanese soldiers literally jumped on him with both feet of course now his feelings for the country in which he was born had doubled and redoubled so had his fear that he wouldnt get credit for those feelings no matter what if the americans came back to hawaiino when they came backwhat would he be just another jap and one whose father was a collaborator for now he needed to remember he was a fisherman first and foremost the winds got tricky as the oshima maru rounded barbers point at the southwestern corner of oahu and even trickier once they passed kaena point the islands westernmost extremity by then it was late afternoon dont you think we ought to get more out into the middle of the channel before we drop our lines kenzo asked hiroshi shook his head thats what everybody else does as far as kenzo could see everybody else did it for a perfectly good reason too the fish were most likely to be there but he didnt argue with his brother hed argued with too many people over too many things lately okay fine he said have it your way they were sure to catch enough to keep themselves eating if they didnt catch more than that hiroshi would have to go out into the middle of the channel wouldnt he he dumped baitminnows and offalinto the pacific he and kenzo lowered the lines into the blue blue water now we wait hiroshi said a sentence that could have passed from one fisherman to another anywhere in the world since the beginning of time a mackerel leaping out of the water not far from the sampan told kenzo catchable fish swam nearby it told hiroshi the same thing he looked as smug as their father did when japan figured out some new way to make things tough on the usa kenzo damn near told him so but that would have started an argument too when they hauled up the lines they brought in ahi and aku and mahimahiand some sharks with them the next little while was the frantic part of the operation they gutted fish and got them in the storage hold as fast as they could one of the sharks about a threefooter almost bit kenzo and kept flopping and thrashing even after hed torn out its insides damn things really dont die till after sundown he said youd better believe it they hiroshi broke off he cocked his head to one side whats that i dont hear anything kenzo pausedhed just made a liar of himself oh wait a minute now i do sounds like thunder hiroshi snorted and with reason the day was fine and clear with hardly a cloud in the sky pick something that makes sense why dont you okay maybe its bombs kenzo said the first thing that popped into his mind once hed said it though he realized how much sense it made the low rumbles were coming from the direction of oahu sure as hell hope tingled through him maybe the americans are really paying a call itd be a big one if they are hiroshi said which was true for the noise went on and on since neither one of them could do anything about it they both went back to gutting fish a few minutes later kenzo looked east again when he didnt return to work right away hiroshi looked that way too they whistled softly at the same time thick columns of black greasylooking smoke were climbing up over the waianae range that is an air raid a damn big one kenzo said after gauging the position of the smoke plumes he added looks like theyre pounding the crap out of schofield and wheeler looks like youre right hiroshi said once hed made the same calculations theyve got to be hitting other places too only we cant see those from where were at yeah kenzo hadnt thought of that but his brother was bound to be right wheeler field was one of the most important airstrips on oahu if the americans hit that one theyd hit hickam and ewa and kaneohe and the others too and if they were hitting airstrips like that maybe the invasions really on maybe jesus christ i hope so hiroshi said about time if it is the intermittent thunder of explosions ceased but the rumble from the east didnt if anything it got louder kenzo suddenly pointed will you look at that jesus christ hiroshi said again this time in tones approaching real reverence the sky was full of planes streams of them and they were flying west from oahu toward kauai that took a lot of them right over the oshima maru kenzo and hiroshi stared up in openmouthed awe kenzo had seen pictures of bs before the war started some of the big fourengined bombers matched what he remembered of those pictures others were a new breed with longer narrower wings and tails with twin rudders the roar of the engines overhead seemed to make the sampan vibrate where are they going to land hiroshi whispered beats me kenzo answered he hadnt known kauai had an airstrip long enough to land planes that big maybe the japanese had built one although he thought theyd done as little as they could on all the islands except oahu still he didnt figure that swarm of bombers would have headed for kauai if they didnt have somewhere to put down well tell our grandchildren about this day hiroshi said yeah kenzo nodded lets just hope we live to have em when corporal takeo shimizu heard the airraid sirens go off he didnt worry much another american nuisance raid he thought the americans sent seaplanes over hawaii the way japan sent them over the us west coast theyd drop a few bombs and then theyd either get shot down or go away but orders were orders come on he called to his men out of the barracks and into the trenches put the cards and the go boards away you can pick up the games when you come back grumbling the soldiers followed him outside grumbling even more they scrambled down into the trenches theyd dug in the lawn in front of the stucco building people who stained their uniforms swore sure as sure theyd get gigged for dirty clothes at roll call tomorrow morning when shimizu heard aircraft engines overhead he was relieved at first hear how many there are he said those must be our bombers coming back from the practice run they were on i dont think so sir please excuse me senior private furusawa said this is a deeper noise our engines have a higher pitch shimizu listened a little longer the noise did seem different still sounds like a lot of planes to me not the ones and twos the yankees send they dont usually come by daylight either are you saying before he could finish antiaircraft guns started banging the gunners didnt think the planes overhead were japanese and shimizu heard the flat harsh crump crump crump of bursting bombs he heard more of those explosions than he ever had when the japanese were conquering hawaii he looked up into the sky his jaw dropped those werent american seaplanes hed grown familiar with their bigbellied lines those were bombers monster bombers swarms of them most flew to the west in the direction of hickam field and pearl harbor but some came right over honolulu and the likeliest reason they came right over honolulu was bombs fell from their bellies he could see them tumbling down through the air and they all seemed to be falling straight toward him duck he shouted and threw himself facedown in the dirt all of a sudden he had more important things to worry about than getting dirt on his uniform the bombs rising whistling scream made him want to scream too then they hit and he did scream it didnt matter nobody could hear him through that thunder the ground shook as if in an earthquake hed been through some bad quakes in japan this was worse than any of them when things rained down on him he wasnt sure if hed be buried alive while you were on the receiving end of a bombardment it seemed to go on forever at last after what couldnt have been more than ten minutes of real time the bombs stopped falling at least they did close byhe could still hear explosions off to the west they were just paying us a social call shimizu thought dazedly they really wanted to visit the airstrip and the harbor like a ground squirrel looking to see if the fox had really gone he stuck his head out of his hole the barracks had been shelled before theyd been leveled this time craters were strewn over the ground around the building so were bodies and pieces of bodies other buildings nearby were smoking ruins yasuo furusawa came up beside him the druggists son looked around with the same horror on his face as shimizu felt oh furusawa said softly and then again oh it didnt seem enough but what else was there to say help the wounded officers screamed get ready to move get ready to fight shimizu didnt know how he was supposed to do all those things at once he didnt know how he was supposed to get ready to fight at all his rifle was in the barracks which had started to burn looking down the trench he didnt see anyone else who had a rifle with him either he could do something for injured men but not much he bandaged wounds he helped get people out of the trenches and helped lift rubble so others could move them the doctor who showed up after a few minutes quickly looked overwhelmed a fire engine screeched to a stop in front of the barracks the crewlocalsstarted playing water on what was left of the building that wouldnt do the rifles in there any good it might keep the ammunition with them from cooking off though which would save some casualties private shiro wakuzawa pointed west look he said shimizu did smoke was rising from the direction of the airfield and from pearl harbor just beyond it the american bombers had indeed hit that area harder than theyd hit honolulu a lieutenant started shouting at the firemen dont worry about this place go there there do you hear me he pointed west as wakuzawa had the firemen answered himin english a couple of them looked japanese but nobody admitted to knowing the language the officer jumped up and down getting madder and madder that did him no good at all he pulled his katana from its sheath the firemen backed away from him almost apoplectic by then he put it back he could kill the locals but he couldnt get them to understand what he was talking about and that was what he needed to do other officers started screaming then zakennayo the rifles one of them howled how are we supposed to fight the americans if our rifles are in there he pointed at the smoldering dripping wreckage of the barracks just when all the men with more gold than red on their collar tabs seemed to have lost their heads a major said we have plenty of captured american rifles and ammunition at armories here in honolulu we can use them if there arent any arisakas handy they have better stopping power than our rifles anyway someone else whod kept his wits about him added whatever we do wed better do it fast night is coming and that will make things harder plainly the yankees are going to try to invade well need to be ready to march first thing in the morning that was how shimizu and his squad found themselves the not too proud possessors of american springfields he didnt much care for his it was larger and heavier than the arisaka he was used to plainly a weapon made for a bigger soldier than the average japanese yasuo furusawa worked the bolt on his springfield a few times smoothits well made he said grudgingly i was thinking the same thing shimizu said it will kick like a donkey though shigata ga nai corporalsan furusawa said and shimizu had to nod not getting supper couldnt be helped either the officers had worried about weapons first and everything else only afterwards shimizu was sure the regiment would start marching for its position in the northern part of oahu as soon as it grew light too he wondered if he and his men would get breakfast before they set out as it happened they did rice cooked somewhere else and brought in by horsedrawn wagon and then some of the regiment with arisakas and others with springfields all of the men in dirty often bloodstained uniforms they started marching toward the positions prepared for them before the last attempted enemy invasion we should have trucks senior private furusawa grumbled we could get there in an hour or two if we had trucks but they didntor rather they had no fuel for them that fire engine had been the first motorized vehicleexcept for airplanesshimizu had seen in operation in weeks and so they marched to get to the kamehameha highway they had to tramp past hickam field a lot of airplanes remained unharmed in their revetments the only trouble was at the moment that did them no good at all the american bombers had plastered the runways for all they were worth snorting bulldozers and swarms of men with picks and shovelspows locals forced into labor gangs and even japanesewere doing their best to make the field usable again their best wasnt good enough yet shimizu didnt like what he saw how were the japanese going to attack american ships if their planes couldnt get off the ground for a moment fear made his strides light then he remembered the aircraft carriers that had let his country conquer hawaii in the first place they would take care of the yankees he marched on feeling better jim peterson was deep in the bowels of the koolau range when he heard explosions outside the tunnel mouth he leaned on his pick for a moment trying to catch his breath any excuse to pause for a little while was a good one every time he lifted the pick and bit into the mountainside with it he wondered if he could do it again the question was altogether serious men quietly fell over and died every day hed helped carry gordy braddon to a graveafter his usual shift was over of course if your knees were bigger around than your thighs as gordys had been for quite a while you werent a prime physical specimen by now there were damn few prisoners in the kalihi valley of whom that wasnt true it was sure as hell true of him the japanese cared less about the tunnel than they did about working the pows to deathor beating them to death or shooting them at the slightest excuse or just for the fun of it the only way they might have got rid of the prisoners faster was by building a railroad through the jungle unlike the tunnel it wouldnt have gone anywhere but that might not have stopped them more explosions what the hell charlie kaapu said he stood out in the mob of tunnel rats because he was twice as strong as most of them he hadnt been there long enough to deteriorate badly and hed been a civilian before not a pow so hed just gone hungry he hadnt been on a starvation diet sounds like bombs peterson said lots of bombs if thats what it is charlie said and peterson had a hard time disagreeing us raids on hawaii hadnt amounted to anything but annoyances up till now still more distant booms came echoing up the shaft whatever they were they were too big to be just an annoyance the same thought occurred to somebody else cant be bombs a weary but authoritative voice said wish it could but theres too damn many of em how could the usa get that many bombers over oahu no way nohow gotta be the japs blowing something up they can blow themselves upor just blow themselves dont make no difference to me somebody else chipped in when the men with picks paused the men with shovels couldnt load rubble for the men with baskets to carry out of the tunnel there wasnt any rubble to load and when the men with baskets didnt come staggering out of the tunnel at intervals short enough to suit the japanese guards came in to find out what the hell was going on a pow near the tunnel mouth called heads up to warn the men at the end of the shaft with a groan peterson lifted the pick it seemed to weigh sixteen tons he swung it back and brought it forward it bit into the volcanic rock grunting he pulled it free and swung it again moments later he heard the japs yelling as they approached they sounded mad as hell they often did but this was worse than usual and their progress up the shaft could be noted by cries of pain from the prisoners they passed that meant they were swinging their damn bamboo swagger sticks at whoever was unlucky enough to get within range they hadnt done that much for a while not inside the tunnel what were they so jumpy about peterson got a crack across the back that sent him staggering into the rough rock wall that gave him more scrapes and lumps charlie kaapu got whacked too he took it with a grin which made the guard hit him again he kept grinning and hefted his pick it wasnt a threat or didnt have to be one for he slammed the pick into the rock a moment later but that guard found something else to do pretty damn quick as soon as the jap was out of earshot charlie said i bet the usa is doing something these little cocksuckers wouldnt be so jumpy if we werent is that hope i feel jim peterson wondered hed gone without so long he had trouble recognizing it hed had grim determination to survive but not hope hope was different and yes this was a dose of that fragile precious feeling by god everybody worked harder not because the guards were beating on people but because hope in spite of that pow with the authoritative voice was contagious men wanted to believe the americans were on their way back and thinking they might be made even dying prisoners stronger for a little while when the shift ended peterson trudged out of the tunnel with as much spring in his step as a starving man with beriberi could have he wolfed down his rice and nasty leaves with good appetite but then he was always hungry by the time he ate he knew the americans had returned men too sick to labormen who would die soon in other wordshad watched smoke rise in the southwest from the direction of honolulu and pearl harbor some of them had seen the bombers peterson couldnt see anything it had got dark he hardly cared his minds eye was in excellent working order the guards acted nervous at evening roll call too naturally they screwed up the count just as naturally they took it out on the pows peterson thought they killed a man when they knocked him down and kicked him but he wasnt sure even sleep normally a mans most precious asset after food went by the wayside tonight prisoners talked in low excited voices falling silent whenever a jap stalked by their longings after an american victory came down to two things steak and french fries a few men talked about pussy but only a few most were too far gone to worry much about women one way or the other fantasies about food were much more immediately gratifying pussys more trouble than its worth charlie kaapu opined that surprised peterson charlie of all people here was in good enough shape to do a woman justiceor maybe even injustice if he saw the chance its trouble id like to have somebody else said wistfully the big burlyby camp standards anyhowhapahawaiian shook his head why you think i ended up in this goddamn place except for pussy tell us the story again charlie peterson said it was better than most of the ones the prisoners told and he hadnt heard it so often either charlie kaapu looked disgusted with himself this jap major have a blond girlfriend he used some of the rhythms of the local pidgin without quite falling into it leering he went on blond girlfriend have goodlooking boyfriend he jabbed a thumb at his own chest but then his face fell you go after nooky you get stupid i got stupid i quarrel with the silly bitch and she squeal on me they grab me they ship my ass up here aint you boys lucky they do that he got jeered as he must have known he would have as poor gordy had said peterson wished hed had that much fun before getting sent to the kalihi valley but the news of the day left him all the more determined to outlast the japanese as he and everyone else in the camp discovered much too early the next morning the news of the day left the guards all the more determined to make sure none of the prisoners there lived through it joe crosetti listened to the briefing officer all right gentlemen the man said and paused to swig at his milk weve given the japs a left to the jaw and a right to the belly weve sunk their carriers and weve walloped the rest of their surface ships and weve plastered their airfields on oahu theyre on the ropes and theyre wobbly but theyre still on their feet now we go for the ko several fliers near joe said yeah a few others growled deep in their throats a low animal noise he didnt think they knew they were making he had to listen to be sure he wasnt making it himself our own losses were in the expected range the briefing officer continued one light carrier sunk an escort carrier and a fleet carrier damaged the fleet carrier can still launch planes and we are still in business more growls rose and even a couple of whoops this time joe didnt feel like joining them the way he looked at it the japs had shown just how good they were badly outnumbered mauled going in theyd still managed to do real damage to the american task force well those divebomber and torpedoplane pilots were out of the game now most of them for good the ones whose planes hadnt got shot down would have had to ditch in the ocean there couldnt have been many pickups youll know we hit their air bases on oahu yesterday with bs and bs the briefing officer said they made it all the way from the west coast with their bombs but they couldnt hope to get home again thats why they headed for kauai once the raid was done how we got an airstrip long enough to land bombers built there under the japs noses is a story theyll write books about after the war you can bet your life on that of course the bombers would still be sitting there at the end of the strip if the japs wanted to smash them up they could it must have been a oneway mission from the start talk about ballsout joe thought our assets on oahu say we did a good job hitting the enemy bases but the japs are attempting to get them into usable shape again the briefing officer said we dont want them doing that a few grim chuckles accompanied the statement a wry smile on his own face the lieutenant commander went on bringing carriersto say nothing of the troopships behind usinto range of landbased air is liable to be hazardous to everybodys health a few more chuckles for all the world as if he were joking what you boys are going to do is youre going to make damn sure that doesnt happen our ships bombers are going to hit wheeler field again to keep the japs from flying off it you fighter pilotsknock down anything that gets into the air and shoot up as much as you can on the ground shoot up enemy planes wherever you spot em and shoot up the earthmoving machinery that lets the japs make fast repairs well hit them hard and well keep hitting them till they cant hit back any more questions yes sir a pilot raised his hand when do the marines go in day after tomorrow if everything works the way its supposed to the briefing officer said you can make that happen you will make it happen now go man your planes as joe hurried up to the flight deck he fell into stride with orson sharp day after tomorrow we really are gonna take it back from them well sure sharp looked at him did you think we wouldnt of course not joe made himself sound indignant if hed had doubts he didnt want to admit them even to himself let alone to his buddy hellcats buzzed overhead as he climbed into his cockpit the combat air patrol was heavy they were already in range of landbased air though none had appeared yet after the naval battle that too argued the bombers had done a good job of putting the runways on oahu out of action for the time being joes hellcat was gassed up and brim full of ammo the plane had a few bullet holes that hadnt been there twentyfour hours earlier but nothing vital had taken any damage the engine came to life at once joe methodically ran through his checkstheyd drilled that into him before they let him into a yellow peril everything looked green not quite so many pilots took off as had the day before bill frank whod roomed with joe and orson sharp and another guy at ground school in chapel hill north carolina was one of the missing nobodyd seen his plane go down but he hadnt landed either joe tried not to think about losses its a job he told himself youve got to do it sometimes things happen thats all but they wont happen to you as planes began to leap into the air joe thought about what he would be doing wheeler field the center of the island between the mountain ranges by now after so much study he could have drawn the map of oahu in his sleep schofield barracks and the town on the other side of the highwaywahiawawould guide him in if he had trouble finding the place with the arrogance of youth he didnt figure he would the island wasnt very big to begin with and then he got the checkered flag the hellcat sprinted down the flight deck there was that momentary lurch as it tried to fall into the pacific joe yanked the stick back the nose went up the fighter zoomed away to find its fellows was any feeling in the world better than this well maybe one he kept an eye peeled for ships down below not quite all the escorts from the jap task force were accounted for he figured the us battlewagons and cruisers and destroyers could handle whatever was left but why take chances he didnt spot any major warships theyd either gone back to the bottom or scooted back to oahu he did see several fishing boats at first he just accepted thathe was after all a fishermans son but then he remembered the japs used those boats as pickets they would have radios aboard the attack from the us fleet wouldnt be a surprise if the enemy could put planes in the air he would he could and he did joe had just spotted oahu green in the distance when a warning dinned in his earphones bandits bandits at ten o clock some distance back of the lead planes joe peered southeast till he spotted the japanese planes their pilots were sly theyd swung around toward the sun so they could come out of it and be harder to spot joe wished his hellcat carried radar then the enemy wouldnt be able to play tricks like that well they hadnt worked this time he glanced over at his wingman he led an element now instead of following in one survival of the fittestor luckiestworked in the air just the way it had in his biology textbook the other pilot a big blond guy from south dakota named dave andersen waved in the cockpit to show he was paying attention joe waved back here came the japs some of the fighters were zeros maybe theyd made it back to oahu after their carriers went down maybe theyd been based therethe japs sure did that with their navy planes in the south pacific others were shorter trimmer with a smaller cockpit canopy silhouette recognition paid off those were jap army fightersoscars in us code oscars were slower than zeros they didnt carry cannon either only two riflecaliber machine guns but they were supposed to be even more nimble and maneuverable than the navy fighters having watched pilots in zeros pull off some mindboggling loops and turns and spins joe was from missouri on that he wouldnt believe it till he saw it for himself which he did in short order hellcats could outclimb and outdive oscars with ease but an enemy pilot who knew what he was doing could damn near fly his plane back around under itself hellcats flew like flycatchers oscars dodged like butterflies they couldnt hit much harder than butterflies though canvasandwire biplanes in the last war had had just as much firepower and hellcats were built to take it oscars werent they were several hundred pounds lighter even than zeros and correspondingly flimsier all that maneuverability came at a price if an oscar got in the way of a burst from a hellcats sixcaliber guns as often as not it would break up in midair that couldnt have been good for morale but the japs who flew the army fighters had guts they bored in on the dauntlesses the hellcats escorted so did their navy buddies in zeros they got a few too but they paid and paid high the hellcats badly outnumbered them joe wondered how many oscars and zerosand jap bombers toowere stuck on the ground because they couldnt take off lots he hoped he took a shot at an oscar his tracers went wide he tried to keep his nose aimed at the jap fighter but he couldnt it was that much more agile in the air in a hop and a skip it was on his tail those two popguns it carried blazing away one round hit the hellcat joe glanced anxiously at his gauges as he gave his plane the gun and ran away from the oscar no fire no leaks no problems yeah a hellcat could take it and hellcats could dish it out too that jap pilot was a pro but hed be a dead pro in short order if he tangled with very many of the big muscular american fighters there was the koolau range to the east and the waianae range to the west japanese antiaircraft guns near the beach started throwing up flak joe swerved back and forth just a little to keep the gunners from being quite sure where he was going dave andersen stuck with him sure enough oahu was little only three or four minutes after he saw waves breaking on the beach he was over the target dauntlesses screamed down out of the sky to blast the runways of wheeler field funny to think how less than two years earlier japanese vals had done the same damn thing what goes around comes around you bastards joe thought your turn now back in december of american planes had been parked on the runways wingtip to wingtip the people in charge then worried about sabotage they hadnt figured theyd get suckerpunched joe was damned if he knew why not but they hadnt the japs unfortunately werent as dumb or as trusting as the americans had been they knew enough to build revetments and they knew enough to camouflage them too but they hadnt painted a civilian bulldozer in camouflage colorstheyd left it schoolbus yellow joe couldnt have found a juicier target in a month of sundays his thumb came down on the firing button tracers leaped ahead of the hellcat a fireball spouted from the dozer joe pulled up to make sure he didnt get caught in it he swung around for another pass at wheeler shooting up what had been an american facility was fun all the same part of him kept imagining hed get a bill for destroying government property this stuff belongs to the japanese government now let them send me a bill and let them hold their breath till i pay it flak around wheeler was heavier than it had been by the shore the japs knew the americans would try to come back and theyd done what they could to get ready and its not gonna be enough goddammit joe said muzzle flashes let him spot a guns upthrust snout shoot at me will you shoot at my buddies see how you like being on the other end the gun crew scattered as joe opened up on them he roared by before he could see what his bullets did to them maybe that was just as well thosecaliber rounds were designed to pierce things like engine blocks and armor plate what theyd do to flesh and bones hardly bore thinking about several plumes of greasy black smoke fouled the blue sky some were from burning jap planes caught in their revetments others joe feared came from downed hellcats and dauntlesses you couldnt do this for free however much you wished you could as he climbed to make another strafing run he got a good look at the craters pocking the runways even as he watched another hellcat shot up a bulldozer one more cloud of smoke billowed up joe slammed his left fist into his thigh one more dozer that wouldnt make repairs if the japs had to fix this mess with picks and shovels theyd need weeks not days theyd need em but they wouldnt have em the marines and the army were on the way boys we have done what we came to do lets go home and gas up and do it some more the exultant order kept joe from heeling his fighter into another dive he didnt complain they had indeed done what theyd come to do as he flew out over the north coast bound for the bunker hill he spotted another wellplastered airstrip down below haleiwa he thought thats what the name of that one is he grinned there in the cockpit yeah he knew the map all right careless ofindeed oblivious tohis own safety lieutenant saburo shindo manned a machine gun near the edge of the haleiwa airstrip he blazed away at the american dive bombers attacking the stripand at the fighters attacking anything around it that might make a target the machine gun a japanese weapon modeled after the french hotchkiss used metal strips of ammunition not the more common belts the loader was a japanese groundcrew man whod protested his unfamiliarity with the process shindos pistol aimed at his forehead proved amazingly persuasive whenever the machine gun ran dry in went another strip of cartridges only the groundcrew mans chattering teeth suggested he might want to be somewhere else one of the new american fightersthe same planes that had worked such fearful slaughter on japans beloved zerosmust have spotted shindos tracers on it came straight at him the machine guns in its wings winking balefully he fired back shoving down hard on the triggers till his gun unexpectedly fell silent give me another strip you stinking son of a backpassage whore lieutenant shindo shouted the groundcrew man neither obeyed nor answered shindo glanced over to him bullets from the american planes machine guns chewed up the grass and dirt all around the machine gun one of them had caught the unwilling loader in the face the unfortunate man no longer had a face not much was left of the back of his head either his brains and scalp spattered shindos coveralls shoving the dead man aside shindo began feeding ammunition into the gun himself that cut down his rate of fire he did what he could though till the last american planes abandoned haleiwa and headed out to sea then he ran for the revetment that sheltered his zero two planes nearby were burning but his survived he glanced back toward the runway his mouth twisted it was as cratered as the surface of the moon the bulldozer that could have set things right in a hurry burned beside the runway no one had thought to move it not even me shindo thought bitterly and yet a bulldozer was or should have been as much a weapon of war as an airplane with or without the big brutal machine though they had to get the airstrip ready as fast as they could prisoners he shouted have we got a gang of prisoners anywhere close by takeo shimizu had rapidly grown to hate the american rifle he carried it wasnt just that the springfield was too long and too heavy for comfort but hed got used to all the places where his old arisaka bumped his back when he carried it along the springfield hit none of them it had its own places and they drove him crazyespecially the one just above his kidney all the soldiers in his squad groused about their springfields he let them if anything he encouraged them it gave them something to do as the northbound kilometers went by people working in the rice paddies that had replaced sugarcane and pineapple fields paused to stare as the japanese soldiers tramped by the laborersfilipinos koreans chinese whiteshad to know what the big bombing attack meant but no one had the nerve to do anything but stare an open jeer here might have touched off a massacre shimizus squadand the rest of the regiment of which it was a partwere north of wahiawa when he heard aircraft engines his head came up like that of a hunting dog taking a scent so did senior private furusawas now shimizu said are those our planes or the enemys furusawa nodded a moment later he said the enemys the roar is deeper than ours they came out of the north from the sea of course shimizu thought one second they were tiny in the distance the next shimizu just had time to shout take cover before the big bluntnosed fighters opened up on the column of marching men there wasnt much cover to take shimizu threw himself flat by the side of the road and hoped for the best bullets rattled off asphalt thudded into the ground and made wet splashy noises when they struck flesh when a couple of them struck flesh too close to the noncom he decided any cover was better than none he jumped into the closest rice paddy even as he crouched in the water he unslung the springfield and held it up to keep the muddy water from fouling the rifle considering how much he disliked it that proved how thoroughly orders about maintaining a clean weapon at all times had been beaten into him he was far from the only soldier who went into the paddies not all the men were as fastidious about their rifles as he was some even ducked their heads under the water as planes flew by at treetop height guns blazing shimizu understood that but he wouldnt have wanted to do it himself he assumed they fertilized the paddies here with night soil the way they did in japan and china combat always seemed to last forever even if in truth it was usually over in a hurry this was hardly combat at all shimizu admired the handful of men who stood there and fired at the american planes he admired them yes but without wanting to imitate them the enemy here had things all his own wayand then he was gone off to make misery somewhere else on oahu dripping and filthy shimizu dragged himself out of the rice paddy soldiers whod flattened out and lived were getting to their feet many of them with dazed expressions on their faces not all the men on the highway and by it were getting up again though too many never would the iron smell of fresh blood and the latrine stench of punctured bowels fouled the tropical air wounded men moaned bodies and pieces of bodies sprawled in ungainly postures what had the americans been firing when one of those bullets hit a man it tore him to pieces the regimental physicians those of them left alive ran from one writhing soldier to another doing what they could whatever it was it couldnt possibly be enough forward called colonel fujikawa the regimental commander we have to move forward are we going to defend this island against the american invaders or not hai it was a ragged shaken chorus but a chorus nonetheless takeo shimizu tried to ignore the wobble in his own voice when he joined it the american fighters strafed them again half an hour later this time from behind the americans had to be flying home back to the carriers that had brought them so close to oahu where are our carriers shimizu wondered again whats happened to them the enemy planes roared off to the north leaving many more dead and maimed behind them wasnt that answer enough shimizu had come ashore on a northfacing beach not two years earlier now he would have to keep the yankees from doing the same he didnt think he would have to wait for them very long either after the yukikaze got into pearl harbor commander minoru genda demanded a car to take him to iolani palace the officers there laughed in his face american bombers had left the harbor a shambles if there were any running motorcars they were reserved for people more important than a mere commander off a sunken ship hed had to pull strings to get his hands on a bicycle pedaling hurt but the ankle wasnt broken the yukikazes doctor had assured him of that much anyhow with it tightly wrapped he could manage as he rolled east he saw what the american bombers had done to hickam field many of the airplanes flying off it still survived but the runways themselves were cratered wastelands that reminded him of the worst photos hed seen of first world war battlefields how soon before japan could get those planes flying again soon enough to attack the enemy invasion fleet that was bound to come he dared hope so anyhow hope at the moment was as much as he could do admiral yamamoto had warned about this kind of us response all along the summer before the americans had tried to do it on the cheap and theyd paid and all too plainly theyd learned and theyd worked had any of their factories and shipyards stood idle for even a moment from that day to this genda fearedyes fearednot honolulu itself hadnt been hit so hard genda pedaled past a battered barracks hall but the bombers hadnt tried to knock the city flat had they wanted to they could have done it theyd spent their bombs more wisely thoughand then theyd flown off to kauai somehow somewhere the americans had managed to carve out a landing strip on the island right under japans nose with oahu secured the japanese hadnt worried much about the other main hawaiian islands that turned out to have been a mistake we cant afford mistakes against the americans genda thought unhappily theyre liable to beat us even if we dont make any he didnt think rear admiral kaku had made any mistakes in the naval battle just past that hadnt kept akagi and shokaku from going down overwhelming numbers and munitions could defeat even the finest tactics if wed had twice as many carriersgenda broke off he knew the answer to that we would have hurt the enemy more and lost all our ships anyhow maybeprobablythe fundamental mistake had been going to war against the usa in the first place but what else could japan have done let fdr dictate what she could and couldnt do in china for a proud and touchy empire that would have been impossible he sighed sometimes a problem had only bad solutions soldiers drilled on the iolani palace grounds some were king stanley laanuis hawaiians genda eyed them with more than a little worry would they really fight against the americans if they didnt they might prove dangerous maybe giving the puppet king of hawaii even a toy army hadnt been such a good idea most of the men on the smooth green grass were japanese though they werent army men they belonged to the special naval landing forces and wore greenish uniforms rather than khaki and black leather rather than brown what will we do to the americans shouted the navy captain leading their exercises slaughter them the soldiers yelled back do our lives matter the officer asked no captain iwabuchi the men replied our lives mean nothing dying gloriously for the sacred emperor means everything genda was relieved to pull up in front of the entrance and let down the bikes kickstand it wasnt that captain iwabuchi and his men were wrongfar from it but genda had more subtlety in him than the man in charge of the special landing forces he sighed much good that subtlety had done him the hawaiian guards at the bottom of the stairs and the japanese at the top saluted him as he slowly and painfully ascended i must see general yamashita and the king he told the army lieutenant in charge of his countrymen at once yes sir the lieutenant had seen him before and knew who he was he sent one of his men into the palace the soldier returned a moment later he nodded so did the lieutenant go on up to the generals office then arigato gozaimasu after thanking the junior officer genda climbed the koawood staircase to the second story he limped into the yellow room where tomoyuki yamashita supervised the japanese occupation of hawaii yamashita looked up from his paperwork welcome gendasan he said sit downi can see youre hurting tell me how bad it is genda gratefully sank into a chair he gave the general a straight answer sir i dont see how it could be any worse we lost both carriers we sent against the enemy and most of the supporting ships the americans will invade the armyand the special naval landing forceswill have to defeat him on the ground the cries of the special naval landing forces floated in through the open window the soldiers sounded ferocious what difference if any that would make yamashita grimaced what went wrong commander we won a great victory the last time the yankees appeared in these waters yes sirand we had one more carrier and they had many fewer the sheer size of the aerial strike force that sank akagi and shokaku still stunned genda what it said about the fleet that sent it forth was even more intimidating and the troopships behind that very well commander we will do what we can to hold this island yamashita said i am sure your navy forces will help us captain iwabuchi is nothing if not ah intrepid more shouts rang out from the special landing forces as far as genda could tell iwabuchi was a bloodthirsty fanatic of course even if he was that wasnt necessarily a drawback in a fighting man between us sir can we beat back the americans i dont know i intend to try yamashita answered calmly whatever we do we buy time for our positions farther west to strengthen themselves that was the whole point of this campaign in the first place neh yes sir genda said im afraid this wont be as easy as fighting the americans was the first time around we may fail yamashita said success or failure is karma but no one will ever say we did not do everything we could to succeed genda didnt see what he could say to that he struggled to his feet and saluted yes sir i had better go across the hall and brief his majesty he spoke without audible irony king stanley might have someone who understood japanese listening you never could tell genda did ask how is morale among the hawaiian troops it seems all right so far yamashita replied we will use them in ways that appear most expedient genda understood what that meant though a listening snoop might not have yamashita planned to throw the hawaiians into the meat grinder to use them in place of japanese soldiers where things were hottest that would let the japanese last longer and stretch further reinforcements from the home islands were to put it in the most optimistic terms unlikely king stanley laanui used king david kalakauas library as his office now he sat behind the dreadnought of a desk that genda had used with mitsuo fuchida and two army officers to pick a sovereign to revive the kingdom of hawaii so far as genda knew none of the japanese support ships had rescued fuchida he was gone lost he had to be the certainty of it ate at genda the king of hawaii looked up from whatever papers hed been shufflingor pretending to shuffle stanley laanui was far from the most diligent administrator in the world his eyes had always had heavy dark pouches of flesh under them now they were bleary and tracked with red when he said hello commander genda his breath was sweetsour with the reek of the fruit spirit people here insisted on calling gin good day your majesty speaking english genda had to be formal he gave king stanley a stiff precise bow refusing to show that the ankle troubled him how bad is it the king asked it cant be good by god you look like a cement mixer just ran over your puppy it could be better your majesty genda tried to hide how shocked he was hed willed his face and eyes to reveal nothing that hed failed so badly said how much hed been throughand probably also said the king of hawaii was shrewder than he looked for a man having an affair with the kings wife that was less than welcome news king stanley barked bitter laughter now if you say it could be better its even worse than i thought when are the americans landing in the next few days i think so sorry one shock after another for genda if the king hadnt taken him by surprise he wouldnt have answered so frankly christ stanley laanui burst out i thought i was kidding those bloodshot eyes flicked back and forth like a hunted animals can you beat them uhcan we beat them all we can do we will do genda saida reply that sounded more promising than it was king stanley unfortunately understood as much jesus whatll they do if they catch me he put a fist by his neck and jerked it upward turning his head to the side as if hanged genda did his best to look on the bright side of things no american soldiers are here yet maybe we will beat back the landing maybe we will beat them on the ground here japanese soldiers are very brave yeah sure commander i know that king stanley said under his breath he muttered something that sounded like if pigs had wings if that was a proverb it wasnt one genda knew the king gathered himself all right well do what we can to give you a hand after all its our necks too if the usa comes back thank you your majesty i knew you would stand by us genda bowed his way out of the office the really worrisome thing was that he was grateful for the sens worth of support the king of hawaii had to give any port in a storm that was an english proverb genda did know as he stood in the hallway a tiny chinese cleaning woman easily ten centimeters shorter than he was slipped a little piece of paper into his hand she was smooth as a stage magician she didnt even break stride as she walked past him he opened it as he limped down the stairs it had a number nothing more he folded it up and stuck it in a trouser pocket he got on the bicycle hed managed to lay his hands on and rode around to the back of iolani palace the guards at the stairs that led up and down there also saluted him he absently returned the gesture as he went down into the basement the door that matched the number on the slip had a window set with wirestrengthened glass genda sighed to himself queen cynthia wasnt going to take any chances today he didnt suppose he could blame her but he wished she would have at least he would be able to speak freely behind the closed door that too was release of a sort though not the kind he craved cynthia laanui was more conscientious than her husband as well as more decorative all the charities that moved food and medical supplies from hither to yon and tried to extract more ran through her she really had done good workand here she was doing more but she closed her fountain pen when genda walked into her little office as soon as the door clicked shut behind him she exclaimed i was afraid you werent coming back so was i but that was not a thought genda would have shared with any womanor with any man unless he got drunk with a friend whod gone through the same thing here i am he said bowing yeshere you are and you came here in a destroyer like any proper queen cynthia obviously had her spies where is the akagi he shrugged sometimes things go your way sometimes they go the enemys way what will you do she asked he couldnt tell whether she meant him alone or the japanese as a whole the answer was the same either way fight queen cynthias gingery eyebrows leaped can you win if they couldnt win she would face whatever the americans chose to dish out to her husband and her whatever that was genda didnt think it would be pretty king stanley could at least claim he was a hawaiian trying to regain his countrys independence after half a century of us occupation it wouldnt help but he could claim it his wife pure haole couldnt even offer that excuse if the americans won they would probably reckon her a traitor to her race we will do our best we have won before genda said almost exactly what hed told her husband youd better she said fiercely if she led the little hawaiian army it might well fight harder than it would under king stanley genda shrugged again karma neh after that he found only one thing left to say karma too that we fell in love neh yes cynthia laanui answered and looked down at the desk was she remembering she was an american shed been willing even eager to forget when things were going better for japan now she looked up again what are we going to do what can we do he shrugged i do not know everything we can his own chances of living through the fighting ahead were anything but good he didnt tell her thatwhat was the point no doubt she could see it for herself anyway if he didnt live her chances were better if no one knew shed been sleeping with the enemy of course as queen to the japanese puppet king of hawaii she faced long odds too he got to his feet to go and bowed once more good luck same to you she said i used to have it but it seems to be gone now he didnt know what to say to that hed just got back on his bicycle when airraid sirens began to wail when he saw the swarms of american planes tearing up hickam field again he feared japanese luck in hawaii was gone now too fletcher armitage was digging an antitank ditch north of wahiawa when american planes roared by overhead he wanted to laugh in the face of the worriedlooking jap guard who rode herd on him and his fellow pows he wanted to scream all right motherfucker you had it your way for a while now see how you like taking it for a change he wanted to but he didnt he didnt get out of line at all in fact the japs had been jumpy even before those planes came over fletch hadnt known why but their wind was up they started beating people up for no reason if you gave them trouble on purpose youd be lucky if they just shot you theyd probably bayonet you and leave you to die slowly under the hot sun and yet there were a hell of a lot of prisoners and not very many guards before it hadnt seemed to matter so much the japs were top dogs and they knew it and so did the men they guarded but if all of a sudden they werent guaranteed top dogs any more an awful lot of americans owed them plentyand wanted to pay it back with interest more fighters and bombers flew by the noise of explosions not too far away said somethingprobably wheeler fieldwas catching hell again unlike the big heavy bombers the day before these planes were coming in low son of a bitch fletch said staring up son of a bitch what is it another pow asked they changed the wing emblem on our planes fletch answered they took out the red ball in the middle of the star when did that happen what else had his country done while he wasnt lookingcouldnt look all at once he felt like robinson crusoe trapped on a desert island while the rest of the world went on about its business no talk the closest jap guard shouted work like any pow fletch worked no harder than he had to he doubted he weighed even pounds he had little strength and less stamina the japs didnt care a lot of the work theyd had the pows do was designed more to wear out and destroy men than for serious military reasons no more fletch could see how this ditch would slow an armored attack the mud of the rice paddies wouldnt help tanks either the us army had done its best to fight when the japanese invaded now the japs were getting ready to do the same and theyre making me help them the sons of bitches fletch wanted to scream it under the geneva convention they werent supposed to make him do work like this since he was an officer under the geneva convention he wasnt required to work at all did the japs care not even slightly work the guard yelled again and bashed somebody in the side of the head with the butt end of his arisaka the luckless pow staggered and fell to his hands and knees the guard kicked him in the ribs and went on kicking him till he lurched upright once more blood running down his cheek the prisoner dug out another spadeful of earth he didnt say a word complaining only got you deeper in dutch keeping your head down as much as you could was a hell of a lot smarter it was most of the time anyhow though fletch obediently dug he kept looking at that jap guard out of the corner of his eye he wasnt the only pow doing that eitheroh no up till now it had looked as if the japanese would hang on to hawaii indefinitely that being so you had to go alongat least someto get along but if this place would be under new management or rather the old management again pretty soon yeah you slantyeyed son of a bitch ill remember your face in my nightmares for the rest of my days do you have nightmares now you bastard if you dont i bet you will pretty soon serves you right too along with glancing at the guard fletch also looked south toward wahiawa jane was still okay hed seen her he knew maybe they could patch things up again if hawaii returned to the old management why not anything might be possible then anything at all platoon sergeant les dillon spent as much time as he could on the valdosta libertys deck it was cooler and less cramped there than down below he went below to eat in the galleythe rule was that no food left itand to use the heads he slept down there too and played poker other than that no besides when he was below he couldnt see what was going on his troopship had been zigzagging west and south ever since sailing from san diego other converted freighters and linersand the destroyers escorting themfilled the pacific as far as his eye could see he thought this was a bigger fleet than the one that had sailed and then turned tail the year before he couldnt prove it but it looked that way he was sure the course changes were quicker and more precise than they had been the last time around when he remarked on that dutch wenzel nodded i guess even the swabbies can learn something if you give em enough time the other platoon sergeant said looks like youre right who wouldve believed it les said they stood only a few feet away from a couple of the valdosta libertys sailors the sailors pretended not to hear if theyd felt like brawling les was ready what would captain bradford do to him make him miss the invasion not likely the worst they could do to him was to send him in no matter what he did on the way that thought had hardly crossed his mind before the troopships loudspeakers crackled to life now hear this an exultant voice said now hear this our ships have whipped the japanese navy and so we are good to proceed to our destination beautiful romantic hawaii coming up the deck exploded in cheers sailors and marines all yelled as if it were going out of style les joined in as enthusiastically as anybody else so did his buddy people around them were still shouting and screeching when he suddenly sobered what are we jumping up and down about he said we just won the chance to get our heads blown off arent you glad about that fuckina i am dutch answered and so are you you sandbagging son of a bitch otherwise wed both be gunnies by now well shit when youre right youre right les said he and wenzel had both turned down the chance for a third rocker under their sergeants stripes so they could go along on the failed attack the year before instead of training boots at camp pendleton then theyd ended up at pendleton anyhow still at their old grade life was a bitch sometimes the racket from the valdosta libertys engines got louder the ship sped up so did all the others in the invasion fleet wenzel grunted they dont want to waste another minute do they would you les answered theyve wasted a year and a half already and then some about time we took hawaii back its not right for hotel street to belong to somebody else goddammit there you go dutch wenzel laughed now i know what im fighting for cheap pussy and overpriced booze suits me fine dillon said and dutch didnt contradict him as dillon always did when he was up on deck he looked out into the ocean to see if he could spot a periscope the odds were long in this miserable tub the odds of being able to dodge if a jap sub did fire a torpedo were even longer he knew all that he looked anyhow it was like snapping your fingers to keep the elephants away it couldnt hurt wonder how far from hawaii we are dutch said beats me les answered aint a hell of a lot of street signs in this part of the pacific well get there when we get there thats all they got there three days later they must have sailed past the battle between the american and japanese carrier forces but not a sign of it remained the ocean kept its own secrets kept them and buried them deep as the troopships approached the north coast of oahu the battlewagons and cruisers and destroyers that had accompanied and escorted the us carriers were giving the landing beaches hell the boom of the big guns echoed across the water when the shells roared in they rearranged the landscape pretty drastically les watched with enthusiastic approval the more they knock the snot out of the japs the easier the time well have he said dive bombers took off from the carriers and pummeled what les presumed to be japanese positions too their bombs kicked up even more dust and dirt than all that highcaliber artillery it was more and more an aviators world what does that make me les wondered when the thought occurred to him a minute later he shrugged it makes me necessary thats what they can blow hawaii to kingdom come but im the poor sorry son of a bitch who lands there with a bayonet on the end of his rifle and takes it away from the japs boy am i lucky he couldnt even blame his draft board not when he like every other marine had volunteered the army was the place for draftees and welcome to them in spite of everything us aircraft had done to the island a few japanese planes did get off the ground and attacked the fleet the hellcats and wildcats overhead went after them like dogs after marauding wolves but they made hits too here a cruiser there a troopship when flames and smoke burst from that other ship full of marines or dogfaces les swore horribly those were his countrymen getting hurt here and there along the beach japanese field guns fired at the fleet shells splashed into the water around the warships they returned fire the japs might have been wiser to stay quiet when they drew notice to themselves bigger us guns did their damnedest to smash them flat somehow dutch looked away from the astonishing spectacle ahead he nudged les here come the lvis that made les glance back over his shoulder too sure enough the landing craftlanding vehicles infantry in official alphabetesewere coming alongside the valdosta liberty as they were alongside the rest of the troopships including the one that was on fire maybe that was a way to get the men off as fast as possible maybe it was more on the order of routine gone mad whatever it was les didnt have time to worry about it he nodded to the men with whom hed be going into battle mostly kids not old enough to vote some of them hardly old enough to shave leavened by a sprinkling of the old breed veterans like himself hed been wondering what to tell them when the moment finally came now it was here dont do anything stupid he said just like the book and everythingll be jake right their helmeted heads bobbed up and down despite the most realistic training the corps could give most of them had no idea what being under fire was like their big eyes tight lips and somber faces said their imaginations were working overtime les remembered how scared hed been when he got up to the line in france he soon discovered everybody else was just as scared including the germans were the japs on the beachand there were bound to be japs on the beachscared too they were supposed to make the hun look like a sundayschool teacher could they be scared les hoped so but he wouldnt have bet anything above a dime on it my company captain bradford shouted take to the boats marines climbed over the rail and scrambled down nets stretched over the side of the valdosta liberty men had been moving from ships to boats like that as long as thered been ships and boats as far as les was concerned there had to be a better way you could get smashed between ship and boat you could fall into the water and drown or you could fall into the boat and break your ankle none of those helped the country one goddamn bit a couple of men already in the lvi steadied dillon as he swung down from the net into the landing craft we got you sarge one of them said thanks les told himhe was a long way from too proud to be glad for the help as soon as his own feet were steady on the steel deck plates he reached up to help other descending marines they got everybody into the lvi without seeing anyone hurt les hoped that was a good omen he also knew damn well the record wouldnt last once they hit the beach diesel engine belching and farting the lvi pulled away from the troopship another one chugged up to take its place along with countless more it wallowed towards oahu les couldnt see out the sides of the boat were too high all he could see besides those steel walls were other marines in green dungarees and jackets and camouflage helmet covers like hisand for variety the sailors running the lvi who wore helmets painted battleship gray along with blue dungarees and shirts even if he couldnt see out he knew when the landing craft got close to shore the american naval barrage fell silent to keep short rounds from coming down on the lvis as soon as the warships guns ceased fire the japs on shore opened up with everything they had theyd kept a lot of their weapons quiet after all shells and mortar bombs started splashing down among the oncoming boats one burst close to les lvi fragments clattered off the boats side but none got through thank you jesus said a marine behind the sergeant les found himself nodding hed never been a churchgoing man but he wouldnt turn down anything he could get right now every now and then enemy rounds didnt come down among the american landing craft but on one or another of them then it wasnt splashblam but clangblam les winced every time he heard that the way he would have winced at hearing a drill in a dentists office and the drill might be for him next depending on what the dentist had to say and one of those clangblams might be for him next too depending on lord only knew what come on goddammit get to the beach goddammit somebody was saying over and over again after a bit les realized the words were coming out of his own mouth he wasnt saying anything everybody else wasnt thinking the lvis bottom grated on sand it rumbled forward anyway it wasnt so amphibious as an amtrac one of the tractors really designed to work on both land and water but it could get around a bit when out of its proper element a couple of swabbies undogged the loading gate it kicked up a splash when it fell open the lvi hadnt quite made it to the tide line out out out captain bradford screamed spread out and get off the beach as fast as you can move marines poured from the landing craft mortar rounds were bursting on the beach too throwing up plumes of golden sand machine guns stuttered out death from the undergrowth not nearly far enough away japanese tracers were bluewhite not red like their american counterparts bullets from those machine guns and enemy rifles kicked up sand spurts too men went down some of them and their buddies shouted doc hey doc for the navy corpsmen who served the marines others lay where they had fallen no medic would help a man blown to hamburger by a mortar bomb neither would anything else not till judgment day les charged past a japanese soldier sprawled on the ground all bloody with his longbayoneted rifle beside him he thought the man was deadtill a shot rang out behind him he whirled the round had come from an american rifle a marine said the son of a bitch was playing possum i saw him grab for his piece and i let him have it thanks les said had the jap got a shot off it would have gone into his back one of those japanese bluewhite tracers snapped past his head he threw himself down into a shell hole and fired back muttering welcome to fucking hawaii corporal takeo shimizu thought hed known everything war could do the bombardment from the us navy ships gathered off the northern beaches of oahu showed him he was wrong just getting to the beaches had been a nightmare the air attacks his regiment suffered bled it white before it ever reached its positions and when it did if this wasnt the end of the world you could see it from here shells roared in on the japanese positions they sounded like freight trains rumbling across the sky till they got close when they began to scream the guns from the destroyers and cruisers were bad enough when the battleships opened up you could see the huge shells coming the earth shuddered when they hit fragments screamed and howled blast picked you up flung you around and slammed you down like a kilo sumo wrestler on a mean drunk as the bombardment went on men started screaming shimizu didnt blame them he did some screaming himself as he had when the bombers came over his barracks here and there soldiers broke and ran away from the beach sometimes their own comrades shot them sometimes enemy shells took care of it before the japanese could to add insult to injury dive bombers roared down and dropped bombs on whatever the shells happened to miss we did this to the americans they fought afterwards shimizu thought we have to do the same but how he didnt dare stick his head up out of the hole where he huddled looking at the enemy was asking to be destroyed just huddling here was asking to be destroyed when the shelling and bombing paused shimizu was too shaken to respond for a moment or maybe longer than a moment more slowly than it should have duty reasserted itself my squad he sang out are you alive he supposed he should have put that better but it was how he felt here corporal shiro wakuzawa called from a nearby foxhole and me yasuo furusawa said a few other men also let shimizu know they were there and someone not far away groaned from a wounda bad one if the noises he made meant anything that was too bad but shimizu had bigger worries on his mind after things stayed quiet for a little while he did look out toward the pacific through the leaves and branches camouflaging his position zakennayo he exclaimed the sea was full of ships and boats warships lay not far offshore japanese guns were still shooting and a few vessels were on fire but only a few shimizu noted the warships yes but they didnt hold his attention for long slowly wallowing toward the beaches through the wavesa much milder sea than the japanese had faced in their winter assaultwere landing craft of a variety and profusion he had never imagined these left the trusty daihatsu barges on which he and his comrades had come ashore far far behind some were veritable ships big enough to hold almost anything shimizu didnt know what they carried and wasnt anxious to find out others smaller pretty plainly brought soldiers to the beach even those were an improvement on their japanese opposite numbers on a daihatsu barge a steel shield protected the man at the wheel and the machinegun or lightcannon crew the soldiers the barge carried were vulnerable to enemy fire all the way in not here these landing boats had real steel sides and front protecting the men in them shimizu stared in honest envy he wished his own country could have made landing craft like them a few japanese airplanes swooped low to attack the boats they did some damage but fearsome american fighters like the ones that had shot up shimizus regiment hacked several of them out of the sky shimizu groaned to see a beautiful zero reduced to nothing but a slick of gasoline burning on the surface of the sea be ready the noncom called to whoever could hear him theyre getting close behind him somebody with an officers authority in his voice shouted the enemy must not get off the beach we will drive him back into the pacific banzai for the emperor may he live ten thousand years banzai shimizu joined in the cry it heartened him if he thought about the emperor that enormous fleet out there and all the accompanying air power didnt seemquiteso terrifying an artillery shell scored a hit on one of the landing ships a column of smoke rose from the big vessel but it managed to reach the beach the doors at the bow opened out rumbled a tank a snorting monster bigger and fiercerlooking than anything japan built on it came sand flying up from its churning tracks the smaller landing boats were coming ashore too the men who scrambled out of them wore green uniforms not the khaki the americans had used before their helmets were also new domed like the japanese model rather than britishstyle steel derbies forward that officer yelled we must throw the invaders into the sea i will lead you forward was the last direction takeo shimizu wanted to go but i will lead you was hard to ignore and the habit of obedience to orders was as strong in him as in any other japanese soldier when the officer ran by katana in hand shimizu scrambled out of his foxhole and ran after him mortar bombs and artillery shells burst among the americans on the beach men fell men flew men were torn to pieces machinegun and rifle fire ripped into the yankees too not all of them went down worse luck a bullet cracked past shimizus head he threw himself down behind a boulder another bullet spanged off the front of it he had to make himself get up and run on combat got no easier because hed been away from it for a while if anything it felt harder the fear came back faster it felt worse than it had when the japanese invaded hawaii much worse than it had when he fought in china a mortar bomb hissed down not nearly far enough away that wasnt a japanese round shimizu remembered the sound of the burst from the last time hed fought americans one of his comrades started screaming fragments must have done their bloody work american machine guns started stitching the air with death too those big men in the unfamiliar uniforms wouldnt be easy to throw back shimizu looked around him you always wanted to see that you werent going forward all alone some of his men were still with him good other japanese farther away were advancing too yes very good the officer was looking around too when a burst from a yankee machine gun caught him in the chest the katana flew from his hand the blade flashed in the sun as it fell to the ground the officer twisted staggered and fell he kept thrashing on the ground but he was a dead man at least two maybe three rounds had torn out through his back as always exit wounds were ever so much larger and bloodier than the holes bullets made going in if one of those rounds hadnt found his heart he would still bleed to death in short order was anybody else of higher rank still up and fighting shimizu didnt see anyone that wasnt a good sign but he didnt have time to brood about it come on he shouted we can do it could they they had to try even though he ran forward in a crouch a bullet caught him in the side at first he felt only the impact his legs didnt want to carry him any more he held on to his rifle as he sprawled on the ground the pain hit then his mouth filled with blood when he howled he tried not to thrash like a dog hit by a truck if he lay still maybe he could take out one more enemy soldier an american in that new green uniform eyed him shimizu looked back his own eyes mere slits the american brought up his rifle to make sure of him shimizu tried to shoot first but found he lacked the strength to raise the heavy springfield he saw the muzzle flash then darkness crashed down saburo shindo shot down his second american fighter in the space of a few minutes it was luck as much as anything else he put a cannon shell through the enemys canopy and probably through the pilot too the plane out of control spiraled down to the pacific much good it does me shindo thought smash one ant and the rest would still steal the picnic the yankees were ashore it was the armys fight now the navy had done everything it couldand failed shindo hated failure he knew that none of what had happened was his fault that didnt mean it hadnt happened or that what sprang from it wouldnt be bad american landing craft littered the beaches like childrens toys at the edge of a bathtub those ingenious boats the great fleet of warships offshore and the stifling enemy air umbrella overhead spoke of an industrial power and of a determination far greater than hed imagined hed scorned the americans in he didnt enjoy that luxury any more tracers zipped past his zero he couldnt outdive or outclimb the us fighter on his tail he could outturn it and he did throwing his aircraft hard to the right the american tried to stay with him but couldnt only a japanese army hayabusa could turn with a zero but a hayabusa couldnt stay up with one if it did and shindo and his zero couldnt stay up with the american he fired a burst at the enemy fighter but it did no harm then the other plane sped away from his as if he were wearing heavy boots hed seen that before too it infuriated and humiliated him none of what he felt showed on his face or in his demeanor it seldom did an antiaircraft shell from one of the ships below burst too close for comfort it didnt harm the zero but staggered it as if it had rolled into a pothole in the air he swung through some quick turns and speed changes to throw off the gunners all the while wondering what to do next he couldnt harm the enemy carriers not now strafing the other warships wouldnt do a thing to their big guns he couldnt do much to the landing craft either and what he could do wouldnt matter the americans were on the beaches i have to hit them there then he decided he came in low machine guns hammering his bullets sent something up in flames enemy soldiers scrambled for cover and flopped down when they found it not all of them ran some stood their ground and blazed away at him with small arms theyd done the same thing during the first day of the japanese attack on hawaii anyone who thought the americans werent brave was a fool they were soft and they let themselves be captured so their enemies could make sport of them but in action they showed plenty of courage machine guns also opened up on shindo they put enough lead in the air to be nuisances or worse than nuisances a bullet clanged home somewhere behind the cockpit shindo eyed his instruments no damage showed his controls still worked he climbed spun back and made another run along the beach more fire answered him this time the americans were ready to the point of being triggerhappy they missed him though missed him again and again he watched his own bullets chew up sand and hoped they chewed up men as well after one more pass along the beach he saw he was low on gas time to go back and refuel hed got out of haleiwa by bouncing along the grass near the damaged airstrip if he could take off from a rolling pitching carrier deck he could also manage that but he pulled up instead of trying to land where hed got airborne the us naval bombardment had cratered the fields near the runway he would surely flip his zero if he tried to put it down if he couldnt land there though where could he the next closest runway was at wheeler field near the center of the island he knew the americans had worked wheeler over too but they would have done that from the air alone some of the bigger naval guns might have reached it but surely they would be concentrating on targets closer to shore shindo would have were he mounting an invasion he had to assume the americans would do the same wheeler was only a couple of minutes away he realized at once that the runways would not serve theyd been pounded hard and the bulldozers that might have fixed them in a hurry had been pounded even harder he saw several burntout hulks one of them had been flipped onto its back no mean feat with a machine so massive bombs had fallen on the grass around wheeler field but it wasntshindo was betting his life it wasntan impossible landing surface he came in as slow as he could just above stalling speed down went his landing gear he brought the fighters nose up and the tail down as if he were out to snag an arrester cable on a carrier deck he bounced to a stop it wasnt a landing to be proud of but he got down for the moment nothing else mattered he undogged the canopy pushed it back and stood up in the cockpit groundcrew men ran toward him what do you need they shouted everything shindo answered gas oil ammunition a place to piss one of the men pointed back into the bushes do it there the yankees wont spot you that way and do it fast before their planes come over again see you and shoot you up they werent just talking about him of course the americans were much more likely to spy his zero as shindo went into the bushes and undid his flying suit so he could ease himself he heard the buzz of engines overhead but that was the familiar buzz of his own countrys airplanes the zero and the hayabusa used the same powerplant keeping a few planes in the air to protect what was left of wheeler field struck him as a good idea though he pitied the army pilots in their peregrine falcons the fearsome new american fighters would chew them up and spit them out higher speed and the wing cannon gave zeros at least some kind of chance against the enemy when he came out of the undergrowth he didnt see any armorers working on those wing cannon whats the matter he demanded a man reloading one of his machine guns said so sorry pilotsan but this has been an army field for a while because hayabusas dont carry cannon i dont think weve got any mm ammunition zakennayo shindo exclaimed he thought hard wait a minute you fly donryus out of here neh the kiits name meant dragon swallowerwas the armys counterpart to the navys gm bomber it was faster but had a much shorter range like the gm it mounted a mm cannon for defensive armament im an idiot the armorer exclaimed he clapped a hand to his forehead then bowed please excuse me sir we store ammunition for bombers separately from what fighters use i dont care if you stow it up your back passage shindo said just get me some and hurry about it the armorer screamed at his colleagues one of them dashed away he came back fast enough to satisfy even the unhappy shindo no enemy airplanes had shown up which was all to the good shindo wondered if hed be able to take off again without nosing down into a hole in the ground the run was bumpy but he got airborne he would take off and land on highways if he had to all he wanted to do was hit the americans as hard as he could for as long as he could but how would he get refueled if he had to land on a highway how would the armorers reload his guns he shrugged for now he had fuel and ammunitionand plenty of americans to hit he roared back toward the landing beaches jiro takahashi stared at the script in front of him in dismay oh jesus christ he looked up to osami murata in even greater dismay so sorry muratasan but i cant say this why not the radio correspondent from tokyo asked calmly whats wrong with it whats wrong with it jiro echoed he hoped murata was joking but feared he wasnt it isnt true thats what how can you sayhow can you have me sayall the japanese in hawaii support the emperor against the usa not all the japanese in his own family supported the emperor against the usa as he knew too painfully well he kept quiet about that instead he said captain iwabuchi has put up signs all over honolulu that anyone who causes trouble will be shot hes put them up in english and korean and tagalog and chinese and japanese he wouldnt do that if he thought all the japanese here were loyal captain iwabuchi has to fight murata was patience personified thats not your job your job is to persuade people to support the emperor and japan youve been good at it takahashisan now you have to keep on doing it we need you more than ever in fact do you jiro tried to keep the worry out of his voice he probably ended up sounding like a machine he knew why they needed him more than ever the americans were ashore on the north coast of oahu they hadnt come very far yet but they plainly ruled the air here japan had used that edge to win after her invasion couldnt the united states do the same he feared it could yes we do beneath his calm beneath his good nature murata showed steel are you sure youre a loyal japanese citizen yourself takahashisan i should hope i am jiro said well i should hope you are too the radio man said but if you are youre going to have to prove it he tapped the script with an elegantly manicured fingernail with this jesus christ give me something i can read without wanting to go out and cut my throat afterwards jiro said hawaii isnt better off under the greater east asia coprosperity sphere than it was before not all japanese here love the emperor i wish they did but they dont i dont know what the koreans are doing but i dont think theyre flocking to volunteer along with their japanese coimperials koreans didnt like being part of the japanese empire the koreans in hawaii had made no secret of being glad they werent part of the empire any moreexcept now they were again murata waved jiros complaints aside as if they came from a little boy we all have to do what we can takahashisan he said were fighting a war its come here again we didnt want that to happen but it did we have to use every weapon we can get our hands on building morale here and in the home islands is one of the weapons we need youre scheduled to go on the air in a few minutes are you going to read what youre supposed to read or not reading it will help the empire if that doesnt matter to you he didnt say what would happen then by not saying he let pictures form in jiros mind jiro didnt like any of those pictures they started with bad things happening to him and went on to bad things happening to his sons and friends none of those bad things would be hard to arrange not at all he played the last trump in his hand im going to complain to chancellor morimura if he reminded murata who his friends were maybe the man would back off instead murata laughed uproariously go ahead takahashisan go right ahead who do you think wrote that script anyway not chancellor morimura jiro said in something not far from horror with more than a little malicious glee the broadcaster from tokyo nodded the very same now takahashisan enough of this nonsense get on with it and no more backtalk miserably jiro obeyed he wondered how he could get through the program but hed done enough of them that he had no trouble reading the words set out before him he thought his performance left something to be desired but the engineer in the room next to the studio gave him a thumbsup through the window that let the man see in when it was over sweat drenched jiro he stumbled out of the studio murata waited in the hallway all solicitude now that hed got what he wanted very good he said you see that wasnt so hard whatever you say jiro answered dully yes whatever i say murata had that elegant accent he wore a fancy suit and he had all the arrogance the japanese conquerors had brought with them from the home islands jiro had admired that arrogance when it was aimed at the local haoles when it was pointed at him and fired like a gun it felt different then amazing how different it felt please excuse me muratasan im going home so long murata said as if he and jiro were still on friendly terms as if we were ever on friendly terms jiro thought murata had used him the way a man would use any tool that came in handy i was too dumb to see it i see it now though he didnt intend to say anything about it if he did hiroshi and kenzo would only laugh at him hearing i told you so from his sons was the last thing he wanted the thick nasty greasy smell of burning fuel oil filled the air hed got used to that after the japanese bombed the pearl harbor tank farms then once the tanks finally burned dry the stink went away now it was back it wasnt so strong this time probably because japan didnt stow nearly so much fuel here as the usa had but the americans had hit what there was men from the special naval landing forces and civilians worked together to build barricades and machinegun nests at street corners the civilians hadnt volunteered for the duty which didnt mean they could get out of it when a haole man didnt move fast enough to suit one of the navy men he got the stock of an arisaka rifle in the side of the head blood running down his cheek and jaw the white man threw another chunk of rubble on the growing barricade and then another a soldier gestured with his rifle at takahashi hey you hai you there get over here and give the emperor a hand please excuse me but i just did jiro answered i just finished broadcasting for muratasan now tell me one ill believe the navy man said scornfully but one of his pals said hang oni know this guys voice youre the one they call the fisherman arent you i listen to you whenever i can thats me jiro said a few minutes before hed hated his connection to the japanese radio now he used it even if he did hate it he shook his head life was stranger and more complicated than anyone could imagine till hed put a good many miles under his keel let him go the second soldier urged the first hes done his bit and weve got plenty of warm bodies here all right all right have it your way the first man from the special naval landing forces sounded disgusted but he didnt argue any more go on you he told jiro you better keep your nose clean domo arigato i will thank you jiro got out of there in a hurry the americans hadnt fought much inside honolulu theyd surrendered when driven back to the citys outskirts that spared the civilian population but surrender wasnt in the japanese soldiers vocabulary the special naval landing forces looked to be getting ready to battle it out house to house would anything be left standing by the time the battle was through more to the point did anybody on either side care joe crosetti gulped coffee in the bunker hills wardroom if not for java he didnt know how the hell he would keep going hed heard the pharmacists mates were giving out benzedrine tablets to pilots who asked for them he hadnt tried to find out not yet he didnt think he needed that big a kick in the pants it had occurred to him though in the seat next to his orson sharp slurped from a bottle of coke he was serious about staying away from the hot drinks that were forbidden to him but he needed a jolt too a couple of empties sat by his feet youre gonna be pissing like a racehorse joe said what do you do if youre up in your hellcat and you gotta whizz sharp smiled what looked like a very secular smile ever hear of a streetcar drivers friend he asked when joe shook his head his buddy explained the gadget son of a bitch joe said thats a great idea but what if it comes loose when youre pulling a lot of gs youll have piss all over the inside of your flight suit maybe all over the inside of the cockpit hasnt happened yet sharp answered and ive flown that plane every which way but inside out im thinking of writing a testimonial for the company jeez louise i dont blame you joe said but what about your john henry how does it like the friend when you weigh four times as much as youre supposed to everything hurts then orson sharp said matteroffactly which was true enough hes not bruised or anythingill tell you that okay i wish id thought of it myself joe said can you get em on the ship or did you bring it aboard i brought mine so i dont know if you can get them or not youd probably do best asking the toughestlooking cpo you can find if he cant tell you nobody can makes sense cpos know everythingor if they dont they sure think they do joe said that had been a revelation to him since boarding the carrier when he was in flight training almost all his instructors were officers hed dealt with petty officers only when navigating the maze of navy bureaucracy now he saw the senior ratings were the men who held things together they might be able to run the ship better without officers than officers could without them a plane roared in and landed up above their heads the ship shook a little but only a little an essex class carrier displaced upwards of tons a few tons of airplane werent much next to that joe and orson sharp both said dauntless at the same time engine noise was a dead giveawayif you knew what you were listening for by now they both did how does it feel being a veteran sharp asked joe considered a yawn interrupted his consideration tired he said his friend nodded thats the truth he took another swig from the waspwaisted green glass bottle then burped softly excuse me his politeness was automatic hed been a gentleman before he became an officer after one more swig he went on were doing what weve got to do though oh hell yes joe nodded vigorously the marines and army men were on the ground in oahu and fighting their way south from the invasion beaches it wasnt easy or cheapquit didnt seem to be in the japs vocabularybut they were doing it some japanese submarines still prowled around but the enemys surface fleet in these waters had taken a ko and enemy air power was on its last legs japan had proved naval air could beat the landbased variety now the usa was extending the lesson some of their pilots are awful good sharp said i ran into this guy in an oscar the other day he could make that little plane sit up and beg and darn nearhe might have been the only man on the carrier who would have said darn nearwag its tail i had two more hellcats with me and we couldnt touch him he got out of stuff you couldnt get out of we never laid a glove on himand i landed with a hole in my prop they can leave you talking to yourself all right joe agreed with those two little machine guns though they have a devil of a time hurting you and you can get away from em easy as pie as long as you dont dogfight em youre okay he paused did they patch you up or put a new propeller blade on new blade sharp told him i couldve flown without the repair if i had toits only acaliber holebut why take chances weve got the spares and thats what theyre here for better believe it joe said and pretty soon the japs wont have any planes left or anywhere to fly them out of if they do i dont care how sweet a pilot you are if you cant get off the ground you might as well pick up a rifle and go fight with the infantry before answering orson sharp finished the coke and set the bottle down by the other dead soldiers thats probably what happened to some of our guys after december his voice was grim yeah it probably is joe didnt like to think about what had happened to american servicemen of any sort since hawaii fell but that would have been an extra humiliation on top of all the others not to be able to fight the way youd trained so hard to do time to pay em back an hour later he was in the cockpit again buzzing towards oahu orson sharp was up there with him their orders were looser than they had been at the very start of the land campaign they were supposed to shoot up anything that moved on the ground knock down any planes that came up against them and especially make sure the enemy didnt have the chance to repair his airfields one of those fields the one at haleiwa had already fallen into us hands as joe flew above it he saw bulldozers and steamrollers swarming over the strip to put it back in commission he also saw artillery coming down nearby the field wasnt ready to use not by a long shot he preferred flying off a carrier deck to shellfire hellcats were wellprotected planes but nothing on gods green earth would save you if you stopped a mm round as if to remind him of that puffs of black smoke from antiaircraft shells burst all around him the japs put up as much flak as they could this wasnt nearly so heavy as it had been when he flew over the japanese carriers and their escorts though that had been almost thick enough to walk on it had scared him too now he had its measure you jinked a little you sped up and slowed down you tried not to give them a straight shot at you once youd done that you went on with your mission every so often somebody got shot down you just hoped your number wasnt up that particular day that thought had hardly crossed his mind when a hellcat trailing smoke fell out of the sky and crashed into a rice paddy down below no way the pilot could have got outit happened too fast oh you poor unlucky son of a bitch joe said the flak must have murdered his engineor murdered him so he had no chance to pull up or bail out a machine gun turned its winking eye joes way those coldly frightful iceblue japanese tracers zipped past the hellcat joes thumb stabbed the firing button red american tracers jumped out ahead of the fighter he had six machine guns all of them firing heavier slugs than the japs weapon joe wouldnt have wanted to catch acaliber round if the wound didnt kill you the sheer shock of getting hit was liable to only a handful of oscars and zeros rose against the hellcats so did one sharpnosed fighter of a type he hadnt seen before that had to be a tony an army machine with an engine based on the messerschmitts liquidcooled inline powerplant and not the radial engine that powered both other japanese fighters tonys were supposed to be fast and wellarmed this one beset by half a dozen hellcats didnt last long enough for joe to tell much though it survived more battle damage before going down than other enemy planes joe had met if there were more of those they could be a royal pain he thought the tony looked a hell of a lot like an me part of that no doubt was the engine which dictated the shape of the planes front end but he still wondered whether some german engineers had stepped in and given the japs a hand that wasnt his worry he and the other hellcat pilots took turns shooting up hickam field down by pearl harbor watching japs sprint for cover was fun watching some of them not make it was even more fun it didnt feel as if hed just shot men any more than it had when he downed enemy airplanes they were just targets and he was glad hed hit them someone else had set a bulldozer on fire joe admired the column of smoke that rose from it as long as the hellcats kept coming back the japs could only repair the runways at night and earlymorning visits by dauntlesses made sure theyd have new damage to fix the next night you didnt see japanese soldiers marching along highways by regiments any more to joe that was a damn shame theyd been awful easy to shoot up then but they werent fools theyd learned better in a hurry these days they traveled by squads and platoons and they stayed off the roads whenever they could that did make it harder to strafe them of course it also made it harder for them to move and to fight which helped the gyrenes and dogfaces on the ground joe looked for gun emplacements strafing artillery pieces was always worth doing people said shellfire killed and wounded a lot more men than all the rounds from rifles and machine guns put together joe didnt know if that was true but hed heard it more than once a lot of the japs gun pits were in the junglecovered mountains and camouflaged with fastidious attention to detail he spotted one gun only because he saw the muzzle flash if not for that he never would have known where it was how theyd manhandled it up there was beyond him when he ran low on ammo he flew back toward the bunker hill one by one his fellow pilots were breaking off too he laughed a little hed had all this training in formation flying and here he was on his own the japs didnt have enough planes in the air to make neat formations necessary any more a destroyer was on fire a few miles off the coast of oahu some enemy pilot had managed to get through the cap overhead the japs were still giving it everything they had they didnt seem to realize they were fighting out of their weightor else they just didnt give a damn destroyers and their bigger buddies needed to stay close to shore so they could pound enemy positions with their guns the carriers cruised farther northwith luck farther out of harms way joe didnt see any of them in trouble and was glad not to he found his own ship and lined up on her stern after that he did exactly what the landing officer told him to do not making his own decisions never failed to rattle him that was what he was supposed to do when he was in the air but he had to obey here hed seen that ever since he first tried putting down on the placid old wolverine on lake erie he believed it he just didnt like it the landing officer straightened him up got his approach angle a little gentler and then dropped the wigwag flags joe shove the stick forward the hellcat dove for the carriers deck the tailhook missed the first arrester wire but caught the second one the fighter jerked to a stop joe scrambled out the deck crew got the plane out of the way so the next hellcat in line could land anything special she needs sir one of the ratings asked ammos run dry joe answered fuels still okay engines behaving the petty officer waved and grinned and nodded joe trotted across the planking to the island and then down to the wardroom for debriefing he looked around most of the fliers whod gone out were back but wheres sharp he asked didnt you see somebody said he took a flak hit and went down nobody spotted a chute so he bought the farm for sure poor sucker oh that was him it felt like a blow in the belly you okay man the other flier asked you look a little green numbly joe shook his head he tried to put some of what he felt into words we were roomies at the start of training we were buddies all the way through he was always better in class than i was he was always better in a plane than i was too and now im here and hes gone he wouldnt saydead dammit he shook his head again and stared down at the deck so the other pilot wouldnt see tears in his eyes i dont believe it thats tough the other mana guy joe hardly knew not the way he knew orson sharp had he known anybody but his kid brother the way he knew sharpspoke with rough sympathy weve all lost friends fuckin wars a fuckin mess but what can you do you gotta pick it up you gotta suck it up if we dont kick the nips yellow asses none of this means shit yeah every word of that was true none of it helped joe felt even more empty than he had when the japs bombed uncle tonys house hed got that news secondhand after it happened this hell hed seen sharp go down he hadnt known who it was though knowing would have been even worse because it wasnt as if he could have done anything about it just bad luck the other pilot said well pay em back though well pay em back and then some sure joe stared down at the deck again he imagined a house in salt lake city in his imagination it looked a lot like his house though he knew it probably wouldnt for real he imagined a western union messenger getting off a bike or out of a carprobably off a bike with gasoline so hard to come by these daysand going to the door with a deeply regrets telegram from the war department and he imagined the lives of his buddys parents and brothers and sistershe had a big familyturned upside down and inside out christ they wouldnt even get to bury him there probably wasnt enough left to bury if we dont kick the nips yellow asses none of this means shit there was the war in one profane sentence but with orson sharp dead another thought filled joes mind even if they did kick the nips yellow asses did any of this mean shit kenzo takahashi approached the barricade with more than a little trepidation seeing a machine gun aimed at your belly button would do that who are you demanded one of the men behind the gun why should we let you by like most of the soldiers from the special naval landing force he was both meaner and jumpier than the army men theyd supplanted in and around honolulu after giving his name kenzo added im jiro takahashis son do you listen to him and that did the trick and not for the first time either the scowling soldier at the machine gun suddenly grinnedand all of a sudden he was a friendly kid no older than kenzo youre the fishermans son you must be all right then come ahead he even gave kenzo a hand to help him scramble up over the barricade it made kenzo want to laugh and cry at the same time he wasnt all right not the way the soldier meant he was rooting for the usa not for japan he hated trading on his fathers celebrity among the occupiers however much he hated it he did it because it worked he felt as if he were getting away with passing counterfeit money every time on he went the soldiers at the next barricade seeing that hed passed the one before didnt give him any trouble that was a relief everybody in honolulu locals and occupiers alike was nervous these days with american planes in the air with american troops ashore plenty of people whod sucked up to the japanese were trying to figure out how to explain what theyd been up to since december the occupiers knew that perfectly well they might be bastards but they werent fools they trusted next to nobody now and often showed mistrust by opening fire and the way they treated locals showed no signs of getting betterif anything it was getting worse kenzo talked his way past two more barricades before he made it to elsie sundbergs neighborhood no soldiers were on her street which relieved him nobody else was out and about either that struck him as smart this was the haole part of town and the japanese trusted whites even less than they trusted anybody else farther west the occupiers had plastered up propaganda posters saying things like asians together against imperialism in several languages they didnt bother here the haoles lay low and hoped neglect wouldnt turn to massacre elsie opened the door even before kenzo knocked come in honey she said come in quick he did she shut the door behind him the venetian blinds were closed nobody could see in from the street are you okay she asked giving him a hug me yeah sure im fine kenzo didnt say anything about running the machinegun gauntlet on the way over here he just clung to her hello ken mrs sundberg came out from the kitchen before hed got elsie away from the soldiers in the parkand before what happened afterwardsher arrival would have made him let go of her daughter as if elsie had become redhot not now he kept on holding her and mrs sundberg didnt say boo she just went on with the rituals of hospitality would you like some lemonade yes maam thank you kenzo said she did make good lemonade as she went back to the kitchen to get some he asked elsie you folks have enough to eat she shrugged were all right were not great but were all right she was a lot skinnier than she had been when they went to school together he was thinner too but not to the same degree there were advantages to being a fisherman in hard times how are things out in the city mrs sundberg asked returning with lemonade for kenzo and for elsie we ah dont get out much these days youre smart not to kenzo answered if you werent staying close to home i sure would tell you to he talked about the barricades and about how the occupation troops were getting antsier by the hour i think theyre liable to make a big fight right here in town and to heck with civilians it looks that way anyhow thats not good elsie said which was a pretty fair understatement not even a little bit kenzo agreed its one of the reasons i came over hereto ask if you people have any kind of hiding place you can duck into if things get really bad he didnt go into detail about what really bad might mean or how bad it might be he had the idea he didnt know in any detail himself and that that might be just as well for his own peace of mind elsies mother sniffed these houses arent like the one in connecticut where i grew up they dont have a proper basement by the way she sounded that might have been kenzos fault by the way elsie said oh mom she must have thought the same thing its true mrs sundberg said and you know how much harder it made things when your father dug that hideyhole under the walkin closet during the first round of unpleasantness she didnt like talkingor thinkingabout the japanese invasion kenzo had seen that before she would if she had toshe wasnt far enough out in left field not to believe in it or anythingbut she didnt like it it had turned her world upside down and it meant she wasnt on top of the world any more when the usa finished the job here she would be again how would she feel about kenzo then that was a worry for another day hideyhole kenzo echoed see for yourself mrs sundberg led him into the bedroom she shared with her husband hed never been in there before the closet made him want to laugh or to scream all by itself it seemed half the size of his familys apartment why would anybody need all that stuff the trap door in the floor though had to be of recent vintage it lay under a throw rug and was hard to spot in the gloom even with the rug off elsies mom made an oddly courteous gesture of invitation kenzo bent and lifted up the trap door the hinges worked without a sound the scent of damp earth rose from below into the closet as mrs sundberg said the house had no basement only a crawl space her husband had dug out a hole under the trap door and had heaped the dirt hed dug out around it to help protect it from gunfire and shell fragments it wouldnt do much if a bomb fell on the house for anything short of that wow kenzo said lowering the trap again thats swell mrs sundberg neatly replaced the rug ralph was in france in she said he knows something about entrenching he never talks about what he did in the war elsie said from the times kenzo had met him mr sundberg rarely talked about anything he made money for the family his wife and daughter did the talking they all seemed content with the arrangement elsie went on this was the first time he ever did anything that showed he really had been in the fighting what horrors had her father seen over there what had he done he probably had reasons to keep quiet having got a glimpse of what war looked like when the japanese pounded honolulu a glimpse and a pounding that cost him his mother kenzo had some idea how lucky he was not to know more no sooner had that thought crossed his mind than antiaircraft guns started hammering much too close by look if theres any sign of trouble you use that hole you hear he said dont wait its pretty bad we will elsie and her mother spoke at the same time okay i better go then thats what i wanted to make sure about what he really wanted was to take elsie back to her bedroom and close the door he couldnt say that or do anything about it not with mrs sundberg standing right there he just dipped his head awkwardly be careful elsie wasnt as shy as he was she hugged him and gave him a kiss that made him want to take her back there more than ever and she whispered in his ear my time of the month came so thats okay good he whispered back worrying about a girlfriend was hard enough worrying about a girlfriend who was expecting would have been twice as bad or maybe four times after a moment kenzo kissed elsie mrs sundberg was still standing right there and she didnt say a word major general yamashita had moved his headquarters out of iolani palace and over to pearl city minoru genda wished the commanding general hadnt for one thing it gave him fewer excuses to visit queen cynthia for another it put the defense of honolulu in the hands of captain iwabuchi and the special naval landing forces iwabuchi was a samurai of the old godownfighting school he could not have cared less if he took all the civilians and the whole city down with him we still have a lot of sailors at pearl harbor genda said the americans put men like that in the line against us if you want to do the same sir they are ready and willing to fight alongside your soldiers theyll probably have to yamashitas voice was gloomy the american soldiers who tried fighting as infantry got slaughtered the same will likely happen to our men he glowered at the map spread out on a table in front of him blueheaded pins and pencil marks showed the american advance between the waianae and koolau ranges despite desperate japanese counterattacks us forces ground forward day by day yamashita went on we dont really need sailors fighting on land we need carriers and planes yes sir genda knew too well that all the carriers japan had left put together couldnt launch half as many planes as the us armada off the north coast of oahu he also knew that the planes the japanese could launch were nowhere near a match for their american opponents we have requested reinforcements he said so far tokyo has not seen fit to send them out admiral yamamoto was too smart to waste resources like that genda hoped he was anyhow there would be other battles to fight later battles where japan wouldnt be at such an overwhelming disadvantage the soldiers and sailors already here could go right on delaying us forces that was what they were good for now the land equivalent of a fleet in being how long they could stay in being was the last important question general yamashita didnt see things that way genda could hardly blame him zakennayo yamashita burst out theyre playing games with my mens lives back in the home islands i want to fight with some chance of victory gallant defeats make fine poetry but the people the poems talk about dont get the chance to hear them neh hai honto genda said and it was true he shrugged were at the end of a very long supply line sir no yamashita shook his big head as angry and frustrated as a baited bear we were on the end of a long supply line now the americans have cut it off when we took hawaii they couldnt bring anything in now we cant this is not a good omen no sir its not genda could hardly disagree with that we have to hang on as long as we can yamashita made a disgusted noise if this were some other part of the world id pull back into the mountains and harass the enemy for months maybe for years but this is a terrible jungle to fight a war in because you cant live in it theres next to no game and next to no fruit for a long time we were the ones who took advantage of that sir genda said escaped prisoners of war cant live off the countryside the way they can in malaya or the philippines prisoners major general yamashita fairly spat the word if we lose here there are liable to be prisoners japan would lose face because of that with a scowl he went on i assure you though commander i will not be one of those prisoners if you are with me at the final moments perhaps you would honor me by acting as my second of course sir it would be my privilege japanese officers soldiers and sailors were trained to commit suicide rather than letting themselves be captured ritual seppuku was a survival from samurai days back then a second had used his sword to take off his companions head after the latter began the act of slitting his belly these days a pistol was more common both weapons quickly and cleanly took the victim out of his pain genda felt he had to add i hope that day does not come so do iwhich doesnt mean it wont yamashita said genda bit his lip and nodded the time might also come when he needed a secondor if he was rushed or in danger of falling into enemy hands the inelegance of a pistol or a grenade might have to do trying to shove worry aside he pointed at the map and said we may be able to hold them at the narrowest stretch between the mountain ranges maybe but the commanding general didnt sound as if he believed it hard to hold in the face of that much air power and the americans tanks are very goodeven better than the russian machines we fought in mongolia in those also had to be new models because that certainly hadnt been true of the handful of tanks the yankees used here in japan did not have many tanksand the ones she did have didnt match up well against those of the other great powers the soviet union had painfully proved that in the border war just before the fighting in europe broke out a country needed a strong automotive industry to build good tanks in quantity japan didnt have one we would have in a few more years genda thought his country had done so much so fast to hurl itself from feudalism headlong into the modern age japanese ships and warplanes and infantry weapons measured up to any in the world but she hadnt been able to do everything at once now the question was how much would that cost her no more carriers eh no more airplanes major general yamashita said it wasnt really a question please excuse me sir but i have to tell you it doesnt seem likely genda said too bad they could let us make a real fight of it yamashita shook his head now now i have a hard time holding on to hope with the enemy in control of the air with the enemy in control of the sea all we can hope to do is delay the inevitable i understand sir genda said even that can be valuable it wins the empire more time to ready itself for the battles that lie ahead hai a small consolation but a consolation yamashita did not sound consoled he had to see he would die on oahu genda foresaw the same fate for himself when there was no escape all you could do was fight but he feared for the empire in those coming battles if the americans could bring a force like this to bear wherever they chose how could japan hope to withstand them and american factories and shipyards were still working at full tilt how long before the united states could muster two such forces or three how long before japan could muster even one that he feared would take much longer admiral yamamoto had foreseen all this even back when they were first beginning to plan the pearl harbor operation and the assault on hawaii yamamoto had feared these blows wouldnt be enough their success had bought japan almost two years to conquer and consolidate genda hoped his country had done enough in that time to ready itself for the blows that lay ahead he hoped so yes but he doubted he would be around to see one way or the other karma neh he said to yamashita shigata ga nai he was here because of a plan hed offered to admiral yamamoto without it the japanese fleet would have struck at oahu and then withdrawn genda shook his head bad as this was that would have been worse the americans would have kept this excellent base they would have caused japan trouble far sooner than they were able to here in the real world things do not always happen as we wish they would yamashita said our troubles here the difficulties germany is having in russia yes genda said and there was another irony japan and the ussr were neutral soviet freighters could and did travel across the pacific from vladivostok to the us west coast and pick up arms and munitions to use against japans european allies no one interfered with them in any way war and diplomacy were curious businesses antiaircraft guns started booming genda didnt hear american fighters roaring in at treetop height to shoot up anything that moved instead the rumble of engines was deeper and quieter at the same time the planes making the racket were flying high to gendas embarrassment yamashita realized what was going on before he did their damned bombers are back he moved not a muscle when he didnt seek shelter genda could hardly do so however much he wanted to while they could still get planes off the ground the japanese had sent bombers of their own to kauai to strike back at the planes that had dealt their airfields such a devastating blow the pilots had reported wrecking a lot of them plainly they hadnt wrecked enough just as plainly the american logistical push was even more impressive than genda had thought those us heavy bombers must have got to kauai as near dry as made no difference the americans had brought along enough fuel to get a lot of them airborne again along with bombs for them to carry maybe we should have put bigger garrisons on the other islands genda thought but oahu was the one that really counted either japan would have had to pull men from here or brought in more troops overall which meant more mouths to feed it hadnt seemed worthwhile the ground shook under genda as bombs burst only a few hundred meters away yamashita sat impassive in front of the map maybe hed already resigned himself to death now or before too long genda supposed he ought to do the same a warrior had to after all but achieving that indifference he found came harder than it should have you sure you ought to go to work oscar van der kirk asked susie these japs in town nowadays theyve got blood in their eye ill be okay susie was wearing the frumpiest dress she owned but nothing on gods green earth would make her look like margaret dumont she went on theyre not going to shoot me any which way and batted those catblue eyes at him there were times when he didnt know whether to laugh or to pop her one he ended up laughing now because she would have hit back or thrown things if he did try to pop her youve got to worry about the other too he said stubbornly some of the things ive heard about those bastards susie made an impatient gesture weve heard that stuff about the japs ever since they got here some of its true too oscar said some of it yeah but not all of it most of the time they havent been too bad susie said as far as oscar was concerned that was damning with faint praise but susie would do whatever she felt like doing if the world didnt like it that was the worlds tough luck as if to prove as much she picked up her handbag kissed him goodbyea long slow delicious kiss as if to give him something to look forward to when she got back that eveningand went out the door jesus oscar said hoarsely listening to her footsteps receding down the hall he shook his head waiting for his heart to stop pounding it didnt want to susie was a hell of a piece of worka hell of a piece periodno two ways about it still shaking his head he gathered up his sailboard and carried the contraption down to waikiki beach to his relief the japs hadnt cordoned it off with barbed wire but they did have machinegun nests and mortar positions camouflaged with golden sand every fifty yards or so along the beach and more of those halfsoldier halfsailor types trotting here and there fortunately one of their noncoms or ratings or whatever the hell he was had seen oscar before oscar bowed to himnot easy when he had the big clunky surf board under one arm and the mast and rigging and sail in his other hand but he managed the jap even deigned to bow back though not so deeply more to the point the toughlooking little man waved him on toward the pacific thanks oscar said and then arigato he knew only a handful of japanese words but hed learned that one long before the war started it came in handy all kinds of places and it sure came in handy now the japs face lit up his grin exposed several gold teeth he bowed again this time as equal to equal and shouted to his men oscar couldnt understand any of it but by the way they smiled and nodded it must have been good how to win friends and influence people he thought the japanese had chased the fishermen off the beach but they let oscar paddle out to sea they were used to him and didnt think he was heading out to a submarine or anything like that only he knew about the submarine hed met he hadnt even told susie though he had asked the subs skipper to get word to her family on the mainland that she was all right he ran up his mast rigged the sail and scooted out to sea on the breeze from off the hills in back of honolulu even as the land receded he could still hear the rumble of artillery off in the distance it made him think about things in a way he hadnt for quite a while if his countrymen took over again could he patent the sailboard if he could there was probably money in it hed done without much money for a long time having some might be nice hed got out far enough to think about dropping his hooks into the pacific when he spotted something floating on the water it was too small to be a boat and it wasnt going anywhere just bobbing on the swells curious he swung the sailboard towards it hed just realized it was a rubber raft when a head popped up out of it hey mac what the hell you call that thing youre on the heads possessor asked in purest brooklynese a sailboard oscar answered automatically he had questions of his own who are you are you okay howd you get here want me to help you get to land a sailboard aint that somethin whatll they think of next the guy in the raft jabbed a thumb at his own chest names nick tversky yeah im jakenot a fuckin scratch on me sometimes youd rather be lucky than good ya know goddamn nip flak tore hell outta my engine but the shit all missed me can you get me ashore without letting everybody from tojo on down in on where im at uh oscar paused that would have been easy before the americans came to hawaiian waters the japs hadnt been so antsy then they sure as hell were now dont know for sure if i can sneak you in okay dont get your ass in an uproar about it the downed pilot sounded a lot more cheerful than oscar would have in his little rubber boat he explained why they got pbys doin search and rescue figure i got a better chance of getting picked up than i do sneakin past the fuckin slanteyes if i have to try it i guess i can paddle that far okay said oscar who was dubious you want me to give you a line and some hooks you might catch something hed been about to start fishing himself before he spotted the life raft thats white of you buddy but honest to god i think ill be fine nick tversky said he hadnt been out here long he wasnt badly sunburned and he hardly needed a shave plainly he wasnt too thirsty either oscar didnt know what to do or what to tell him meeting a downed pilot was something hed thought about now and again meeting a foulmouthed downed pilot who didnt want to be rescued that was a different story awful good to see the usa coming back here he tried adding about time hey i aint the brass i cant do nothin about that nick tversky said but speakin of brass i figure we didnt try it for a while after we screwed the pooch the first time on account of we wanted to make sure we had the brass knucks on i guess that makes sense oscar said we sure missed you though what can you do sometimes you just gotta stand the gaff tversky obviously had no idea what oahu had been through since december on the other hand oscar had no idea what getting shot down in a fighter plane was like did the two balance out he couldnt have said not like the scales of justice but they probably belonged somewhere in the same ballpark good luck to you oscar said uncertainly afraid he was leaving tversky to a fate much worse than the pilot imagined but then tversky let out a whoop and pointed off to the east theres my goddamn taxi if i can flag it down oscar looked that way a speck in the sky swelled rapidly it was a flying boat all right was it an american flying boat the japs had em too nick tversky seemed in no doubt he waved like a man possessed he pulled out what looked like a pistol and fired it straight up it turned out to be a flare gun the flare was much less impressive than it would have been at night a small red ball of fire but either it or the pilots gesticulatinghe damn near capsized the raftdid the trick the flying boat swung its blunt nose toward him he whooped again louder and more ferocious than an indian in a tworeeler western the pby if that was what it was splashed down onto the pacific and rumbled toward him somebody leaned out of a hatchoscar was hazy on the right nameand yelled whats this old home week hes my buddy tversky yelled back and then more quietly what the hell you say your name was oscar oscar answered oscar heres good luck the pilot went on he shows up and then you show up what the hell kind of a name for a hawaiian is oscar said the guy on the pby im from california oscar said dryly ive lived here eight years or so fuck me the flier said they took tversky aboard the flying boat the engines roared back to life the big clumsylooking airplane lumbered over the pacific graceless as a goose running across the surface of a lake to take off when it finally got airborne it didnt seem so splendidly suited to the new medium as a goose but it flew well enough it kept on going in the direction it had been heading when its crew spotted the downed flier that left oscar alone on the water with an empty rubber raft score one for our side he said hed first set eyes on tversky less than half an hour earlier now the pilot was gone in a day or so if not in mere hours hed be back in the war as for oscarive got fish to catch he thought and sailed out a little farther before dropping his lines into the sea hed hoped running into tversky would bring him good luck but it didnt his catch was average or slightly below but you took what you could get maybe not for too much longer maybe things will get back to the way they used to be he could hope anyway he brought the sailboard back to waikiki beach with automatic skill he could hardly have imagined when he first thought up the gadget as with anything else practice made pretty darn good charlie kaapu had been every bit as smooth as he was what the devil had happened to charlie oscar scowled as he took the sailboard over the breakers whatever it was it wasnt anything he could fix hed put his own neck on the line trying that consoled him not very much some of the japs on the beach actually applauded when he came ashore he would have liked that better if he hadnt been thinking about charlie he would have liked it better if he hadnt had to cough up a couple of fat mackerel to keep their goodwill too cost of doing business he thought that did console himsome anyway when he got back to the apartment he found susie there by all the signs shed been there quite a while she was fallingdown drunk the place reeked of the horrible fruity stuff they called gin these days shed never done anything like that in all the time hed known her what happened he blurted she looked up from the beatup old sofa her eyes didnt want to track him oscar she said thank god after a moist hiccup she added it couldve been me what could have he asked what happened babe he wished he had some coffee in the place but it was harder than hell to come by these days hed lost the habit i was going to work to work susie repeated maybe forgetting shed just said that and these japshjapsat one of the barricades she had to try three times before she got the word right these japs they had a girl down in the middle of the street and they they all she didnt go on tears started running down her face it could have been me hey oscar said softly hey he might have been gentling a spooked horse i told you so came to the tip of his tongue and died there which was probably lucky for him hed heard that these sailorsoldiers did things like that which was why he hadnt been thrilled when susie headed for work in the morning he went over and cautiously put a hand on her shoulder she flinched but only a little im glad youre okay he told her shed earned the right to get smashed sure as the devil it could have been me she said one more time then she clung to him and cried her heart out he hadnt seen many tears from her before what am i gonna do she asked after the storm passed i think you better stay in here not let those bastards spot you oscar answered ill go nuts she said ill lose my tan snockered as she was that seemed to matter a lot to her but then she shuddered remembering what shed seen ill do it okay oscar said for now just settle down get some sleep if you can youll feel it when you wake up im afraid im not drunk she said irately sure babe sure oscar lied without hesitation the things you do for love he thought with a wry smile then he stopped cold as usual the word brought him up short but he nodded to himself whether the word made him nervous or not it talked about something real he gave susie a kiss whats that for she asked just because he said just because guards hustled american pows south away from the american soldiers whod landed to bring oahu back under the stars and stripes like mostprobably allof his buddies fletch armitage would sooner have run toward the americans than away from them shooting squads or no shooting squads the guards might have been bastards but they werent stupid bastards they could figure that out for themselves the minute anybody got the slightest bit out of line they opened fire dead prisoners marked the road back toward honolulu men slipped away anyhow especially at night fletch got no sleep every few minutes a rifle or a light machine gun would bark screams from the wounded punctuated the time between bursts of gunfire sometimes the japs would let wounded men howl other times they would go out and finish them off with rifle butts or bayonets fletch couldnt decide which noises were more horrible but the noises werent what made him sit tight a cold calculation of the odds was could he get away from the guards possible but not likely once he did could he sneak through the japanese lines without getting murdered by ordinary enemy soldiers also possible but even less likely put the two together and he figured his chances were much less than drawing the king of spades to fill out a royal flush when the sun came up he saw how many americans had died trying to get away and how many hadnt diedyet had he had anything in his stomach he might have thrown it up the japs hadnt bothered feeding the pows though it didnt look as if they were going to start now either curses and kicks got the prisoners on their feet the guards bayoneted one man who had trouble after that the stronger americans helped their weaker buddies up isogi the guards shouted how they expected the pows to hurry was beyond fletch but they did bastards somebody said fletch nodded the japs were also bastards whod eaten theyd brought rice along for themselves before long clouds drifted over the marchingactually shamblingmen it started to rain in the blink of an eye everybody threw his head back and opened his mouth as wide as it would go men fell down because they couldnt see where they were going nobody gave a damn fletch got a couple of swallows before the sun came out again by the afternoon of the second day they reached the outskirts of honolulu fewer men had tried to run off than had the day before they were farther from the front and they had the horrible examples of the day before still fresh in their memories honolulu looked fortified to a faretheewell the americans hadnt fought in the city theyd surrendered before drawing a couple of hundred thousand defenseless civilians into the battle by all the signs the japs cared no more about civilians than they did about pows fletch didnt know what would make them surrender he couldnt think of anything that seemed likely to the pows did get fed after a fashion they were marched past a pot of rice each man got a spoonful shoved straight into his mouth by a cook who looked as if he hated them all everybody got the same spoon fletch didnt care by then he would have eaten rice off a cowflop he would have thought about eating the cowflop too hardly any locals were on the street the ones who were seemed to cling to the sides of buildings and to do their best not to make themselves conspicuous in any way they watched the prisoners with frightened eyes through honolulu through waikiki fletch had a pretty good notion of where they were going by then when he turned out to be right he started to laugh the pow next to him must have thought he was nuts and might not have been so far wrong whats so goddamn funny the man demanded this is where i came in fletch answered back to kapiolani park and the pow camp there back through the barbedwire gates that had let him out when the japs decided theyd sooner get work from their prisoners than leave them sit around idle and starving as long as they were going to starve us they could use us while we wasted away oh yeah thats what you call efficiency fletch wondered why the japanese were bringing prisoners back here now to keep them from running off to the americans that was bound to be one reason to keep the americans from shooting them up by mistake in spite of his misery he laughed again the next sign the japs showed of worrying about what happened to pows would be the first to gather a lot of prisoners together in one place so they could be massacred more easily he looked at the machine guns in the towers out beyond the barbed wire that seemed alarmingly likely and what could he do about it not one single solitary thing not that he could see the gate shut behind his gang of pows he looked around the camp wasnt so insanely crowded as it had been the last time he was here that would have encouraged him if he hadnt feared most of the missing men were dead his old tent had been right about here it was gone somebody else had the spot now and had run up a leanto that looked as if it would stop leaning and start collapsing any minute now the barracks still stood but he didnt want anything to do with them any place where pows congregated in large numbers was liable to be a place where the japs could get rid of them in large numbers he didnt mind sleeping on the ground why should he hed done enough of it lately there was bound to be canvas to scrounge and sticks as well before long he could rig some kind of shelter to keep off the rain till then he wouldnt worry about it not in this weather getting wet mattered much less than it would have on the mainland he did head for the one water fountain in the park the march down had left him dry as a bone because the pow camp wasnt so crowded the line at the fountain was shorter than it had been in days gone by even so while he waited another gang of pows came in he finally got to the water and drank and drank and drank been through the sahara buddy asked the guy behind him feels like it fletch splashed some water on his face too it felt wonderful at last reluctantly he gave up his place still more prisoners came into the camp fletch remembered what some crazy roman emperor had said a couple of thousand years earlier it went something like i wish all humanity had a single neck so i could cut off the head at one blow he wished that hadnt come back to him from whatever history class hed heard it in it described what the japs looked to be doing here much too well the trouble with mortars was you could hardly hear the bombs coming in before they burst les dillon caught a faint hiss in the air and threw himself flat just in time the fragments from the mortar round snarled past above him he allowed himself the luxury of a sigh of relief the japs had a particularly nasty little weapon the americans called a knee mortar it wasnt fired off anyones knee but one man could serve it and every other jap infantryman seemed to carry one one of those bombs had almost punched his ticket schofield barracks lay not far ahead bombers had largely leveled the barracks halls the japanese didnt seem to care they were as ready to defend rubble to the death as they would have been to save hirohitos crown jewels a machine gun fired several quick bursts from the direction of the barracksa reminder to les to keep his head down as if he needed one the japs were even tougher than hed figured they would be logically they didnt have a prayer they had no air cover left they had next to no armor and what they did have wasnt good enough if he were their co he would have dickered a surrender on the best terms he could get they didnt think that way they didnt surrender period the only japs whod been captured were men either knocked cold or too badly hurt to get away or to kill themselves they also took no prisoners god help you if you tried to surrender to them sometimes their wild counterattacks would overrun us forward positions les had helped recapture one or two of those the american corpses hed seen made him hate the enemy instead of just being professionally interested in getting rid of him the way he had been with the germans in after that he wouldnt have let any japs give up even if theyd tried one of the green young marines in his platoon an openfaced oklahoma kid named randy casteel hunkered down near him and asked sarge how come the japs do shit like that dont they know it just makes us want to fight em even harder his drawl only made him sound more horrified and more bewildered than he would have without it les dillon was bewildered too and hed seen a lot more nasty things over a lot more years than private casteel had damned if i can tell you he answered maybe they think theyre scaring us when they do that kind of stuff to a body they got another think comin casteel said hotly yeah i know les also knew the japs hadnt done everything to bodies some of those poor menmost of them probablywere alive when the enemy got to work on them he could only hope theyd died pretty soon we just have to keep pushin and keep poundin they wont do anything like that once theyre all dead sooner the better casteel said oh hell yes les felt fatherlyalmost grandfatherlyas he went on but you got to remember not to do anything dumb though killing japs is the name of the game dont let them kill you you do something stupid theyll make you pay for it before you can even blink take bayonets randy casteel nodded eagerly oh yeah sarge i know about that make sure you remember dammit the nips have more evil tricks than you can shake a stick at les said normal bayonet drill meant keeping the cutting edge toward the ground but the japanese bayonet had a hooked hand guard the japs used it to grab on to a us bayonet a twist and the marines rifle went flying keep the left side of the blade toward the deck and youll be fine yeah sarge casteel repeated several men had died before somebody was sharp enough to figure out a counter to look at your average japanese soldier you wouldnt think he was big enough or strong enough to win a bayonet fightbut he was oh brother was he other thing to remember is dont use the bayonet till its your last choice les added blow the little fuckers head off instead lets see him get sneaky trying to dodge a bullet in training everybody fussed about the bayonet in the field it made a tolerable can opener or barbedwire cutter it wasnt a great combat knife like almost all marines les preferred the kabar on his belt over here cmon this way the call from ahead came in perfect english randy casteel glanced at les the platoon sergeant shook his head sit tight he said another goddamn decoy some of the enemy soldiers knew the language and some of the locals still worked with them and for them the locals had grown up speaking english so of course they had no telltale accent to give them away if you paid attention to shouts from people you didnt know youd charge right into an ambush les stuck his head upjust for an instant and not in a place from which hed looked before somebody in khaki was moving out there he snapped off a shot and ducked down again not even the scream that followed made him take another look the japs should have gone in for amateur theatricals look at the soldier you thought youd just killed and it was even money hed be waiting to plant one right between your eyes the sun dropped down toward the waianae range les muttered under his breath more goddamn infiltrators after dark sure as shit yeah sarge randy casteel nodded in the daytime american firepower and airplanes dominated at night it was the japs turn theyd sneak into the american lines by ones and twos theyd roll grenades into foxholes or jump in with a knife the rule now was two men in a hole one of them awake all the time it made war even more exhausting than it would have been otherwise but it saved lives at least one american had been shot by somebody on his own side for not coming out with the password fast enough to suit a triggerhappy marine les felt sorry that had happened but not very anybody dumb enough to move around at night when he didnt have to and dumb enough to draw a blank on the password was probably dumb enough to get himself killed some other way if he hadnt found that one you know the word for tonight les asked casteel lizard lips the kid answered les nodded most of the passwords had ls and rs in them those were the english sounds that gave the japs trouble darkness fell fast here twilight didnt linger the way it did in more northerly climes and when it was dark it was dark the electricity was out there was no background glow the way there would have been if lights shone not far away a few fires burned but with the rice paddies wet there werent many of those either you gonna sack out on me if i give you first watch les asked tell me straight if youre beat sleep now and ill get you up at midnight i can last and i dont want both of us screwed because you couldnt if you dont mind sarge i better sleep now im pretty beat casteel said okay go ahead les told him the kid curled up twisted a couple of times like a dog making a nest and was dead to the world inside of two minutes les knew unconsciousness would sap him just as fast and just as hard when his turn came bare ground damp ground rain hed sleep on a bed of nails like an indian fakir for now though he had to stay awake he stuck his head up to look out of the hole that was all he did anyone walking around at night was presumed to be a jap he peered south his rifle close by him most of the fires down around schofield barracks seemed to be out he muttered something foul he might have spotted japs sneaking forward against a background of flame now hed have to do it the hard way he wished for the moon it wasnt a childish wish for something he couldnt possibly get he just wished it were in the sky but it wasnt and it wouldnt come up till randy casteel went on watch he shrugged odds were the kid needed more help than he did so he told himself anyway a few strands of barbed wire looped in front of the american position les didnt think they would slow the japs down but the marines whod set out the wire had also hung kration cans partly filled with pebbles from it with luck a noise from those would give some warning off to his left a rifle crackedan arisaka a burst from an american machine gun answered it les wondered if a night firefight would break out that would be the last thing anybody needed but the firing died away as far as les could tell all it had done was scare everybody who was awake casteels breathing never even changed les longed for a cigarette that would have to wait till daylight the flash of a match and the glow of a coal just asked a sniper to draw a bead on you he longed for a cigarette but he wasnt dying for one the stars wheeled across the sky nothing happened but something always could waiting for it wondering when it would come and how bad it would be wore away your stomach lining out ahead something rattled les rifle was against his shoulder before he knew how it had got there the noise might not have come from a jap the other night somebodyd used up a stray cats nine lives all at once but you never could tell was that a moving shape there on this side of the wire it might have been too small and low for a man but it might not have too the japs could crawl on their bellies as well as snakes finger tight on the trigger les hissed out a challenge password no answer no movement silence he wondered if his nerves were getting the best of him he called the challenge again still nothing but the shape of the shadows ahead looked different from the way it had before he heard that rattle it might have been his imagination he didnt think so he thought it was a jap maybe two the rifle bucked against his shoulder japs had fine disciplinebetter discipline probably than the marines but holding still and not making a sound despite a wound from a highpoweredcaliber round proved beyond this one he groaned les fired again the jap screamed the cry slowly subsiding into an agonized gurgle but sure as hell more than one enemy soldier lurked out there in the darkness with a bloodcurdling shriek the jap les hadnt hit dashed at him he fired once moreand missed night shooting was as much a matter of luck as anything else still shrieking the jap jumped down into the foxhole with him if les hadnt got his m up in a hurry the jap would have gutted him like a tuna the knife in the enemy soldiers hand rebounded from the stock les had told randy casteel about the virtues of firing as opposed to the bayonet he had no time to aim and shoot he didnt even have time or room for a bayonet thrust he used a buttstroke instead and felt the big end of his piece slam the side of the japs head he thoughthe hopedthe blow would fracture the enemys skull but either the jap had a devil of a hard head or les hadnt hit so hard as he thought he had the jap kept fighting if a little dazedly he slashed out with his knife les felt his tunic tear and the hot pain of a blade cutting his arm he hissed a curse then the jap grunted more in surprise than anything else and went limp the hotiron smell of blood filled the foxhole as well as an earthier stinkthe soldiers bowels had let go he was dead as shoe leather before he finished crumpling hell of a way to wake somebody up randy casteel said peevishly thanks kid les panted got a wound dressing handy can you stick it on my arm he nicked me a little he worked his hand the fingers all opened and closed and gripped the way they were supposed to he nodded to himself doesnt seem too bad lemme see casteel bent to get a close look in the darkness yeah i can patch you up you just got a star to go with your purple heart he fumbled in his belt pouch for the dressing all things considered id rather have a blowjob les said which jerked a startled laugh from the other marine what the fucks going on somebody called from not far away if he didnt like the answer a grenade would follow the question that you dutch les said two japs looks like i scragged one other one tried to keep us company he cut me a little but casteel gave him a kabar where it did the most good somebody else out there in the darkness asked a lowvoiced question dutch wenzels reply was loud enough to let les hear it oh hell yes sir thats him aint a jap in the world talks english like that i dusted some sulfa powder on the wound too sarge randy casteel said good thats good you did everything just right dillon answered what time is it anyway uh half past ten think you can sleep another hour and a half ill go back on watch i wont be able to get any shuteye for a while anywaynot till the arm quiets down a little he said nothing about the pounding of his heart which also needed to ease nothing like damn near getting killed to keep you up at night casteel said ill give it a try he needed almost ten minutes to start snoring this time les envied him his youth and resilience im supposed to be the smart one he thought so how come im the one who got cut the japanese officer on top of jane armitage squeezed her breasts one last time grunted and came she lay there unmoving as she had while he pumped away inside her he didnt care damn him he patted her head as if she were a dog that had done a clever trick then he dressed and walked out of the room dully she waited for the next violation she knew she ought to douche but what was the point with so many japs every day douching seemed a pitiful stick in the wind against pregnancy and disease how long did the average comfort woman last how long before the sheer physical endurance you needed to take on man after man after mannone of whom gave a damn about you except as one convenient hole or anothercombined with mindnumbing selfloathing to make you decide you couldnt stand to go on for one more cock let alone one more day jane was stubborn the end hadnt come for her because she still wanted to see the japs dead more than she wanted to die herself but new girls had replaced several from the original contingent by now and the ones whod left hadnt gone on rest cures theyd died died by their own hands jane flinched when the door opened but it wasnt another horny jap wanting a few minutes of fun before he went back to killing american soldiers it was one of the chinese women who ran the soldiers brothel for the occupiers she fluttered her fingers a gesture that meant jane had taken on her last man for the day wearily she nodded the chinese woman closed the door and went on to the next room occupiers the word echoed in janes head in shakespeares day she remembered from a lit course at ohio state to occupy a woman meant to screw her jane had never thought to see the connection so vividly illustrated in the twentieth century not far away japanese field guns boomed shooting at the americans pushing down from the north she wished the guns would blow up in the japs faces she hadnt really understood the futility of wishing till she got here before long american shells screamed in counterbattery fire they called it that was what she got for being an artillerymans wife exwife almost exwife she shook her head in sour disbelief shed thought fletch wasnt the lover she deserved maybe he wasnt but a million years of fletch would have been paradise next to what shed gone through the past few weeks a white woman poked her head into the room beulah stayedwas stuck inthe room next door come on she said we might as well get something to eat okay jane made herself climb to her feet more shells burst within a few hundred yards of the apartment buildingturnedbrothel i wish a couple of those would land on this place and blow it straight to hell even though she knew wishing was useless she couldnt stop what else did she have left beulah only shrugged she was broadshouldered and stolid and jane suspected not very bright if anything that helped her here not thinking was an asset gotta keep going she said what else can we do hang ourselves but jane didnt say it shed been taught as a girl that saying something made you more likely to do it she wasnt sure she believed that any more not after a couple of psychology classes but any english major would have said words had power if they didnt why pay attention to them in the first place the comfort women gathered together in what had been a storeroom and now with the addition of chairs and tables no doubt stolen from peoples homes did duty for a dining room some of the women didnt want to have much to do with anybody jane was one of those others talked about what theyd done and what their japs had done they might have been factory workers comparing the behavior of machines if they were going to talk they didnt have much else to talk about supper was rice and vegetablesmore than jane would have got if they hadnt kidnapped her the japs might not have wanted to fuck her if she looked like a starving woman she didnt care she wouldnt have done this for all the gold in fort knox she wouldnt even have done it for a tbone smothered in mushrooms and onions somebody said whatll the japs do if it looks like theyre gonna get kicked out of wahiawa there was something new to talk about after all please god somebody else said and soon a woman sitting near jane crossed herself that anyone could still believe in god impressed herand horrified her too what did it take to get you to see nobody was on the other end of that telephone maybe theyll let us go beulah said not the japs jane said they never do anything for anybody they do things to people instead so whatll they do to us beulah asked what can they do that they havent already done jane winced that question made altogether too much sense after weeks of having to lie down for endless men she hated what was left in the way of degradation but someone had an answer theyre liable to kill us all that way we wont be able to tell anybody what they made us do no one spoke for a little while the unwilling comfort women weighed the odds would the japanese murder them in cold blood it didnt strike jane as the least bit unlikely dead women told no tales she said weve got to get out of here how three women asked at the same time the windows were barred the doors were guarded the chinese women who ran the brothel for the japstheir boss was a snake named annabelle chungkept their eyes open for trouble all the time even talking about escaping was dangerous some of the miserable women in this room informed no one knew who but the fact seemed inarguable what could they get that would make squealing on their fellow sufferers worthwhile not more food the usual currency of betrayal in the rest of wahiawa fewer horny japs after a while what difference did that make but jane couldnt see any other reason to snitch except general meanness of course that wasnt impossible either no matter how many women asked the question nobody answered it an answer did occur to jane give the guards some of what she had to give the other japanese soldiers before she landed here sucking a strangers cock to get something she wanted would no more have occurred to her than killing herself she probably would sooner have killed herself she remembered that as if from very far away now shed had to get down on her knees so often for nothing at all why not do it once more if she really needed to and it wasnt as if suicide were a stranger to her thoughts nowadays she looked around at the other comfort women were they thinking along with her how could they not be a few weeks of this had coarsened the women it didnt kill some of them hadnt even bothered to put on clothes before they came to supper there had been evenings when jane didnt bother either though shed thrown on a muumuu now would they all be thinking well why not whats one more after so many and if by some accident they got out of this what would their lives be like jane tried to imagine wanting a man to touch her the picture refused to form and she tried to imagine a decent man wanting to touch her if he knew what the japs had made her do that picture wouldnt take shape either she shook her head what was left for her nothing she could see sometimes a woman broke down and sobbed here sometimes crying jags ran through them all contagious as chicken pox not tonight though maybe they were all trying to figure the odds artillery and smallarms fire through the night didnt keep jane from sleeping like a stone one more thing nobodyd told her screwing all day was hard physical labor and it wore out the spirit much worse than the body no rooster announced the dawn as far as jane knew all the roosters in wahiawa except one saved for stud were long since chicken stew since coming here shed wondered once or twice if he got sick of fucking strangers all day every day she figured the odds were against it after all he was a goddamn male usually the breakfast gong took the roosters place the women woke for that if they didnt get breakfast they couldnt eat till suppertime today though just as the eastern sky was beginning to go pink four mm shells slammed into the brothel that got jane out of bedliterally she woke up on the floor with one of the walls tilted sideways and with chunks of plaster falling on her head from the ceiling somebody was screaming fire at the top of her lungs somebody else was just screaming the agonized unthinking cries of the badly wounded jane scrambled to her feet she cut one of them on broken glass but she hardly cared she let the muumuu fall over her head then rushed out the door it had been locked from the outside but the blasts blew it open beulahs door had come open all by itself too jane looked into the room lets get out of here she shouted well never have a better chance i guess not beulah saidshe must have been in another line when they were handing out brains all she had on was a pair of panties she didnt stop for anything else come to think of it that wasnt so dumb where do you think youre going annabelle chung stood in the corridor hands on her hips jane wasted no time on conversation she hauled off and belted her oppressor in the chops the chinese woman shrieked and staggered but tried to fight back jane gave her a pretty fair onetwo maybe shed been listening after all when fletch went on and on about joe louis and hank armstrong the chinese woman went down on hands and knees when she started to get up beulah kicked her in the ribs that wasnt in the marquis of queensberry rules but it sure as hell worked annabelle chung stayed down way to go jane shouted the side of the building had a hole in it you could drive a bus through comfort women streamed out some wore muumuus like jane one or two were buck naked several of them were limping or bleeding none of that mattered getting out did out in the open two japs had stood nearby only the bottom part of one of them was left the other had had his head almost blown off jane looked longingly at the arisakas by the dead men she knew how to use a boltaction rifle but lots of japs still occupied wahiawa even with a rifle she couldnt kill them all oh but i want to she thought they could kill her though and they would if they saw her with an arisaka in her hands she hated to leave the rifles there but she did lets get away she said her partners in misery didnt need the advice they were already scattering as fast as they could some of them would have friends and families to go back to would they still be friends would the families stay loving when they found out what the women here had had to do maybe some of them might anyhow the rest well they couldnt be worse than the japs jane had nothing and nobody here fletch was a pow if he hadnt died since she last saw him for all practical purposes he was an exhusband anyway would i take him back now jane laughed as she ran that wasnt the question was it would he take me back now she had no idea everything shed done shed been forced to do everybody had to know that would anyone care or would she stay soiled in the eyes of the world for the rest of her life shed worry about that later all she wanted to do now was get away from the brothel get away from the japs and let the world scorn her if it would more artillery shells screamed in jane threw herself flat before they burst fletch had talked about that too and shed seen it worked when the japs came down from the north now her own country was doing its best to kill her she forgave it as she lay there in the gutter with fragments of sharp steel screeching by above her head she cried tears of pure unadulterated joy lieutenant saburo shindo helped mechanics gut wrecked zeros and hayabusas salvaging machine guns and mm cannon for use against the americans on the ground hed already gutted his own fighter to his mortification the yankees had caught it on the ground and shot it up bad enough to keep it there for good hed wanted to die in the air with luck taking a few more enemy planes with him the kami in charge of such things paid no attention to what he wanted he couldnt remember the last time hed seen a japanese fighter in the air the americans ruled the skies now their fearsome planes roared over oahu like flying tigers shooting up anything that moved when the japanese landed here zeros dominated the air now shindo was finding out how taking what hed dished out felt he would rather have stayed on the other end of it pass me those tinsnips he said the mechanic working with him did he sliced away at the aluminum skin of a zeros wing the fuselage had burned the other wing had gone up with it this one by a freak of war was pretty much intact put that cannon in some kind of improvised ground mount and it would make a few americans sorry theyd ever been born the thought had hardly crossed his mind before he heard a sound hed come to hate the roar of enemy engines in the air american radials had a deeper note than their japanese counterparts anyone whod heard both would never confuse the two shindo threw down the snips and ran for the nearest trench the japanese had dug lots of them when they thought they would still be able to fly out of wheeler field that proved optimistic but the trenches still gave people a place to hide when yankee planes came over a few soldiers fired at the fighters and dive bombers with rifles so americans had fired at zeros when the war was new furiously but without much hope the americans had knocked down a couple of japanese planesput enough lead in the air and you would much good it had done them no doubt the japanese here would knock down a few american planes too and much good that would do them in fact the muzzle flashes told the yankees where the trenches were shindo huddled in the dampsmelling dirt as heavy machinegun slugs chewed up the ground all around him some of them struck home few men who were hit cried out as they would have if a riflecaliber round struck them if a highvelocity bullet the size of a mans thumb hit you you were usually too dead to scream bursting bombs made the earth shake under him the noise was tremendous something beyond the normal meaning of the word shindo felt it through his skin as much as he heard it dirt rained down on him fragments of bomb casing howled past not nearly far enough over his head and then like a cloudburst it was overtill the next time shindo looked at his wristwatch he shook his head in slow wonder all that horror compressed into less than ten minutes it was as abbreviated as airtoair combat and seemed even slower in the air he could have fought back here he just had to take it the americans hadnt gone back to the north theyd flown south instead to harry pearl harbor and ewa that meant they might hit wheeler field again on the way home to their carriers shindo shrugged stoically as he climbed out of the trench if they did they did that was all he couldnt do anything about it he could help the army meet the us invaders or he thought he could when he got a look at the fighter hed been cannibalizing he wasnt so sure any more one bomb had landed right on it another close by one blast or the other had driven his tinsnips deep into the trunk of a palm tree so deep he knew hed need other tools to get them out and the barrel of the cannon hed been freeing had a distinct bend in it now nobody would use that weapon against the yankees shindos shoulders slumped how were you supposed to fight the enemy when he blocked things even before you did them again the americans must have been asking themselves something like that at the end of now that it was japans turn shindo found no better answers than they had then jim peterson stood at attention with his fellow sufferers in the kalihi valley most of them were as skeletal as he was beriberi and dropsy swelled others past what was natural a man like charlie kaapu who was only gaunt stood out as an extraordinary physical specimen pows had tried to get away from this hellhole before the americans came back to oahu now with the hope of rescue in the air escape attempts came more often but sick starving men couldnt go very far very fast they usually got caught and when they did they paid this poor fellow looked like a rack of bones the butchers cat would have turned up its nose at him even before the japs beat the crap out of him now he was all over bruises and blood too theyd broken his nose a couple of guards held him upright he didnt seem able to stand on his own whatll they do to him charlie kaapu whispered to peterson hed quickly mastered the art of speaking without moving his lips dont know peterson whispered back thats why were here thoughso they can make a show it wasnt much of a show the guards let the pow fall to his knees a lieutenant swung his sword peterson had heard that samurai swords would cut through anything on the first try one more lieor maybe the jap hadnt taken good care of the blade any which way he needed three hacks before the pows head fell from his neck the body convulsed but not for long the head just lay there if anything it seemed relieved the ordeal was over fuck charlie kaapu whispered under his swarthy skin he turned green he was a civilian he hadnt seen so much peterson only shrugged the japs had done plenty worse the lieutenant let out a torrent of japanese a noncom who spoke fragments of english pointed to the emaciated corpse and the pool of blood soaking into the ground under it you run you he pointed again that got the meaning across but peterson suspected some of the lieutenants eloquence was lost in translation yeah like i give a shit he thought off in the distance bombs burst andcaliber machine guns chattered the unmistakable sounds of american planes giving the japs hell the guards resolutely pretended nothing out of the ordinary was going on the pows had to pretend the same thing men who grinned or laughed caught hell several of them had died from itnot as spectacularly as the beheaded man but every bit as dead the guards were jumpy and getting jumpier all the time no matter what they pretended the sergeant with a little english pointed toward the mouth of the tunnel through the koolau range you go he yelled and the pows went it was madness peterson knew it everybody knew it prisoners and guards alike the only reason the men were digging through the mountains bowels was so they could die from hard labor and bad food too many of them hadnt needed any further abuse from the japs the routine was deadly enough besides that even if there had been some point to all the mankilling labor there wasnt any more the japanese would never get a nickels worth of good out of the tunnel by every sign peterson could use to judge they wouldnt hold oahu the stars and stripes would fly here again everything the pows in the kalihi valley did was an exercise in futility they got driven to it even so if anything they got driven harder than ever now the guards might have feared they would rise up if they werent worked to death and otherwise intimidated they might have been right too outside the tunnel mouth peterson grabbed a pick charlie kaapu took a shovel his face said he would sooner have bashed japs with it than lifted chunks of rock easy peterson murmured a machinegun nest covered the tools anybody who got out of line would die fast so would a lot of pows who hadnt done one damn thing the hapahawaiian growled down deep in his throat but he carried the shovel into the tunnel instead of braining the nearest guard light vanished it would have been dark in there even if peterson had been well nourished night blindness had advanced with his beriberi he couldnt see much at all lamps set into the wall here and there gave just enough light to let him keep moving forward the sound of other pows banging away at the living rock told him he was getting close so did a japs yell hurry up faster peterson wanted to ask why the jap would have answered with a beating or a bayonet or a bullet those answers were persuasive enough too how could you argue with them you couldnt not unless you had a club or a rifle yourself peterson wished for a rifle he wished for a machine gun and the strength to fire it from the hip you could do that in the movies in the real world he knew better a jap hit him with a bamboo swagger stick for no reason he could see a pick was a weapon too he could have broken the bastards head he could have but he didnt he didnt fear death himself though he would surely die if he raised his hand to a guard but the japs would slaughter untold other pows to avenge and punish he didnt want to die with that on his conscience instead of smashing the guards skull the pick bit into the rock pulling it free took all his strength so did lifting it for the next stroke how many had he made too many far too many that was all he knew he grubbed rock out of the wall charlie kaapu shoveled it up and dumped it into baskets some other poor sorry son of a bitch carried away the spoil other pows grubbed and shoveled and carried too the guards screamed at everybody to move faster dully peterson wondered what difference it could make they werent that close to punching through or he didnt think they were even if they had been what advantage could the japs gain from moving men to the east coast no fighting there could they get back over the mountains and hit the americans in the flank theyd done it in the west in their invasion but theyd been up against a much weaker foe and one who didnt control the air peterson didnt believe they could make it matter this time around every so often one of the laborers keeled over the guards werent about to put up with thatit was too much like resting on the job they fell on the sufferers like wolves trying to get them back on their feet with blows and kicks some of the pows could be bullied upright again some were too far gone and lay on the tunnel floor no matter what the japs did and some didnt keel over because they were tired some keeled over because they were dead the men who carried away rock also carried away corpses that gummed up the works because the rock accumulated the japs just screamed at them to move faster too and beat them when they didntsop for imperial japan hours blurred together into one long agony at last after the usual eternity the guards let the pows stumble out of the tunnel they queued up for the little bit of rice the japs grudgingly doled out there was even less than usual today men grumbledfood they took seriously the japs only shrugged one who spoke a little english said more not come blame americans had us fighters some of the ones peterson had seen werent wildcats but new plainly hot machines shot up the rice on the way to the kalihi valley or had the japs with more important things to worry about than a bunch of damnedliterallypows just not bothered sending any either way it made starving to death seem almost worthwhile almost when jiro takahashi walked up nuuanu avenue to the japanese consulate he was shocked not to see the rising sun flying in front of the compound then he noticed how many bullet holes pocked the buildings the staff must have decided not to fly the flag to keep from giving a target to the american planes now constantly overhead for most of the occupation the guards in front of the consulate had been a ceremonial force no more they crouched in sandbagged machinegun nests the snouts of their weapons pointing up toward the sky there were fewer of them than there had been some jiro supposed would have gone up to the front others with the buildings as battered as they were some of those bullets would have found flesh too its the fisherman one of the guards called the men who were left still knew jiro that made him feel good the one whod spoken went on you bring us some nice ahi fisherman or even some mackerel jiro laughed nervously he was emptyhanded as they could see not today gomen nasai he answered he was sorry too in better times he would have had fish for the consul and the chancellor and often the guards as well is kitasan in he asked i think so the talky guard answered go on in any which way theyll be glad to see you theyre glad to see anybody right now his laugh had a somber edge with such gallows humor ringing in his ears jiro did even some of the secretaries had put down their pens and picked up arisakas one of the remainder a grayhaired fellow who would have been useless on a battlefield said oh yes takahashisan the consuls here im sure hell be happy to talk to you please wait a moment he hurried back to nagao kitas office returning a moment later he beckoned jiro on welcome takahashisan welcome kita said after they exchanged bows good to see you havent abandoned us his words showed spirit but his round features were thinner and less jaunty than jiro had ever seen them jiro bowed again i wouldnt do that your excellency he said though the thought had crossed his mind the radio broadcasts full of lies hed had to read still rankled plenty of people would kita said they want to forget they ever heard of japan or the great east asia coprosperity sphere opportunists he laced the word with scorn they probably have american flags in their closets waiting to come out when the time is right im still here jiro said reflecting that both his sons thought him an idiot for clinging to the land where he was born his still being here prompted another thought please excuse me kitasan but where is chancellor morimura somewhere up at the fighting front kita answered jiro blinked the skinny official with the doelike eyes hardly seemed a military man but the consul went on i have learned he is a graduate of eta jima invalided out of the navy because of stomach trouble he went into ah other work after that now though with every man needed to hold back the americans he has returned to the warriors life tadashi morimurawas that even his real name a graduate of the japanese naval academy jiro had trouble imagining it let alone believing it but it was plainly true and what other work had morimura been doing by the way consul kita said it the man had been a spy imamazed kitasan jiro said so was i kita answered you think you know someone and then you find you didnt know him at all he shrugged shigata ga nai hai jiro nodded hed thought morimura a friend not an operative things looked clearer than they had no wonder chancellor morimura had introduced him to osami murata hed wanted the radio man from tokyo to use jiro as a propaganda tool and hed got what he wanted if i saw morimura now id punch him in the nose jiro thought he laughed at himself even here the younger man would probably mop the floor with him he shrugged well so what sometimes you have to do things like that just to show youre no mans puppet he felt as if he wore strings on his wrists and ankles nagao kita might have been reading his mind i am sorry to have to tell you this takahashisan he said i fear it will make you less likely to stay loyal to the end he was right to fear that too but jiro said only ive come this far i cant very well jump out of the boat now its too late it wouldnt do me any good because he had the consul at a momentary disadvantage he felt he could ask how does the fighting look they push us back kita answered bleakly we fight with great courage shouting the emperors name and wishing him ten thousand years for all we do though they rule the skies and they have more tanks and artillery this is not good jiro said honto this is not good the consul agreed i dont know what we can do about it though except die gloriously not retreating even a centimeter dying rather than yielding the ground we have conquered that did sound glorious it also sounded like a recipe for defeat modern japan had never been defeated in a foreign war shed beaten china and russia shed sided with the allies in world war i and beaten germany in china and on the seas the idea that she could lose was unimaginableexcept that jiro had to imagine it he asked what will you do kitasan if ifthe worst happens i am a diplomat the rules for me are different from the ones for soldiers kita replied i can be exchanged jiro had an inspiration i am a japanese national can i be exchanged too if hawaii returned to american hands he wouldnt want to stay here most people would hate him for siding with japan they might do worse than hate him they might decide he was a traitor and hang him or shoot him consul kita looked surprised well i dont know takahashisan i would have to do something like put you on my staff i suppose could you jiro asked eagerly going back to japan would mean leaving his sons behind he knew that but hiroshi and kenzo had their own lives and they were americans as much as he remained japanese they might be glad to see him go theyd probably be relieved if he did depend on it kita scribbled a note to himself we will go on hoping that black day does not come but if it should we will see what we can arrange domo arigato kitasan jiro bowed in his chair there was one thing he wouldnt have to worry about of course he still might get killed but that didnt bother him the same way it wasnt certain and he couldnt do anything about it one way or the other if japan lost though american vengeance was as sure as tomorrows sunrise now hed done what he could to escape it when minoru genda pedaled over to iolani palace something had changed he needed a moment to realize what it was the big toughlooking hawaiian soldiers whod guarded the bottom of the stairway up to the front entrance were gone he asked one of the japanese guards at the top of the stairs what had happened to them sir king stanley sent them up to the front the noncoms tone made it plain he had nothing to do with anything his superiors did he sent the whole hawaiian army to the front the whole hawaiian army had about a battalions worth of men did he genda said our officers approved it sir would those hawaiians be there if they hadnt the noncom asked reasonably i suppose not genda still had doubts but he wasnt about to discuss them with an underofficer the occupying authorities had let king stanley laanui form an army of sorts because theyd nominally restored hawaiis independence and independent countries always had armiesof sorts at the time nobodydoubtless including king stanleyhad imagined the hawaiian army might actually have to fight for that matter nobody knew which side it would choose to fight on did the soldiers think of themselves as hawaiians loyal to the ancient kingdom or as americans on masquerade were there some who felt each way if there were the tiny army might have its own tiny civil war if it did that while it was holding some of the line well what followed wouldnt be pretty and yet the japanese officers who presumably knew it best had let it go forward genda hoped they knew what they were doing too late to change it now either way his ankle didnt bother him too much when he went up the stairs to the library hed interviewed stanley laanui there along with other possible candidates for the revived hawaiian throne now the room again belonged to a distant relative of david kalakaua the king of hawaii whod had it built seen from the front the enormous victorian desk behind which king stanley sat seemed wide as akagis flight deck poor akagi for a moment pain for gendas lost ship stabbed at him daggersharp he bowed to the king not least to make sure his face didnt show what he was thinking your majesty he murmured hello commander nice of you to come to see me for a change stanley laanui slurred the words so genda had trouble understanding them was he drunk this early in the morning whether he was or not he alarmed the japanese officer did he know about gendas visits to queen cynthia if he did what did he aim to do about them if he kept a pistol as well as a bottle in one of those drawers but the not very kingly king of hawaii went on this captain iwabuchi is a lot nastier than general yamashita ever was genda believed that the commandant of the special naval landing forces struck him as hard and determined even by japanese standards i am so sorry your majesty genda said you know he has many worries like i dont the king exclaimed they wont hang iwabuchi if our side loses he was bound to have that right genda couldnt imagine the japanese naval officer letting himself be captured iwabuchi would surely die in battle or commit seppuku before permitting such a disgrace do not be hard on him genda said remember he helps defend your country oh yeah king stanley said hell defend it till everybody in honolulus dead genda had no doubt captain iwabuchi intended to defend honolulu just that way this is war your majesty he saiduse was making his english more and more fluent this is not a game we cannot stop and ask to begin again it goes to the end whatever the end may be if id figured the americans were coming back i dont know that i would have let you stick a crown on my noggin stanley laanui said believe me your majesty i do not want the americans here any more than you do genda said japan does all it can to beat them hawaiis doing everything it can too the king said thats why i sent my army up to join the fighting hai genda said and not another word any other word might have been too much but after a moment he did find a few that seemed safe i hope the army will fight strongly for us why shouldnt it the king asked genda said nothing the question had too many answersbecause the soldiers might not be loyal to the king of hawaii because they didnt have all the weapons they needed to fight firstrate foes like the us marines and army because they had no combat experience because some of them were either cutthroats or men looking for enough to eat and not really warriors at all theyd all been trained since they joined up but how much did that mean only one way to find out by now theyd be up near the line whatever japanese officer they reported to would use them why not they would surely kill some americans if they died themselves even in swarms so what better them than precious irreplaceable japanese troops king stanley was doing his best to act like a proper ally genda admired him for that he also pitied him japan didnt want a proper ally here in hawaii any more than she wanted proper allies in any of the countries shed conquered she wanted puppets who would deliver natural resources and do as they were told hawaii had no natural resources to speak of sugar pineapple neither would have been worth a single japanese soldier or sailor hawaiis position was its natural resource under the rising sun it shielded everything farther west and made it hard for the usa to help australia and new zealand under the stars and stripes it was a spearhead aimed straight at the rest of the japanese empire it behooved japan to hold on to hawaii as long as she could then how long that would be we will all do the best we can your majesty genda said how good is that king stanley demanded you can hear the american guns off to the north sounds like they come closer every day too you dont see anything but american planes any more they shoot up anything that moves theyve damn near killed me two three times by now how can you stop them commander answer me that please answer me that we will do the best we can genda repeated we have more courage than the enemy does he believed that was true even if the marines were not to be despised the king looked at him what difference does courage make if they drop bombs on your head and you cant do anything about it well the question was too much to the point genda found he had no answer he feared none of his superiors did either les dillon had already discovered that some of the japs fighting the marines carried springfields not arisakas that made sense after the army threw in the sponge here it must have handed over a zillion rifles plus the ammo to shoot them for a zillion years but it made him have a harder time telling by ear who was shooting at whom that was doubly dangerous right now because the enemy in front of his platoon didnt seem to be japs at all they spoke english as well as half the marines and they wore what looked like us army khaki not the darker shade japan preferred he wasnt the only one whod noticed either who are you guys a marine yelled through the racket of gunfire the answer came back at once royal hawaiian army get the fuck off our land haole asshole a burst from a machine gun punctuated the words royal hawaiian army les blinked he knew the japs had given hawaii a puppet king he hadnt knownhe hadnt dreamtanybody besides the japs took the king of hawaii seriously not sticking his head up he called why arent you people on our side not the enemys that got him another burst hed been smart to keep lowtracers went right over his foxhole whoever was handling that gun knew what to do with it japan never took our land away from us japan never took our country away from us another hawaiian shouted the usa sure as hell did yeah but that was a long time ago the words died unspoken on les lips it might seem a long time ago to him to the noisy bastard on the other side of the line it wasnt even the day before yesterday for that matter you couldnt talk about the civil war with a lot of southernerscaptain bradford included it wasnt the civil war to them either it was the war between the states or if theyd been drinking for a while the war of damnyankee aggression whatever you called it it happened long before hawaii joinedor was joined tothe united states he tried another tack why fight now for chrissake you cant win and youll just get shot he knew damn well the japs wouldnt surrender hed seen them fight to the death in hopeless positions too many times to have any doubts on that score but maybe the hawaiians were different if he could do things on the cheap instead of putting his one and only irreplaceable ass on the line he would and gladly no words came back this time one more burst of machinegun fire did whatever the men in front of him had in mind surrender wasnt it he muttered to himself sooner or later hed find out what those bastards in oldfashioned khaki were worth it turned out to be sooner not long after dark fell a runner brought word that the marines would go forward the next morning half an hour after sunrise les almost opened fire before the man stammered out the countersign to his hissed challenge when he got the news instead he half way wished he had shot the fellow he lay in his foxhole trying to grab whatever uneasy sleep he could that wasnt much little firefights kept breaking out all along the line maybe the hawaiians knew something was up or maybe they just wanted to prove they had balls he would have been happy to take it on faith the us barrage started as soon as morning twilight painted the eastern sky gray volley after volley of s crashed down on the enemy positions in front of les and his buddies mortar bombs added to the weight of flying metal hed seen heavier bombardments in the last war but this was plenty to cut a man into screaming hamburger if he stood up in itand maybe if he didnt too the royal hawaiian army wouldnt have faced artillery fire before he wondered how the hawaiians liked it under cover of the booming guns half a dozen shermans clanked up toward the line les was glad to see the big ugly iron monsters they could clear out the strongpoints that survived the artilleryand some always did and they drew enemy fire too infantrymen always aimed smallarms fire at tanks les didnt know whyrifle and machinegun bullets couldnt penetrate armor plate but hed seen it again and again if the hawaiians were shooting at the shermans they wouldnt be shooting at him so much he approved of that oh yes he approved of that very much indeed his belly knotted as soon as the s fell silent he knew what was coming next and it came captain bradford yelled come on men up out of your holes follow me grunting les scrambled out of his foxhole and ran forward he bent over he zigged and zagged he knew none of that would do him a damn bit of good if the bullet with his name on it was out there flying a boche machine gunner had taught him that lesson once and for all time in and he still had the puckered scars to prove it bullets cracked past him the hawaiians werent dead and they werent paralyzed either too fucking bad he thought when you heard a crack a round came much too close he ducked automatically whenever he did hear one hed been ashamed of that till he saw everybody else did it too which sure hadnt taken long hed fought in trenches before in and here that was the worst war had to offer the germans had been tough the japs here were even worse because they didnt give up and they kept coming at you till they were dead or you were so he had standards of comparison the fifteen or twenty minutes till the marines killed the last man from the royal hawaiian army were the worst minutes of his lifeeven worse than the time cindy lou callahans father caught them in bed together and ran for his shotgun which went a long way towards explaining how and why les joined the marines the hawaiians wouldnt give up either they wouldnt retreat they didnt just stay in place and die they kept making countercharges at the marines screaming and swearing and throwing grenades like anybody whod done any fighting les vastly preferred bullets to his bayonet the bayonet got blood on it in those trenches so did his kabar so did the butt end of his rifle he killed one bastard with his bare hands in an animal tangle of flying arms and legs if he hadnt tucked his chin down tight to his chest the enemy soldier might have broken his neck instead of the other way round afterwardsbut only afterwards when the red madness of battle easedhe wondered why the hawaiians sold their lives so dear did they think the usa would hang them for traitors and they had nothing to lose did they really hate americans or were they simply as much caught up in the madness as the men who faced them he couldnt even ask a prisoner afterwards there were no prisoners like napoleons guards like the japanese whod given them guns the men from the royal hawaiian army died but did not surrender once the last of them had died les dillon squatted in a muddy trench and lit a cigarette hed just finished bandaging a marines leg he hoped the man wasnt hamstrung all he could do was hope he was no corpsman another marine whod also come through unhurt stared at him from about ten feet away he too had a cigarette dangling from the corner of his mouth fuck he said and then again fuck les nodded yeah he said and jesus that amounted to about the same thing if hed spoken first he would have said what the younger man had he looked around these tornup trenches werent worth a thing by themselves any more than one german trench had been worth anything in particular during the war to end all wars how many men had died defending them how many had died or been maimed taking them he knew the answer to the last question knew it out to the tenth decimal place too goddamn many he threw down the cigarette butt and lit a new one a runner came over from the right what are you guys sitting around with your thumbs up your asses for pick up your feetget moving back where i came from theyre going forward like billybedamned a burst of weary profanity answered him les said cut us some slack okay we almost got our heads handed to us here those fucking hawaiians wouldnt give up for shit goldbricks i knew you guys were goldbricks the runner said goldbricks my ass les said even after a fight like the one hed just been through sometimes your own side was a worse enemy than the bastards whod been trying to kill you what the hell you talkin about hawaiians the runner sneered you cant bullshit me about hawaiiansi damn well know better we had hawaiians in front of us too all decked out like the army was when the shit hit the fan they fired two three shots and then threw down their pieces and threw up their hands we musta took a companys worth o pows the man meant it les could see that he and the other marines whod just gone through hell stared dully at the irate runner fuck he mouthed as the youngster had a few minutes earlier he gathered his men by eye come on he said we gotta get back in the goddamn war thinking back on things senior private yasuo furusawa couldnt account for being alive most of the men from his regiment had died at or near oahus northern beaches theyd done everything they could to throw the americans into the sea theyd done everything they couldand it hadnt been enough furusawa stayed alive after the first days fightingone of the few who did naval bombardment didnt kill him neither did us air strikes nor did enemy artillery and smallarms fire by the second morning nobody survived to give him orders hed retreated several times since then for one thing he had no one left to tell him not to for another he wasnt a typical soldier most of the men in his regimenteven most of his noncomshad come into the army straight off a farm a lot of them had had to learn how to make up a bed that stood on a frame instead of just on the floor they sucked up the indoctrination about the duty to die for their country along with the rest of their training till it became as automatic as slapping a new clip into an arisaka it wasnt that furusawa was unwilling to die for japan like any soldier with a gram of sense he knew that was always possible often likely sometimes necessary but he was less inclined to die if it wasnt necessary than most of his comrades because he was a druggists son hed got more education than the average conscript and his father had taught him to think for himself in a way most japanese didnt you always have to worry is this the right medicine is this the right dosage will it be good for this patient never assume anything always check always questionalways furusawa didnt know how many times hed heard his father say that and the old man being a typical japanese father in a lot of ways would usually follow the advice with a clout in the ear to make sure it sank in the method was brutally simple the army used it too like a lot of brutally simple things it worked in his innocence the younger furusawa had gone on asking questions after he was conscripted the army far more brutal than his father ever dreamt of being soon cured him of thatat least of asking them out loud but the habit of thought persisted he would sometimes smile to himself when he ran into things that made no logical sense even smiling could be dangerous he was convinced he got more than his share of thumps and slaps because he didnt act like a patriotic machine of course he didnt know a single soldier who wasnt convinced he got more than his share of thumps and slaps so who could say for sure after the americans landed hed fought hard but hed watched other soldiers rush across open ground to try to come to close quarters with the enemy and hed watched rifles and machine guns and mortars and artillery shells tear them to bloody shreds before they accomplished a thing if a sergeant or a lieutenant had shouted at him in particularyou furusawa forwardhe supposed he would have charged too no superior had that left him to use his own judgment and he was still alive and fighting while flies buzzed around the bloated stinking corpses of most of his regiment how long he could escape becoming a bloated stinking corpse himself was anybodys guess he crouched in a shell hole not far in front of the ruins of schofield barracks the us armys former base had been smashed twice now first by the japanese when the yankees held it and now by the americans to keep japan from getting any use out of it several of the men nearby were stragglers and orphans like himself others belonged to a company whose captain wasnt shy about grabbing reinforcements wherever he could a corporal spoke in bitter frustration those stinking bastards who furusawa asked that could have meant either the enemy or the japanese high command the yankees the corporal answered when the wind blows from them to us you can smell their cigarettes when was the last time you had one naked longing filled his voice please excuse me but i dont smoke furusawa said ai the noncoms disgusted grunt might have meant why do they saddle me with idiots like this furusawas cheeks heated the corporal went on well even youll know they dont send many smokes from japan i havent had one for weeks american tobaccos good toobetter than what we use ourselves im tempted to sneak over there and cut somebodys throat just so i can steal his cigarettes he sounded as serious as a funeral are cigarettes worth risking your life for furusawa asked why not im going to get killed pretty damn quick anyway the corporal said cigarettes or hooch or pussymight as well have fun while i can that made more sense to furusawa than it might have to a lot of his countrymen you dont think we can win he said win losewho gives a shit theyll use us up either way and that made sense to furusawa too however much he wished it didnt all the phrases the japanese army used to convince its men to fight to the end no matter what came bubbling up in his mind he didnt bring any of them out but even thinking them at a time like this showed hed been more thoroughly indoctrinated than he thought what were such words worth on a real battlefield with the stench of death and its lesser cousin the stench of shit all around words were worth enough to send young japanese men into the face of enemy guns by the hundreds by the thousands a lot of those young japanese men were part of that battlefield stench now how could anything be worth more than a mans life the words said the country was the emperor was and the young men or most of them believed it he knew what questioning it here and now would get him a bullet in front of the ear or in the back of the neck unless some officer who heard him decided to make him into an example for other doubters in that case hed die a lot slower and hurt a lot more while he was doing it he opened a ration can hed taken from a dead american a lot of the food the enemy ate was nasty but he got lucky this timeit was chopped salty meat it wasnt anything he would have got back home but it was like something he might have got he wolfed it down as he did he remembered the cans of the stuff called spam hed found for his squad when the japanese were conquering he sighed nostalgically now thatthat had been really good not five minutes after hed finished the americans started shelling the japanese line furusawa huddled in his hole right next to the can hed dropped had the kami decided to discard him the same way getting discarded hadnt hurt the can if his time was here he hoped he would be as lucky huddled next to him the corporal who wanted a smoke said stinking hawaiians its their fault were in this mess he didnt mean japan japans problems werent the hawaiians fault but those of this particular knot of japanese soldiers were furusawa said the most he could for the men of the royal hawaiian army some of them fought well and some of them damn well didnt the noncom snarled as a nearby shell burst sent splinters screeching overhead some of them ran away zakennayo some of them surrendered the worthless turds furusawa had run away he would have been dead if he hadnt the corporal had probably run away too surrender that was scarier than the artillery barrage you didnt just disgrace yourself if you gave up you disgraced your family too who could say what the authorities would do to them if word that you were a prisoner got back to japan and it wouldnt be only the authorities who would go to a druggist whose son had thrown down his rifle who wouldnt turn away when a man like that a man who had raised such a worthless son walked by who wouldnt talk about him behind his back not that he wouldnt know what all his neighbors all his former friends were saying mortar bombs hissed down along with the shells furusawa really dreaded mortars you could hardly hear them coming and they dropped straight down into foxholes you couldnt hide from them the way you could from ordinary artillery if one of them decided to rip you up there you weresashimiand you couldnt do a thing about it then as suddenly as a hawaiian rain shower the bombardment stopped furusawa and the corporal looked at each other each one making sure the other was still breathing and hadnt been blown to red rags without even a chance to scream shouts in harsh english came from the north so did bursts of machinegun fire to make the japanese keep their heads down and so did clanking rattles that sent fresh ice walking down furusawas spine tanks hed seen the new us tanks beforealways from some little distance or he wouldnt be here worrying about them now they were bigger and tougherlooking than their japanese counterparts not that any japanese tanks were close by their cannon would wreck machinegun nests their machine guns would chew up infantrymen and what could a poor damned foot soldier do about them not bloody much furusawa popped out of his hole a couple of times to fire at the oncoming marines bullets cracked past him whenever he did he took his life in his hands even to try to shoot but he knew the yankees would run up and kill him if he didnt fight back the risk of death against its certainty you braced yourself you took the risk and you hoped for the best if no bullet found you you did it again a burst of machinegun fire from one of the us tanks almost tore his head off he crouched in the hole shuddering then the machine gun swung elsewhere to torment other luckless japanese soldiers as soon as it did the corporal with whom furusawa had been talking sprang up and ran toward the tank which was horribly close he scrambled onto the metal monster before the bow gunner could swing his weapon back to bear on him through the din of battle furusawa heard the noncom tap two grenades on his helmet or possibly on the side of the tank to start their fuses he opened a hatch and chucked them in then he jumped down and tried to get away one of the american tankers cut him down with half a dozen rounds from the submachine gun he carried as a personal weapon the grenades went off two muffled thumps inside the big steel box an instant later much bigger booms followedthe grenades must have touched off the tanks ammunition the big machine ground to a halt a thick column of greasy black smoke rose from it five men and a traveling fortress slain the corporals spirit would have a lot to be proud of as it took its place with so many others in yasukuni shrine furusawa admired the mans bravery and admitted to himself he couldnt match it seeing the tank go up in flames made the yankees hesitate it filled the japanese with new spirit at least for a little while another soldier used a bottle full of burning gasoline to disable a second tank though furusawa thought some of that crew got away he hoped the new loss would make the americans draw back it didnt they might have lacked the stubborn stoicism of japanese troops but they were brave tough men give up someone shouted in japanese you wont be harmed after surrender youll be fed and treated well only a long burst of machinegun fire answered that call the americans must have found a local japanese to do their talkingto do their lyingfor them theyd done that when the american army was advancing too you listened to those willsothewisp at your peril furusawa had seen men do what they said and then get shot down another call came from behind him back here weve got another line set up that was a tokyo man talking he didnt have the hiroshima accent of the men from furusawas regimentand of most japanese settlers in hawaii that made furusawa believe him it also gave the senior private an excuse to retreat with his honor more or less intact he seized the chance scrambling and scurrying and scuttling bullets whipped by him but none bit he flopped down into a hole deeper and much better made than the one in which hed sheltered this had to be a position american pows had prepared in advance he nodded to himself good now the army would get some use out of all that digging a us fighter plane roared low over the vast pow camp in kapiolani park fletcher armitage stood in line for the evening mealwhatever rice and weeds the japs cared to give their prisoners the planes pilot waggled his wings as he zoomed away when american fliers first started doing that some of the prisoners had waved back after the beatings the japanese guards handed out that stopped in a hurry one of the guard towers sent a stream of bullets after the fighter but it was long gone the machine guns in the towers bore on the camp when the towers went up the japs hadnt figured those guns would need to shoot down us planes too bad you bastards fletch thought a man in front of him said i wonder what the hell they call that aircraft sure as hell didnt have anything like it when we got took he was right about that it looked more businesslike than any plane fletch had known in and its business was death the line snaked forward when fletch got up to the cooks one of them plopped a ladleful of overcooked gluey rice and green stuff in his bowl the ladle was small for all he knew the greens were lawn trimmings he didnt care for one thing he didnt get enough to matter for another he would have eaten all he did get if the japs had cooked grubs in with the gruel he would have eaten those too he savored what little he got for a couple of hours he wouldnt feel like a man starving to deathwhich he was he would just be very hungry to a pow in hawaii very hungry seemed wonderful two emaciated prisoners carried an even more emaciated body to the disposal area near the perimeter several others lay there some scrawnier yet men who should have been in the prime of life died here every day and not a few of them fletch glanced warily toward the guard towers if the japs in them decided to open up men inside the perimeter would die by the hundreds by the thousands and they were thinking about it he could feel the tension in the air if anything those american fighters made it worse the japs were losing the fight for oahu the distant rumble of artillery fire and bombs going off wasnt so distant any more if the guards wanted to take a last revenge on the pows in their hands and under their machine guns they could if they did the americans would avenge themselves in turn that was obvious it might have restrained americans guarding japanese prisoners fletch could tell the japs didnt give a shit they intended to fight to the death any which way if they could get rid of men who might recover and fight them againor just men whod fought them in the pastthey would do it and then die with smiles on their faces ill give you something to smile about you slanteyed mothers fletchs hands balled into fists hed had that fantasy so many times and he couldnt do one goddamn thing to make it real not one the japs were on the right side of the wire and he was on the wrong side he didnt have a chinamans chance of getting out either hell a chinaman would have had a better chance than he did a chinaman might have been able to fool the guards into thinking he was another jap tall thin freckled and auburnhaired fletch made a most unconvincing japanese he did what most of the pows did most of the time he lay down and tried to rest the laughable rations gave them next to no energy the less they used the better off they were he shook his head when that occurred to him the less energy he used the longer hed last whether that made him better off was a long way from obvious but sleep had dangers of its own when he slept he dreamt of food he burned too low for sex to mean anything to him but foodfood was a different story those dreams never went away if anything they got worse as he got weaker steaks smothered in onions danced in his dreams so did mashed potatoes and string beans bacon and eggs pancakesmountains of pancakes smothered in melted butter and maple syrup cherry pie a la mode not sliceswhole pies with quarts of vanilla ice cream plopped on top coffee with cream and sugar beer brandy whiskey and when he woke up the dreams would seem so vivid so real hed be just about to dig in just about to make up for more than a year and a half of tormenting hungerand then hed have his food snatched away by cruel consciousness when a man cried in kapiolani park he most likely cried after a dream of food still if you didnt dream of roast beef sleeping was better than staying awake general anesthesia would have been better still the only kind the japs offered though was too permanent to suit him when he didnt dream of food he often did dream of combat sometimes he and the us army triumphed over the japs waking up after those hurt almost as bad as waking up after a dream of thanksgiving turkey with all the trimmings sometimes he got shot in the night or worse bayoneted returning to himself after those dreams came as close to relief as anything in the pow camp he dreamt of combat tonight it was artillery in his head which could be as bad as bayonets hed commanded a he knew too well what shellfire did to human flesh if he hadnt known before what hed seen in the fighting would have taught him plenty and when he woke he woke from a noisy dream of combat to combat machine guns and rifles and mortars were going off much too close by tracers ripped through the prisoner camp mostly from south to north the tracers were red fletch needed a moment to remember what that meant the japs used iceblue tracers red tracers meant americans holy jesus fletch whispered tears filled his eyes maybe those were tears of weakness he didnt care somebodyd remembered he and his comrades in misery existed somebody was trying to save them what might have been the voice of god but was more likely a marine or sailor on a pa system shouted through the racket of gunfire prisoners us prisoners move toward the beach well get you out as if to underscore that a mortar round hit a guard tower it went over with a crash there was one machine gun that wouldnt shoot backand wouldnt shoot any pows either but the guards and soldiers around kapiolani park werent about to give up without a fight as far as fletch could see the japs never gave up without a fightnever gave up in fact they stopped fighting only when they died their coldlooking tracers spat out at the attacking americans and as the pows started moving toward their rescuers automaticweapons fire lashed the camp men died and fell wounded and screaming just as they were on the point of being rescued the unfairness of that tore at fletch so did raw terror he didnt want to be one of those casualties not now not at this of all moments but the prisoners couldnt do anything to protect themselves they had no place to hide bullets either nailed them or didnt it was all luck one way or the other a squad of guards rushed into the camp and turned their arisakas on the pows too they must have thought they could turn the americans back instead careless of whether they lived or died the pows surged toward them disciplined to the end the japs all emptied their clips at about the same time as they were reloading the americans swarmed over them the scene was straight out of durer or goya skeletons rising up to attack the living the japs screamed but not for long fletch had always thought only artillery could tear a man to pieces he found he was wrong bare hands did the job just fine one by one machine guns in the guard towers fell silent knocked out by the attackers move move move roared the big voice on the loudspeaker american prisoners move to the south tracerlight gave fletch his first glimpse of the soldiers whod hit the beach to liberate the pow camp he needed a moment to recognize them for what they were they wore dark uniformsdark green he thoughtnot the khaki that had been his color even their helmets were different potshaped domes that covered more of the head than the britishstyle steel derbies fletch and his comrades had used for a heartbeat he wondered if they really were americans but they had rifles and submachine guns in their hands and they were shooting up the japs what else mattered he would have kissed orson welles martians if they turned their fearsome heat rays on those guard towers these werent martians they were americans even if they wore funny clothes haul ass youse guys one of them yelled in pure new york we got boats on the beach waitin for youse shake a leg already fletch gave it all he could he had the feeling a tortoise with a tailwind would have left him in the dust but he couldnt do anything about that the marines had landed with bulldozers with armored drivers boxes to tear paths through the barbed wire he stumbled out through one stumbled across kalakaua avenue and then fell down when he got to the sand not all the japs were out of action falling down might have saved his lifea snipers bullet cracked past just over his head he hauled himself to his feet and staggered on the beach was alive with stick figures just like him this way this way marines and sailors with red flashlights steered pows toward the boats that waited for them we got plenty for everybody dont fight dont trample obeying that order came hard how could anyone stand to wait another moment to be free as he stood there bullets still snapping and cracking past every so often he got a look at the boats that would take him and his partners in misery away he knew damn well that the us military had owned no such slabsided frontmouthed machines before the war with the japs started like the airplanes like the uniforms these had all been designed and built from scratch while he waited on the sidelines a career officer he wondered if hed have any career left even after he got his strength back while he was staring at the landing craft the men who crewed them stared at the nearly rescued pows you poor sorry sons of bitches one of them said we ought to murder every motherfucking jap in the world for this before fletch could say anything one of the other americans on the beach beat him to the punch sounds good to me one by one the boats filled and waddled off the beach and into the water they were every bit as ungainly there as they were on land fletchs turn finally came he climbed an iron ramp and got into a boat a sailor was passing out cigarettes to the pows here ya go pal he said and gave fletch a light the first drag on the chesterfield after so long made him dizzy and lightheaded and sick to his stomach as if hed never smoked at all it felt wonderful another sailor said you guys are so skinny we can load more of you on each boat than we figured it only went to show there were advantages to everything even starvation fletch would gladly have forgone that one a motor started chains rattled the ramp came up sailors dogged it shut all of a sudden it was the bow of the boat awkward as a drunken sow the landing craft backed into the water beside fletch a man quietly started to bawl were free he blubbered were really free i didnt think we ever would be but we are yeah fletch said and then he was crying too joy and weakness all coming out at once inside a couple of minutes half the breathing skeletons in the boat were sobbing as if their hearts would break sailors dealt out more smokes and they passed out open ration cans too tears stopped as abruptly as theyd started everybody crowded forward wanting his with a fierce and terrible desire none of them would ever be the same about food again fletch was sure of that right now they might have been hungry wolves in a cage not till his hands closed around a can did a low unconscious growl die in his throat he ate with his fingers the can held greasy roastbeef hash it was the most delicious thing hed ever tasted he couldnt remember the last time he ate beef probably when his army rations ran out my god he muttered over and over again my god that such food was out there even his dreams hadnt been anything like this he cut his tongue licking the inside of the can to make sure he got every tiny scrap out of it the boats motion and the rich food they werent used to made several men seasick after some of the stinks fletch had known lately that one wasnt so bad his own stomach seemed to take the wonderful food for ballast nothing bothered him as the boat chugged away from oahu he didnt think anything would ever bother him again he might have been wrong but he felt that way after a couple of hours his landing craft and the others came up alongside ships that took the pows aboard that wasnt easy they couldnt climb nets the way sailors and marines did sailors on deck lowered slings to the boats the sailors there fitted them around the prisoners shoulders the men on the ship hauled them up fletch felt more like a package than the daring young man on the flying trapeze careful buddy a sailor said as he came up over the rail dont hurt yourself im out of that goddamn camp fletch answered how could anything hurt me now as soon as he was safely up on deck he asked can i get some more food can i have a bath we got saltwater soap and those showers are going the sailor said otherwise its a sponge bathtoo many men and not enough fresh water food docs gotta say its okay before we give you much sometimes you eat too much too fast you get sick i wouldnt fletch knew he sounded like a whiny little kid he couldnt help it when it came to food he felt like a whiny little kid he decided to take a shower even he didnt believe how filthy he was as he stripped off his rags a sailor said you got anything in the pockets you need to keep otherwise were gonna deepsix all of this shit no there isnt anything fletch answered he wasnt used to being around wellfed americans any more their fleshy bodies looked wrong distorted he knew the problem was in the way he looked at these strangers whod rescued him and taken him in not in the men themselves knowledge didnt change perception saltwater soap was nasty stuff but he needed something nasty to get a few layers of filth off lots of freed pows scrubbed themselves in the showers an oceantemperature shower wasnt too bad not when the ocean was off hawaii he kept flicking glances toward the naked men in there with him he could see every bone and every tendon in their bodies that was how americans were supposed to look next to them the sailors and marines seemed almost inflated after he came out of the shower and dried off all he got in the way of clothes was a bathrobe sorry buddy said the sailor who handed it to him we didnt know you guysd be in such miserable shape its okay fletch said but for modesty going naked in this climate was no hardship the hawaiians had done it all the time and he didnt need anybody else to tell him he was in miserable shape he knew that himself he didnt actually see a doctor a pharmacists mate looked him over you dont seem too bad all things considered the man said after a very quick very cursory check just dont try to fatten yourself up all at once he picked up a spray gun shed the robe he sprayed both fletch and the garment fletchs nose wrinkled whats that stuff he asked whatever it was it had a harsh chemical tang there were other kinds of bad smells besides those that sprang from filth and death shits called ddtand now you know as much as you did before right the pharmacists mate said what you need to know is it kills lice mosquitoes every kind of bug under the sun kills em dead dead dead you may not believe it but you arent lousy any more what about the nits fletch scratched automatically kills them too the sailor said and if a louse does somehow hatch whats left of the ddt in your hair is plenty to make the little bastard buy the farm im telling you buddy this shit is the straight goods yeah whats it do to people then fletch asked diddly squat safe as houses greatest thing since sliced bread the pharmacists mate gave him back the robe go feed your face not too much though you hear or youll be sorry yes mother fletch said which made the other man laugh he went on to the galley they had biscuits there with butter and jam flour had vanished from oahu even before the american surrender it all came from the mainlandand then it stopped coming butter and jam were only memories too thank you jesus somebody said as short and sincere a grace as fletch had ever heard and then the cooks brought out platters of fried chicken at the sight at the mouthwatering smell several pows burst into tears one of them said but whats for all the other guys that got a laugh and defused the tension that had built at the presence of so much food fletch felt the fearsomebody else might get more than he did he had to remind himself there was plenty for everyone his head might know that but his belly didnt he snagged a drumstick the coating of batter crunched in his mouth then he was eating hot chicken he wasnt dreaming about it it was real tears streamed down his cheeks it was real when he set the bone down not the tiniest scrap of meat was left on it no crumbs from the biscuits remained on his plate either he leaned back in his chair he didnt feel starved he didnt even feel hungry he could hardly remember what that was like wow he said the man next to him grinned right the first time buddy a sailor came by to pick up plates a pow stopped him saying i was at the opana camp for a while up at the other end of the island that place was as big as this one maybe bigger have you gone after the guys there too the sailors face clouded we cant he said as soon as we got close to it the japs started shooting up the place we werent ready for it thenwe didnt think anybody could act that bastardly shows what we knew he made as if to spit on the deck then caught himself at the last second dont know for sure how many guys those fuckers murderedgotta be thousands jesus the prisoner whod asked the question crossed himself fletch was horrified but not surprised everything the japanese had done since taking hawaii showed pows were nothing but a nuisance to them theyd starved their captives abused them and worked them to death why wouldnt they slaughter them to keep them from being rescued it made perfect senseif you fought the war like that thanks for getting to us before they did the same thing at kapiolani he said the gob hadnt had thing one to do with it but fletch had enough gratitude to spread around to anybody in the us military right now brass figured wed better try the sailor said im gladdern hell it went as well as it did how many japanese machinegun bullets had snapped by within a couple of feet of fletch how many scrawny starving men had those bullets killed he didnt know he wondered if anyone would ever know exactly he knew who would if anybody ever did graves registration and yet here he was on an american ship his belly fullreally full of american food he was gladder than hell the rescue had gone as well as it had too the guards in the kalihi valley were jumpier than ever that made the prisoners tunneling through the koolau range jumpier than ever toothose of them who kept the strength to worry jim peterson still did so did charlie kaapu peterson admired the hapahawaiians strength and determination he wished he could match them but hed been here much longer than charlie and hed been in worse shape when he got here his spirit was willing his flesh he had no flesh to speak of not any more he had skin and he had bones and only hunger between them we got to get out of here charlie whispered to him one evening before exhaustion knocked them over the head we got to those fuckers gettin ready to do us all in you can see it in their eyes peterson nodded hed had the same thought himself every time artillery fire got closer every time american fighters flew by overhead they might have been twisting a knife in the japs guts the guards would lash out then the way a kid whod just lost a schoolyard brawl might kick a dog they didnt have any dogs to kick though they had pows instead and kicking was the least of what they did to them at the same time peterson shook his head even that took effort go ahead if you think you can get away id just hold you back you can do it man charlie said gotta be tough get back to honolulu you be okay he might be okay if he got back to honolulu flesh melted off him day by day but he still had some the first jap who saw peterson would know him for what he washe didnt think he weighed a hundred pounds any more and that would be all she wrote the outskirts of honolulu werent more than three or four miles away they might as well have been on the dark side of the moon for all the good that did peterson im done for he said not enough left of me to be worth saving shit charlie said dont you want to get your own back dont you want to watch these assholes get whats coming to em how you gonna do that if you lay down and die im not laying down peterson said remembering how fiercely hed sworn revenge back when captivity was new im not laying down dammit but i cant go anywhere very far either look at me he held out his arm five knobby pencils attached to a broomstick look how am i going to run if we get spotted charlie kaapu looked he swore his words all the more terrible for being so lowvoiced ill go ill bring back help bet i find american soldiers in honolulu maybe he would thered been a hell of a lot of shooting from somewhere down that way a few nights earlier whatever it was all about the guards had been even nastier since peterson wouldnt have imagined they needed an excuse for that but they seemed to he said if you make it tell em were up here far as anybody knows i bet weve fallen off the edge of the world ill do it charlie said you really cant come man peterson shook his head again the hapa hawaiian reached out in the darkness and set a hand on his bony shoulder hang on brother im gonna get away im gonna bring help in spite of everything jim peterson smiled just like in the movies fuckina man charlie said just like in the movies well if youre gonna do it do it fast peterson said i dont know how much longer im going to last and god only knows how long the japsll let anybody last cover for me at roll call in the morning charlie kaapu said will do peterson answered though he feared the japs would notice charlie was missing even if their count came out right they had trouble telling one emaciated white man from another yeah all occidentals look alike to them peterson thought and damned if he didnt smile again but charlie was only half whiteand only half emaciated too which counted for more he stood out he had as much life in him as half a dozen ordinary pows put together he as if to prove his own point peterson fell asleep then right in the middle of a thought he woke up some time laterhe didnt know how long charlie kaapu wasnt lying beside him any more good luck charlie he thought and then he fell asleep again three men died during the night the pows who lived on carried the corpses out with them so the guards could keep the precious count straight and those living pows did what they could to keep the guards from noticing one of their number wasnt there and wasnt dead they shifted around in the ranks that were supposed to be still and unmoving the japs clouted several of them the guards would do that without an excuse when they had one they did it even more but they were stupider than peterson had figured them for he thought the americans were going to get away with their deception and wondered how the japs could fail to miss what wasnt right in front of their noses the answer wasnt all that hard to find their officers didnt want smart bastards here they wanted mean bastardsand what they wanted they got still and all the japs would have had to be dumber than a pile of pebbles not to notice pretty damn quick that charlie kaapu wasnt there they were just about to let the pows queue up for the miserable breakfast when a corporal let out a yelp as if somebodyd poked him with a pin kaabu when the japs tried to say p it mostly came out as b peterson had got used to being called beterson naturally charlie didnt answer the guards had the conniptions they should have had twenty minutes earlier they started beating people in earnest with swagger sticks with rifle butts and with their fists they kicked men who fell too they were even more furious than peterson had figured they would be and they werent just mad at the pows they also screamed at one another the men whod been on watch during the night would surely catch holy hell that didnt break jim petersons heart it couldnt happen to a nicer bunch of people the prisoners didnt get breakfast that morning they got marched straight into the tunnel instead the japs cut them no slack if anything the guards worked them even harder than usual anyone who faltered got beaten or kicked without mercy along with taking out endless buckets of rock the pows dragged out several corpses they got no supper that night either nobody dared say a word if the japs kept that up for another few days they wouldnt need to worry about escapes from the kalihi valley any more all the pows here would be dead a few months earlier mistreatment like this might have prompted lots of men to try to escape no more next to nobody had the strength and the guards would be shooting at their own shadows now the prisoners went nowhere the timing was bad just before sunup the next morning two trucks came up to the camp in the kalihi valley from honolulu below jim peterson and the other prisoners stared in amazement the trucks themselves were ordinary us army vehicles the japs had commandeered painting over the white star on each driversside door but their being here wasnt ordinary they were the first trucks peterson had seen since coming to the punishment camp and instead of getting the prisoners to do the work for them the way they almost always did the japs unloaded the trucks themselves the contents seemed harmless enough crates with incomprehensible japanese squiggles on the sides the guards lugged them over to the mouth of the tunnel then they set up another machinegun position nearby and posted several riflemen next to the crates too they treat that shit like its the hawaiian crown jewels another prisoner remarked to peterson how do you know its not he said if their sides losing this is a hell of a place to stash em he got a lesson in the way rumors worked by the time the pows assembled for roll call half an hour later everybody was convinced the japs were going to stow the hawaiian crown jewels in the tunnel no one had any evidence that that was so but nobody seemed to need any either in nothing flat a chance comment swelled into one of those things everybody knew another thing everybody knew was that the japs were going to be double tough on the count this morning peterson and the other pows had only been guessing about the crown jewels what everybody knew turned out to be dead right this time no one presumed even to twitch as the guards stalked along the prisoners ranks one luckless fellow who sneezed with a guard right behind him got beaten and kicked till he lay on the ground all bloody and groaning peterson shuddered to think what would happen if the japs screwed up the count even though the prisoners were cooperating for a wonder the guards didnt for what felt like an even bigger wonder they let the pows line up for breakfast as always it wasnt much and it wasnt good after a day and a half of emptiness and brutal labor anything at all in petersons belly seemed wonderful he knew he was still a starving man but he wasnt starving quite so fast after the prisoners ate the guards pointed toward the tunnel mouth all go all go they shouted and speedothe english they used for make it snappy mac of course a clout in the head with a rifle butt or a length of bamboo was as much a part of a universal language as a smile or a caress somehow the poets had never got around to singing the praises of a good solid wallop when the japs said all go they werent kidding they routed out the cooks and sent them into the tunnel too and they made the healthier prisonershealth being very much a relative term herecarry the men who were too sick to walk but not yet dead into the shaft american bomber they said that made peterson wonder for one thing the american attackers had shown exactly no signs of caring about the kalihi valley for another up till now the japs had shown exactly zero interest in their prisoners safety no that wasnt quite true the japs sometimes went out of their way to decrease safety for the pows improving it was another story more or less fortified by his moreorless meal peterson attacked the rock face with a pick other prisoners scooped up the rock hed torn loose loaded it into baskets and carried it away peterson heard gunshots from the direction of the tunnel mouth he didnt think much of itthe japs often got a wild hair up their asstill a pow came staggering back toward the excavators theyre killing us he shouted theyre shooting us then he fell over peterson marveled that he could have come so far so fast shot through the chest work came to a ragged halt one by one picks and shovels fell silent no guards lashed out with clubs or shouted speedo and isogi in fact no guards seemed to be in the tunnel at all when peterson realized that ice ran through him the japs dont have the crown jewels in those boxes he shouted theyve got dynamite theyre going to blow in the tunnel mouth and trap us in here he threw down his pick the steel head clanked on stone a moment later he picked up the tool again it wasnt much of a weapon but he couldnt get a better one till he knocked a jap over the head and stole his arisaka come on he yelled they arent going to get away with this god damn them he started back up the long straight shaft the pows had dug nor was he the only one everybody who still had the strength stormed up the tunnel toward the tiny circle of light at the end the japs must have known something like that would happen theyd shifted the machine guns that had protected those crates so they pointed straight down the tunnel they fired a burst a few rounds struck home at once others viciously ricocheted off ceiling floor and tunnel walls before finding a prisoner to wound that wasnt the worst of it the worst was listening to the machine gunners laugh as they squeezed off some more rounds in their shoes peterson would have laughed too why not they could fire those nambus till the barrels glowed red and the poor bastards they were killing couldnt even shoot back weve got to keep going he cried its our necks if we dont its our necks if we do somebody else said which was just as true id rather get shot than buried alive peterson wished he had some better choices but those seemed to be the only ones on the menu hed had nightmares where he was trying to run somewhere but his feet seemed stuck in quicksand this was one of those except it wasnt a nightmare it was real if he didnt get to the mouth of the tunnel before the camp guards did whatever they did he never would their machine gunners kept on shooting down the shaft they kept on laughing between bursts too then they stopped shooting peterson could think of only one reason why they would do that they must have lit the fuse and they were all running for cover and he was too far away he knew he was too far away he tried to force more speed from his poor abused carcass but a shuffling shamble was all it would give him quicksand he thought desperately quick he was one of the leaders of the mob of pows hed got within a hundred yards of the tunnel mouth when the japanese explosives went up the next thing he knew it was black and untold tons of rock were coming down on him oh good he thought at least im not bur oscar van der kirk jumped when somebody knocked on his door a little before eleven susie higgins jumped higher shed seen horror out on the street oscar had just heard about it who the hells that she said her voice shrill with fear dont know oscar heard the fear in his own voice too the knock came again quick and urgent two years earlier whoever it was would have just walked in odds were long against the doors being locked in those days now now was a different story oscars fear swelled with each tap anybody out after curfew was in trouble with the japs anybody in trouble with the japs these days was as good as dead and so was anybody who helped someone in trouble with the japs dont let him in susie whispered ive got to oscar said i wouldnt let those bastards get their hands on a gooney bird let alone a man before susie could start a fightand before he could lose his nervehe threw open the door oscar croaked the man in the hallway he was about oscars height but only skin and bones draped in rags his eyes burned feverishly deep in their sockets a powerful stench came off him in waves a stench that said he hadnt bathed in weeks who the but oscar broke off with the question unfinished charlie jesus christ charlie get your ass in here charlie kaapu gave him a ghost of the grin he knew then get out of my way numbly oscar did charlie staggered past him and into the little apartment if oscar had ever wanted to see a dictionary illustration of the phrase on your last legs here it was in front of him he was so shaken he didnt even close the door after charlie till susie hissed at him she gasped when she got a good look at the hapahawaiian he wasnt just four steps from starving to death somebodythe japs oscar supposedhad been beating on him with sticks the welts showed it on his arms across his face and visible through the holes and tears in his shirt on his chest and back as well he was missing some teeth hed had when the japs got hold of him he sat down on the ratty rug as if his legs didnt want to hold him upand they likely didnt you think i look bad you ought to see the other poor bastards up in the kalihi valley he said next to them im duke goddamn kahanamoku here susie ran to the icebox and pulled out a couple of ripe avocados and a mackerel suddenly charlies attention focused on her like a searchlight in the presence of food he forgot about everything else oscar didnt suppose he could blame him either let me have those please charlie said an unusual restraint in his voice he sounded like a man holding himself back from leaping on what he wanted i was going to do something with the fish susie said uncertainly he shook his head his hair and scalp were full of scabs too dont bother he told her ive eaten fish japstyle plenty of times and i dont much want to wait you know what i mean without a word susie gave him the mackerel and the alligator pears oscar didnt think hed ever seen her speechless before but she was now charlie made the avocados and the fish disappear in nothing flat he ate with a singleminded concentration like nothing oscar had ever seen oscar didnt try to talk with him till nothing was left but peel and seeds and bones if he had spoken he didnt think charlie would have answered or even heard him oh lord that was fine charlie looked down at his rubbish hed even eaten the eyes out of the mackerels head i do that for days and days at a time i start to be a man again wont be easy not till the americans get here oscar said yeah charlie kaapu nodded i was hoping theyd be here alreadyall that shooting we heard down here from up in the valley but i see it aint so some crazy jap motherfucker almost shot me for the fun of it before i got here scuse me susie its okay susie said i know about the crazy jap motherfuckers i know more than i ever wanted to she shuddered what did they do to you charlie oscar asked well they taught me one thingi aint never gonna screw around with no jap officers special lady friend no more charlie kaapu said in spite of himself oscar laughed so did susie she clapped her hands too charlie went on but you didnt mean that they tried to starve me to death they tried to work me to death when i didnt start dying fast enough to suit em they tried to beat me to death too the other guys there were pows who were hard cases imagine what id look like if i was there three times as long thats them my god susie said after trying to imagine that how come they arent all dead lot of em are charlie answered more dyin every day too but a hard case is a hard case and some of em stayed alive just to spite the japs this guy named peterson shoulda been dead months ago but he was still breathin when i got away one tough son of a bitch you bet what the heck did they have you doing in the kalihi valley oscar said ive been up there its nothing but the river and trees all the way back to the mountains dont i know it charlie said what were we doin we were digging a tunnel through the mountains to the damn windward coast thats what digging with picks and shovels and crowbars and baskets mind the japs didnt give a shit if we ever got there it was something to work us to death with thats all my god oscar muttered people had talked about ramming a tunnel through the mountains for years he supposed they would have got around to it sooner or later when they did he supposed they would have used dynamite and jackhammers and all the others tools mankind had invented to make sure jobs like that didnt take forever can i have a bath or a shower or something charlie said im filthy and im lousy too i hope you guys dont get company on account of me oscar hoped the same thing he automatically started to scratch then jerked his hand down out of the corner of his eye he saw susie doing the same thing it would have been funny if it hadnt been so grim and charlie was filthy the rank smell that came off him filled the apartment go ahead oscar told him i wish i had soap and hot water thats all you can wear some of my clothes when you come out toss yours out and ill get rid of em will do charlie said were about the same sizewell we used to be anyway i cant get over how fat people look oscar and susie were both skinnier than they had been when japan took oahu and they were better off than most people because oscar caught so many fish to a skeleton though a skinny man had to look fat charlie went into the bathroom then stuck his head out again what was all the shooting about a couple of nights ago thats why i thought the army would be back here they cleaned out the prison camp in kapiolani park oscar answered they rescued a bunch of guys who looked just like you he didnt say that except by not screwing around with women he should have left alone charlie couldnt help the way he looked oscar added i guess they were afraid the japs would start killing people if they just left em there jeez i believe that charlie said i was hoping i could take soldiers back to kalihi valley god knows whats gonna happen to my buddies now he closed the door again water started to run in a low voice oscar said hes gotta stay here for a while babe im sorry but i dont know what else we can do susie waved the words aside its okay youre right we cant do anything else my god did you see him he looks like a photo in life or national geographic where theyre talking about famine in india or china or somewhere like that now she did scratch her head she smiled sheepishly but said for heavens sake throw his clothes somewhere far far away im going to imagine im itching for the next week whether i really am or not yeah i know oscar got a flowered shirt and a pair of pants out of the closet and tossed them into the bathroom he didnt have a belt that charlie could use to hold up the pants none of the ones he owned had enough holes but a length of rope would keep his pal decent he glanced over at susie how sympathetic would she feel if charlie stayed here all the time how would she show her sympathy like that oscar shrugged a mental shrug if she did then she did that was all and if she did didnt that tell him she wasnt the girl he wanted to spend the rest of his life with when charlie got out of the tub he threw his old clothes out from behind the door he emerged a couple of minutes later much cleaner maybe because he was cleaner maybe because of the way oscars shirt and pants hung on him he looked even scrawnier than he had before oscar picked up charlies reeking rags with thumb and forefinger like a fussy maiden lady he didnt care how he looked if hed had tongs he would have used those he took the clothes out to the front door of the building poked his head outside to make sure no japs spotted him and threw everything into the gutter he frantically wiped his hand against his own trouser leg as he went back to his apartment charlie was telling susie what things were like in the kalihi valley she hung on his every word well charlie could tell stories with anybody this side of will rogers oscar wasnt bad but he wasnt in charlies league he shrugged to himself again hed see what happened that was all whatever it was he was glad charlie had got out of the kalihi valley in one piece jane armitage had made a lair of sorts for herself in the wahiawa experimental planting station a stream ran through it so she had water some of the trees had fruit on them and gave her a little something to eat zebra doves werent nearly so common as they had been before the japs invaded but the little bluefaced birds were still around jane didnt dare make a fire if you got hungry enough you could eat them raw jane wouldnt have believed it but it was true and she was hungry enough she couldnt have had a simpler plan stay out of sight and try not to die till the americans took wahiawa no one seemed to have come after her or the other comfort women whod escaped from the blasted brothel jane knew exactly what that meant the japs had more important things to worry about they were getting screwed now instead of doing the screwing and they had it coming to them too every so often other people came into the station to gather fruit jane hid from them like an animal cowering in the thick bushes by the stream that was partly because she feared they might betray her to the occupiers and it was partly because after what the japanese had made her do she felt unclean surely anyone who knew her anyone who knew what shed had to do would think she was unclean too from thirdgrade teacher to whore in one easy step the front was getting close to wahiawa but not fast enough to suit her the japs made a stand in front of the town they would the bastards jane thought as she got hungrier even though they didnt know she was here they kept on trying to ruin her life theyd done it all right here she was not quite thirty and she hoped to heaven she never saw never touched and most especially never tasted another cock as long as she lived maybe one day shed change her mind she laughed at that yeahwhen i get to be ninety or maybe ninetyfive there were times when she wouldnt have bet she could make it to her thirtieth birthday let alone to ninetyfive except by standing and fighting the japs didnt have anything to do with that american shells had been falling on wahiawa ever since the brothel got hit sometimes they fell in or near the planting station those fearsome crashes uprooted trees and sent shrapnel snarling through the leaves and the undergrowth none of it hit jane but some came scarily close shed been at the station four or five days when machinegun bullets began snapping past overheadbecause the gardens followed the course of the stream most of the land here was lower than the surrounding countryside fletch had told her that when you could hear a bullet snap it came closer than you wanted it to she thought these bullets were wonderful they meant the americans were almost as close as she wanted them to be then japanese soldiers started falling back through the station jane hid herself as deep among the bushes as she could she feared they would fight from the cover the exotic plants offered the low ground though evidently counted for more than that some of the japs paused to fill their water bottles in the stream then they trotted south to make a stand somewhere else before long their bullets cracked by above her head as they harassed the oncoming americans she lay down behind a fallen log and hoped it would protect her somebody set up a machine gun on the northern lip of the little valley its insane hammering made her fillings ache she heard shouts that didnt sound as if they were in japanese and then boots padding along the trails tourists had taken to see the elephant apple and the candle tree ever so cautiously she raised her head for a moment fresh fear shook her were these men americans they were white men and they spoke english but shed never seen those green uniforms before the helmets didnt look anything like what fletch had laughingly called his tin hat either she had to nerve herself to speak hello she said her voice not much more than a whisper with frightening speed two rifles swung to cover her the fuck one of the apparitions in green said son of a bitch its a broad the other one said come on out of there lady we goddamn near drilled you goddamn near the first one agreed what the hell you doin here anyways hiding she answered to her it was the most obvious thing in the world thesewarriorsgrinned as if shed made a joke who are you people anyway she asked corporal petrocelli maam one of them said at the same time as the other answered private schumacher maam together they added united states army the army didnt wear uniforms like theirs noit hadnt worn uniforms like theirs thered been some changes made schumacher who was shorter and darker than petrocelli which only went to show you asked any japs around jane pointed south they went thataway she said as if she had a bit part in a b western i hope you kill em all thats what were here for maam corporal petrocelli said he looked her up and down not like a man eyeing a woman thank god but more like an engineer wondering how long a badly battered piece of machinery could keep running taking a couple of small cans out of a pouch on his belt he handed them to her here you go reckon you need these worsen we do thus prodded private schumacher coughed up some rations too thank you she whispered on the edge of tears then she proved she did have a little common sense left she asked how am i going to open these heretry this schumacher gave her a knifeno a bayonet longer and slimmer than the one on his rifle it looked much too deadly for such a mundane job but it would probably work he said took it off a dead jap a couple days ago was gonna keep it for a souvenir but theres more you can get some use out of it toadsticker like thatll scrag anybody who gets out of line too petrocelli said if id had it back in the brothel if id stuck every man that touched me jane grimaced if id done that idve killed so many the army would probably be in honolulu by now not far away somebody shouted jane had no idea what he said it made sense to the soldiers though they trotted away schumacher looked back over his shoulder and waved then they were gone and most of wahiawa had to be in american hands and jane had a weapon and foodmy god real food she went back into her refuge under the bushes and behind the log maybe shed come out after a while and maybe she wouldnt in the meantime she used the bayonet to open a can it was roastbeef hash she hadnt eaten beef in going on two years she thought it was the most wonderful thing shed ever tasted which only proved how long shed gone without the americans were going to overrun wheeler field lieutenant saburo shindo could see as much the japanese on the ground were doing everything they could to hold back the enemy theyd taken gruesome casualties and the yankees still moved forward the americans had more and better tanks than the japanese they had more artillery plus navy vessels bombarding oahu and they had complete control of the air shindo knew how important that was hed enjoyed it during the japanese conquest of hawaii having american fighters and bombers overhead from dawn to dusk was much less enjoyable than being up there himself now he had the chance to get up there again the groundcrew men at wheeler field had cannibalized zeros and hayabusas for their weapons theyd cannibalized half a dozen wrecked fighters to put together one that wouldthey hopedfly shindo hadnt even had to pull strings to get to take it up against the americans he was as far as he knew the last pilot at the field alive and unwounded there was an american movie about a man made from parts of other men the fighter shindo would fly against the americans was a lot like that most of it came from zeros with occasional pieces from hayabusas it was a deathtrap he knew as much under normal conditions he wouldnt have walked past it let alone got into the cockpit now the whole japanese garrison on oahu would die how was the only thing that mattered shindo wanted to die hitting back at the enemy hurting the roundeyed barbarians whod dared strike against his divinely ruled kingdom before he got into the frankenstein fighter a groundcrew man handed him a bottle of the local notquitegin he wouldnt have drunk before an ordinary mission what difference did it make now none he could see hed have to be lucky to make a proper attack run hed need a miracle and not such a minor one to come back good luck hit them hard the groundcrew man said as shindo handed back the bottle banzai for the emperor banzai shindo echoed he climbed up into the cockpit closed it and dogged it shut the engine fired up the first try shindo took that for a good omen hed been desperately short of them lately so had all the japanese on oahu one more good omen would be taking off without blowing up he had a hundredkilo bomb slung under the plane what passed for a runway was only enough grass to get him off the ground he hoped if there wasnt quite enough grass or if a wheel bumped down into a hole the grass hidhis mission would be shorter than he expected despite the risks he wished the bomb were bigger the fighter could carry kilos without any trouble but the armorers hadnt been able to find one that size he shrugged and adjusted the safety harness then he released the brakes the plane rolled forward he gave it more throttle when he neared the end of the grass he pulled back on the stick the zeros nose came up he couldnt have asked for a smoother takeoff he got a panoramic view of the fighting as he climbed wahiawa was gone lost so were the schofield barracks just north of wheeler field if the mechanics had waited much longer to get busy with their wrenches and pliers and rivet guns they wouldnt have been able to do this below him wildcats and the new american fighters dove to shoot up a japanese ground position machinegun fire rose to meet them but no real antiaircraft guns opened up none of the american planes paid any attention to shindo if they noticed him at all they assumed he was one of them a zeros size and shape were a little like a wildcats but only a little the biggest help he had was the yankees assumption that no more japanese aircraft could fly if he couldnt be japanese he had to be american logical wasnt it but logic was only as good as its assumptions since those were wrong he flew north toward the waiting american fleet a flight of southbound planes waggled their wings at him maybe they thought he was in trouble he politely waggled back as if to say everything was fine they flew on so did he he smiled a thin smile as he had in air battles past he could follow their vector back to the carriers that had launched them domo arigato he murmured doubting they would be glad to have his thanks the rest of the us task forcedestroyers cruisers and battleshipslay close inshore so their big guns could shell the japanese they went at it methodically why not no one could hit back at them shindo didnt intend to these ships however impressive and they put the biggest japanese fleet to shame werent the ones that really mattered he wanted the carriers they steamed farther offshore to make sure nothing from oahu could reach them lieutenant shindo smiled again something from oahu was heading their way anyhow there they were they had destroyers around them to protect against submarines and to deliver antiaircraft fire they must have long since picked him up on radar even if they had though they didnt think he was hostile then he muttered zakennayo the carriers still had a combat air patrol overhead here came a wildcat to look him over just in case the pilot was bound to be thinking shindo could survive a lot of things but not close visual inspection he knew the moment when the enemy flier realized what he was the wildcat suddenly sped up and started jinking the american thought he could win a dogfight a lot of wildcat pilots made the mistake against a zero they hardly ever made it more than once this yankee wouldnt shindo turned inside him got behind him shot him up and sent him spinning down toward the pacific but the wildcat pilot must have radioed his buddies they all swarmed toward shindo hed just run out of leisure things would happen in a hurry now he dove toward the closest carrier the americans still didnt space them out as widely as they should have if the japanese could have organized a real attack they might have mauled this task force as things were shindo could only do his best antiaircraft guns opened up on him as he dove the ships down below had finally figured out he wasnt one of theirs the closest carrier wasnt a big one he didnt care if he could hit it he would he pulled the bombrelease lever the bomb fell free it exploded on the flight deck shell fragments or machinegun bullets slammed into the zero as it zoomed away the engine coughed smoke trailed from the plane karma shindo said sure enough this was a oneway mission he would have been angrier and more disappointed if hed expected anything else he flew on toward the next nearest carrier hoping his plane wouldnt go into the drink before he got there a wildcat dove on him he did a snap roll and got away that changed his direction there was another carrier not far ahead it was landing planes and had lots of them on the flight deck perfect he gained a little altitude then dove as if landing himself inside the cockpit he braced himself for the impact not that that would do any good banzai he shouted as the flight deck swelled below him ban joe crosetti ran for the bunker hills island after scrambling out of his hellcat he wondered why some nearby ships were firing aa like it was going out of style he wouldnt have believed the japs had any planes left what he believed didnt matter worth a damn he got his nose rubbed in that a moment later a sailor pointed to starboard and screamed holy fucking shit its a jap and it was the zero was on fire it skimmed low over the surface of the pacific straight for the bunker hill joe stared in helpless fascination what the hell was that pilot thinking he couldnt be crazy enough to try to land on an american carrier could he hed get shot to pieces before he could open the cockpit and even if that werent so he wasnt lined up anyway he rose a little then dove for the deck crosetti couldnt believe he was going to crash his plane on purpose till he did it the zero went up in a fireball so did half a dozen hellcats fire joe yelled fire on the flight deck a flightcrew man came running out of the inferno his clothes were on firehe might have been on fire too he screamed like a damned soul with devils sticking pitchforks into him down joe shouted down and roll that was what everybody got trained to do remembering the training when things hit the fan wasnt so easy joe was still in his flight suit with the heavy leather jacket he wasnt a big guy but he dashed across the deck tackled the flightcrew man lay atop him and beat at the flames with his gloved fists when most of the fire was out somebody turned a hose on them for a few seconds the man behind the hose had the sense to turn the nozzle to mist not stream otherwise the highpressure water might have blasted them off the flight deck and into the drink medics came up and hustled the burned man below how about you buddy one of them asked joe you okay yeah i think so he answered dazedly gloves or not hed burned his hands he had a burn on one cheek toohe could feel it but he was in one piece nothing like the poor bastard whod come out of that inferno the medic slapped ointment onto his cheek it stung then soothed you did good the guy said then hustled away to look for more casualties he wouldnt have to look far that jap had been a bastard but a brave bastard hed done as much to the bunker hill as he could planes were still burning despite the ocean water the hoses poured on them burning gasoline and oil floated on top of the water and had to be drowned or washed over the side if that zero smashed down half a minute earlier joe shuddered he would have been right in the middle of the fireball now all he could do was help hang on to a hose that tried to defeat the flames his burned hands screamed at him he ignored them the burns werent all that bad and he didnt think he was making them worse hed worry about it later any which way did you see that fucker asked the petty officer behind him you see the way he crashed that goddamn plane i sure did joe answered the cpo who held the nozzle doused a burning hellcat that might have been his if hed done it a little earlier he would have got me there hed said it the sky didnt fall but he didnt think he would ever have the feeling that nothing could happen to him not any more now he was just anotherwhat had some wise guy called it another fugitive from the law of averages that was it he knew he was screwed so he screwed us too the petty officer said how the hell do you stop a guy who already knows hes gonna buy a plot we didnt joe said no shit the petty officer agreed can you imagine what it would be like if a hundred o them jap bastards tried to crash their planes into carriers and battlewagons all at once they could fuck up the whole goddamn us navy joe thought about it the idea was scary but only for a moment he shook his head never happen buddy no way in hell where you gonna find a hundred guys crazy enough to kill themselves like it was closeorder drill not even the nips are that nuts yeah i guess youre right the petty officer said after some thought of his own youd have to be asiatic to do somethin like that and not even the japs are asiatic that kind of way he pointed to an escort carrier off to starboard a column of smoke rose from that ship too bastard must have put a bomb into hereither that or another plane got her bomb i think joe said you can stick a bomb under just about any fighter there was just the one plane wasnt there well i thought so the rating answered now i aint so sure god what a fucking mess this turned out to be he had that straight damage control was on the ball theyd kept the fire from spreading and now they just about had it out but bunker hills flight deck was still a mess they would have to shove six or eight planes over the side they would have to repair the planking on the flight deck too some of it had caught fire the air stank of gasoline and motor oil of burnt paint and burnt rubber and burnt wood and there was one more odor too one that made spit flood into joes mouth before he realized what caused it and then made him want to be sick the smell of burnt meat would never be the same for him again platoon sergeant les dillon crouched in a shell hole just north of the wheeler field runways the japs had machinegun nests on the other side of those battered cement strips before long somebody who didnt have to do it was going to order the marines to cross that bare ground and they would too or die trying les didnt want to be one of the poor bastards who died trying he heard the sweetest sound in the world radial engines up in the air screaming their heads off hellcats strafed the jap positions he watched thosecaliber rounds chew up the grass over there then he heard different engines louis armstrong instead of benny goodman the dauntlesses put bombs down right on the money and then roared away to get more ordnance and do it again crossing the killing ground still wouldnt be easy any jap who wasnt dead or maimed would be up and shooting the minute the marines came out of their holes even the ones who were maimed would hang on to a rifle or a grenade they werent about to let you take them alive that was fine with les dillon he didnt want to take them alive anyhow a whistle sounded les grimaced this was itthe moment he hadnt been waiting for up you bastards captain bradford yelled are we marines or not that flicked the mens pride the company commander had to know it would les sprang up and ran forward he hunched over as low as he could and dodged from side to side all of that did more good than snapping your fingers to keep the elephants away but not a whole hell of a lot and the planes hadnt cleaned out all the japs hed figured they wouldnt marines fell others flopped down to fire back an iceblue tracer snapped past dillons head his first thought was of a firefly on benzedrine his next was that the round had come much too close to punching his ticket he should have thought that first but your mind did crazy things sometimes then he was in among the japs some of them were real infantrymen others by their clothes groundcrew for airplanes they all fought like madmen the next jap with any quit in him that les saw would be the first but the marines had no quit in them either more of them rushed up to help their buddies the japanese didnt get much in the way of reinforcements les had the feeling the ones fighting here were the last japs standing for quite a ways and then they werent standing any more the marines still on their feet finished off any of the enemy who still twitched word about the opana pow massacre had got out the marines hadnt been any more inclined to take prisoners than the japs were to be captured even before it did now maybe theyd follow a direct order to try to capture some enemy soldiers for interrogation then again maybe not had the japs won the fight les knew a bullet through the head was the best he could hope for things went downhill from there and in a hurry too three sherman tanks rumbled and snorted across the ruined runway les eyed them with a mixture of appreciation and disgust he was glad to see themhe was always glad to see tanks because they took so much pressure off the foot soldiersbut he would have been gladder if theyd shown up an hour earlier they could have made taking this position a hell of a lot easier he wasnt the only one with that feeling either nice of you to join us girls a marine lisped giving the tankers a limpwristed wave they didnt want to get their hair mussed another grimy unshaven leatherneck added even more swishily than the first one les started to giggle he didnt know why but listening to tough guys acting like a bunch of fruits always broke him up some fairies got into the marines when they were found out they left the corps a lot faster than theyd joined it hed seen that happen a few times in china and back in the states some of the men who got bounced were losers for other reasons too others would have made pretty fair marines if they werent queer he laughed again on a different note for all he knew there was a faggot or two in the company now as long as a man didnt advertise itsome didhow were you supposed to know even while such thoughts occurred to him he got down in a hole some jap didnt need any more you didnt want to be on your feet and upright when the japs could start taking potshots at you any second the tank crewmen meanwhile yelled insults back at the marines who fought on foot one bow gunner wanted to jump out of his tank and kick ass the driver on that tank restrained him he was probably lucky ground pounders were likely to be in better shape and meaner than guys who had armor plate to hold the war at bay enough les yelled everybodyenough weve got japs to kill you want to beat on each other wait till we take honolulu that name had enough magic to calm people down marines whod been to hawaii before thought of hotel street those who hadnt didnt but what they had in mind was something like hotel street honolulu was the holy grail there were all sorts of incentives for throwing out the japs booze and pussy not the smallest among them where do we go now sir someone asked captain bradford i dont have more orders yet the company commander answered we did this now we wait and see what happens next the men knew what to do about that they settled themselves in the entrenchments theyd just won here and there they heaved japanese corpses out of them they lit cigarettes some of them opened kration cans as long as they werent going anywhere right away theyd make themselves as comfortable as they could hurry up and wait was supposed to be an army joke but the marines lived by it too dutch wenzel came up to cadge a camel from les they dont put cigars in the krats wenzel said mournfully you still alive hadnt seen you for a while so i started to wonder well i was the last time i looked dillon answered i wondered about you too dont see somebody for a coupla hours you figure maybe he stopped one with his chest these japs wenzel bent close for a light sucked in smoke and held it as long as he could les wondered if he was going to finish that after he finally blew it out then he decided it didnt matter among the marines that was practically a complete sentence all by itself dutch exhaled a gray cloud and said you know you can get damn near anything for cigarettes from the people here they been without since they smoked the last of what they had they go down on their knees to thank you if you give some away yeah les leered you get one of these gals to go down on her knees for you i heard of being hung like a horse but i never heard of being hung like a camel wenzel made a horrible face but he said i bet you could get sucked off for cigarettes no shit tell you somethingi think id rather get blown than lay most of these women theyre so goddamn scrawny itd be like laying a ladder les nodded all the civilians on oahu were skinny even the japs were skinny and theyd had better rations than the locals just the same youve heard about the prisoners at that opana place and the ones our guys rescued down by honolulu those poor mothers werent just skinny they were fucking starving to death for real goddamn japs have a lot to answer for better believe it dutch smoked the cigarette down to a butt then he took an alligator clip out of his pocket and went on smoking it even after it got too small to hold between his fingers that was a good idea les reminded himself to scrounge his own clip off a radioman or a fieldtelephone operator or somebody else who messed around with wires wenzel went on there was supposed to be another camp somewhere too one where the japs got even with guys who got their asses in a sling at the regular places scuttlebutt is that one made the others look like a rest cure i heard something like that too les said you keep hoping that crap isnt so and then you find out it is and that its worse than anybody said it was on account of nobody wouldve believed it if they tried to say how bad it really was wenzel eyed the closest japanese corpse the jap had taken one in the neck and one in the face either would have finished him the one in the face had gone out through the back of his head and blown out most of his brains flies crawled over the bloodsoaked grayish spatters he got it quick dutch observed after what they did at opana id like to roast em all over a slow fire not half of what they oughta get either gonna be that kind of war all right les agreed mournfully back in the germans fought hard but they fought pretty clean so did we even ifhe chuckled reminiscentlytheir machine gunners had a lot of trouble surrendering those bastards thought they could bang away till you were right on top of em and then put up their hands they had more accidents but its all gonna be like that here and were just starting out still a long way to tokyo fuck its still a long way to midway sir the radioman called to captain bradford the company commander listened and talked for a little while then he said well boys weve got our orders now he waited for the expectant mutter to die away then went on were going to do a left wheel and head for honolulu with the rest of the guys moving south what the fuck les muttered hed figured they would keep driving straight south he said sir what about pearl city and pearl harbor theyll be taken care of sergeant i promise bradford said only difference is we wont be the guys who do it right les said somebody somewhere way the hell up the chain of command had had himself a brainstorm whether it would end up being the good kind or the other kindwell everybody would have to wait and see how that turned out honolulu dillon tasted the word hed been thinking about hotel street not long before he wondered what was left of it if the damn nips didnt shoot him first hed find out minoru genda waited in a hotel room on hotel street hed brought his bicycle upstairs with him to the bare little cubicle if he left it on the street even chained to a lamppost it would be gone by the time he came down hed paid too much for the room hed paid too much for the bottle of island gin hed brought here too he shrugged what did he have to do with his money now but spend it a knock on the door he jumped up from the bedthe only furniture in the room but for a battered chest of drawers hotels on hotel street had only one thing in mind he opened the door queen cynthia laanui stood in the hallway probably the most recognizable woman in hawaii shed taken pains not to be recognized her red hair was tucked up under a straw hat enormous sunglasses helped hide her face shed brought her bicycle upstairs too a cramped room with two bicycles in it amused genda small things still could few big ones were amusing any more queen cynthia walked the bicycle in when genda stood aside he closed the door behind her and locked it then he took her in his arms they kissed greedily when they broke apart she said its not going to work is it she didnt sound bitteronly very tired no genda wished he could lie to her back at pearl harbor japanese officers were still busy lying to one another they kept on believing that if this went right and if that went right and if they caught the americans napping here they might still save oahu american officers must have danced that dance of delusion at the end of and the start of before long defeat stared them in the face even so and it would stare the japanese in the face too genda went on we fight hard we are brave but so sorry we cannot win the enemy is too strong saying something like that brought vast relief his colleagues might have arrested him for telling the truth if you didnt look at something they were convinced it would go away but being convinced didnt make it true what are we going to do then cynthia asked what can we do what did we mean here the empire of japan and the soon to be extinguished kingdom of hawaii king stanley and herself genda and herself all of those at once that last was gendas guess he said we all do the best we can his answer was as ambiguous as her question she spotted the bottle on the chest of drawers two lithe strides took her to it she yanked out the cork swigged and made a horrible face god thats nasty she said coughing and then drank again genda took a pull too it was every bit as bad as cynthia said it was but the only thing worse than rotgut liquor was no liquor at all you have courage not to try to get away he said her laugh was all razors and barbed wire where would i go how would i get there wherever it is somebody would know my face your propaganda people made sure of that im on postage stamps for crying out loud and pretty soon ill be on postoffice walls too seeing that that meant nothing to genda she explained thats where we put posters of wanted criminals he kissed her again you are not a criminal to me but you are wanted paying compliments in english wasnt easy for him he hoped that one came out right it must have because she turned red but she sounded no happier as she answered yeah and that only makes me a bigger villain to the usa like being queen of hawaii wasnt bad enough i fell for a japanese officer they wont know whether to shoot me or hang me she was probably right no she was bound to be right if the americans came back they would have debts to pay he wished he could offer to take her to japan she deserved to escape such a fate he didnt think the two of them would last long as a couple once she got back to the home islands king stanley would have to come too gendas liaison with a roundeyed woman would draw much more notice and much more censorious notice in japan than it did in this easygoing place the king and queen of hawaii would undoubtedly go on being used for propaganda purposes brave heads of a government in exile genda could see it all now what he couldnt see was how to get queen cynthiayes and king stanleyaway from oahu if hed known how to do that he might have had some notion of how to get away himself but no japanese planes had been seen in these parts since the american fleets fighters and bombers smashed the fleet and then the landbased aircraft an hk flying boat might be able to sneak into pearl harbor but the odds were long as the americans had shown by their landing at the kapiolani park pow camp they controlled the sea and air all around oahu and their grip tightened by the day genda didnt think japan could scrape together enough carriers and other ships to challenge this armada even if she abandoned the rest of the warwhich she couldnt very well do everything admiral yamamoto had said about what the united states could do if roused was coming true from honolulu though tokyo was more than kilometers away even now hawaii shielded japan maybe a submarine could sneak in and out none had come in though genda didnt know if any had tried which would be worse knowing some had failed or knowing his superiors far to the west hadnt dared risk any one more question he hadnt asked himself when things go wrong japanese people often kill themselves dont they by the way queen cynthia asked the question she knew the answer yes we do that minoru genda nodded he didnt go into details about seppuku women werent expected to disembowel themselves anyway only to slit their throats after the nod he shook his head trying to shove such unpleasant unwelcome thoughts aside it wasnt the first time hed had them he said too soon to worry about such things much too soon he sipped from the bottle on the dresser if he drank enough of that he wouldnt worry about anything for a while cynthia also drank but her voice was completely sober too soon to worry about it yes much too soon i dont think so since genda didnt really think it was much too soon either he didnt try to argue with her he asked how is his majesty he didnt think this would happen when he let you put the crown on his head she answered genda already knew that she went on its funny hes at least hapahaole himself but he really is angry with haoles for what theyve done to hawaiians thats genuine a lot of him is bluff and bluster and bullshitmaybe she felt the almostgin after allbut thats for real she looked down at her ring and flushed again well he isnt angry at all the haoles no one could becan be could be angry at you genda said thats sweet youre sweet now cynthia laanui kissed him a long time ago someone had told him that the person who started a kiss was the one who needed it more by the desperate way cynthia clung to him that held a lot of truth when they separated she said you dont know me very well you cant know me very well if you tell me something like that dont get me wrongi like it but i know its silly too i dont think so genda was sure she was right but he didnt care right now they had nothing left but each other and they might not have each other long either he gathered himself picked her up and carried her to the bed he was a small man two or three centimeters shorter than she was but he was strong their lovemaking had always had the sweetness of stolen fruit now every time they touched they knew it might be the last the way things were these days each joining might be the last thing they ever did for him and evidently for her too that only made the flame burn hotter afterwards a pink flush mottling the pale skin between her breasts she said i wish i had a cigarette with the air of a successful stage magician genda pulled a pack of chesterfields from a trouser pocket here he said cynthia squealed and kissed him my god my god my god she said where on earth did you get these where to hear her talk the tobacco drought might have been worldwide not confined to hawaii genda made a small ceremony of lighting one for her and one for himself a friend gave them to me he said and let it go at that the friend had got them from another friend whod got them from a dead us marine that might be more than cynthia wanted to hear she coughed when she first inhaled genda had done the same thing theyd gone without tobacco so long it was as if theyd never smoked at all but the second puff made her smile jesus thats good she said and then after a momentary pause can i have a few to take back to stanley im sorry i know its greedy but if i give him cigarettes he wont wonder why i went out okay genda said the slang made cynthia smile genda didnt begrudge her five chesterfields very much he knew she was right if she gave the king those hed think shed left iolani palace to get her hands on them that shed got them from her lover wouldnt cross his mindor genda hoped it wouldnt she smoked her cigarette down to the tiniest of butts then stared sorrowfully at the scrap of tobacco that remained i feel like chewing this like a hillbilly she said although genda knew about snuff chewing tobacco had never caught on in japan the idea made him queasyor maybe it was just the chesterfield the queen of hawaii got out of bed and started dressing id better go back now she said as she had on the way from the palace to hotel street she tucked her hair up under her hat and put on the sunglasses we will do everything we can genda said cynthia laanui nodded and after theyd done that neither one wanted to dwell on what might happen then she nodded one more time then walked the bicycle out the door without a backward glance genda waited five minutes before he dressed so they wouldnt be seen leaving together he wrestled his own bicycle down the stairs and started back to pearl harbor he hadnt gone far before he realized the great naval center was under attack planes roared above it fighters strafing and dive bombers stooping on targets to drop their bombs japanese antiaircraft gunsand some captured from the americans at the surrenderfilled the sky with puffs of black smoke naval guns were also firing on pearl harbor from ranges beyond the reach of shorebased artillery genda wished japan hadnt had to wreck the great coastdefense guns the usa had installed along the southern coast of oahu they would have taught those ships respect but they could have harmed the japanese navy and so aichi dive bombers with armorpiercing bombs had blown up the casements in which they lurked were those landing craft in the water whatever they were they looked a lot more sophisticated than the daihatsu barges on which japan relied genda pedaled harder hed had permission to leave his station but he wanted to be there to defend the harbor as long as he could as if one man will make any difference now he thought bitterly but his legs pumped up and down all the same the bunker hill was a going concern again flight deck repaired incinerated planes shoved into the drink new hellcats and dauntlesses taken aboard joe crosetti missed the fighter that had gone up in flames but the new one would do the job just fine he missed the men lost when that jap crashed his zero into the carrier far more you couldnt replace men the way you could airplanes not far away the copahee was still under repair the escort carrier had taken a bomb from that same jap the guy was a son of a bitch yeah but hed done a hell of a piece of work there sailors on the baby flattop took off their caps and waved to joe as he and his buddies from the bunker hill flew over them bound for oahu he waggled his wings to return the compliment by rights the sailors could have been pissed off how had that jap got through in spite of radar and the combat air patrol overhead joe feared he knew the answer the americans had got overconfident and fallen asleep at the switch the blip on the radar coming in alone so what it was bound to be another american plane wasnt it well no and the guys flying cap had been slow getting a handle on it too the carriers fell away behind him so did the destroyers and cruisers screening them he came up on the warships bombarding oahu their guns thundered below him flame and smoke belched from the muzzles the ships heeled in the water at the recoil some dugin japs would be catching hell fewer bombardment ships remained north of oahu a good many had steamed around the island to pummel pearl harbor joe and his fellow fliers were on their way there too hed shot up the harbor before plenty of times things were different today marines and dogfaces were landing they were going to take the base away from the japs just about all the japanese soldiers were at the front what kind of fight could sailors and other odds and sods put up well fix em goddammit joe said a second front here would do almost as much good as the second front in europe stalin kept shouting for catch the enemy between hammer and anvil and smash him flat yeah joe muttered yeah one thing the japs had already made very plainthey had no quit in them all the antiaircraft guns that hadnt been knocked out were banging away like nobodys business flying past a near miss was like driving a car over a hole in the road you went down and then you went up again sometimes hard enough for your teeth to click together but you didnt pick up shrapnel from a hole in the road unless somebodyd stuck a land mine down there something clanged against the new hellcats fuselage joe automatically checked the gauges everything looked good these babies could take it hit a zero or an oscar with a good burst ofcaliber bullets and itd break up in midair the army fighter the americans called the tony was a tougher bird but nowhere near as tough as a hellcat orders were to shoot up anything japanese at pearl that might shoot back joe went in at not much above treetop height machine guns blazing he wondered if the place was worth taking away from the nips two campaigns inside of two years had turned it into a pretty fair approximation of hell on earth the water had a greasy sheen he was so low the odor of spilled fuel oil got into the canopy wrecked american and japanese ships lay side by side brothers in death before the war started nobody except a few aviationminded cranks had really believed airplanes could sink capital ships all by themselves i believe oh lord i believe joe sounded like a holy roller preacher how many hundred thousand tons of twisted steel lay below him the last two times the us and japanese fleets clashed neither sides ships had set eyes on the others planes did all the dirty work once upon a time ford island there in the middle of pearl harbor had been a tropical paradise all palm trees and bougainvillea and frangipani nothing green was left now just dirt and char marks and the wreckage of buildingsand antiaircraft guns among the wreckage joe squeezed the firing button on top of the stick his sixs hammered away the recoil made the hellcat jerk in the air japs scrambled for cover he might have been playing pinball except those were real people down there real people i hope i kill he thought out at the edge of the harbor landing craft were coming ashore some of the aa guns were firing at them instead of at the airplanes overhead that wasnt so good a threeinch gun could do horrible things to a boat that was meant to be equally awkward by land and sea joe strafed a gun from behind he didnt think its crew heard him coming whatcaliber slugs did to human flesh was even worse than what antiaircraft guns did to landing craft some of the ugly boxy boats came right up the channel wrecks blocked bigger ships from getting in but the landing craft scraped past them joe wagged his wings in salute as he shot at a japanese machinegun nest a hellcat trailing smoke plunged into the water of the west loch joe looked around he didnt see a parachute maybe the poor bastard inside the plane was lucky not to get out he would have come down in the middle of a big swarm of japs with a pisspoor chance of getting away what they would have done to him before they let him die compared to that going straight into the drink looked pretty good joe made pass after pass firing short bursts so he wouldnt overheat his guns and burn out the barrels finally his ammo ran dry he still had plenty of fuel but so what unless he wanted to imitate that jap and see how big a fire he could start it didnt do him much good here it would take him home though he flew back over oahu toward the bunker hill the japs shot at him several more times and missed every one hitting a fastmoving airplane wasnt easy frustrated gunners on both sides could testify to that a few more puffs of black smoke around him and then he was out over the pacific he hoped none of the american ships would fire on him if one did they all would and they threw up a lot of shells and bullets they might not get him anyway but why take chances he ran the gauntlet a cap fighter came over to have a look at him but it pulled away when the pilot recognized he was in a hellcat it waggled its wings as it went he returned the courtesy as always landing on the bunker hill meant turning off his own will and doing exactly what the landing officer told him to fighter pilots were a willful breed he hated surrendering control to somebody else but the easiest of the many ways to kill yourself on carrier duty was to think you knew better than the landing officer however little joe liked it he believed it at the officers signal he shoved the stick forward and dove for the deck jesus he said as he slammed home his tailhook caught the second arrester wire the hellcat jerked to a stop flightcrew men came running up as joe opened the canopy and got out howd it go mr crosetti one of them called piece of cake joe answered i need ammo then i can go back and give em some more were going to take pearl harbor back from those bastardsyou better believe we are the sailors cheered well have you back in the air in nothin flat sir an armorer said dont you worry about a thing not me joe said thats for the guys with lots of gold braid as an ensign he outranked all the ratings around him he was an officer of course but he felt he was barely an officer just about all the others on the ship were entitled to give him orders that was a worry for another day now all he wanted to do was hit the japs another lick what would end up happening to pearl harbor once the americans took it backwas also a worry for another day and not for the likes of him fighting was getting close to honolulu now the roar of battle from pearl harbor never went away no matter how much jiro takahashi wished it would hed made a bet not long after the japanese conquered hawaii hed bet they were the winning side for a while that bet looked pretty good it didnt any more he wished his sons would give him a harder time about it he deserved a hard time for his foolishness but they treated him sympathetically as if he were an old rake coming back to earth after a spree with a young floozy who took him for everything but the gold in his teeth shigata ga nai father hiroshi said when the americans come back we just have to try to keep you out of trouble if we can they cant get him for treason kenzo spoke as if jiro werent in the tent in the botanical garden hes not a us citizen he was just helping his own country no matter how dumb he was he didnt say that he didnt need to say it everything that had happened since the americans came back shouted it for him do you think theyll care hiroshi asked to them hell be a jap who helped the other japs the hateful key word was in english his older son went on theyll probably deal with all the people like that so wed better have some good reasons why they shouldnt dont worry about me boys jiro said consul kita told me he would take care of me if he could and im sure he meant it they both stared at him big deal kenzo said kita cant even help himself now let alone anybody else thats the truth hiroshi agreed all just talk and nonsense well i hope not jiro said the consulate is still up and running up and standing still you mean kenzo said it hasnt got anywhere to run to the americans are in pearl harbor father theyll be here in honolulu any day now what can kita do jiro shrugged he got to his feet i dont know maybe i ought to go and see neh you ought to leave that place alone father kenzo said havent you got in enough trouble because you went there if america wins you will be happy jiro said all rightbe happy i wouldnt be happy even if i never went on the radio america is not my country it has never been my country i came here to make some money not to live and you made more than you ever would have in japan hiroshi said so what jiro shrugged again so what i say i have lived for all these years in a land that does not like me does not want me and does not speak my language if you want to go on being japshe brought out the english word too and laced it with contemptin america fine not for me not if i can help it he pushed past hiroshi and kenzo and out of the tent his sons didnt try to stop him if they had they would have got a surprise they were taller and younger than he was but he was meaner i raised them soft he thought most of the time that pleased him they didnt need to be as hard as he had but they didnt have that toughness to fall back on either the air stank of smoke of burning it wasnt so bad as it had been when all the fuel at pearl harbor burned then honolulu wore a shroud for weeks till the fires finally burned themselves out still it left his lungs as raw as if he were smoking three cigarettes at the same time he smiled wryly he couldnt remember the last time hed smoked one cigarette let alone three up nuuanu avenue he went the guards at the japanese consulate waved to him konichiwa fisherman they called you havent got any goodies for us today please excuse me no jiro answered with so many american ships operating south of oahu now they probably would have sunk the oshima maru if he dared put to sea in her is kitasan in yesfor now a guard said another one sent him a reproving look as if he might have said too much but no one stopped jiro from walking up the stairs and into the consulate when he got inside the smell of smoke was thicker he needed only a moment to see why secretaries were busy tearing up papers and burning them that sobered him if the staff at the consulate didnt think honolulu could hold the game really was coming to an end one of the secretaries looked up from ripping reports into strips for all jiro knew they were reports about him if they were better they should go into the fire oh hello takahashisan the secretary said the honorable consul will be glad to see you he was just talking about you in fact maybe those reports really were about jiro then thank you he said and went on into nagao kitas office do whatever you can to buy time we need it kita was saying into the telephone when jiro walked in the consul waved and gestured to a chair when he finished talking he hung up good to see you takahashisan he said things are his little wave was more expressive than words could be i see you are getting rid of your papers jiro said cant be helped kita said better not to let the americans find out some of the things we did here better not to let the americans find us here either ah so desuka jiro said is there some way the americans wont find you here despite kitas halfpromise of a little while before he did not presume to include himself among the number who might not be found here when he talked with an important personage like the consul he still felt very much like a hornyhanded fisherman nagao kita smiled there is some way yes how would you like to stay here till tonight and come to honolulu harbor with me if we are lucky a submarine will surface and take some of the people who matter to us back to japan and you really would take me jiro hardly dared believe his ears i am a man who matters enough to go back to japan he wondered what the home islands would be like hed been away so long a lot had changed here in hawaii since he came japan was bound to be different too the consuls smile grew wider almost filling his broad face i would take you i am glad to take you takahashisan your broadcasts served your country and served your emperor well and we have two spaces on the submarine we were not sure we would the king and queen of hawaii have decided to stay here and face whatever happens they are brave jiro thought they were also foolish then full understanding of what the consul had told him sank in i will get a place on this submarine that would have gone to the king or queen of hawaii i will his voice rose to a startled squeak it hadnt broken like that since he was nineteen years old but it did now dont worry about it kita said easily even if they had decided to go we would have found a place for you one way or another jiro bowed in his seat domo arigato kitasan you could put me in a torpedo tube i wouldnt care oh you might if they had to shoot you at an american cruiser kita had a good laugh the kind that invited everyone who heard it to laugh along it made even a silly joke funnier than it would have been otherwise i would like to go back and say goodbye to my sons jiro said slowly takahashisan if you were going on the submarine alone i would tell you to go and do this kita answered weve never talked much about your sons and one reason we havent is that i know they think of themselves as americans not japanese i dont hold that against you how could i when it is true of so many of the younger generation here i dont know that they would raise the alarm for all i know they probably wouldnt but please excuse me i would rather not take the chance jiro bowed his head i understand thank you kita said i do not want to make things more awkward than they have to be after that jiro had nothing to do but wait he leafed through magazines from japan everyone in them seemed happy and cheerful and prosperous all the news was good they talked about beating the americans again and again in their pages the united states seemed a clumsy stupid giant not worth taking seriously off in the distancebut not far enough off in the distanceartillery and bombs thundered every so often an american plane would roar over honolulu the usa made a more serious foe than the propaganda magazines cared to admit darkness fell the staff at the consulate went right on burning papers jiro felt useless he didnt know enough to help but they wouldnt want to take him back to the home islands if he were useless would they he dozed in his chair nagao kita shook him awake its time takahashisan the consulthe departing consulsaid hai jiro yawned and stretched im ready was he he was more ready to leave honolulu if he could than to face the returning americans he supposed that made him ready enough the streets of honolulu were dark and empty but far from quiet off to the west the battle for pearl harbor still raged by all the signs fighting was getting closer to the city if that submarine didnt come in now it would never have another chance jiro could plainly see that the japanese occupation was finished he sighed he wished things had turned out different even if he wasnt here to hear it hiroshi and kenzo would be saying i told you so barricades and roadblocks slowed the journey down to the harbor the special naval landing forces who manned them were alert even jumpy but consul kita talked his way past them every time other little parties made their way to the harbor too some of them were japanese others hawaiians and even haoles whod gone along with the new regime they had a good notion of what they could expect when american rule returned but the king and queen were staying behind yes they were brave did they have any common sense he stared out past sand island which helped protect the approaches to honolulus harbor the americans hadnt landed there yet they probably hadnt thought they needed to a japanese garrison still held the place if us troops had taken the island the sub would have had a much harder time getting inand getting out again afterwards off to the west tracersamerican red and orange and japanese bluemade a fireworks display against the night they shed enough light to let jiro see everyone else looked as worried as he felt one of the japanese a bureaucrat in a civilian suit said where is the submarine not five minutes later like a broaching whale but ever so much bigger it surfaced by the pier a hatch came open at the top of the conning tower a moment later several people exclaimed in disgust jiro didnt but he came close the air that wafted out of the hatch was as foul as any hed ever smelled and fishermen knew everything there was to know about stinks too many people too close together for too long foul heads and sour food all went into the mix so did the stink of oil and several other things he couldnt name right away he wondered how the sailors stood it then decided they had to be so used to it they didnt even notice it any more an officer popped out of the hatch is everyone here he called we cant wait for stragglers not if we want to get out in one piece the king and queen of hawaii are not coming consul kita said they have refused our invitations its their funeral the officer said jiro thought that was likely true the officer climbed out of the hatch sailors followed him and laid a gangplank from the pier to the subs iron hull the couple of dozen escapees came aboard a sailor guided them to the ladder up to the conning tower another ladder led down into the dark smelly bowels of the submarine as people started down that ladder the officer took their names nagao kita vouched for jiro oh yes the officer nodded when we were surfaced i would pick up his broadcasts myself good man arigato jiro said shyly do itashimashite the officer answered after the last person came aboard he asked where is commander genda hes supposed to be here too when no one answered the man muttered zakennayo the order for his recall comes from admiral yamamoto no less well were not going to wait no matter what only dim orange lamps lit up the inside of the submarine pipes and wires ran overhead even short men like jiro had to duck all the time machinery was everywhereabove below and to either side whatever space existed for people seemed an afterthought the hatch clanged shut the officer dogged it he came down the internal ladder his shoes clattering he gave a series of crisp orders the sub backed away from the pier and then went under air bubbling out of the buoyancy tanks and water sloshing in slowlyjiro gradually realized everything underwater happened slowlyit turned and started out the channel by which it had entered the harbor he sighed with mingled pleasure and disappointment on the way home at last minoru genda had never imagined he would disobey an order from admiral yamamoto he looked to the commanderinchief of the combined fleet as an example a mentor a friend yet the japanese submarine had presumably come and presumably gone assorted dignitaries were presumably aboard the boat he remained somewhere between honolulu and pearl harbor doing everything he could to hold back the advancing americans cynthia laanui had nothing to do with it so genda told himself and believed he told himself the truth the queen of hawaii made a wonderful diversion he liked her more as a person than hed thought he would too but none of that was reason enough to throw away his naval career hawaii was this invasion had been gendas idea from the beginning hed proposed to yamamoto the notion of following up the air strike with ground troops only with hawaii under the rising sun hed said could it serve as japans shield rather than americas outstretched arm hed persuaded yamamoto yamamoto had persuaded the armya harder job since the conquest of malaya and the dutch east indies and their vital resources had to move more slowly but yamamoto made the generals believe japan had a better chance of keeping her conquests if she held hawaii for close to two years hawaii had done what it was supposed to do with a japanese garrison here the usa had to fight the pacific war from its own west coast its reach wasnt long enough to do japan much harm from there now though now hawaii was falling back into us hands genda was no fool but no blind optimist either he knew the signs of defeat when he saw them and he saw them now the fall of pearl harbor was perhaps the next to last nail in the coffin and if he took credit for the victory of how could he not shoulder blame for the defeat of to duck it would make him into a liar and he refused to lie to himself he intended to atone in his own person for his plans failure he thought yamamoto would understand he had an arisaka some soldier or naval landing force man would never need again he wished he had a uniform that gave better camouflage than his navy whites by now the whites had so many dirt and grass stains they hid him better than they had a couple of days earlier he wasnt the only man in whites to form a part of the japanese skirmish line that made him feel better he wasnt the only officer determined to make the yankees pay for everything they got the enemy skirmish line was a couple of hundred meters away the americans werent pushing forward right this minute every so often they would fire a few rifle shots or a burst from a machine gun or a browning automatic rifle to discourage the japanese from attacking the men on gendas side would do the same genda didnt think his countrymen could attack they were a motley mix of army and navy men an army captain seemed to be in local command genda outranked him but didnt try to throw his weight around the army officer sounded capable while he himself knew as much about infantry combat as he did about paris fashions he was learning fast though as for the americans by all the signs they were waiting till they built up overwhelming force then they would hit the japanese line somewhere and pour through the defenders would have the choice of dying where they stood or falling back to try to stop the enemy somewhere else genda had already seen the yankees do that once they didnt take many chances if hed enjoyed all their materiel he wouldnt have taken many chances either a senior private squatted in the foxhole along with genda he was filthy and weary but managed a smile of sorts when he noticed gendas eye on him hard work sir he said wryly hai genda nodded in a mess like this he worried less about rank than he would have otherwise he said you look like youve done your share of hard work and then some could be sir the soldier answered i started up at the north coastand here i am that was something unusual most japanese soldiers whod met the americans on the invasion beaches were dead genda knew the army preferred dying in place to retreating keeping his voice carefully neutral he said you must have seen a lot of fighting how did that happen senior private ah my name is furusawa sir the soldier showed no reluctance to give it he didnt seem to feel hed done anything wrong and he explained why i found all my superiors killed around me that left me free to use my own judgment i thought i would be more use to the emperor killing as many americans as i could than throwing my life away to no good purpose by the way he eyed genda anyone who presumed to disagree with him would be sorry but genda didnt disagree and have you done that he asked sir i have the soldier answered his riflean american springfieldhad plainly seen a lot of use but it was clean and in good condition seeing gendas glance toward the weapon furusawa went on my units barracks in honolulu were bombed and we lost our arisakas how do you like the american piece genda asked its a little heavy sir but not too bad furusawa said and it fires a largercaliber round than an arisaka so its got more stopping power i do like that like the rest of what senior private furusawa had to say that was more clearly reasoned than genda would have looked for from a lowly enlisted man and while furusawas accent said he came from somewhere in the southdown by hiroshima perhapshe also sounded better educated than the farmers and fishermen who made up a large part of the population there why are you only a senior private genda asked by which he meant why do you talk the way you do why do you think the way you do the younger man understood what he didnt say which showed furusawa did think that way with a crooked smile he replied well sir for one thing i was a pretty new conscript when we came here and there werent a lot of promotions after that and my father is a druggist that sort of made me a white crow to a lot of the country boys in my regiment he echoed gendas thought there and continued complaining wouldnt have done me much good and keeping me down made some sense too because the others might not have followed me the way they would have with someone else genda wondered if he himself could have spoken so dispassionately about being passed over for a promotion he obviously deserved he doubted it what do you think will happen now he asked that depends sir youd know better than i dohas the navy got enough ships and planes to beat the americans and drive them away no genda spoke without hesitation senior private furusawa shrugged he didnt seem very surprised well in that case well just have to give it our best shot wont we he shrugged again karma neh he could speak indirectly at least as well as genda what he meant was were all going to die here and we cant do a damn thing about it genda thought about that but not for long he didnt need long he sighed nodded and said hai yasuo furusawa knew he ought to get away from commander genda the naval officer knew hed fallen back from the north instead of senselessly charging and throwing his life away that made genda dangerous to him as the japanese were driven back into honolulu if the officer wanted to make an example of someone he had a nice juicy target and sticking around genda endangered furusawa in another way too the navy man was a greenhorn at infantry combat his white uniform only made things worse he drew bullets as well as he could have without painting a target on his chest and bullets meant for him could all too easily find someone nearby instead but furusawa stayed by him before long he found himself gendas unofficial aide and orderly genda he thought was the smartest man hed ever met and the officer didnt seem to think he was a baka yaro himself that made furusawa proud right now pride was about all any japanese had left he shook his head japanese soldiers or most of them had a contempt for death the americans couldnt begin to match oh the yankees were brave enough hed seen that in the first invasion and he saw it again now but he could not imagine an american rushing out against a tank with a flaming bottle of gasoline and smashing it down on the cooling louvers above the engine the japanese who did that must have known he couldnt get back to cover alive and he didnt the americans shot him before he made even three steps but their snorting mechanical monster went up in flames and the japanese picked off the crewmen bailing out without the tank the enemy attack bogged down could i do that furusawa wondered his long retreat from the north left him with doubts about himself and about his courage he didnt think he was afraid to die if his death meant something the death of that soldier with the molotov cocktail certainly had hed cost the americans a tank and five men that was one side of the coin the other side was losing that tank and those five men wouldnt cost the usa the battle honolulu would fall hawaii would go back under the stars and stripes nobody but a blind man could believe anything else well in that case why dont we throw down our rifles and throw up our hands and surrender but furusawa shook his head no less than any other japanese he believed surrender the ultimate disgrace and he didnt want to spread his own disgrace and shame to his family back in the home islands besides some of the men in charge of honolulu might have been blind if they didnt think they could throw the americans back you wouldnt know it to listen to them the garrison commander was a navy captainin army ranks he counted as a colonelnamed iwabuchi we can do it he shouted to anyone who would listen we will do it the white men have no stomach for blood well before long we will drown them in an ocean of it furusawa remembered him drilling his special naval landing forces before the americans landed hed been just as fanatical then hed sounded like a screaming madman as a matter of fact and he still did but he did more than just scream furusawa wouldnt have wanted to attack honolulu artillery hid inside buildings here machine guns had elaborately interlocking fields of fire if you took out one nest you exposed yourself to fire from two or three others the only thing captain iwabuchi hadnt worried about in honolulu was its civilians if they starved if they got shot if they got blown to pieceswell so what and if a fighting man wanted a woman for a little fun before he went back to his foxholeagain so what you knew what kind of screams those were when you heard them they sounded different from the ones that came from wounded people they held horror as well as pain commander genda clucked in distress this is not a good way to fight a war he said sir this is what the army did in nanking too furusawa said i hadnt been conscripted yet but the veterans in my regiment would talk about it sometimes most of them had sounded pleased with themselves too he didnt tell genda that but american propaganda will have a field day the navy man said the greater east asia coprosperity sphere is supposed to protect asia from western imperialism now who will protect asia from japanese imperialism he put his life in furusawas hands when he said something like that if the senior private blabbed to someone like iwabuchi well one more time so what genda would die a little sooner than he might otherwise and perhaps a little more painfully given the perversity of war though neither of those was certain none of the japanese defenders was likely to get out of this any which way the americans probed with infantry they got a bloody nose and pulled back captain iwabuchi was jubilant they cant stand up to us he shouted if they come again well smash them again commander genda sounded less gleeful they arent done he said to furusawa theyre putting a rock in their fist thats all a rock sir the senior private didnt follow him for a moment youll see genda answered about fifteen minutes later furusawa did american artillery started pounding the japanese frontline positions furusawa had never imagined so many guns all going off at once his own forces were not so lavishly provided with cannon huddling in a ball to make as small a target as he could he felt as if the end of the world had come when the barrage lifted the americans surged forward again furusawa was too dazed to shoot for a little while but japanese machine guns opened up on the yankees again he was amazed hed lived through the shelling and even more amazed anyone else had the automaticweapons fire drove the americans back again in front of his foxhole but they broke through farther north what do we do sir he asked commander genda if we stay here theyll outflank us and cut us off hai genda answered any army officer would have ordered a fight to the death where they were furusawa was as sure of that as he was of his own name after a moments thought genda said we fall back it doesnt look like we can do much more where we are does it not to me sir furusawa said in surprise to his even greater surprise genda smiled at him well you know more about it than i do they fell back passing the wreckage of a machinegun nest that hadnt survived the barrage furusawa wondered if the army would have done better with people like genda in charge he feared hed never know why this is hell nor am i out of it kenzo takahashi remembered the line from an english lit class it sounded like shakespeare but he didnt think it was who then he couldnt remember miss simpson wouldnt have approved of that at all if miss simpson was still alive though she was just as busy trying not to get blown up as kenzo was he and hiroshi didnt know where their father was hed headed for the japanese consulate and hed never come back hiroshi and kenzo both went looking for him and neither one had any luck kenzo even went to the consulate himself the guards let him in when he told them whose son he was but nobody inside would tell him anything nobody of very high rank seemed to be there he wondered where the consul and the chancellor and the other big shots were wherever it was would they have taken dad with them kenzo had trouble believing it when the big american push started shells crashed into the refugee camp where he and his brother and their father had stayed since their apartmentand kenzo and hiroshis motherburned in the japanese attack on honolulu japanese positions were nearby so kenzo could see why the americans struck seeing why did nothing to ease the horror he and hiroshi got out unhurt that would do for a miracle till god decide to dole out a bigger one somewhere else hed seen bad things when the japanese took honolulu he hadnt seen the worst because the americans chose to surrender rather than let the worst happen to the civilians in the city the japanese didnt care about civilians they would fight as long as they had cartridges and with bayonets after that and whether the americans wanted to bring hell down on the civilians of honolulu or not what else were they going to do to get rid of the japanese soldiers among them kenzo and hiroshi stayed flat on their bellies all through the artillery barrage theyd learned that much in the earlier round of fighting it didnt always help but it was their best hope shrapnel tore through their tent and the ropes that held it up it fell down on them which frightened kenzo worse than he was alreadysomething he wouldnt have thought possible through the roars and crashes of exploding shells he heard screams some abruptly cut off when the shelling eased he struggled free of the heavy canvas the only words that came out of his mouth were oh jesus christsomething his missing father might have said he could smell blood in the air there lay a man gutted like an ahiand there a few feet away lay most of his head wounded men and women were worse than dead ones they writhed and shrieked and moaned and bled and bled and bled kenzo bent to use a length of rope torn apart by shell fragments as a tourniquet for a woman whod lost a big chunk of meat out of her leg below the knee he hoped it would do her some good he was in the middle of that when someone shouted in japanese come on give me a hand yes you when he looked up a soldier was leading hiroshi away the soldier had a stretcher and needed kenzos brother to help him carry wounded no doubt they would deal with soldiers first civilians later if at all oh jesus christ kenzo said again he couldnt stop them from grabbing his brother not unless he wanted to get killed himself and probably get hiroshi killed with him the other trouble was they were both too likely to get killed anyway more american shells screamed in some on the japanese positions some on the luckless refugee camp more screams rose many of them screams of despair kenzo hugged the ground next to the injured woman and hoped none of the fragments would bite him he had no idea what else to do when the barrage eased he asked the woman how are you she didnt answer he took a look at her a chunk of shrapnel had clipped off the top of her head her brains spilled out onto the dirt kenzo threw up then he spat again and again trying to get the horrible taste out of his mouth and then he staggered to his feet and stumbled away any place in the world had to be safer than where he was at first his flight was blind before long though it had purpose he headed for elsie sundbergs house if anything happened to her if anything happened to her he didnt think he wanted to go on living hed been through a lot just then and he was only twenty years old getting to her house in eastern honolulu was a nightmare in itself he had to pass several checkpoints manned by special naval landing forces and they would just as soon have shot civilians as looked at them that was no exaggeration bodies lay in the street blood pooled around them some of the womens skirts and dresses were hiked up kenzo bit his lip the occupiers hadnt killed them right away had he tried sneaking by he was sure they would have put a bullet in him instead he came up to each barricade and roadblock openly calling im the fishermans son im looking for my father he hated using his fathers collaboration in any way but it got him by and one of the men at a sandbagged machinegun nest said didnt he get out on the submarine the other night what submarine kenzo askedthis was the first hed heard of it there was one the landingforces man said kenzo couldnt very well argue with him because he didnt know there hadnt been one the fellow went on i dont know whether your old man was on it or not though they dont tell guys like me stuff like that he gestured go ahead buddy i hope you find him i always did like listening to him thank you kenzo said wishing he hadnt heard that quite so often from japanese military men he could have done without the compliment would his father have got on a submarineone probably bound for japan muttering unhappily kenzo nodded to himself his father would be able to see the jig was up here and he must have been afraid of what the americans would do to him when they came back he likely had reason too even if he was a japanese citizen collaborators would catch it kenzo talked his way past another couple of japanese strongpoints the special naval landing forces and the soldiers they had with them seemed determined to hold on to honolulu as long as they were still breathing and still had ammo god help the city kenzo thought not that god seemed to have paid much attention to honolulu since december the fresh shell crater in the sundbergs front lawn made kenzo gulp one of the windows had only a few shards of glass in it there was a fistsized hole in the front door nobody answered when he knocked he started to panic but then quelled the alarm thudding through him theyd built a hideyhole under the house he tried the door it swung open he carefully closed it behind him wanting things to look as normal as they could then he went to the closet that held the entrance to the foxhole sure enough the rug over the trap door was askew if elsie and her family were down there they had to be panicking hearing footsteps over their heads kenzo squatted down and rapped out shave and a haircutfive cents on the trap door he didnt think any japanese soldier would do that when he tried to lift the trap though he found it was latched from below that was smart he rapped again calling you okay elsie could she hear him through the floor he called again a little louder something slid underneath himthe latch he got off the trap door so it could go up it did about an inch elsies voice floated out of the opening that you ken yeah he said almost giddy with relief you okay we are now she answered you gave us quite a turn there sorry he said i figured i would but it was too late by then how about you elsie asked the americans shelled the camp he said bleakly there are machinegun nests not far away so theyll probably do it some more hank and i are okay so far the japanese dragooned him into being a stretcherbearer but he was all right last i saw him what about your father elsie knew where his worries lived all right i think hes on his way to japan right now kenzo replied and if he is that may be the best thing for all of us elsies mother spoke up if theyre shelling the camp you wont have anywhere to stay come down here with us are you sure he asked damn straight were sure that gruff male voice belonged to mr sundberg whom he hadnt met so often we owe you plenty ken maybe we can pay back a little come onmake it snappy kenzo lifted the trap door high enough to get through it then closed it over his own head it was dark and gloomy under the house and smelled of damp dirt thered been more digging since he last saw the shelter elsie squeezed his hand we just went down here yesterday she said weve got water weve got some food we can last till its overi hope and weve got a honey bucket over there in the corner at the end of that trench mr sundberg chuckled hoarsely all the comforts of home kenzos nose had already noted the honey bucket it was better than nothing the whole setup was a lot better than staying out in the open thanks he said that didnt go far enough he tried again thanks for looking at me and not seeing a jap elsie squeezed his hand again her mother said well sort that all out later lets see if we can live through this first he couldnt remember the last time hed heard such good advice replacements came up to fill the ranks of captain braxton bradfords company les dillon looked at the new men joining his platoon with something less than delight they were plainly just off the boat they must have landed in the north hopped on a truck to get down hereand now theyd go into the meat grinder they were clean they were cleanshaven their uniforms werent filthy and werent out at the knees and elbows the way the veterans looked and smelled and acted seemed to dismay them they might have been in the company of so many wolves any of you guys ever seen combat before les knew the answer would be no even before the new fish shook their heads he sighed sheer ignorance was going to get a lot of them shot in the next few days he couldnt tell them that straight out what he said instead was try and stick close to somebody who knows what the fuck hes doing shoot first and ask questions later the japs have had time to get ready for us and they dont give up weve got to make the damn bastards pay for what theyve done to hotel street hotel street sergeant a replacement asked les rolled his eyes the kid didnt even know wearily dillon said best damn place in the world to get drunk and get laid that give you the picture the young marine nodded he looked eagergungho people were calling it these days gungho was great if it kept you going forward if you didnt pay enough attention to where you were going though yall listen up hear me that was captain bradford a southern drawl often seemed to be the marine corps second language the company commander went on we are gonna go on through those houses and apartments in front of us and we arent gonna stop till we get to the rubble past em where the japs bombed honolulu a year and a half ago well set up a perimeter on the edge of that zone and wait for the artillery and armor to soften up the way ahead questions men nobody said anything les figured the new guys would keep going if they got half a chance marines were like that grabbing as much as they could as fast as they could the army was more methodical dogfaces said the marine way caused more casualties les thought there might be more at first but not in the long run you new men keep your eyes open hear bradford added damn japs are better at camouflage than yall ever reckoned anybody could be fuckersll hide in a mailbox or under a doormat everybody watches out everybody helps everybody else right right sir the marines chorused les caught dutch wenzels eye the other platoon sergeant gave back a fractional nod the replacements wouldnt know what to look for some of them would get educated in a hurry othersprobably morewouldnt stay in one piece long enough to have the chance some of those houses and apartments and little shops up ahead were as innocent as they looked some held jap riflemen or machinegun positions japanese mortar crews would be waiting in the alleys and on the roofs les knew the marines could clear them out what the cost would be that was the question a couple of bullets snapped past les was on the deck before he knew hed thrown himself flat it was just harassing fire but it was from an arisaka he didnt believe in taking chances some of the new guys gave funny looks to him and the other marines whod flattened out he didnt care his mama hadnt raised him to take chances he didnt have to machine guns mortars and some s opened up on the buildings ahead hellcats strafed them by the time the barrage let up they were smoking wreckage les wondered how anybody could tell them from the rubble farther east he shrugged hed worry about that later if at all boy those jap bastards must be dead meat now a recruit said happily les laughed not that it was funny yeah and then you wake up he said theyre waiting for us you see one you think is dead put a bullet in him hes liable to be playing possum waiting to shoot you in the back the replacement looked disbelieving les had neither time nor inclination to knock sense into his empty head captain bradford yelled forward and forward he went as usual he ran hunched over making himself the smallest possible target he dodged like a halfback faking past tacklers and the first piece of cover he sawgoddamn if it wasnt a bathtub blown from lord knows wherehe dove behind sure as hell the shelling and strafing hadnt killed all the japs it hadnt even made enough of them keep their heads down arisakas and springfields and nambu machine guns opened up knee mortars started dropping their nasty little bombs among the americans so did bigger mortars farther back les hated mortars not only because the bombs could fall right into foxholes but also and especially because you couldnt hear them coming one second nothing the next your buddy was hamburgeror maybe you were wounded men started screaming for medics the navy corpsmen who went in with marines didnt wear red cross smocks and armbands or red crosses on their helmets the japs used them for target practice when they did the medics carried carbinessometimes riflestoo in france in the germans mostly played by the rules as far as les could see there were no rules here this was a very nasty war he snapped off a shot or two then ran forward again several marines were shooting at a groundfloor window from which machinegun fire was coming les dillon put a couple of rounds in there too to give the japs inside something to think about two marines crawled close enough to chuck grenades through the window the machine gun promptly squeezed off a defiant burst more grenades flew in this time the enemy gun stayed quiet les ran for a doorway dutch wenzel ran for one a couple of houses farther on he stopped halfway there yelped and said aw shit his rifle fell to the pavement what happened dutch les called got one right through the hand the other noncom answered hurts like a son of a bitch i never got shot before welcome to the club les wouldnt have joined if he had any choice but an injury like wenzels sounds like you got a milliondollar wound you did your bit it wont kill you itll probably heal good and youre out of the fight for a while yeah i already thought of that wenzel said but you know what id sooner stay here with the rest of you guys i feel like im getting thrown out of the game just after we went and scored six runs in the eighth stay there till we push forward some more les said then you can get to the rear without worrying a snipers gonna get you without worrying so much he thought yes granny dear wenzel said les laughed like him the other platoon sergeant was more used to giving orders than taking them then the laughter died in his throat because the door he was standing in front of opened had the jap behind it been a soldier les would have died in the next instant instead he was a skinny eightyearold kid in ragged shorts watcha doin mister he asked jesus les exploded i almost shot you you dumb little he broke off when he saw how skinny the kid was fumbling through the pouches on his belt he found a kration can here this is chopped ham i think bet you like it a hell of a lot bettern i do the kids eyes got big as gumdrops wow he breathed as if les had just given him the hope diamond thanks mister he disappeared yelling mom mom guess what i got you almost got acaliber round in the teeth thats what les heart still thuttered all kinds of bad things happened during a war even so how could you make yourself forget you shot a little kid les knew he had lots of things to worry about but that thank god wasnt one of them no more taking a sailboard out from waikiki beach the japs had put down barbed wire and machinegun nests and mines years after they were gone some damnfool tourist would probably blow his foot off on one everybody missed till he found it the hard way oscar van der kirk wasnt especially worried about some imaginary tourist he just didnt want to blow off his own foot crossing waikiki beach he did want to live long enough to have the chance to cross it again because of the fish hed brought home oahus hunger hadnt pinched him and susie as much as it had most people now they had to do without and it hurt and they had charlie kaapu with them so it hurt even more the only way to get food now was to go out and work the only work was helping the japs build more roadblocks and barricades and pillboxes to hold back the us marines and army oscar thought it was a lot of work for precious little rice charlie started going out with him after a few days oscar wondered if he was strong enough to do the hauling and lifting but he took them in stride no huhu he said when he and oscar didnt happen to be close to any japs up in the goddamn tunnel i did twice this much on a quarter the food everybody did remembering what hed looked like when he came out of the kalihi valley oscar believed him he did ask how theyd kill you if you didnt charlie answered that whole setup was made to kill people either the work would do you in or the guards would i hope our guys gutshoot every one of those bastards they deserve it he was normally an easygoing fellow not here not now he meant every word of it but he knew how to bow and smile at the japanese riflemen and machine gunners when he got anywhere near them oscar knew how to do that too but charlied had the advanced course oscar could satisfy the japs charlie could make them smile back and even laugh sometimes he would cuss them in friendly tones while he smiled he took his life in his hands every time he did it some of the japs had picked up bits and pieces of english oscar kept trying to warn him and charlie would say yeah oscar sure oscar and hed go right on doing it it was as if he had to take his revenge on them no matter what it cost him off to the west the battle for honolulu ground on the americans had the artillery they had the tanks they had the airplanes they even brought navy ships off the south coast of oahu to blast the city with big guns all the japs had were the rubble and their weapons and their stubborn courage those were plenty to make the american reconquest a long slow bloody job i hope they all die charlie said with a big grin on his face i hope they all die slow and i hope they hurt all the time while theyre doing it yes you too sergeantsan he added to a japanese noncom who walked by after fiddling with the sight on a machine gun hearing only the title of respect the sergeant grinned and returned charlies bow ohhh charlie oscar said right oscar charlie said and oscar shut up so far waikiki had been only at the edges of the fight a few overs from the us bombardment of the rest of honolulu came down there the big raid on the pow camp in kapiolani park had been just east of the main part of waikiki oscar began to hope his district would come through without much damage artillery didnt shatter that hope planes from one of the carriers somewhere out in the pacific did in the abstract oscar didnt suppose he could blame the pilots they wanted to soften up the japs so that when the american foot sloggers finally ground this far east they wouldnt have to work so hard oscar had got used to the roar of planes overhead hed even got used to the deeper tones of the new us aircraft they made japanese aircraft sound like flying sewing machines but the sound of dive bombers falling out of the sky straight toward him was new and altogether terrifying the japs reacted before he could some of them dove for cover others either manned their machine guns and blazed away at the dive bombers or fired their rifles at them oscar could admire that kind of bravery without wanting to imitate it get down you damn fool charlie kaapu yelled at him as the first bomb screamed down huh oscar said brilliantly looking back he had to admit it wasnt his finest hour charlie used the handle of his shovel to knock oscars legs out from under him before oscar could even squawk the bomb hit blast sucked the air out of his lungs had the bomb burst a little closer it would have torn them to pieces from the inside out so he drowned in his own blood chunks of casing screeched through the air some of them not nearly far enough over his head and that bomb was only the first of eight or ten somebody in the bible had wrestled with god and prevailed oscar felt as if he were wrestling with god and getting the crap slammed out of him he got bounced and slapped around and ended up all bruised and battered he stopped complaining even to himself when he fetched up against the japanese sergeants head the mans body was nowhere in sight oscar almost lost his meager breakfast the work he and charlie and the rest of the japs forced laborers had done was smashed to hell and gone so were a lot of japanese soldiers and special naval landing force troops and luckless locals dragooned into working for them and the dive bombers were only the opening act of the show as soon as they roared away fighters swooped low and started spraying the landscape with bullets oscar watched a jap hit by a burst literally get cut in half the worst part was the mans top half didnt die right away even though blood spilled from itand from the rest of himlike water from a hose he yammered something in his own language tried to lever himself upright and even looked around for the rifle hed dropped only after most of a dreadful minute did the expression drain from his face he slumped over again finally seeming to realize he was dead jesus oscar turned away clapping a hand to his mouth hed already seen a lot of things he never wanted to see again that one though that one topped the list charlie kaapu watched the jap with a face that might have been carved from the basalt underlying the islands serves him right he said but oscar didnt have time for any more than that another fighter roared in its machine guns winking fire he folded himself into the smallest ball he could and prayed he didnt get chewed up the way the jap had charlie kaapu lay on the ground beside him also doing his best to imitate a sowbug bursts of fire from japanese machinegun nests answered the hail of lead from the sky the japs had nerve even if oscar thought they were short on brains then one of the american planes slammed into the ground and went up in a highoctane fireball the japs yelled like men possessed oscar had a hard time blaming them too theyd just proved they could hit back both at the start of the japanese invasion of hawaii and now at the end of their tenure here his own countrymen came closer to killing him than the japs ever had he waited for those fighters to come back and shoot up some more japanese positionspositions he hoped a little farther away from him shit joe crosetti exclaimed when another hellcat crashed and exploded in flames in waikiki he knew that could happen to him too he hated being reminded somebody wasnt going home to his mom and dad and brothers and sistersmaybe to his wife and kid some clerk in the war departmentsome bastard thousands of miles away from the fighting and snug as a bug in a rugwould have to send out a deeply regrets telegram and some familys life would turn upside down as joes thumb found the firing button and he raked the japs below withcaliber slugs he never once thought that they had moms and dads and brothers and sisters and maybe wives and kids too they were just the enemy to him they werent people the way the guys on his own side were and they were still doing their goddamnedest to kill him their pale coldlooking tracers spat from machine guns down on the ground and probed for his fighter trying to knock him out of the sky like that poor luckless son of a bitch whod just bought the farm something clanged into the hellcat as always joe quickly scanned the instruments everything looked okay the engine kept running he reached out and patted the side of the cockpit attababy he told the plane they werent just whistling dixie when they said a hellcat could take it down on the ground the japs were sure taking it more fires than the one from that other planes funeral pyre were rising from waikiki see how you like it you bastards joe thought he hoped there werent too many civilians down there if there were it was their tough luck they were almost as abstract to him as the enemy he wished the japs would just throw in the sponge the way some lousy pugs handlers would after joe louis beat the snot out of their pride and joy sometimes though a pug stayed in there and went toetotoe with the champ till he got koed if the japs wanted to do that against the usa by god theyd get carried out of the ring too yeah theyd landed a sucker punch at the start of the fight but you only got one of those and when you were up against the heavyweight champion of the world one wasnt enough joe sprayed waikiki with bullets as big as his thumb till his guns ran dry then he got on the radio to his squadron leader going home for more ammo roger that the other pilot answered well keep em busy while youre otherwise occupied admiral out joe said with a snort admiral he still aspired to a lieutenant jgs stripe and a half on his sleeve a few more tracers came up at him as he flew north japanese holdouts still doing their damnedest to make trouble they still held a few pockets in central oahu where theyd been encircled and bypassed sooner or later soldiers and navy fliers would clean out those pockets it wasnt as if the japs could retreat to the jungle here and fight a long guerrilla war oahu had plenty of jungles the only trouble from what joes briefings said was that youd starve if you tried playing tarzan in them five minutes after he left waikiki behind he was out over the ocean again unless you flew over oahu you didnt realize what a small island it was he waggled his wings as he flew past the destroyers and cruisers and battleships still firing from the north some of them had come around the island to hit targets near pearl harbor and honolulu none of the ships shot at him none of them had shot at that crazy jap who crashed his zero into the bunker hill either bastard had extracted a high price for his worthless neck too hed hurt that baby flattop along with the big fleet carrier combat air patrol came by to give joe a looksee they hadnt done it soon enough with that jap joe of course was harmless at least to us ships he and the cap planes exchanged more wing waggles and some raunchy banter over the radio then he flew on toward his carrier he still didnt like carrier landings he didnt know a single pilot who did he suspected there was no such animal like them or not he did exactly what the nice gentleman with the wigwag flags told him to do it worked the landing officer didnt wave him off when the flags dropped so did joes hellcat his teeth clicked together as the wheels hit the flight deck the tailhook caught the fighter jerked to a stop joe shoved back the canopy and scrambled out of the cockpit he ran for the island as soon as his feet hit the deck planking the faster you got away from the plane the better off you were the briefings had that one right as if joe needed the reminder the jap suicide pilot drove home that lesson over waikiki crosetti the briefing officer said when joe reported yes sir the other officera regular and an older mansmiled not the way you expected to get there i bet sir till the war started i never figured id get there at all joe answered well since you did suppose you tell me what you saw the briefing officer said aye aye sir joe said and he did at breakfast one morning on the hospital ship fletch armitage realized he was making progress breakfast like most breakfasts on the benevolence was scrambled powdered eggs fried spam and hash browns nothing was wrong with the hash browns they had crunch over greasy softness and you could pour on the salt till they tasted just the way they were supposed to the powdered eggs and spam on the other hand up till that morning fletch had shoveled them into his face with reckless abandon like a man coming back from the ragged edge of starvation he damn well was a man coming back from the ragged edge of starvation and he wanted to claw back from that edge just as fast as he could he made a pig of himself at lunch and dinner and snacks in between times too some of the rescued pows had eaten themselves right into stomach trouble the only trouble fletch had was gaining weight back fast enough to suit him this particular morning he took a big gulp of coffee with plenty of cream well condensed milk and sugar and tore into breakfast he ate a mouthful of spam and eggs then paused with the oddest expression on his face you know what he said to the guy next to him in the galley no the other exprisoner said what these eggs and this meattheyre really lousy fletch knew he sounded astonished he had all the food he wanted now hed got to the point where he didnt just want food he wanted good food wanting it on a hospital ship was probably optimistic but even so youre right the other man sounded as astonished as fletch had i didnt even notice up till now neither did i fletch said the guy to his left was just as skinny as he was some of the poor bastards from kapiolani park had actually starved to death before the us navy could throw enough food into them to keep them going fletch hadnt been in that boat but hed been in the one tied up right next to it take your plate sir a filipino mess steward asked fletch nodded good bad or indifferent every scrap of food in front of him had vanished he wondered if he would ever leave anything uneaten again the way he felt now he wouldnt bet on it as the steward also took the other former prisoners plate fletch asked any chance of getting fresh eggs and real ham around here yeah the other former pow said several other scrawny men nodded the filipino beamed at them like a proud mother just after juniors first steps oh my friends he said you feel better i am so happy for you does that mean we dont get the fancy grub asked the guy on fletchs left probably the mess steward answered not beaming so much now two thousand miles from the mainland remember you eat better than other people out here weve earned it fletch said he didnt quite feel as if he were made of pipe cleaners any more hed graduated to pencilsgnarled knotty pencils but pencils all the same he wondered what would come next in his gradual reinflation what came next that day was an examination by one of the doctors on the benevolence fletch got weighed he had his blood pressure taken the sawbones looked pleased youre getting there captain im just a lieutenant fletch said nope the doctor shook his head if you werent a pow you wouldve got the promotion by now and soyou did thanks doc fletch would rather have heard it from somebody besides an md but he wasnt going to complain any which way instead of complaining he asked when can i go ashore when we decide youre strong enough and when it seems safe the doctor answered i know youre feeling betteryou were one of the men bitching about chow this morning werent you thats a good sign but youre not fit for active duty yet and oahus no place for tourists right this minute i understand that fletch said my wifes there thoughif shes still alive anyway he didnt say anything about the divorce that had been in progress it wasnt final when the fighting started jane wouldnt have kept on with it since then would she hed got the doctors attention oh the other man said we are letting men in that situation onto the island it wont happen tomorrow though or the day after youll have some hoops to jump through as far as the paperwork goes let me at em fletch said after what i went through with the japs ill never worry about that kind of crap again youre not the first guy ive heard that from either the doctor said one way or another itll get sorted out in the meantime try to be patientand the breakfasts are still good for you even if they arent the most exciting thing in the world all of that was undoubtedly good advice which didnt make fletch like it one bit better after the japs took wahiawa they set up a community kitchen in the elementary school to share what little there was to eat the us army troops who retook the town kept the kitchen going these days it doled out krations and crations and big tasteless chocolate bars called drations the joke was that if you ate one of those it was in you for the dration jane armitage was not inclined to be fussy about what kind of food she got there was plenty of it the only thing that mattered to her no one moreshe didnt have to give herself to japanese soldiers if she wanted to go on eating to say nothing of breathing no one had thrown her time in the brothel in her faceyet she didnt think any of the other women had had trouble with it either if the japs dragged you in there kept you in there with bars on the windows and screwed you whenever they felt like it you pretty plainly werent collaborating that meant you got to stand in line behind the people who damn well were several women collecting their rations had hair clipped down to stubble to show what they were theyd collaborated with the occupiers on their backs but theyd done it for fun or for advantage not because they had to most of them were local japanesemost but not all one was a tall redhead who had beenmaybe still wasmarried to somebody from fletchs old unit she got her food and sat as far away from everybody else as she could her belly bulged the baby was due any day now jane would have bet anything in the world that it wouldnt have red hair but women whod gone to bed with japanese soldiers were only the small change of collaboration everybody stared when yosh nakayama came into the community kitchen the nursery man stolidly collected his ration tins sat down not far from jane and started to eat hed translated for major hirabayashi and relayed the japanese commandants orders to the rest of wahiawa but hed also done everything he could to get crops in the ground when oahu was hungriest and nobodyd ever claimed hed informed on people jane knew hed done what he could to keep her out of the brothel though shed been too dumb to realize it till too late some wanted to string him up others thought he deserved a medal he went on about his business there in the eye of the storm it wasnt as if he could hop in a plane and fly off to tokyo there had been informers some of them had slipped out of wahiawa before the us army came in jane hoped they were getting the shit bombed out of them in honolulu that would start to give them what they deserved and some had tried to stay and brazen it out again a lot of those were local japanese whod bet on the wrong horse you could understand them even if you despised them but smiling sammy little who had the biggest usedcar dealership in wahiawa was as anglosaxon as george washington and he was in the guardhouse hed rolled over and wagged his tail for the japs they were on top and hed wanted to stay near the top it seemed as simple as that figuring out how many people were dead because of his toadying wasnt so simple jane hoped hed get it in the neck somebody lit a cigarette janes nostrils twitched along with almost all the other smokers on oahu shed had to lose the habit during the japanese occupation the soldiers rations included little packs of cigarettes jane had smoked a few they still made her dizzy and nauseated the way they had when she was just learning how she intended to keep at it till it seemed natural again as soon as she was done eating she went back to her apartment as long as she stayed in there with the door locked things had a harder time getting at her she started to head for the bathroom then checked herself shed taken endless showers they didnt wash away the memory of all the hands that had groped her she didnt know how many times shed douched with salt water that couldnt make her forget all the times shed had to open her legs for the japs and now that she had toothpaste again she also brushed her teeth over and over she remembered how theyd made her get down on her knees even so she was going to remember going to have to deal with all that the rest of her life she was damned if she could see how maybe she was just damned period the japs hadnt cared what they did to her all theyd wanted was a few minutes of fun each if that left her ruined for the rest of her days so what she snorted they hadnt cared about the rest of her days not even a little bit theyd intended to use her use her up and then knock her over the head who was she kidding the only thing that had saved her was the us reinvasion slowly she made herself straighten up and peer into the mirror over the sink she still looked like death warmed over but if she gave in to despair didnt the japs win a battle inside her head it felt that way living well is the best revenge that held a lot of truth she wasnt what she would have been if the japs had left her alone and that was a damn shame but she wasnt a slut or a basket case just because theyd done their goddamnedest to turn her into one and if anybody didnt like it tough shit she muttered shed never liked the way fletch swore maybe now she understood it a little better than she had when they were married she hoped fletch was still alive after what shed seen and after the stories soldiers told about what the japs had done at the pow camp up by opana she knew the odds werent the best she hoped anyhow she might not have wanted to stay married to him she didnt hate him though and hed done what he could for the country and when he found out what the japs had made her do hed probably want to spit in her eye she sighed wishing some of the krations came with a little bottle of bourbon instead of cigarettes somebody in washington should have done something about that she sure as hell needed a drink now and she was sure plenty of servicemen needed one even worse they had to do without and so did she life isnt fair she thought her laugh was as bitter aswhat was that stuff in the bible wormwood that was it theyd used it to flavor absinthe one more kind of booze she couldnt have as if i didnt find out about that the hard way sandbagged machinegun nests and concrete pillboxes sprouted like pimples on the smooth green skin of the lawn around iolani palace trenches zigzagged from one to the next the japanese werent going to give up the kingdom of hawaiis center of government without a fight senior private yasuo furusawa understood that it was at least as much a propaganda point as a military one as long as iolani palace stayed in japanesenominally in hawaiianhands the kingdom japan had reestablished here remained a going concern strong japanese forces also hung on in the gray boring office buildings west of the palace so did the remnants of the royal hawaiian army from what furusawa had heard some of king stanley laanuis hawaiians had fought with fanatical fervor others unfortunately had hardly fought at all commander genda looked northwest the direction from which the us marines were likeliest to come then he looked back over his shoulder toward the palace like honolulu city hall to the east it hadnt been badly damaged as if picking that thought from his informal aides mind genda said the americans want to keep these places in one piece if they can they intend to use them after they finish the reconquest yes sir furusawa nodded hed figured that out for himself hed also realized captain iwabuchi didnt intend to let the americans have anything in honolulu in one piece if he could help it here he could he kept insisting the japanese would throw the americans back commander genda furusawa noted claimed nothing of the sort that also made sense to furusawa however little he liked it the usa held an even more dominant position here than japan had during the first invasion how long do you think weve got sir furusawa asked genda shrugged your guess is as good as mine weve already held out longer than i thought we could the special naval landing forces are dedicated men hai furusawa said that was a diplomatic way of calling them maniacal diehards which would have been just as true the army had orders against retreat its men knew better than to let themselves be captured but the special naval landing forces rushed toward the enemy like lovers going to meet their beloved they hurt the americans and sometimes even threw them back the price they paid though i wish captain iwabuchi would not order charges genda said again thinking along with him they are wasteful especially when we cannot replace our losses better to make the yankees come to us and pay the price would he listen if you told him something like that furusawa asked genda gloomily shook his head he would just call me soft maybe he would be right i dont know anything to speak of about commanding ground troops whats your opinion senior private mine furusawa was flabbergasted he didnt think a superior had ever asked him that before he wished someone would have done it sooner now it probably doesnt matter much one way or the other does it sir the naval officer looked at him in surprise furusawa wondered if he was in trouble then he laughed at himself of course he was in trouble before long all the japanese soldiers and men from the special naval landing forces would be dead how could he land in trouble any worse than that after a moment genda started laughing too well furusawasan youve got the right way of looking at thingsno doubt about it all we can do here is all we can do once weve done it he licked his lips once weve done it theyll start defending the empire a little closer to the home islands thats all furusawa sent him an admiring glance defending the empire closer to home sounded much better than dying to the last man here they both meant the same thing but how you looked at it did count a mortar bomb crashed down not far away furusawa and genda both huddled in the trench you couldnt hear a mortar bomb coming it announced itself by blowing up huddling in a trench wouldnt do you any good if the damn thing came down on top of you either more mortars opened up on the japanese positions in front of iolani palace so did regular us artillery pieces you could hear those shells coming in the louder the scream in the air the closer to you they were some were very close close enough to throw dirt on furusawa theyre coming theyre coming someone shouted furusawa popped up when he heard that he might get killed if he did but the american marines would surely kill him if he waited in the hole he squeezed off a couple of rounds from his springfield the us barrage hadnt knocked out all the japanese strongpoints machine guns spat death at the big men in green uniforms some fell some ducked into doorways or dove behind piles of wreckage some drew back we still have teeth furusawa said proudly even if he had no idea whether hed hit any americans hai commander genda jerked a thumb back over his shoulder smoke rose from the palace a couple of shells had hit it in the end they wont care whether they destroy it a pityits a nice building i hope the people inside are all right he didnt talk about any one person in particular senior private furusawa had a pretty good idea which person in the palace mattered most to him though when furusawa came to hawaii from japan hed never expected to meet a queen there hadnt been any queen here then he couldnt fault gendas taste queen cynthia was a striking woman even if her coppery hair and green eyes made her seem more like some kami than a proper human being an american with one of their automatic rifles started squeezing off short bursts to make the defenders keep their heads down a bullet snapped past furusawas ear he ducked so did commander genda furusawa sighed his superiors romance probably wouldnt have ended well anyhow it surely wouldnt now les dillons first glimpse of iolani palace was almost his last glimpse of anything as he ran up hotel streetnot the good part worse luckand turned right on richards a burst of enemy machinegun fire cut down the marine next to him the man a replacement whose name les had never learned probably died before he finished crumpling to the pavement three slugs in the chest would do that to you les knew he could have caught the burst as easily as the other guy dumb luck one way or the other he dove headlong into a doorway letting the japs have another good shot at him would be stupid not everything that happened in combat was luck not even close if you gave the enemy a target when you didnt have to you almost deserved to get nailed the japs kept shooting as if they thought somebody would outlaw ammunition in an hour and a half to les the long bursts they fired from their machine guns showed poor training if you fired off a whole strip of bullets or a magazines worth from a light machine gun of course most of them would go high the muzzle couldnt help pulling up three four five rounds at a crack was the right way to do it with all those bullets in the air though some had to hit something the poor damned replacement had proved that the hard way calls for corpsmen rang out again and again les admired the navy men who accompanied the marines more than he could say combat wasnt their proper trade but they went anywhere he and his buddies did and they put themselves in harms way every time they rescued a man under enemy fire when corpsmen got liberty along with marines they had a hard time buying themselves drinks mortars and artillery pounded the japanese in front of iolani palace les wouldnt have wanted to be a jap pinned down by superior firepower and with no place to go but hed already seen the slanteyed monkeys had no quit in them maybe that barrage knocked out some of their strongpoints but the ones that survived kept right on shooting dauntlesses roared down out of the sky to bomb the japs the ground shook under les blast slugged him like a sugar ray robinson rightand he wasnt even the target no he wouldnt have wanted to trade places with the emperors samurai marines started dashing across richards toward the palace grounds even after the dive bombers came in the japs had plenty of machine guns waiting for them and snipers in the buildings on this side of the street took a toll too a lieutenant from another company dove into the doorway with les were going to have to clear this whole block he said what you and me lieutenant or no lieutenant les was ready to tell him to piss up a rope if he said yes to that combat was one thing and bad enough all by itself suicide when suicide wouldnt do you or your side any good was something else again as far as les was concerned the japs were welcome to that but the officer whod probably been born about the time when les started going over the top in france shook his head no no no he said ive got some men following me if they dont get chopped up too bad theyll be along okay sir thats business les said the junior officer wasnt asking his men to do anything he wouldnt do himself and hed got here ahead of them les asked how are they fixed for grenades lots the lieutenant said which was the right answer while waiting for the rest of the marines to get there les kicked in the door if japs had lurked right behind it he would have been dead long since he went inside his heart pounding then he had company lots of company it helpedsome clearing that block across the street from the palace grounds was as nasty a job as hed ever been part of the japs as usual wouldnt retreat and wouldnt surrender they had grenades too he would hear them banging the damn things on a helmet or against a wall to start their fuses that would be the signal to duck into an office or back around a corner when you could then to move forward again once the enemy grenades went off it might as well have been trench warfare along with the grenades it came down to handtohand more than once some hawaiians fought alongside the japs instead of being small and tough they were big and tough and no more inclined to surrender than hirohitos boys just my luck les panted after the marines finished a knot of them he had blood on his bayonet and blood on his boots the stink of it filled the air some of these hawaiian fuckers quit as soon as they got the chancebut none of the ones i ever ran into maybe they dont like you sarge a marine said wouldnt be surprised les said the other leatherneck had put a bayonet into the kidneys of the hawaiian hed been fighting so he couldnt complain about undue familiarity got a butt on you im out sure the marine handed him a pack he took one and lit it with a zippo thanks buddy damn i needed that he gratefully sucked in smoke i believe you the other marine said some of the people here theyd rather have cigarettes than food and theyre so goddamn skinny they look like they oughta go into the hospital its a funny business yeah les looked down at the camel between his index and middle fingers a thin curling ribbon of smoke rose from it wonder how come you want em so goddamn bad they dont do that much for younot like booze or anythingbut they sure get their hooks in he shrugged fuck what difference does it make none i can see the other marine answered were gonna have to clean out the stinking palace next wont we boy thatll be fun yeah maybe even more fun than we just had here les took another drag his eyes crossed as he tried to focus on the glowing coal well we knew pretty damn quick this was gonna be a game of last man standing cant be that many japs left heres hoping the other marine said when propaganda and military necessity ran into each other propaganda had to take a back seat minoru genda understood that unfortunately the americans did too they were methodically knocking down iolani palace above his head they might even get propaganda mileage out of thatsomething on the order of we had to destroy this historic building to liberate it before long japan would be in no position to contradict them if not for the basement which had been the preserve of servants and bureaucrats in days gone by the palace would have been uninhabitable as things were genda took refuge there with a few japanese soldiershis unofficial runner senior private furusawa among themand with king stanley owana laanui and queen cynthia king stanley was holding up better than genda would have expected he was holding up better than a lot of the soldiers in fact he gave genda a crooked smile and said well this didnt work out the way we expected did it please excuse me your majesty but it did not genda said karma neh we did the best we could i know im not mad stanley laanui laughed i oughta be huh what do you mean genda asked cautiously if the king of hawaii knew about his affair with the queen genda almost laughed too what difference did it make now no matter how you sliced it none of them was going to live much longer a couple of mm shells slammed into the palace to underscore that something up above genda fell over with a crashone of the castiron columns supporting the second story but king stanley said if youd picked somebody else to put a crown on hed be in the hot seat now and id be off somewhere else thinking better you than me you poor sorry bastard you were a good king cynthia laanui said you are a good king she set a hand on his arm genda had to work to keep his face impassive she might have had fun with himshe had had fun with himbut she did love her husband or if she didnt she wouldnt show it now not when everything was falling apart no offense to you sweetheart but i always did want to give the usa one right in the eye stanley laanui said i was just a little kid when that damn dole and the rest of those pirates hijacked the kingdom but i always figured i owed em one so i tried to pay em backand now theyre paying me back up above something else came down hard enough to make the floor over their heads shake whatever it was it had almost come through the floor a machine gun mounted at the edge of the dry moat began to chatter if the us marines wanted iolani palace they would have to pay the price for it they did want it and they were paying all over now king stanley said all over he had a us army in a holster on his belta brute of a pistol that would knock over a horse let alone a man he took it out and looked at it better to go this way than to let those shitheads catch me and hang me no japanese could have put it better yes cynthia said softly she eyed the pistol with a strange fascinationhalf longing half dread they wouldnt let us go on living for very long and theyd have fun with us before they did hang us or shoot us we did what we did and it didnt quite workyoure rightand now its time to close the door stanley laanui glanced over to genda shall i give you one between the eyes before i finish cyndi and me he inquired the way things were he might have asked the question anyhow but the words held a certain bitter edge he does know genda thought his gaze flicked to cynthia she must have realized the same thing for she couldnt hide her surprise and alarm genda decided not to show he understood everything king stanley meant bowing he said no thank you your majesty i will not live through defeat either i promise you but we have our own way of ending harakiri the king asked genda made himself not wince as he nodded seppuku was a much more elegant much less earthy way to put it king stanley grimaced better you than me buddy i want to get it over with in a hurry it will be fast enough genda answered he turned to senior private furusawa and spoke in japanese will you please serve as my second things here cannot go on much longer as if to underscore that the machine gun at the edge of the moat started hammering away again i would be honored commandersan furusawa said i will do it quickly so you do not suffer domo arigato genda said and then went back to english it is arranged okay stanley laanui said his mouth twisted when the machine gun abruptly fell silent you ready sweetheart i dont know queen cynthias voice shook i dont know if anybody can be ready but youd better not wait she nodded to genda goodbye commander we tried our best hai sayonara genda looked down at the floor the hawaiian royal couple went into a little room off the central hallway a shot rang out and then a moment later another one genda opened the door if either of them needed finishing he would take care of it but stanley owana laanui while he might not have made much of a king had done what he had to do here he and his redheaded queen both lay dead each with a neat gunshot wound to the templeand a nasty exit wound on the other side sayonara genda whispered again and went back outside he nodded to senior private furusawa the time has come he said and sat crosslegged on the floor baring his belly he drew his navyissue katana from its sheath hed never used it before he should have had a wakizashi a samurais shortsword but he would have to make do as the blade touches you sir furusawa asked let it go in first genda said then he looked up to the ceiling with this my death i atone for my failure here may the emperor forgive me may my spirit find its home in yasukuni shrine he drove the sword home the pain was astonishing unbelievable discipline forgotten he opened his mouth to scream then everything ended what was left of the top two floors of iolani palace belonged to the usa again japs and hawaiians sprawled everywhere in bloodsoaked unlovely death so did too goddamn many marines japs and maybe hawaiians too were still holed up in the basement every so often they would fire up through the floor above them that was a nasty angle when a bullet hit two marines one in les dillons platoon had had their balls shot off the japs had driven back three attacks on the basement from outside now the americans were trying something different marine engineers were setting up a shaped charge on the ground floor of the palace it would blow a big hole in the basements roof with luck that would let leathernecks get down there and go toetotoe with the enemy luck les thought some fucking luck the japs down there would die so would a lot of marines he was too likely to be one of them another bullet crashed up through the floor by luck that really was good that one missed everybody getting shot at from below was still goddamn scary several marines fired a round or two down through the floor at the japs they couldnt see then they all went somewhere else in a hurry so the slanteyed sons of bitches wouldnt nail them by shooting back where the bullets had gone through their boots clumping around overhead probably gave the enemy a hint about where they were anyway through all the chaos the engineers went on working one of them looked up at les and said okay were about ready to blow this bastard hear that people les called to the other marines get your grenades ready well see how many of those fuckers we can blow to hell and gone before we go down there ourselves another engineer lit a fuse the marines drew back after a sharp surprisingly small whump the charge blew a hole about four feet square in the floor along with his buddies les chucked grenades through the hole as fast as he could some fragments came back up they bit one man in the hand the marines kept on tossing grenades into the basement they didnt want live japs anywhere near that hole les didnt see how anybody could live through what the enemy was getting but the japs had surprised him before come on he said and let himself drop through the hole he was down there by himself for only a heartbeat more leathernecks dropped down with him he saw a few twisted bodies close by then a bullet cracked past his head sure as hell some of hirohitos warriors still had fight in them a marine with a tommy gun sprayed death as if from a garden hose after that it was the usual chaos of a firefight made worse because it was at such close quarters les was too busy to be afraid and too afraid to be anything else he charged forward yelling like a banshee and at least one of the fierce roars that burst from his throat started life as a terrified shriek even if he knew that with luck the japs wouldnt hell theyve gotta be as scared as i am went through his mind in one of the brief moments when he wasnt shooting or throwing a grenade into one of the rooms off the central hallway or using his bayonet hed already used it more here in hawaii than he ever did in the trenches in if the japanese soldiers he faced were afraid they sure didnt show it les wasnt showing it either but he knew what was going on inside his own head to him the japs might have been targets on the firing range except they had the nasty habit of fighting back he fired and stabbed and used his rifle butt once or twice he got a cut on one forearm but it was hardly more than a scratch if he wanted more oak leaves for his purple heart he supposed he could get them but he didnt much care the purple heart wasnt a medal anybody in his right mind wanted to win more and more marines jumped down into the basement they went forward faster than they could get killed or wounded before too long no more enemy soldiers were still standing the americans went through the basement methodically finishing off wounded japs save a couple for prisoners les called the brass wants to grill em he got grumbles from the men down there with him after what those mothers did to our guys they ought to grill em over a slow fire one of them said save a couple les repeated maybe what we squeeze out of em will save enough of our guys while were cleaning out the last of em to make it worthwhile maybe the marine didnt sound convinced but he didnt shoot the unconscious jap at his feet either the enemy soldier showed no gunshot wounds but he was out cold les wondered if hed got the jap with his rifle butt or if one of the other leathernecks had done it he shrugged that didnt make much difference the fighting right here was over he could enjoy the breatherfor a little while can you hear me a voice asked in japanese yasuo furusawa forced his eyes open his head hurt worse than after the worst hangover hed ever had hai he whispered so he wouldnt have to hear himself the man looking down at him was japanese but wore civilian clothes they were in a tent that was canvas behind the other man furusawa tried to take stock but didnt have much luck what happened he asked at last you were in iolani palace do you remember the other man said hai senior private furusawa repeated again as if from very far away he remembered finishing commander genda genda had died as a samurai should and he remembered a hole blown in the ceiling and us marines jumping down into the palace basement roaring like tigers he remembered trying to fight off a big one and that was the last thing hedid remember that meant zakennayo he exclaimed am i he couldnt make himself say the words the other man nodded yes you are a prisoner of war you were taken while unconscious it is not your fault you did not surrender that helpedabout as much as bailing with a bucket helped keep a battleship afloat a prisoner furusawa said in despair the knowledge hurt almost as much as his head which said a lot furusawa squeezed his eyes shut as shame washed over him my family is disgraced forever your family doesnt know the other man said by his oldfashioned accentand by how thin he washe had to be a local japanese working with the americans no one will tell them till the war is over you can sort it out then meanwhile arent you glad youre alive no furusawa shook his head which also hurt what what will they do to me you could do anything to a prisoner anything at all as if picking that thought from his mind the local japanese said america follows the geneva convention no one will torture you for the fun of it or anything like that you will be questioned but it will only be questions do you understand i hear you furusawa said wearily he heard gunfire too not close enough to be alarming but not that far away either were still fighting yes but its mopping up now the other man said honolulu will fall oahu will fall the war will go west furusawa wished he could call a local japanese a liar he knew he couldnt hed been sure oahu would fall since his own countrymen couldnt keep the americans off the northern beaches hawaii would no longer be the empires eastern shield now the usa could use the islands against japan shigata ga nai he thought he certainly couldnt do anything about it are you hungry are you thirsty the other man asked hai furusawa sat up on the edge of the cot where theyd put him ill get you food the local japanese said there are guards outside dont try to leave it would be the last thing you did furusawa hadnt thought of leaving he barely had the strength to sit the local japanese went out he spoke in english someone answered him in the same language he hadnt been lying then furusawa hadnt thought so the other man came back in a few minutes with us ration tins and a cup of coffee furusawa ate greedily he felt a little more alive when he finished you were in the palace basement neh the local japanese said furusawa nodded and didnt wish he was dead right afterwards the other manwho was furusawa slowly realized an interrogatorwent on do you know what happened to the man and woman who called themselves king and queen of hawaii hai why not answer what difference did it make now what difference did anything make now this felt more like a strange life after death than anything else he shot her then he shot himself they didnt want to be captured either well i can believe that the local man said they would have had a hard time of it he paused to look at a notebook questions he wanted to ask do you know who the navy officer who committed seppuku was commander genda with a certain mournful pride furusawa added i had the honor to act as his second lucky you the interrogators tone proved him more american than japanese i thought so furusawa paused and winced it felt as if someone were trying to drive a blunt spike through his skull please excuse me my head hurts i believe that they say youre lucky it didnt get broken for good the local japanese answered this is luck furusawa thought the local japanese held out two white tablets here are some aspirins they may help a little poison furusawa wandered but as a druggists son he recognized aspirins when he saw and smelled them he swallowed them with a last little swig of coffee arigato he said maybe the interrogator meant it maybe the americans were easier on prisoners than his own people would have beenwere he could hope anyhow and hope was all he could do hed fought as long and as hard as he could but now for him the war was over kenzo takahashi wondered if hed been smart to make sure his girlfriend was all right for the first few days in the shelter under the sundbergs house things had been pretty quiet he and elsie and her folks could go up and use the bathroom they could come out at night during lulls and get avocados out of the trees in the back yard they could even sleep in beds if they wanted to though that was risky you could get caught when the shooting picked up again now though the fighting had moved east too much of it was right in this neighborhood the japanese special naval landing forces didnt yield ground till they had to by the pounding us forces were giving them they would have to before long in the meanwhile though in the meanwhile what had been a quiet prosperous residential street turned into a good approximation of hell shells burst all the time machine guns stuttered and chattered rifles barked planes flew low overhead strafing anything japanese that movedand anything that moved that might be japanese coming out would have been suicidal kenzo had long since lost track of how many bullets tore through the house above them mrs sundberg cried softly everything we worked so long and hard to build and get she choked out not everything her husband said were still here things are justthings hed always struck kenzo as a sensible man what do we do if the house catches fire elsie asked get out as best we can and pray mr sundberg answered bleakly thats the one big worry ive got there were smaller ones mr sundberg had dug that narrow trench to a latrine pit people used it when they couldnt go up above it wasnt pleasant or anything close to pleasant hed stowed bottles of water down below but not a whole lot of food everybody got hungry and cranky kenzo also felt very much the odd man out elsies folks were polite about ithe didnt think hed ever seen them less than polite but they and elsie made a group he wasnt fully part of her father joked about it if you can put up with her here ken youll never have to worry about it again i think youre right kenzo answered he and elsie slept huddled together so did her parents they had no room for anything less intimate mr and mrs sundberg didnt say boo they had to know hed really slept with elsie but they didnt let on and then the firing got worse kenzo hadnt thought it could japanese soldiers were right outside they shouted back and forth to one another trying to set up a defensive line they sounded excited and frightened but still full of fight maybe one of them smelled the stink from the latrine pit he came over and shouted whos in there elsie and her folks couldnt understand the words but the tone made them gasp with fright kenzo was scared almost out of his wits tooalmost but not quite trying to sound as gruff as he could he barked this is a holdout position get lost you baka yaro or youll give it away oh so sorry the soldier clumped off elsie started to ask something kenzo held a finger to his lips even in the gloom under the house she saw it and nodded when kenzo didnt hear any japanese soldiers close by he explained in a low voice i think you saved all of us this time ken she whispered and put her arms around him and kissed him right there in front of her parents he was grinning like a fool when he came up for air maybe he wasnt such an outsider after all thanks ken ralph sundberg said i dont suppose you want a kiss from me but im glad you and elsie like each other ill go on being glad when we get out of here too okay mr sundberg kenzo answered he couldnt have asked to hear anything better than that if the older man really meant it he hoped he got the chance to find out a couple of hours later something a lot bigger and heavier than a machinegun round smashed into the house above them the shooting rose to a peak then slowly ebbed kenzo heard fresh shouts some of them were the cries of the wounded which could have come from any throat others though were unmistakably english my god mrs sundberg whispered were saved not yet kenzo said and he was right the fighting went on for the rest of the day as evening turned gloom into blackness he heard a marine outside say lieutenant i think theres japs under this house im gonna feed the fuckers a grenade no were americans kenzo and the sundbergs yelled the same thing at the same time getting killed by their own side would have been the crowning indignity startled silence outside then okay come out under the front steps come slow and easy and stick your hands in the air when youre out one by one they obeyed scrambling out of the hole was awkward kenzo helped haul elsie out it wasnt quite so dark as hed expected when he returned to the world outside the little shelter four marines immediately pointed rifles and tommy guns at him you guys are americans one of them said to the sundbergs what about thisjaplookin fellow in the presence of two women he left it at that hes as american as we are mrs sundberg said he saved all our lives when you were pushing the japanese back through here mr sundberg added looking back at the wreckage of his house that must have been a tank round through it the hole in the front wall was big enough to throw a dog through shaking his head he went on weve known him for years i vouch for him one hundred percent elsie squeezed kenzos hand i love him she said simply which made his jaw drop it made all the marines jaws drop too the one whod spoken before frowned at kenzo what have you got to say for yourself buddy im glad to be alive im twice as glad to see you guys he answered in his most ordinary english i hope i can find my brother andhe hesitated my father sooner or later they would find out who his father was that might not be so good can you men spare any food mr sundberg asked we got mighty hungry under there ration cans of hash and peaches made kenzo forget all about what might happen later onexcept when he looked at elsie then he saw the bright side of the future the other hed worry about it when and if it came by the sound of things the end of the world wasnt half a mile away from oscar van der kirks apartment and getting closer all the time the mad anguished fury of war seemed all the more incongruous played out in waikiki which would do for the earthly paradise till a better one came along japs cant last much longer charlie kaapu said looking on the bright side of things all over but the shouting some shouting oscar said he pronounced it wrong susie higgins said he meant shooting maybe i did charlie said never can tell plenty of shouting and shooting was going on to any reasonable man charlie was right and more than right when he said things were almost over the japs werehad to beon their last legs theyd been driven out of honolulu waikiki was about the last bit of oahu they still held logic said that surrounded and outgunned they couldnt hold it long logic also said they should give up whatever logic said the japs werent listening to it they fought from machinegun nests and rooftops and doorways and holes in the ground they fought with a singleminded determination that said they believed holding on to one more block for one more hour was as good as throwing the americans into the pacific it seemed crazy to oscar but nobody on either side gave a damn about his opinion i want to go out there and stab some of those little monkeys charlie said what i owe them he carried a little more weight than he had when he came out of the kalihi valleya little but not a lot you couldnt put on a lot of weight in hawaii these days no matter how you tried dont be dumb oscar said the army and the marines are giving you your revenge and the us taxpayer is footing the bill susie added how can you beat a deal like that how its personal thats how charlie growled as if to tell him nobody gave a damn about personal reasons a bullet came in through the open window cracked past the three of them and punched a hole in the far wall the wall already had several all oscar and charlie and susie could do was huddle here and hope they didnt get shot or blown up oscar looked from charlie to susie and back again as far as he knew they hadnt fooled around on him he was a little surprisedsusie had a mind of her own and charlie was a born tomcatand more than a little glad hed been looking for answers sometimes negative ones were better than positive another bullet came in through the wall this one tore a hole in the couch susie yelped so did oscar the us taxpayer was liable to be footing the bill for wiping him off the face of the earth hey he said what susie and charlie said at the same time not you oscar told his buddy he turned back to susie if we get out of this in one piece you want to marry me she didnt hesitate she rarely did sure she said its not like we havent been through a little bit together is it not hardly oscar said charlie whistled the wedding march loudly and way off tune oscar made as if to throw something at him he and charlie both laughed susie astonished him by starting to cry if the war hadnt started she would have gone back to pittsburgh after her little fling oscar probably would have forgotten her by now the way hed forgotten a lot of girls you never could tell how things would work out joe crosetti shot up waikiki the japs down there stubbornly kept shooting back it wouldnt matter much longer though enemy troops were running around the hotels by waikiki beach and on the beach itself taking positions to try to defend against the landing craft coming in from the pacific ive watched three invasions now joe thought how many people can say that naval guns pounded the expensive beachfront property a long round smashed an apartment house to smithereens a few blocks inland joe would have thought nothing could survive the assault from the sea and the sky he would have been wrong hed thought that before and hed been wrong every time as soon as the landing craft came into range the japanese raked them with machinegun fire a field gun in the royal hawaiian hotel pumped rounds at the ugly boats struggling toward the beach joe saw splashed from near misses and then a boat caught fire turned turtle and sank all in the wink of an eye you bastards joe exclaimed he swung his hellcat out over the oceanand one of the landing craft opened up on him with itscaliber machine gun mistaking him for a zero you bastards he said again this time on an entirely different note fortunately the sailor with the itchy trigger finger couldnt shoot worth a damn and joe spotted what hed been looking for the muzzle flash from the field gun theyd put it right inside the wreckage of that big pink pile he dove on it his finger stabbed the firing button six tongues of flame flickered in front of the hellcats wings as always the fighter staggered in the air all at once the engine had to fight the recoil from half a dozen guns banging away like sons of bitches joe controlled the plane through the rough part with a touch honed by practice gforce shoved him down hard into his seat as he came out of the dive the bastard of it was he couldnt see what the hell hed done or even if hed done anything every ten seconds took him another mile from the royal hawaiian clang a bullet slammed into the hellcat fuck joe exclaimed yeah the japs were still doing everything they couldor maybe that was an american bullet running around loose either way it was doing its best to kill him either way its best didnt seem good enough way to go babe joe murmured affectionately and patted the seat the way he would have patted a reliable horses neck he made one more pass over waikiki by the time he finished that one only two of his guns still held ammo time to head for home he flew back toward the bunker hill theyd gas him up the armorers would reload the guns and then hed be off again it was almost like commuting to work you could get killed in a traffic smashup too you could yeah but the jerk in the other car was just a jerk he wasnt trying to kill you on purpose the enemy damn well was it made a difference joe was amazed at what a difference it made twenty minutes later his teeth slammed together as the hellcat jounced home at least he didnt bite his tongue every once in a while youd see a guy get out of his plane with blood dripping down his chin joe ran across the flight deck and down to the wardroom to debrief things had become routine or pretty close but the powers that be still wanted as many details as pilots could give did you radio the position of that field gun so a dive bomber could pay it a visit the debriefing officer asked uh sorry sir but no joe thumped his forehead with the heel of his hand christ i really am an idiot well you did have other things on your mind the debriefing officer said generously speaking of which you need to see commander mccaskill in his office right awayon the double he said i do joe yelped was he in trouble for not making that radio call he didnt think he ought to be in enough trouble for the bunker hills commander of air operations to ream him out in person what for sir hed better be the one to tell you that the debriefing officer answered apprehensively joe went up to the carriers island he found the door to commander mccaskills office open mccaskill a craggy grayhaired man in his early forties looked up from his desk ensign crosetti reporting sir joe said fighting not to show the nerves he felt come in crosetti the air operations commander said ive got something for you joe couldnt read anything in his voice or on his face he would have madeprobably did makea formidable poker player sir joe approached as reluctantly as a kid about to get a swat from the principal mccaskill reached into a desk drawer and pulled out two small boxes he shoved them at joe here these are yours now joe opened them one held two silver bars the other two thin strips of gold cloth mccaskills face had more room for a smile than joe would have guessed congratulations lieutenant crosetti he said my god i made jg joe blurted it almost came out holy shit now that would have been something he wondered if anybody ever had said something like that he wouldnt have been surprised still smiling the older man nodded you earned it son youve done well i wish orson hadnt bought the farm joe said suddenly sobered he wouldve got these way before i did oh commander mccaskill also sobered after a moments thought he said i dont think youll find anyone on this ship without absent friends now joe nodded that was bound to be true mccaskill went on if it makes you feel any better mr sharp did win his promotionposthumously maybe a little sir joe knew he had to be polite yelling not fucking much would have landed him in the brig he wondered how much consolation that promotion was for sharps folks back in salt lake they would sooner have had their son back joe would sooner have had his buddy back absent friends he muttered and then this is a nasty business it is indeed commander mccaskill said but i will tell you the only thing worse than fighting a war fighting a war and losing it were here to make sure the usa doesnt do that joe nodded again not happily but with great determination oscar van der kirk crouched in the rubble of what had been his apartment building he had one arm around susie and the other around charlie kaapu they all huddled together to take up as little space as they could oscar had a cut on his leg charlie was missing the top halfinch of his left little finger susie as far as oscar could tell didnt have anything worse than a few bruises shed always been lucky they were all lucky oscar knew it they were alive and they werent maimed after everything that had hit the apartment that was real luck not far away somebody else whod stuck it out was alternating moans and shrieks the cries were getting weaker whoever it was oscar didnt think hed make it no way to get up and see or to help the poor bastard you could almost walk on the bullets flying by overhead the marines storming up waikiki beach were giving it everything they had the more lead they put in the air the less damage the last japanese pocket in the honolulu neighborhood could do to them and the japs were fighting back with everything they had left that meant rifles and machine guns and knee mortars if one of those little bombs came down on top of oscar and susie and charlie that would be that or a us shell could do the job just as well or maybe even better now we know whats worse that everything we ran into when we were surfing at waimea oscar yelled into charlies ear oh boy charlie yelled back back in college oscar had read marlowes doctor faustus he hadnt understood it then now he had understanding rammed down his throat you really could pay too much for some kinds of knowledge if he lived that would be worth remembering the marines were only a block or so away oscar could hear them shouting at one another getting a new attack ready with luck this one would carry them past what was left of the apartment building with even more luck it wouldnt kill his girl or his buddyor him but he could also hear the japs shouting a block or so to the north it couldnt mean they sound like theyre getting ready to charge too susie said and they did thats crazy oscar said theyd just be killing themselves no sooner were the words out of his mouth than the japanese soldiers or naval landing forces or whatever they were charged the marines they were screaming like banshees and shooting from the hip it was so spectacular and so spectacularly mad that oscar stuck his head up for a moment to watch heading the charge was a senior japanese navy officer in dress whites bald and bespectacled and waving a sword oscar had to blink to make sure he wasnt seeing things half a dozen bullets seemed to hit the officer at the same time his body twisted horribly as if it didnt know which way to fall his sword went flying and susie grabbed oscar and dragged him down getting shots not how youre gonna get out of proposing to me she yelled okay babe thats a deal oscar stayed down from then on by the noises some of the japs actually got in among the marines they didnt have a hope in hell of driving them back they just died a little sooner than they would have otherwise they probably also killed some marines who might have lived if things went a little differently after that mad charge got smashed the marines surged forward only spatters of gunfire answered them the japs had shot their last bolt an american in a green uniform flopped down almost on top of oscar and susie and charlie his rifle swung toward them with terrifying speed dont shoot oscar said were on your side as soon as the leatherneck got a look at susie the rifle stopped moving his grin showed white teeth amidst brown stubble i dont care about you pal but i hope like hell she is he said here enjoy he tossed them a pack of cigarettes and some crackers and cheese wrapped in cellophane then he fired a couple of rounds and ran on my god oscar said dizzilyand he hadnt even opened the luckies yet we made it susie kissed him charlie pounded him on the back nobody stuck anything up where a bullet might find it oscar didnt want to turn himself into a liar now especially after susie kissed him again the jeep that rolled south from haleiwa down the twice wrecked and now restored kamehameha highway carried a pintlemountedcaliber machine gun the driver glanced over to fletch armitage you handle that thing if you have to sir still jap snipers around every now and then ill handle it fletch promised you think im skinny now you shouldve seen me a month ago he felt like a new man if the new man tired easily and looked as if hed blow away in a strong breeze he still marked one hell of an improvement over the old one fletch looked like a new man too in the olivedrab uniform that had replaced khaki while he was on the sidelines the jeep was new too or new to him none of the handy little utility vehicles had got to oahu before the war started the machine gun by contrast felt like an old friend he could have stripped it and reassembled it blindfolded hed had to do that at west point if the instructors felt nasty theyd remove a key part before you put it back together and make you figure out what was wrong war had chewed up the landscapechewed it up twice in less than two years not even hawaiis luxuriant growth was able to cover up the latest round fletch looked at things with a professional eye the japs had fought like sons of bitches no doubt about it burntout tanks and wrecked artillery pieces and pillboxes told how hard they had fought so did the smell of death that fouled the warm moist air the kamehameha highway was better than new twice as wide with no potholes because the paving was still so fresh the engineers whod put humpty dumpty back together again had done a hell of a job and theyd needed to if supplies didnt go south by the kamehameha highway they didnt go south at all no snipers fired at the jeep less than an hour after fletch got off the landing craft he found himself in wahiawa here you go sir the driver said pulling up behind the gutted corpse of a packard that had sat by the curb since december good luck he pulled a big little book out of his pocket and settled down to read thanks fletch said tightly he got down from the jeep wahiawa lookedtrampled was the first word that came to mind the japs hadnt cared about civilians to them builtup areas made good strongpoints the town had paid for their stand everybody in hawaii had paid and paidincluding at last the japs themselves civilians on the streets were scrawny kration cans were some of the commonest trash fletch saw krations werent delicious but they were paradise next to what people had eaten while the japs ruled the roost a brunette haole woman with her hair hacked off short as a marines shrank away from fletch when his eye fell on her he wondered what that was all about but only for a moment she must have been sleeping with the enemy his mouth tightened which only made the woman look more frightened as she scuttled past him how anyone could but then he sighed some people didnt care what they did to get by it wasnt as if he hadnt seen that before if your choices looked like screwing a jap and starving to death what would you do he thanked god he wasnt a judge making hawaii run the way it was supposed to again would take years his own worries were more personal he turned west off the highway toward schofield barracks which he knew were nothing but wreckage and more to the point toward his old apartment building which he hoped was still there a lot of the places around here were okay the japs must not have thought they could make much of a stand in this part of town there it was battered but still standing just like me fletch started to shake this was harder than anything hed done since the first time he went into combat with japanese fighters and dive bombers blowing up everything in sight and who says youre not going into combat now he asked himself jane already blew up your heart armitage was still on the mailbox in the lobby he climbed the stairs two at a time so he wouldnt have time to think by the time he got to the second floor he was pantinghe still wasnt in great shape but exercise wasnt the only thing making his heart pound when he walked down the hall he took a deep breath and knocked on what had been his own front door maybe she wouldnt be home but he heard footsteps inside so she was the door opened there she was skinny but who wasnt skinny these days but still looking damn good to him yes captain she saidand then she did a double take right out of the three stooges my god fletch my god she squealed and threw herself into his arms she didnt feel skinny hed forgotten how a woman in his arms did feel finding out again was like three shots of bourbon on an empty stomach when he kissed her she kissed him backfor about three seconds before she twisted away what had been intoxication curdled hello jane he said sourly come in she said looking down at her toes and not at him im sorry fletch i know what you must be thinking but thatwasnt all about you anyway great he said and she flinched as if hed hit her he did go in the place didnt look too different it smelled of wood smoke but she sure wouldnt have been able to go on cooking with gas how are you he asked im here she answered i saw you once with those others i know i saw you too fletch said i must have looked like hell jane nodded you did im sorry but you did i didnt think anything would be left of you in a little while damn near wasnt he said i was down to about a hundred pounds when the leathernecks raided the camp in kapiolani park and got me out hed put some weight back on but he still had a long way to go you made it though way to go way to go yeah sure her laugh might have been dipped in vitriol fletch she stopped then muttered well you might as well hear it from me because youll sure hear it hear what he asked ice forming in his belly if shed collaborated he didnt know what hed do if shed collaborated bust her in the chops and walk out he supposed slam the door on this part of his life forever they made me their whore she whispered comfort woman they called it they stuck me in a brothel and they made me they made me fuck them and suck them all comers welcome there is that plain enough i was doing that till the place got shelled and i could get away oh he said and then oh jesus and then no wonder you didnt want to kiss me no wonder at all jane said bleakly hawaii the impregnable fortress of the pacific another acidfilled laugh what was impregnable was me and its just dumb fucking luckyeah thats what it is all rightim not carrying some japs bastard id never know whose either cause there were too damn many to be sure fletch felt like sinking through the floor there is a peculiar horrible helplessness unique to the man who cant protect his woman im sorry he said in a low voice im so sorry part of him knew that was irrational hed been a pow at least as helpless as jane and shed dumped him anyhow but hed also been a soldier charged with defending hawaii against the enemy and hed failed the whole army and navy had failed but he didnt care about that hed failed it was personal which made it all the worse that ought to take care of any silly foolishness about getting back together jane said you wont even want to look at me now let alone touch me hey fletch said gently jane looked up in surpriseshe must have thought he would stomp out of the place in disgust he said i know all about what the japs could make people do they would have killed you if you didnt you think i dont know that too i sawplenty believe me whatever you had to do nobodys gonna blame you for it i sure dont youll probably end up a hero babe and go to the mainland and make speeches about what a bunch of bastards were fighting so people in war plantsll buy more bonds she stared at him you son of a bitch she said and she started to cry what thedevil did i do now he asked honestly bewildered if youd just walked away it would have been over jane answered but youreyoure sweet to me she cried harder than ever what am i supposed to do now everything that has to do with common sense says i ought to finish what i started but then you go and you act sweet what am i supposed to do about that would you rather i slapped you silly fletch inquired his sarcasm rolled right off her because she nodded you bet i would she answered if you did id know where i stoodright where i always stood it would be over but this she stared at him again blinking rapidly her eyelashes were wet have you grown up did whatever the japs did to you finally make you grow up i dont know he said heavily all i know is i didnt die and too many people did no i know one other thingi never stopped loving you for whatever you think thats worth i couldnt do anything about it for weeks and months at a time but i never stopped take it for what you think its worth he reached into his pocket id give you a drink if i had one but all ive got are luckies will a cigarette do sweet jesus yes jane exclaimed im getting the habit back and i love it thereve been times when i thought about screwing a soldier for a pack there really have thats the other side of the coin after so many whats one more especially when hes on our side after you do what i had to do it doesnt mean what it used to no i dont suppose it would fletch said well im not asking leave me a couple and keep the rest of the pack i can get more when she took a lucky between two fingers he flipped a zippo hed got from a pharmacists mate and lit it for her he fired one up for himself too he was also getting used to them again the nicotine buzz hit harder than he remembered from the days before the war janes cheeks hollowed as she sucked in smoke thats so good she said and then cocking her head to one side what the dickens am i gonna do with you fletch its your call honey he answered with a shrug that he hoped hid his own dreams i never wanted things to end if you do i guess i cant stop you think about it though dont make up your mind right away thats all i ask weve both been throughtoo much theres no rush if you decide its over its over if you dont ill be heretill i get well enough to go back on active duty anyhow thats fair jane said her voice troubled thats more than fair i guess okay lets leave it there then fletch looked around for an ashtray jane was doing the same thing she went back to the kitchen and came out with a saucer they both knocked off ash and then before long stubbed out their cigarettes he climbed to his feet i better go im glad you came through however it happened same to you looking like a soldier advancing into machinegun fire she stepped forward and put her arms around him he held her not too tight she put her chin up you sure he asked jane nodded he kissed her not too hard even with a mild kiss like that he rosehe leapedto the occasion he was starting to feel well enough to know how long hed gone without he didnt try to do anything about it letting go of his notquiteex was hard holding on to her now would have been much worse he clicked his tongue between his teeth and said take care of yourself kiddo yeah you too jane answered ill see you uhhuh fletch left the apartment left the apartment building and walked back to the jeep parked on kamehameha highway take me back to the beach he told the driver away went the big little book yes sir the soldier said and fired up the engine justice of a sort had come to wahiawa it was a rough justice but the times it was trying to deal with had been rough too jane armitage knew that even better than most of her neighbors like them she scowled at smiling sammy little who stood before his fellow townsfolk and tried to say he hadnt collaborated with the japanese smiling sammy wasnt smiling now the usedcar dealer had on a loud checked jacket that he might have worn on his lot back in the days when oahu had autos that ran and gas to run them i never hurt anybody he insisted i never squealed on anybody i never got anything special from the japs so help me god a woman standing near jane aimed a forefinger at him look at you you lying son of a bitch that coat fits you people muttered it was a telling maybe a deadly point most peoples clothes hung on them like tents even after theyd been eating us military rations for a while the woman accusing smiling sammy had arms and legs like sticks she was far from the only one too sammy little wasnt so chunky as he had been when he was selling cars but he was a long way from emaciated hed gone through the occupation on more than rice and turnips and weeds whered you get your chow sammy somebody called somebody else added whod you sell down the river for your belly i never did little said ii had a stash of canned goods the japs never found yeah thats it the chorus of liar that rang out had a frightening baying quality to it hounds might have bayed like that after treeing a raccoon especially if they were hungry another chorus began the gauntlet the gauntlet sammy little licked his lips the color drained out of his face no he whispered i didnt do anything i dont deserve it we can hand you back to the army said the woman whod pointed at him theyll give you a blindfold and a cigarette or else theyll give you twenty years for sucking up to the japs this way its all over at once and youll probably live jane didnt think anybodyd died running the gauntlet in wahiawa not yet yosh nakayama went through almost unscathed only a few people had wanted to take a shot at him most figured hed done the best he could in an impossible situation other men and women though got badly beaten they too probably would have faced worse from the us military two lines formed from smiling sammy little on one end to getting it over with on the other the usedcar salesman licked his lips one more time then lowered his head and ran like hell between the lines people punched him and kicked at him as he dashed by hed got about a third of the way before somebody tripped him he went down with a moan after than a lot more of the punches and kicks landed jane kicked him in the ribs as he crawled past her but he made it to the far end he was bloodied and battered but he was alive jane kicked him only once she despised him but on general principles he hadnt done anything to her personally when two haole men led out a small kindlooking chinese woman though heres annabelle chung one of them said something made a crunching noise near jane she realized she was grinding her teeth she ran the japs comfort house for them the other man said she took their money she brought them to the women she made sure nobody got away too they made me do it annabelle chung said shrilly they said theyd kill me if i didnt that might even have been true jane didnt know one way or the other she didnt care either so what she shouted so what god damn you you enjoyed seeing us in hell in there you enjoyed it how would you have liked it if the japs did a quarter of what they did to us to you i wish they would have other women forced into prostitution screamed at annabelle chung too she started to cry one of janes fellow sufferers said yeah look at those tears what did you think we did every night after the japs finally got through with us i spent all that time wishing i was dead and i spent a lot of it wishing you were dead too thats right jane said oh lord thats just right other comfort women also chimed in the chinese woman whod been dragged into prostitution along with the haoles denounced annabelle chung as fiercely as any of them i didnt mean anything bad the madam said when something close to silence finally came i was just trying to get through it all same as anybody else im sorry youre sorry you got caught jane yelled you knew what they were doing to us and you didnt care that isnt true annabelle chung protested but a fierce rising cry drowned her out the gauntlet the gauntlet the gauntlet people made sure jane and the other former comfort women had good spots they hustled annabelle chung to the starting point she didnt want to go through in her shoes jane wouldnt have wanted to either a big man finally gave her a shove after that it was run or die people were harder on the madam than they had been on smiling sammy little that probably wasnt fair odds were hed done more harm through the occupation than she had but hed been sneakier about it he hadnt been right out there pimping for the japanese saying just what he had done was hard with annabelle chung nobody had any doubts about that she was already staggering by the time she got to jane sticking out a foot was the easiest thing in the world annabelle chung went down with a wail of despair jane yanked at her hairyanked some of it out she threw it aside and kicked the chinese woman in the side of her head pain shot through her foot she didnt mind it felt wonderful annabelle chung didnt make it to the far end of the two lines once she fell the comfort women converged on her after they finished she lay unmoving on the ground jane got a good look at her then part of her wished she hadnt the sight wasnt pretty even so one of the other women said not half what she had coming jane nodded shed just helped maim or killmore likely killsomebody and she wasnt the least bit sorry maybe she should have been maybe she would be later not now though oh no not now a mynah bird hopping on the grass flew away before she got close it was just a bird to her these days not a potential supper the same was true of zebra doves the tame foolish little birds would be everywhere again in a few years the way they bred put rabbits to shame she didnt mind them their twittering swarms would help make hawaii feel normal once more normal jane laughed what was normal after close to two years of hell did anybody on these islands have the slightest idea jane knew she didnt not any more from hawaiis worries she soon came back to her own what was she going to do about fletch that she didnt disgust him still amazed hershe disgusted herself most of the time maybe he really did love her how much did that matter enough when she knew his flaws only too well maybe he wasnt the same person he had been before december any more than she was she wasnt the only one whod gone through hell hed suffered longer than she had if not in the same ways did she want him back could she stand living with him if she couldnt could she ever stand living with anybody again those were all good questions one of these days soon she needed good answers for them get ting rescued with three haoles who vouched for him wasnt enough to keep kenzo takahashi from being thrown into an internment camp behind barbed wire he would have been angrier had he been more surprised it was going to be open season on japanese in oahu for a while that was thanks to people like his own father for dads sake kenzo hoped he had got out of honolulu on a submarine he wasnt in this camp if he was still on oahu hed get caught before long god help him if he did better he was long gone then even if he had collaborated kenzo didnt want him strung up hiroshi was alive hed been in the camp longer than kenzo had he walked with a stick and a limphed got shot in the leg after the special naval landing forces dragooned him into hauling and carrying for them the wound was healing he tried to make light of it saying could have been worse oh yeah kenzo said how they could have shot me in the head or in the belly his brother answered i saw guys that happened to he grimaced or the marines couldve finished me off when the japanese soldiers fell back this one bastard damn near did im lying there bleeding right and hes got this goddamn bayonet poised to stick mehe gestured with his caneand when he finds out i speak english he wants to know who plays short for the dodgers pee wee reese kenzo said automatically yeah well i got it right too hiroshi said but try coming up with it when youve just been shot and some maniac wants to stir your guts with a knife if they gave you tests like that in school people would study a hell of a lot harder i believe it kenzo set a hand on his brothers shoulder im glad youre here im glad im anywhere hiroshi saidwith feeling like just about everybody on oahu they ate rations out of cans because theyd done so much fishing neither of them was as skinny as a lot of the japanese in the camp all the same beef and porkeven beef and pork out of canstasted mighty good to kenzo people knew who he and hiroshi were they knew who their father was some of them must have hoped blabbing to the authorities would win a ticket out of camp kenzo never found out whether it did he did know his name and hiroshis got called at a morning lineup when they stepped forward they got hustled away for interrogation your father is jiro takahashi the japanese propagandist sometimes called the fisherman asked a first lieutenant who couldnt have been much older than hiroshi thats right kenzo saidno point denying the truth do you know his current whereabouts the lieutenant asked no sir kenzo answered we heard he was on a sub headed for japan but we cant prove it hiroshi added uhhuh the lieutenant wrote that down do you have any way of demonstrating your own loyalty to the united states of america kenzo wondered if he wanted to be loyal to a country that didnt want to believe he was but only for a moment he thought about mentioning elsie but figured that wouldnt do him any goodit sure hadnt yet that gunner we pulled out of the pacific hiroshi said what the heck was his name hope flowered in kenzo burleson burt burleson he said and felt as if hed passed a test of his own he and hiroshi explained how theyd rescued the man from the flying boat and landed him somewhere near ewa the lieutenant wrote that down too we will investigate he said if we cant confirm your story it will be held against you jesus christ kenzo said we dont know what happened to this guy once he got off the sampan for all we know the japanese grabbed him ten minutes later and hes been dead for months for all i know he never existed in the first place and youre making him up the lieutenant said coldly we will investigate in the meanwhile in the meanwhile they went back into the camp nobody wanted to have anything to do with them after that people seemed to think collaboration was as catching as cholera why not the us military had the same attitude eleven days laterkenzo was keeping trackthey got summoned at morning roll call again off they went to be confronted by that same kid lieutenant he looked as if hed bitten down hard on a lemon here he said and thrust a typed sheet of paper at each of them kenzo looked down at his it stated that hed been certified loyal and had full privileges of citizenship in spite of his race and national origin oh boy he said in a hollow voice hiroshi looked as thrilled as he sounded whats the matter youve got what you wanted dont you the lieutenant said what i want is for people to think im loyal till i do something that makes em think im not kenzo answered thats what americas supposed to be about right this says you thought my brother and me were disloyal till we showed you we werent see the difference maybe if the officer saw he didnt care maybe itll work that way one of these days i dont know what i do know is there were local japs who played footsie with the occupation your father did okay so it looks like you didnt terrific youre free to go if you want a medal for doing what any loyal american was supposed to do forget about it what do we do now hiroshi asked whatever you want like i said youre free to go if youre smart though youll hang on to those letters and show em whenever you have to the lieutenant jerked a thumb toward the tent flap go on get out of here beat it out they went the guards outside started to lead them back into the internment camp kenzo displayed his letter the corporal in charge of the guards read it moving his lips he grudgingly nodded i guess theyre legit he told his men fuck em theyre still japs one of the soldiers said yeah the corporal scowled at kenzo and hiroshi i dont know how you conned your way into those papers but you better find somewhere else to be and i mean now they left as fast as they could hiroshi grimaced against the pain in his leg but he didnt let it slow him down kenzo looked out at the wreckage of the city where hed lived his whole life he had to glance toward diamond head to get a notion of just where he was not enough still stood in these parts to tell him later he supposed he would go over to the sundbergs and see how elsie was doing he wondered how often he would have to display his loyalty letter between here and there free he said tightly right les dillons platoon camped on the cratered ground outside iolani palace even now they kept sentries out a few japanese snipers were still running around loose just the other day one of them had wounded a guy near what was left of honolulu hale before the marines hunted him down and sent him to his ancestors the stench of death lingered in the air a lot of bodies remained in the wreckage sooner or later bulldozers would knock things down and either get them out or cover them up it hadnt happened yet somebody in a clean new uniform approached the perimeter seeing unfaded untorn unstained olive drab automatically roused les suspicions another worthless replacement for a marine whod known what he was doing but hadnt been lucky but this guy walked up with an air of jaunty confidence and had a cigar clamped between his teeth dutch les shouted you son of a bitch yeah well i love you too buddy dutch wenzel answered his hand was still bandaged but he showed he could open and close his fingers they decided not to waste cargo space shipping me back to the mainland so here i am good to see you good to see anybody who knows his ass from third base les said some of what were getting to fill casualty slots he shook his head then laughed they mustve been saying the same crap about me when i went into the line in they were right too werent they wenzel said les affectionately cuffed him on the side of the head wenzel looked around boy we liberated the living shit out of this place didnt we bet your ass dillon said not without pride iolani palace would never be the same half of itmaybe more than halfhad fallen in on itself somebodyd put up a flagpole on the ruins though the stars and stripes flew from it les figured he would start selling sweaters in hell before the old territorial flag showed up again nothing like being used by a collaborator king to turn it unpopular in a hurry over to the east honolulu hale was in even worse shape being a modern building the city hall was more strongly made than the old royal palace that meant the japs had used it for a fortress after gunfire from tanks and artillery pieces leveled it marines and army troops had to clear out the surviving japs with flamethrowers and bayonets the stars and stripes flew over that pile of wreckage too les was proud to see the starspangled banner waving but he wasnt sorry to have missed that fight hed been in enough of them and then some the rest of honolulu wasnt in much better shape even the buildings that still stood had pieces bitten out of them the japs had made a stand or tried to in just about every stone or brick building in town theyd taken it out on civilians too which only added to the stench in the air les sighed thinking of what was left of the honkytonks on hotel street not bloody much this town is never gonna be the same he said this whole island is never gonna be the same dutch wenzel said pineapples sugar cane all that craps down the drain now nothin but fuckin rice paddies left the dolesll be on the dole by god he laughed at his own wit so did les whos gonna worry about any of that for a while he said whos gonna worry about cleaning up this mess here either only thing anybodys gonna give a damn about is getting this place ready to fight from hickam and wheeler are up again so the carriers dont all have to hang around but christ only knows how long itll be before we can use pearl again tell me about it wenzel said more wrecks in thereours and the japsthan you can shake a stick at all the fuel burned or blown up the repair yards smashed to scrap itll be a while yet reckon so les lit a cigarette partly to fight the stink from his friends cigar he looked north and west even before then weve gotta clear those bastards off of midway and wakeespecially midway i wont be sorry to get rid of washing machine charlie bettys from midway could reach oahu every few nights a handful of them would buzz overhead drop their bombs and then head for home they were only an annoyance unless one of those bombs happened to come down on you wenzel nodded yeah the sooner that starts the better and after we take care of those placeswell its wherever we go next thats all wherever the fuck it is theyll need marines les said positively dutch wenzel nodded again both of them looked west towards islands whose names and dangers they didnt know les blew out a cloud of smoke wonder how many of usll be left by the time its all over enough i expect dutch nodded one more time only a few hundred japanese soldiers and sailors had been captured in the downfall of oahu the americans kept them in a camp not far from pearl city near the northern tip of pearl harbor yasuo furusawa suspected one reason the americans did that was to let their prisoners watch them at work getting pearl harbor usable again would have taken japan years if the japanese had tried at all furusawa would have judged it an impossibly big job the americans threw more machines at it than he would have guessed there were in all the home islands put together they had plenty of fuel too even if they were bringing every liter of it from the mainland and things got done sunken ships were raised some were refloated for repair torches attacked others turning them into scrap metal buildings went up on the shore and on ford island it all happened so fast it reminded him of a movie run at the wrong speed we didnt know how strong they were when we started fighting them he said gloomily as he stood in line for rations even those were a sign of us might he ate more and better as an american prisoner than he had as a soldier of the japanese empire he remembered what his own side had fed american pows and how theyd looked after a while the comparison was daunting the prisoner in front of him only shrugged what difference does it make he said what difference does anything make weve disgraced ourselves our families will hate us forever even among the humiliated japanese prisoners of war a hierarchy had sprung up though only a senior private furusawa stood near the top of it hed been captured while unconscious he couldnt have fought back men like him and those whod been too badly hurt to kill themselves stood ahead of those whod simply wanted to live those whod thrown away their rifles and raised their hands instead of hugging a grenade to their chest or charging the americans and dying honestly several captured prisoners had already killed themselves the americans did their best to stop prisoners from committing suicide some of the captives thought that was to pile extra disgrace on them furusawa had at first he didnt any more the americans had rules of their own different from japans suicide was common among his people but not among the yankees he would have said they were soft had he not faced them in battle even the first time around theyd fought hard and trying to stop their reinvasion was like trying to hold back a stream of lava with your bare hands every so often prisoners got summoned for questioning the enemy had plenty of interrogators who spoke japanese furusawa wondered how many of the locals now working for the usa had served the occupation forces before he wouldnt have been surprised if quite a few were doing their best to cover up a questionable past with a useful present whatever they wanted to know he answered why not after the disaster of being captured how could anything else matter did you ever see or know captain iwabuchi the commander of the defense in honolulu an interrogator asked i saw him several times drilling his men i never spoke to him though nor he to me i was only an ordinary soldier after all the interrogator took notes what did you think of captain iwabuchi he asked that he asked more from his men than they could hope to give him furusawa said do you think there are other officers like him do you think there will be other defenses like this probably furusawa said by the way the local japaneses mouth tightened he hadnt wanted to hear that furusawa went on how else would you fight a war but as hard as you can the americans werent gentle with us when they came back here either it will only cost japan more men in the long run the interrogator said you must have seen you cant hope to win when america strikes with all her power furusawa had seen that it frightened him even his full belly frightened him but he said i am only a senior private i just do what people tell me to do if you had caught a general maybe you could talk to him about such things we caught a lieutenant colonel and two majorsone was knocked cold like you the others both badly wounded the interrogator said everyone of higher rank is dead almost all of the men of those ranks are dead too i am not surprised furusawa said you have won a battle here i cannot tell you anything different but the war still has a long way to go they brought him back to the camp after that he watched fourengined bombers take off from hickam fieldone more facility repaired far faster than he would have thought possible the huge planes roared off toward the northwest the war still had a long way to go and the americans were getting on with it fletcher armitage filled out his uniform better than he had the last time he came into wahiawa looking at himself in the mirror comparing himself to people who hadnt almost starved to death he judged he was all the way up to very skinny from where hed started that showed a hell of a lot of progress wahiawa had made progress too theyd bulldozed rubble off the streets some of the longdead automobiles parked along kamehameha highway were gone too more people were on the sidewalk like fletch they had more flesh than the last time he was here he tapped the driver on the shoulder why dont you park whatever you say sir the soldier answered cheerfully he pulled over several big trucks painted olive drab rumbled by heading south fletch wondered what they were carrying to honolulu or pearl harbor both places still needed everything under the sun he shrugged that wasnt his worry his worries were right here walking to the apartment where hed lived with jane was easier this time he didnt get tired so fast exercise was starting to feel good again he wasnt doing too much without the strength to do it the way he had while he was a pow no jap sergeant was going to whack him with a length of bamboo or a rifle butt if he slowed down either but he didnt have to slow down now he went up the stairs at a good clip he did raise his hand twice before he knocked on the door but that was nerves not weakness so he told himself anyway she wont be home he thought but the door opened oh jane said its you come in she stepped aside to let him you were expecting cary grant he asked with a crooked smile jane laughedsourly i wasnt expecting anybody people know i had to do what i did but they know i did it too they dont come around much she closed the door then turned to look him over you seem better you dont look like youd blow away in a strong breeze any more i put a roll of quarters in my pocket before i came down just to make sure fletch answered this time jane really laughed his eyes traveled her youve always looked good to me babe she stared down at the ratty rug even after all that yeah he nodded i know about doing things you wouldnt do if you had a choice believe me i do the tank traps and bunkers and trenches i dug probably got our guys killed after they came back you think i wanted to do that but the japs wouldve murdered me if i told em no soi dug jane took that in a direction he hadnt expected murmuring killed she eyed him have you ever killed anybody known you killed somebody i mean artillerymen usually fought at ranges where they couldnt see what happened when their shells came downusually but not always hed used a as a directfire weapon when the japs invaded oahu yeah he said and told her about blowing an enemy tank to hell and gone then he asked how come because i did too or i think i did she told him about annabelle chung while i was doing it it felt like the right thing sometimes it still does but sometimes i just want to be sick you know what i mean if anybody ever had it coming babe she did fletch said you werent the only one who thought so either if it makes you feel any better jane nodded i tell myself that sometimes it helps sometimes it doesnt she made a wry face the last couple of years a lot of things have happened that cant be helped aint it the truth fletch said with more feeling than grammar but maybe some can awkwardly he dropped to one knee hon since the divorce never got finished will you please stay married to me jane stared at him then she started to laugh again you didnt do that the first time you proposed to me well i know you better now and i mean it more too he said and ill try to be a better husband too i wont promise the moon but ill try so will you get up silly she said softly will i she seemed to be asking him as much as herself slowly she nodded i think i will if youre crazy enough to still want me well see how it goes i guess and if it doesnt one of usll file papers again thats all sure fletch agreed more because he didnt feel like arguing than because he wanted to think about papers and lawyers and all the other delights hed known just before the japs invaded but hed known other delights since next to time as a japanese prisoner even lawyers didnt look so bad next to hell purgatory probably seemed a pretty nice part of town he grunted a little as he got to his feet thank you babe dont thank me yet fletch jane said as far as im concerned youre still on probation if it works fine if it doesnt i will go back to a lawyer she eyed him with mockhe hoped it was mockseverity thats a threat buster youre not supposed to grin like a fool after i make a threat no huh not even when im happy fletch pulled the corners of his mouth down using one index finger for each corner there is that better he asked blurrily fingers still in place jane snorted so help me god youre crazy as a bedbug yes maam thank you maam fletch saluted her with as much precision as if he were a plebe back at west point may i please kiss the bride to be wife to be whatevertheheck to be maam most of the time after youd just more or less proposed and she said yes the answer to that was automatic looking at janes face he knew it wasnt here when he remembered why some of his own joy chilled within him but she nodded after a couple of seconds carefully she said carefully he promised he held her with as much formal reserve as if they were waltzing together for the first time she closed her eyes and raised her chin looking about onequarter eager and threequarters scared to death he kissed her it was more than a brush of his lips across hers but less than half of what he wanted it to be the same sort of kiss hed given her the last time he came back here when it was over he let her go right away okay he asked she nodded again okay thank you she looked out the window across the roomanywhere but at him this wont be easy im sorry if you want to change your mind i can see why you would not me he said i figured thered be bumps in the road but heyat least theres a road the last couple of years he didnt go on or need to so lets do like you saidwell see how it goes and well go from there deal deal jane held out her hand fletch shook it and i brought you another present too he pulled out two packs of luckies wow she all but snatched them out of his hands the way things are theyre better than roses she opened a pack and stuck a cigarette in her mouth he lit it for her wow she said again after the first drag i better go fletch said she didnt tell him to stay however much he wished she would have he paused with his hand on the knob one more thing if they ship me outno when they ship me outill be paying those bastards back for you yeah jane took another deep drag on the lucky thats a deal too fletch autumn for more than thirty years it had been only a word to jiro takahashi it was always summer in hawaii a little warmer a little cooler a little drier a little wetterso what summer endless summer but now against all odds he was back in japan and he had to remember what seasons were like southern honshu had always prided itself on its good weather with the inland sea helping to keep things moderate jiro supposed it wasnt as bad here as it was up in hokkaido where they got real blizzards every winter it still seemed chilly and nasty to him ive been spoiled he thought the authorities were doing their best to keep him happy his broadcasts from hawaii had made him something of a celebrity in the home islands a grumpy celebrity wasnt good he thought he would have been happier if theyd let him stay next door in yamaguchi prefecture where hed been born hed visited his old village he had a brother and a sister there and a few old acquaintances it proved more awkward than hed expected no one knew what to say after so many years apart he didnt have much in common with family or former friends maybe the people who ran things were smart to keep him in a big city he could visit again whenever he wanted toif he wanted to yamaguchi prefecture remained overwhelmingly rural it was livelier than it had been when he left but next to the hustle and bustle hed known in honolulu it seemed if not dead then very very sleepy for instance it had no town with firstrate broadcasting facilities they wanted to keep him on the radio as if his broadcasts could somehow compensate for the loss of hawaii nobody ever came right out and said hawaii was lost it just stopped showing up in the news jiro hoped his sons had come through the fighting he also hoped they were happy under american rule once more he knew he wouldnt have beenand he knew the americans wouldnt have been happy with him he got off the trolley at the stop closest to the studio it was only a block or two from the domed industrial promotion hall in the center of town when he looked north the chugokusanshi range loomed over the city skyline the mountains didnt have snow on them yet but they would by the time winter was over he hadnt even seen snow since coming to oahu he supposed seeing it wasnt so bad dealing with it if he had to he had to that was all hello takahashisan the local broadcasters name was junchiro hozumi he reminded jiro of a cheap imitation of osami murata he cracked crude stupid jokes and breathed in your face to show how friendly he was he did have a smooth baritone though he said today shall we talk about how you came back to japan jiro thought about that he remembered how terribly overcrowded the submarine was and how the stink almost knocked you off your feet he remembered the heartpounding fear as the boat sneaked submerged past the american ships that had by then surrounded oahu he remembered the shrill pings of the enemys echotracker and the crash and boom of bursting depth charges he remembered how the submarine shook as if in an undersea earthquake and he remembered how fear turned to terror did hozumi understand what he was asking did he want his listeners hearing things like that what would the government do to himand to jiro if they went out over the air nothing good jiro was sure of that as tactfully as he could he said maybe wed better pick something else hozumisan for a wonder hozumi got the message his grin was wide and friendly and showed a gold front tooth whatever you say how about being able to eat proper rice now that youre in the home islands again all right we can do that jiro said the rice here was better than the horrible slop hed eaten after the occupation started the ration was larger than the one people on oahu had got toonot a whole lot larger but larger he could talk about that and let people here think he was talking about the whole time hed lived in hawaii hed begun to understand how the game was played the studio reminded him of the one at kgmb from which he and murata had broadcast the routine seemed much the same too had the japanese borrowed from the americans he wouldnt have been surprised even the engineers signals through the glass were the same good job hozumi said when the program was done good job arigato jiro said hed got through another one anyhow when he left the studio he took the trolley down to the shore and stared out across the inland sea at itaku shima the island of light from time out of mind the tiny island had been dedicated to the goddess bentin the chief temple was more than years old pilgrims came to visit from all over japan hawaii didnt have anything like that jiro nodded to himself even if the weather here couldnt match what hed left hiroshima wasnt such a bad place after all
