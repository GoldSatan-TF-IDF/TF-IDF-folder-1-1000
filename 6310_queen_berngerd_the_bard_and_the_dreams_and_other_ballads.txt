swede around burnt and slew the castle of martha was wrapped in fire to the church the good lady flew she dwelt in the tower both night and day there unto her none repaired neath the church roof sat the dull owl gray and at the good lady stared in the house of the lord she dwelt safe and content till the foes their departure had taen then back to her ruined castle she went and bade it be builded againthere found the houseless a cover once more and the mouths of the hungry bread but all in kariseby wept sore when they knew dame martha dead and when the dame lay in her coffin and smild so calm with her pallid face o there was never so little a child but was brought on her to gaze the bell on the day of the burial tolld and youth and age shed the tear no man was ever so weak or old but helped to lift the bier when they the bier set down for a space and rested upon the road a fountain sprang forth in that very place to this hour has it flowd god bless for ever the pious soul her blessings no lips can tell for oft have the sick become sound and whole who drank at dame marthas well the tower yet stands with gloomy nook where dame martha sat of old the stranger comes thereon to look and to hear the story told the bard and the dreams oer the sweet smelling meads with his lyre in his hand the bard was straying in the twilight of evening refreshing and bland his chords were playing he sang of the flowrets that slept in the tomb he sang of the flowrets that poured their perfume he sang of the flowrets that yet were to bloom and the rose departed a smile from its sepulchre darted and the rose yet living with blushes of red breathed sweets oer his head and the rose which unborn concealed yet lies seemed to open before his eyes by a fountains side with verdure arrayd himself he laid and the murmur and hum of the pure water fleeting and the strains which the birds of the wood were repeating and the innocent heart which so peaceful was beating shed healthgiving slumbers on lids which no sorrow cumbers in the visions of sleep there came to his side a sire with locks snowhoary and the songster sped with that sire for his guide to an unknown territory on ruins majestic himself he found the mouldering bones of old heroes lay round their ghosts awakingrose from their graves wild gestures making the youth was quaking but the old man smiled as his mind he led to the kempion times long fled then a lamp in the nights deep silence shone through the dingy mould and under the masses of fallen stone there glittered gold to the harp then pointing the sage disappears and the youth shed tears yes yes the young bard thy countenance knows so sang in wild passion the boy not in vain in my bosom a holy fire glows not in vain thy bright lamp the graves mystery shews the bard will obey thee with joy again there appeared in the dreams of the stripling a being who held him intent it came as in flood come the high billows rippling like billows when ebbing it went though the look of an aged and slow female wearing it ran like the breezes in spring time careering full often it vanished with threatening bearing but suddenly caught he the fugitive wild and then by his breast a maiden smild thee often ive met on lifes journey he said and when like a meteor thou past me hast sped ive seen thee look backwardand threaten o kiss me sweet maiden ere on thou dost stray ive seen thee with flowers strew the wanderers way they lived in their brightness when thou in this lightness hadst fled farthest off and sometimes they became a bautastone over the wormwasted frame vouchsafe me a smile said the youth i entreat i know thy course lightningfleet thy light pinions ever thou pliest sweet giver of palms verdant palms to the stripling so clever who caught thee though lightning fleet again to his eye a fair vision was given a being angelical stood in the heaven in morns fresh rosehues drest stood the spirit blest as shines from above the starlet of love so kindled his glance toward earths gentle child as the maid to her beckons the youth she loves dearly when vespers are chiming and luna shines clearly so toward him beckoned the angel and smild with rapture the songster took thither his way where the winged one of heaven stood beauteous and gay but just as he hoped that the height was surmounted far distant again they each other confronted and still the angel beckoned there butnever never near my seraph wilt ever avoid my embracesaid the songster with mortified mien but though im unable to climb to thy place my eye thou hast blest from the mansions of grace and thy heaven thou distant ive seen his slumber departed his visions they fled but oft when he harped they came into his head blest trebly blest may our life be regarded far unto me hear threefold life is awarded see the roselet departed a smile from its tomb has darted and the rose which yet lives in blushes and bloom breathes oer me perfume yes from its concealment the unborn rose before me seems to unclose king oluf the saint king oluf and his brother bold bout norroways rocks a parley hold so sweet in drontheim tis to dwell the one of us two who best can sail shall rule oer norroways hill and dale who first of us reaches our native ground oer all the region shall king be crownd then harald haardrode answer made aye let it be even as thou hast said but if i today must sail with thee thou shalt change vessels i swear with me for thou hast got the dragon of speed i shall make with the ox a poor figure indeed the dragon is swift as the clouds in chase the ox he moveth at lazy pace hear harald what i shall say to thee what thou hast proposed well pleaseth me if my ship in aught be better than thine im readily cheerfully lend thee mine do thou the dragon so sprightly take and i with the ox will the journey make but first to the church well bend our way ere our hand on sail or on oar we lay and into the church saint oluf trode his beautiful hair like the bright gold glowd but soon out of breath there came a man thy brother is sailing off fast as he can let them sail my friend who to sail may choose the word of our lord we will not lose the mass is the word of our blessed lord take water ye swains for our table boardwe will sit at board and the bread we will taste then unto the seashore will we haste now down they all sped to the ocean strand where the ox lay rocking before the land and speedily they to the ocean bore the anchor and cable the sail and oar saint oluf he stood on the prow when on board now forward thou ox in the name of the lord he grappled the ox by the horn so white hie now as if thou went clover to bite then forward the ox began to hie in his wake rolld the billows boisterously he hallooed to the lad on the yard so high do we the dragon of harald draw nigh no more of the pomps of the world i see than the uppermost top of the good oak tree i see neath the land of norroway skim bright silken sails with a golden rim i see neath norroways mountains proud the dragon bearing of sail a cloud i see i see by norroways side the dragon gallantly forward stride on the ribs of the ox a blow he gave now faster faster over the wave he struck the ox on the eye with force to the haven much speedier thou must course then forward the ox began to leap no sailor on deck his stand could keep then cords he took and his mariners fast he tied to the vessels sheets and mast twas then twas then the steersman cried but who shall now the vessel guide his white gloves off saint oluf throws and he himself to the rudder goes o we will sail oer cliff and height the nearest way like a line of light so oer the hills and dales they career to them they became like water clear they sailed along oer the mountains blue then out came running the elfin crew who sails oer the gold in which we joy our ancient father who dares annoy elf turn to stone and a stone remain till i by this path return againso they sailed oer skaaneys mountains tall and stones became the little elves all out came a carline with spindle and rok saint oluf why sailest thou us to mock saint oluf thou who the red beard hast through my chamber wall thy ship hath passed with a glance of scorn did saint oluf say stand there a flint rock for ever and aye unchided unhindered they bravely sailed on before them yielded both stock and stone still onward they sailed in such gallant guise that no man upon them could fix his eyes saint oluf a bow before his knee bent behind the sail dropped the shaft he sent from the prow saint oluf a barb shot free behind the ox fell the shaft in the sea saint oluf he trusted in christ alone and therefore home by three days he won that made harald with fury storm of a laidly dragon he took the form but the saint was a man of devotion full and the saint gat norroways land to rule into the church saint oluf strode he thanked the saviour in fervent mode saint oluf walked the church about there shone a glory his ringlets out whom god doth help makes bravely his way his enemies win but shame and dismay to scribblers would it not be more dignified to run up debts on every side and then to pay your debts refuse than write for rascally reviews and lectures give to great and small in pothouse theatre and townhall wearing your brains by night and day to win the means to pay your way i vow by him who reigns in hell it would be more respectable to a conceited woman be still be still and speak not back again what right have you to answer in this strain whilst im a man a prince of the creation youre but a female woman by your station a creature for mans sovereign service born whose fitting wages are contempt and scorna creature formed to dive down in the sea to fetch up seaeggs for the likes of me only too grateful when weve stilled our greed if on our leavings youre allowed to feed if thus i speak i speak on public grounds my only aim is to keep well in bounds
