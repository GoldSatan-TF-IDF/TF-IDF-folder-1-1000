charles todd a duty to the dead the first book in the bess crawford mystery series this book is for pauline and brian gadd two terrific people who shared their england with the authors including a wonderful day at the imperial war museum and hot chocolate pork pies the fox in the back garden and making us feel we were family moses and monty the most enormous warmhearted kitties who purred when

the wilds of sevenoaks don bush who did without fran so that she could go with caroline an act of love if ever there was one the wonderful landscape of kent which has been the inspiration for more than one todd novel and not least robin hathaway author of the dr fenimore and dr jo banks mysteries who offered us gum tree and other adventures when we needed a sanctuary to finish duty with much much love always chapter one tuesday november am at sea this morning the sun is lovely and warm all the portholes below are open to allow what breeze there is to blow through the lower decks and air them with no wounded onboard to keep us occupied we are weary of one anothers company beds are made up kits readied duties done since gibraltar ive written to everyone i know read all the books i could borrow and even sketched the seabirds uneventful is the password of the day i lifted my pen from the paper and stared out across the blue water id posted letters during our coaling stopover in naples and there wasnt much i could add about the journey since then id already mentioned the fact that greece was somewhere over the horizon and likely to stay there someone had sighted dolphins off the bow just after first light and id mentioned that too what else oh yes we discovered a birds nest in one of the lifeboats no idea how long it had been there or if the hatching was successful or what variety of bird it might have been margaret one of the nursing sisters claimed it must surely be the ancient mariners albatross and we spent the next half hour trying to think what we should name our unknown guest choices ranged from coleridge to the kaiser but my personal favorite was alice in wonderland i always tried to keep my letters cheerful even when the wards were filled with wounded and we were working late into the night fighting to save the worst cases my worries werent to be shared at home and in the trenches letters were a brief and welcome respite from war it was better that way and now we were in the kea channel just off the greek coast at cape sounion and steaming toward our final destination at lemnos it was the collection point for wounded from greek macedonia palestine and mesopotamia there post could be sent on through the army id grown rather superstitious about writing to friends as often as i could id learned too well just how precious time was and how easily someone slipped away dying days or weeks before i heard the news my only consolation was that a letter might have reached them and made them smile a little while they were still living or comforted them in their last hours god knew the battle of the somme over the summer had been such a bloodbath no one could say with any certainty how many men wed lost i could put a face to far too many names on those casualty lists a gull flew up to land on the railing close by me an eye fixed on me most were nearly tame begging for handouts in the distance over the birds shoulder was a smudge that must be kea the sea here was a sparkling blue and calm britannics frothy wake the only disturbance as far as the eye could see in any direction sailing between the island and the mainland was a shortcut that saved miles and miles of travel or as captain bartlett had told me on my first voyage out keep cape sounion on your left and kea on your right and you cant go wrong and so i looked for it every voyage thereafter like a marker in the sea one of britannics officers paused by my deck chair and the gull took flight with an annoyed squawk i see youre already enjoying the morning air miss crawford the last time we passed through here it was pouring rain you could hardly see your hand before your face remember browning was sun browned broad shouldered and handsome in his uniform wed formed a friendship of sorts during the voyages out flirting a little to pass the time neither of us took it seriously much pleasanter than france this time of year i replied smiling up at him no mud he laughed and no one firing at you we should be safe as houses soon thats good to hear but i knew he was lying it was a game all of us played pretending that german uboats werent a constant threat even hospital ships like britannic were not safe from them despite our white paint and great red crosses they were said to believe that we hid fresh troops among the wounded or stowed munitions in the hold amongst the medical supplies there was no truth to their suspicions of course and this channel was well traveled always a temptation for that matter mines paid no heed to the nationality or purpose of the hull above them when a vessel sailed too near you couldnt dwell on it or youd live in fear he moved on overseeing the change of the watch and i capped my pen there was something about his laugh that reminded me of arthur graham when it caught me unawares as it had done just now the gates of memory opened and arthurs face would come back to me during training wed been warned about letting ourselves care too much for our patients they are yours to comfort yours to heal but not yours to dream about matron had told us firmly only foolish girls let themselves be drawn into romantic imaginings see that you are not one of them good advice but matron hadnt foreseen arthur graham hed been popular with the other wounded the medical orderlies and the nursing staff it was impossible not to like him and liking him it was impossible not to feel something for him as he fought a gallant but losing battle with death i wasnt foolish enough to believe it was love but i was honest enough to admit i cared more than i should id watched so many wounded die perhaps that was why i desperately wanted to see this one man snatch a victory out of defeat and restore my faith in the goodness of god but it wasnt to be and truth be told i had more than one reason for remembering arthur graham and his laugh there was a promise id made freely if you gave your word so freely my conscience argued then why have you never kept your promise theres been no opportunity i said the words aloud then in embarrassment turned to see if anyone had overheard me liar you never made the time it isnt true you traveled through kent on your last leave you could have kept it then i resolutely uncapped my pen and tried to distract myself with my letter the seagull returned to keep me company theres a cheeky seagull on the railing every morning ive christened him baba for the man who sat outside our gate in agra and examined the goods the merchants brought to the house afterward hed come round to the back garden and talk cook into giving him the gull flew up just as there was a deafening explosion and the ship seemed to rock on her spine the deck lurched where i was sitting pen and paper flying from my lap it was all so unexpected that i was thrown out of my chair as it too went over i struck the bulkhead with such force that i rebounded hard against the stairs just behind me my right arm took the brunt of that and pain shot up to my shoulder i cried out in alarm trying to scramble to my feet the explosion had left me stunned i could hear the shouts and screams all around me but they seemed to come from a great distance and then i was standing upright holding on to the stairs with my left hand my hearing gradually returned and i forced myself to think clearly to remember all those drills wed attended again and again and sometimes laughed about over tea my life belt it was in my cabin i had forgot to bring it on deck with me a rating ran by stopping every few feet to look over the railing what is it i called to the young seaman whats happened he didnt answer his attention on the ships waterline but i really didnt need to hear it from him a submarine had found us and torpedoed us somewhere near the bow it was the only explanation was there a second torpedo already on its way there was no time to stand and speculate still dazed i stumbled through the nearest sea door and went toward my cabin for my life belt the darkhaired irish nurse eileen came running toward me in the passage crashing into me as if she hadnt seen me at all it jarred my arm and i smothered a cry i tried to steady her but she shook her head and ran on disoriented and badly frightened i came to the next set of stairs and it struck me suddenly that all this elegance surrounding uselegance intended for happier voyages for travelers dancing the night away without a care in the worldmight wind up at the bottom of the sea like titanic or for that matter lusitania no that mustnt happen herethis great ocean liner would survive as the general alarm was being sounded the orderlies were collecting under the majors sharp eye while the rest of us were hurrying to take our stations since i was coming from the open deck everyone asked me for news as they passed but i could only shake my head and tell them i knew as little as they did dr menzies stopped me and reached for my arm i hadnt noticed that my arm was cut much less that it was bleeding rather badly his fingers ran quickly surely over the skin closest to the gash i winced at his touch i rather think its broken have you got something to stop the bleeding ill set it for you as soon as we know whats happening and he was gone i reached my cabin found my life belt on its nail and cursed dr menzies as i struggled to put the vest on properly i hadnt had time to notice how my arm was beginning to ache until he drew my attention to it now it hurt like six devils and i felt a first inkling of nausea from the intensity of the pain he was right it must be broken i wasnt about to touch it myself and find out and this wasnt the time to be a problem for others using my left hand and my teeth i managed to wind a scarf around the gash to contain the bleeding my kit bag lay at the foot of my bunk holding my right arm close to my chest i reached into it and pulled out the small oilskin packet in which id learned to keep my papers and money shoving that down the front of my shirt i turned and hurried back into the passage it was eerily quiet as if no one was left onboard but me anyone need help i shouted to be sure no one was lying hurt somewhere if id been thrown to the deck it was possible that others had been tossed about as well i listened and heard only the sounds of the ship herself i opened the nearest doors only to find the cabins empty their occupants were all on deck then trying to see what sort of damage wed sustained getting to their stations in some sort of order waiting for instructions time that i joined them as i turned to the companionway captain bartlett began speaking to the ships company and i tried to make out what he was saying my ears were still full of cotton wool and i couldnt distinguish all the words something about assessing damage and no need to worry the abandon ship alarm hadnt sounded and that was reassuring britannic had watertight doors wounded she might be but certainly not doomed of course theyd said the same about titanic at least there hadnt been a second torpedo yet i didnt want to think about what that might have done to us i reached the lifeboat station as someone just ahead of me remarked i expect we hit a small craft a fishing boat most likely there was a nervous edge to her voice this is probably nothing more than a precaution marilyn johnson answered i wish the captain would tell us more but then he probably doesnt know himself yet most of the nurses were wearing their life belts but several still clutched them in their hands the crew was busy with the boats not lowering them yet just preparing them and then ahead of our station a working detail of ratings panicked racing to get a boat launched early and i realized with a shock that they were intending to commandeer it my next thought was had they been down below and did they know how bad it really was an officer was trying to deal with them his voice hard and calming theres no need to panic do your duty damn you and your turn will come i thought it was my friend browning but there was tension and anger in the voice as well changing its timbre not encouraging surely behind me dr brighton joined the queue he was an older man a very good doctor and unflappable id watched him in the operating theater he noted the scarf around my arm whats this i saw that blood was seeping through the pretty pattern of lilacs a cut i told him unwilling to admit to more he began to unwind the scarf then saw for himself what lay beneath rewinding it more efficiently he confided to me in a low voice i dont think its a good idea to go below for something to stabilize that bone the portholes on e and f decks are still open worst luck and theres no chance of closing them now well sink fast if the watertight doors are damaged where was the explosion i asked as quietly striving to keep my arm steady as he worked starboard side i think near the bownot far from where i was sitting yes bartlett has just sent a distress signal meanwhile damage reports are still coming in they arent good the ship was turning now toward kea in the distance but i wasnt sure we could make it something didnt feel right about britannicshe seemed heavier id sailed in her often enough to recognize a difference i prayed it was only my imagination running away with me dr paterson nearer the rail called to dr brighton theyre using the screws to turn not the rudder i dont think thats a good sign dr brighton finished tying up my arm and then hurried over to join him staring down into the water how many of these people can swim for that matter could i with this arm that thought flashed through my mind as i watched the crew at their work as they readied the great arms of the lifeboat launching system everyone knew the drill but no one had believed it would ever be necessary five voyages into the mediterranean with no trouble that had given us a false sense of security i watched one of the younger seamen fumble the ropes and an older rating swore at him to mind what he was about browning was by my side saying i dont like the look of that arm miss crawford ask someone to help you into a boat if the time comes i turned does anyone know what happened id swear britannic seems sluggish as if shes taking on water he didnt answer me directly uboat mine does it matter are we sinking is this a precaution or real damned real he said tightly and was gone there was a nurse just up ahead with bruises on her face someone had tied an impromptu bandage around her head and already the blood was seeping through serviettes from the dining room they gave the woman a rakish air and i wanted to laugh no thats hysteria stop it i warned myself the irish nurse had come up beside me trying to edge her way up the queue her face was so pale the freckles across her nose stood out i dont like the water she was saying id rather take my chances here i put a hand on her shoulder dont be silly eileen if anything happens the lifeboats are the safest place for us to be eileen froze fear stark in her eyes then its true were sinking i could hear shouting now and saw that harry dyke one of the officers was looking up at the poop deck where firemen from below were trying to launch a lifeboat for themselves you fools he yelled stay onboardwere trying to beach her but they were frantic to be gone and without waiting for orders or other passengers to join them they launched anyway stay away from the ship dyke was shouting to them now and for gods sake try to pick up any of the crew whove already jumped surprised i turned to look at the sea and could see bobbing heads treading water those who hadnt waited for a boat to be lowered from the look of them they were already tiring the water was november cold after all in spite of the suns warmth eileen fled before i could stop her the firemen were paying no heed but i thought theyd heard dyke i saw one reach out an arm to drag a swimmer inboard then the third officer lawes was trying to prevent two of his boats from automatically launching so far the abandon ship signal still hadnt been given we were all at our stations worried and waiting for instructions none came i eyed the distance to kea could we make it that far wounded as we were or was the submarine lurking nearby watching ready to try another shot if it looked as if wed be successful i shivered at the thought i saw that lawes was too latethe boats dropped to the water with such violence that spray swept the side of the ship by a mercy both stayed upright to my surprise eileen was in one of them britannic was listing now it wasnt just my imagination and it was harder to understand why the captain hadnt ordered the boats away i could appreciate how the passengers on britannics sister ship titanic must have felt in the cold darkness of the north atlantic at least here there was daylight someone behind me was pushing hard eager to be nearer the lifeboat as if afraid shed be left behind she jostled my right arm and i felt faint from the stab of pain i stepped back letting her have my place then sat down on the deck lowering my head swallowing hard nausea was there all too close to the surface dizzying in its intensity i hadnt realized that a break in a bone could be so exquisitely painful id feel a greater tolerance for the wounded after this one of the other nurses came to bend over me and then we heard people shouting and screaming a warning i managed to get to my feet and turn to look over the railing the two boats from lawess station were in trouble and bartlett was bellowing to them through the loudhailer mind the screws damn it i stood there unable to turn away as one of the lifeboats caught in britannics wake was being dragged inexorably back toward our three propellers already partly out of the water their great brass wings shining wet in the sun as they went round like everyone else along that rail i cried out in horror staring down at the frightened helpless faces turned first up to us and then back toward the stern there was nothing that anyone could do no way to stop what was about to happen in what seemed to be slow motion but must have been only a matter of seconds the first boat was swept into the screws the sound of wood rending reached us screams echoed across the water and then there was silence i dont think anyone on the ship moved wood debris and torn bodies churned into the bloody wake i felt sick in five sailings with severely wounded onboard i had never seen anything quite so terrible the image stayed with me repeating itself over and over again dr paterson swearing like a trooper raced toward the stern looking over into the water for survivors the abandon ship alarm was sounding now and i realized that while wed been absorbed by the drama on the water britannics list had increased alarmingly someone came up to me cursing me telling me to get into one of the lifeboats before it was too late to lower them it was lieutenant browning harried and angry his expression a mask of duty but his mind already leaping ahead to what we were about to face it was the last thing i wanted to do nowleave this ship i could see other boats in danger of the same fate as the first one it would be better to drown than to face those churning blades but when i turned drawn to stare at them i was surprised to see that the screws were barely moving that someone had ordered all engines stopped it was then i knew with cold certainty that we were sinking collecting my wits i said lookthe boat im assigned to is full browning shook me and i cried out from the pain in my arm he stopped saw how bloody my scarf was and ripped my apron off below my vest using it to fashion a makeshift sling this way sister he took my good hand and led me through the ship to another boat station lifting me bodily into the first one we came to just as it was ready to lower this one has a better chance of making it what he didnt add was that with the ship listing it would be touch and go on the other side the occupants reached up to pull me safely aboard be safegodspeed he told me and then he was gone we hit the sea heavily bobbed dangerously then steadied someone was calling frantically to us from the water and i turned to see that it was the irish nurse clinging to a shard of wood from one of the broken boats i leaned forward to touch the shoulder of the officer in charge of our boat and pointed looking around he saw eileen nodding he tried to steer the boat nearer to her she was having a dreadful time staying afloat as the plank perversely danced away on the next swell afraid of losing her several of us leaned over at once to try to reach out for the bit of wood she gripped so frantically and nearly capsized ourselves in the process the officer shouted a warning and then i saw the boat hook lying in the bottom i picked it up swung it over everyones head and out toward eileen she hesitated reluctant to let go of the only security she knew and then in a final desperate lunge that took all her strength she grasped the curved end of the hook i could see the despair in her eyes as she held on for dear life with barbara mercers help i dragged her to the side of our boat because i was nearest her i passed the boat hook to someone else and put out my left hand to catch eileens barbara did the same and with an effort i hadnt dreamed i was capable of we began to haul the girl up over the side eileen was crying begging us not to let her go nurses on either side of us caught at her wet clothing as it tried to pull her down and we soon had her safely aboard other hands lowered her gently into the well it was then i saw the lacerations on her legs and the tatters of skirt and petticoat that only half covered them the wounds were deep and bleeding profusely it must have been a torment for her almost beyond bearing but the coldness of the water had helped stanch the rate of bleeding long enough for her to be rescued barbara and margaret began to bind up the wounds but the pain was intolerable now eileen fainted just as well barbara muttered as she worked our boat crew began to row now with vigorous strokes pulling us as far from britannic as possible their backs arched over the oars and the muscles in their shoulders straining with the effort there was nothing more i could do i sat back nursing my arm id damaged it picking up the boat hook with both hands trying to reach eileen and pull her to us the ends of the bone felt as if they were grinding together now but what else could i have done in the closely packed lifeboat there had been no time or space to shift places i tried to touch the area around the break but it hurt so much i stopped it was too late to worry now besides the little lifeboat was rolling in a fashion that britannic never had done even in storms i was feeling increasingly uneasy or was it the agony in my arm it was overwhelming and seemed to have reached a crescendo i closed my eyes trying my best to cope think of anything but your arm i commanded myself anything england no dont think of home something else my greatgrandmother had danced at a ball in belgium on the eve of waterloo while napoleon was racing north across the french border she had watched my greatgrandfather slip from the ballroom to ride to meet his regiment then smiled to hide her fear from the others present and turned to dance with a new partner later shed had her portrait painted in the ball gown she wore that night i tried to picture her floating across the polished floor in the arms of another man while the one she loved was facing the greatest battle of his career would i be painted in my torn bloodstained uniform after surviving britannic my mother would have a fit there was a single blast of the ships whistle and i opened my eyes in time to see that her bridge was almost on a level with the water britannic was going that beautiful ship tears began to run down my face salty on my lips i shook my head to clear it and unable to turn away watched the great liner die on all sides of me other people were crying as well their eyes fixed on the ship not ready to absorb what this meantor what lay ahead of us we could hear the boilers exploding as the cold water reached them and the splash of gear and equipment sliding down the decks to crash into the sea the ship itself was creaking as if she were alive protesting the engineers last to leave were madly scrambling out of funnel four after holding their positions until the end lucy across the boat exclaimed oh my god just like titanic barbara beside me said dryly no dear lusitania there arent any icebergs in the mediterranean was it a mine someone else asked i was shading my eyes against the suns glare as one of the officers assigned to our boat cleared his throat and answered the question must have been none of the lookouts saw any sign of a uboat or reported a torpedos wake but if it was a submarine thank god it didnt attack again bloody uboat wouldnt have picked us up even so it was the rating at the helm we had moved smartly in a dash to put ourselves beyond reach of the great ships death throes afraid of being pulled under with her but she filled our world still then someone said theres the end of her in a hollow voice as if they couldnt believe their eyes britannic seemed to roll uncertainly then bow first she raced down through the water as if she had a rendezvous below and was late the roar of her passing was like something human a cry like nothing id ever heard the sight and sound were heart wrenching and as i looked out at the turbulence where the great ocean liner had once been i knew id remember those last appalling moments until the day i died the sea seemed lonely now wide and endless and unfriendly we were in the middle of nowhere kea was off on the horizon and this was a busy sea lane but the water was so desperately empty even crippled britannic had been comforting a place we knew large and able to hold its own against the vastness of the sea or so wed wanted to believe did everyone get off lucy asked anxiously oh my god what if wed had more than three thousand wounded onboard she began to tremble we were all shaken uncertain trying not to think about that wed had enough lifeboats and we knew the procedures by heart but it was a daunting prospect in the face of our present situation attempting to shift the subject i said did anyone respond to the captains distress call there was no mention of other boats in the area as far as i know margaret replied they must have learned about the mine laying in the bottom of the boat eileen moaned a little and barbara asked is there a medical kit onboard she needs something now for the pain there was a swift scramble to find the kit and i let myself go for a few minutes drifting on a tide of sickness and pain even so i could hear barbara talking as she worked on eileens limbs worried that the girl would bleed to death i tried to recapture the image of that ballroom in belgium and my greatgrandmother whirling past long candlelit windows in a daring waltz smiling up at a young lieutenant while out of the corner of her eye she watched another officer slipping out the door and hurrying away but behind my lids now was only the red glare of the sun as i opened my eyes again other lifeboats had drawn within hailing distance of ours one of them called to us and asked if everyone was all right i thought it was lieutenant browningprayed it was the officer in our boat bellowed well do someone else called across the water how many boats did we lose four the number seemed to hang in the air like signal flags on a lanyard try to stay together then weve a better chance i was nearly sure it was captain bartlett speaking now but water tended to distort voices would he be blamed for what happened like the captain of titanic you couldnt see a mine in time could you they were purposely low in the water bobbing hiding in the froth a cruel and unseen killer we roused ourselves and began taking stock three others in our boat were wounded in addition to eileen the only doctor among us had sustained a blow to the head the knob rising like a small hill and he was slow to respond to questions about how he felt two of the nurses had rather serious cuts barbara was already ripping apart her skirts for makeshift bandaging and others followed suit salt air is a healer lucy was saying trying for cheer but i doubt it was meant this way medically barbara said succinctly bloody germans i said noticing that somewhere i had lost my cap and the heat was beating down we need to shield our heads and faces from the sun try to rig something if you can well burn in no time my apron was around my arm but i borrowed a pocketknife from the man at the helm and with a little help managed to hack a strip from my skirt that i could wind turbanlike around my head you look like an arab one of the other women told me and there was a general nervous laugh but i noted that others were following my example i managed to cut another strip and handed it to barbara to shield eileens face from the sun rigging it over the bucket used for bailing the glare from the water was very different this close to it and i found i was squinting horribly until id created my own shade we fell silent for a time overwhelmed by events there seemed to be no one else in the world but ourselves a cluster of small boats at the mercy of the sea thank god it was not raining or stormy i felt myself drifting away again on the thought the wash of the sea against the sides of the boat and the warmth of the sun surprisingly soothing for a little while my greatgrandmother seemed to have abandoned me leaving me to my own devices and for a time i tried to pretend we were on the ship that had brought us back from india lying on deck with our backs to the mast watching moonlight streaming across the dark sea it had been too hot to sleep below and the passengers had come up to find a breath of air counting stars until that palled poshi hadnt thought of that in ages it stood for port side out starboard side home the best cabins the cooler ones were on the port side of a vessel traveling out to india and on the starboard side coming home and still there were nights when not a breath of air stirred and if the ship hadnt been moving wed all have surely died of heat exhaustion the image of a dark ship on a dark sea faded abandoning me too i came back to the present unable to escape for very long my arm had settled into a dull constant ache as long as i kept it close to my body and braced i think all of us were feeling the exhaustion of the last hours god knew after what wed been through it wasnt surprising then suddenly i was awake again overheated in the full strength of the sun and thirsty i wanted to dip my hands in the cool water surrounding us and bathe my face but i knew better not only would it dry my skin more but it would also make it burn and blister people were sleeping for a few minutes at a time as id done or staring out to sea without actually seeing it no one seemed inclined to talk now i wondered what memories they were chasing and if theirs had succeeded better than mine i turned my head to look forward at the officer he was anxiously scanning the horizon the ratings were trying to keep us on course with the other boats but i didnt think we were making much progress toward kea i looked around and found that several of the boats had even drifted away the rhythmic slap of the waves against the sides of ours was the only sound surely kea was farther away than before it had looked closer from the decks of britannic hadnt it i couldnt be sure where i was sitting my back had very little support and soon it began to ache in concert with my arm in spite of my sling i straightened trying to ease both why had the mast on the ship from india seemed comfortable and here there was no comfort to be had barbara stretching turned to me and said the arm hurts i daresay but from the looks of it this isnt the best place to try and set it a little yes i answered managing a smile but nothing like what eileen must be feeling more than a little i broke my arm when i was twelve falling out of the apple tree while trying to emulate my brothers as for eileen she shrugged expressively yes if we werent found soon if she didnt have proper care we were lucky barbara went on as if to convince herself we got off and no one in this boat was terribly hurt she glanced down at eileen except of course for her well have to bathe her legs in seawater again soon to keep the wounds from suppurating itll have to do i knew what was in barbaras mind the irish girl might survive but she could lose one or both legs to infection barbara was older than most of us an experienced nursing sister before the war had begun in she had told me once that her family had been horrified when she decided to train as a nurse now with the war on it was socially acceptable to tend the wounded but not then not a woman of her class not in with a sigh i leaned back as best i could still trying to find comfort for my spine the life belt was cumbersome and very little help one of the nursing sisters moved a little as uncomfortable as i was we will be rescued wont we of course we will i answered to cut off the rising fear in the girls voice there must be shipping fishing boats barbara added there are so many of us if a ship finds one lifeboat it will begin to search for others if you must worry ask yourself how we are to get home with no britannic to carry us to england a very good question her words turned all of our thoughts from rescue to passage back lucy said theyre chronically short of nurses thats in our favor id rather not be sent to egypt margaret put in i hear hospitals there are appalling most of us understood appalling conditions wed worked in them more often than not egypt is no worse than the others i said fishing boats out of kea began to appear over the empty horizon a cheer went up after what seemed to be an eternity the first one arrived on the scene and then others spread out behind it watching them move past us i realized that there were people bobbing in the water even though from our position we couldnt see them and the boats went first to pull them out but there wasnt much space on the little craft and so they couldnt manage taking any of us from the lifeboats while we were watching them turn back for kea wondering how long it would be before we saw them again hms scourge steamed into view and began to pick up survivors our boat wasnt one of them but scourge was followed soon enough by hms heroic which seemed to tower over us as she came up the worst of the wounded including eileen were sent by motor launch to korissia the port on kea we were taken aboard climbing the ladder if we could or waiting our turn on the sling if not from heroics deck i watched our progress in the mountainous interior growing higher the numerous small coves and bays giving the shore a ragged outline what sort of medical care would we find here i wished i had two good arms it rankled that i was a burden there were enough injured without me were forty nautical miles from piraeus one of the officers said reassuringly as if hed read my thoughts youll be all right the doctors and nurses already landed there had begun working frantically to save the most critical cases making use of whatever they could collect among themselves to bind up the severest wounds some including loss of limbs supplies were being offloaded from the naval vessels now and that was a blessing i was a little unsteady when i got to shore but went directly to do what i could to help then someone noticed my swollen hand discovered it came from a broken arm and ordered me to step aside weve enough nurses dr paterson told me ill see to you directly meanwhile theres a little shade over there and eileen could use the company shes awake now weve given her something for her pain thanks to heroic silently cursing my uselessness i did as i was told pausing to speak to a pair of ratings lying on blankets and to the nurse with the bandaged head before sitting down by the irish girl eileen recognized me and said shakily well were alive it counts doesnt it i smiled i should say it does i made such a fool of myself didnt i she added after a moment i dont think theres any way we can predict how well behave in an emergency until were there i answered judiciously you didnt panic my ancestors were battlehardened soldiers i wouldnt dare panic i said lightly theyd rise up from their graves in horror that brought a flicker of amusement quickly gone ive never been hurt before not like this its odd you know to be one of the wounded i was just thinking the same thing myself not half an hour ago im not enjoying the experience there was a pause will i lose my legs do you think dr menzies wouldnt answer me when i asked i doubt it hes always been the cautious one you know yes but i didnt think she believed me one of the island women brought us cold water to drink which was pure bliss and then a little later gave us bread baked only that morning with a small dish of almonds and olives i was surprised to find i was hungry and i dipped little chunks of bread into the water sharing it with eileen insisting that she must keep up her strength even if she didnt feel like eating another woman brought us fruit and gesturing with a smile mimicked biting into it will i lose my legs eileen asked again as if shed forgotten shed spoken to me before about it looking at her i could see she was groggy and perhaps a little feverish there will be scars i said avoiding the question but who will see them here have a little more of this orange it will help ward off scurvy but she barely noticed my little joke just then i realized that lieutenant browning had arrived bringing in one of the last boats and he began to take charge almost at once i thought he was actually speaking greek but it was french and hed found someone among the local people who could translate for him i smiled thinking that it was just the sort of thing he would do find a way to cope at some point in the afternoon he came over to speak to me asking how i was no one had had time to set my arm and i said nothing about it although he could see my purpling hand and the swelling by that time eileen had been taken to someones home where it was cooler and i was sitting with one of the engineers whod broken his leg jumping into the water listening to his tale of another sinking before the war lieutenant browning came back shortly with dr brighton and although i protested that it could wait my arm was cleaned and braced and wrapped and i was given a stronger sling it looked suspiciously like a part of someones tablecloth but there was no morphine to help because we didnt have enough i slept for a time after that in spite of the pain it was beginning to put my teeth on edge and so my sleep was restless at best and my dreams were filled with mines and explosions and fear in late afternoon two more warships came in and i was among those taken to piraeus crowds of people had come down to the grimy little port to watch us disembark as if word had run before us like wildfire a number of us were put up in one of the small hotels near the harbor it was called the athena and the staff was very kind margaret shared my room and helped me undress and bathe and dress again she also cut my meat it tasted suspiciously like goat and broke my bread four times i was taken to hospital for my arm to be seen and treated and rebound i could tell no one liked the look of it but there was no infection and i thought perhaps the bone was beginning to knit pulling eileen into the boat id managed to turn a simple fracture into a compound one and it appeared for a time that id need surgery thank god the doctors were wrong several days after our arrival someone came to tell us the final death toll thirty men it was astonishing and i put the good news into a letter home written with my left hand and barely legible the question now was how to get us back to england and how soon chapter two as it happened i arrived in england before my latest letter traveling aboard a smaller hospital ship where i was given light duties from reading to patients to sitting with the surgical cases it was an odd experience to stand aside while other nursing sisters did what i could do with my eyes shut but i also had the opportunity to observe techniques or oversee the skills of new probationers who were still struggling to remember all theyd been taught my father met my train at victoria station and tuttutted over the bandaged arm strapped to my side under my cloak he reached into the carriage for my valise saying gruffly well it could have been worse bess britannic was in all the newspapers you know and speculation has been rife that she was torpedoed theyll be giving you a campaign ribbon next captain bartlett is already in london facing an inquiry as we made our way through the throngs of peoplemost of them families greeting soldiers or saying goodbye to themhe added over the uproar of the next train pulling out i told you to stay out of harms way yes well i said dryly i was trying the mine had different ideas damned efficient germans he studied my face still in pain a little i lied the train from dover to london had been crowded and my arm had been jostled in spite of the sling and every care he tried to shield me from the bustle of people coming and going lets get you out of here then we threaded our way through the valises and trunks and people cluttering the platform and he handed in my ticket for me then we were outside in the street and london was cold wet and rainy a far cry from the warmth of greece all the same i was so thankful to be home the journey from athens to malta to dover had been long and arduous and somehow a ship no longer seemed to be a haven we had spotted submarines on three different occasions but they had been after more important prey my father was saying my dear theres not a hotel to be had anywhere well have to make do theres the flat for me what about you ill stay at my club tomorrow the train leaves at some ungodly hour seven i think well have to be down again by sixthirty wake me up at fivethirty if you will it takes me longer to dress he was trying to conceal how worried he was about me but he said only growing conceited about your looks are you quite vain i retorted it was an old argument richard crawford career officer in the army that he was had wanted a son to follow in his boots instead hed got a strongwilled and determined daughter we had battled ever since i was three he waved to a cab that was waiting down the line and it pulled up for us in you go at least you havent a great deal of luggage to worry about thats a blessing but your mother has already bethought herself of that the house is full of female things and shell expect you to make a fuss over all of them i shall the war wasnt over for me whatever mama might hope id have to find myself new uniforms or have them made up we stopped at the flat i shared with four other nursing sisters and i made a clumsy dash through the rain for the door my father at my heels got there first and opened it for me mrs hennessey in the groundfloor flat answered my knock and was on the point of sweeping me into a copious embrace when she glimpsed the strapped arm oh my dear she hardly came to my chin an elderly widow who had lived in this same house since her husband died in it had been converted into flats in she reached out and took my left hand youll be wanting the key and with that arm whos to see to you none of the others are here just now you know but ill be glad to come up and clean cook a little whatever it is you need she hesitated we heard that britannic had gone down was it very bad we were so fortunate there were no wounded onboard i answered but for the rest of us it was a little wearing still we were very lucky a response id given so often it was like a parrot repeating a lesson and not a part of me of my experience indeed mrs hennessey peered into the hall is that your father with you dear she had strict rules about men coming up to the flat if we wanted to say goodbye to any male over twelve and under sixty it had to be done at the foot of the stairs in plain view of anyone coming and going diana called it the cruelest blow to romance shed ever encountered but none of us had so far complained to mrs hennesseys face who else i asked with a smile there are no handsome young men left in london to meet my train hes dragging me home tomorrow but ill have to stop over tonight then heres the key my love and if you need anything just ask ill be bringing up a bit of hot soup later tell your father ill keep an eye on you i thanked her and let my father see me up the stairs to the flat under the eaves a mercy it was a broken arm and not a broken limb he said as we reached the last landing i couldnt have carried you another step he unlocked the door for me and stuck his head inside ill have dinner sent round to you i expect the larder is empty mrs hennessey is bringing me soup that will do theres tea i said glancing toward what we euphemistically called our kitchen id do anything for a cup he laughed and came in shedding his coat he was not presently a serving officer hed retired in but they had found work for him at the war office nonetheless a tall handsome man with iron gray hair broad shoulders and the obligatory crisp mustache he wore his uniform with an air we called him colonel sahib my mother and i behind his back he made tea quickly and efficiently while i pored over the mail collected in the basket on the table three of the letters were for me friends writing from the front i wasnt in the mood to open them and set them aside the war seemed too close as it was the streets filled with soldiers some of them wounded on leave the drabness of late november feeling as if it reflected the drabness of another year of fighting for a little while i just wanted to forget that somewhere bodies were being torn apart and people were dying we could hear the guns as we disembarked in dover and i had no way of knowing whether it was our artillery or the germans something of what i was feeling must have shown in my face my father misinterpreted it and said yes youve had a rough time of it my dear best to think about something else for a bit your leave will be up soon enough soon enough i echoed and took the cup he brought me it was a souvenir from brighton with the pavilion painted on it i had never understood where marianne one of the nurses with whom i shared the flat had found all of them but the shelf in the tiny kitchen held plates from victorias jubilee edward viis coronation and half the seaside towns in england my father held a cup with penzance on it he raised his eyebrows as he noticed that himself good god your mother would have an apoplexy no decent dishes we do very well i answered him didnt you notice the teapot its georgian silver i swear to you and there are spoons in the drawer that are french im told and the sugar bowl is certainly royal worcester he joined me at the table stretching his long legs out before him bess i knew what he was about to ask it wasnt bad i said trying to put a good face on all that had happened to me frightening yes when we first hit the mine and then when we had to abandon ship i didnt mention the boats pulled into the screws and worrying because there were so many who were hurt the papers said we were lucky in the circumstances that only thirty died while over a thousand lived but what about those thirty souls who never came home some are buried near piraeus in the british military cemetery there others were buried at sea or never made it out of the water at all i think about them on the whole everyone behaved quite well and it was daylight and sunny though the water was cold that made an enormous difference to those who jumped do you want to go back to duty he was offering to pull strings and keep me at home to work with convalescents yes i do i make a difference and that matters there are men alive now because of my skills and one who died in spite of them i changed the subject quickly do you know the graham family ambrose graham in kent too abruptid intended to broach the subject casually but his concern had rattled me he frowned grahamrings a bell somewhere he had something to do with racing i thinka horse called merlin the wise ah one of the finest steeplechasers there ever was that graham he died some years ago his first wife was a cousin of peter nevilles he lost her in childbirth and merlin had to be put down that same year neville wrote me that it turned his mind he finished his tea and sat back any particular reason why i should remember the grahams tonight my father was nothing if not allseeing his subalterns and his indian staff had walked in fear of him believing him to have eyes everywhere i knew betterit was a mind that never let even the tiniest detail escape his notice not especially i was fishing for words now the right ones his son arthur was one of my patients you see arthur was that the childs name arthur was a son of the second family ambrose graham married again ah go on at any rate arthur was healing quite nicely then his wound went septic almost overnight and hedied i ended baldly and you felt that somehow it was your fault you must have been very tired and upset my dear to believe such a thing men do die from wounds ive seen perfectly hardy souls taken off by the merest scratch while others survive against all odds even florence nightingale couldnt have done more you must accept that as part of the price of nursing his voice was unusually gentle no not that i mean yes i feltit was appalling that he died that wed failed although wed done all that was humanly possible there is something else as he was dying arthur made me promise to give one of his brothers a message he was insistent i dont think he would have died in peace if i hadnt agreed i could see arthurs face again taut with suffering as he reached for my hand intent on what he was saying urgent to make me understand why i must carry out his wishes hed died two hours later without speaking again and id sat there by the bed watching the fires of infection take him it was i whod closed his eyes they had been blue and not even the mediterranean sea could have matched them what sort of message he knew soldiers my father did and his gaze was intent something to do with his will a last wish or more personal something hed left undone a girl perhaps when i hesitated he added its been some time i think since you made your promise is that whats worrying you my dear there were no wounded on britannics last voyage it was the voyage before thatif you remember i had only a few days in london before we sailed again i should never have brought up the subject tonight i dont even know why i had except that as our train rumbled through kent and i was finally safely back in england i faced for the first time the unpalatable truth that i could very well have died out there in the sea one of those thirty lost souls and if i had and there was any truth to an afterlife it would have been on my soul that id failed arthur i was sorely tempted to change trains there and then in rochester and make my way unannounced to owlhurst it would have been a foolish thing to domy father was waiting for me in london and for all i knew arthurs brother was in france out of my reach but the urgent need to assuage my sense of guilt had been so strong i could hardly sit still in my seat i knew what it was of course i did it was the taste of near failure and to my fathers daughter failure was unthinkable i tried now to find a way of disentangling myself from what id begun but i was in too deep and heard myself saying instead the messagehow am i to judge it how can i know if i waited too long if im already too late arthur wasnt delirious he knew what he was telling me and why what wed been giving him hadnt affected his brain i know the dying dwell on small things something left undone something unfinished this was different he was still in command of his senses when he held my hand and made me swear i think until the last minute he still believed hed live to see to it himself he desperately wanted to live he turned to me as a last resort if the moment made such an impression on you why have you put off carrying out his wishes i rubbed the shoulder of my bad arm i dont know i said again and then was forced to be honest fear i think fear of what i was still grieving not for the man his family knew but for the one id nursed theyd remember him differently as their son their brother their friend i wasnt ready for that arthur i wanted to hold on to my memories for a little while longer iti know that was selfish but it was all i had i looked at my father feeling the shame of that admission iit was a bad time for me you cared about this young man i can see that do you still i hesitated then made an attempt to answer his question im not nursing a broken heart truly its justmy professional detachment slipped a little iit took a while to regain that detachment i stirred my tea before looking my father in the face youve commanded hundreds of men there must have been a handful of them who stood out above the rest and you couldnt have said why even when you knew you oughtnt have a favorite theyre justa little different somehow and you want the best for them and it hurts when you lose them instead yes i understand what youre saying god knows i do ive sent men into danger perfectly aware that they might not come back and equally aware that i could not send someone else in their place if you remember when you first decided to train as a nurse i warned you that the burden of watching men suffer and die would be a heavy one young graham just brought that home in a very personal way it happens my dear he wont be the last war is a bloody waste of good men and that will break your heart when nothing else does id have liked to meet this man he sounds very fine he cleared his throat in that way he had of putting things behind him as to the message would you like to tell me what it is and let me judge i considered his suggestion realizing that it was exactly what i wanted to do i took a deep breath trying to keep my voice steady i had to repeat the words two or three times to be certain i knew them by heart tell jonathan that i lied i did it for mothers sake but it has to be set right my father frowned and thats it yes in a nutshell i was tense waiting afraid he might read something in the words that i hadnt i dont see theres been any harm done waiting until now to pass it on to his brother he replied slowly but you have a responsibility not to put it off again a duty to the dead is sacred i neednt tell you that i lied i did it for mothers sake i repeated the words in my head i couldnt tell my father that with time those words had become sinister it was only my imagination running rampant of course still i was relieved that hed found them unremarkable its not your place to sit in judgment you know and there it was again that sixth sense that told him what i was thinking there must be a dozen explanations perhaps he tried to make himself seem braver than he was or safer than he was or perhaps theres a girl involved someone his mother had hoped he might marry one day and hed lied about how he felt toward her men do strange things in the excitement of going off to war make promises they cant keep get themselves involved more deeply than they might have done otherwise if arthur graham had wanted you to know more hed have explained why his message mattered so much for whatever reason he didnt and that was the crux of it arthur had never told me anything and id been afraid that it meant there had been someone else it wasnt merely vanity i had listened to too many men in pain in delirium on the point of being sent home dying the dying often regretted a hasty marriage that would leave the girl a widow sometimes they regretted not marrying and how many letters had i written to girls who had just told the wounded man that she was expecting his child and he would turn his head to the wall it cant be mine they sometimes murmured in despair or they were in a fever to find a way to marry her before the baby came war and women they seemed to go together there were other worries facing the wounded of course debt a familys need a mothers illness how to live with one arm or without sight but arthur had said it has to be set right i heaved a sigh not of relief but of selfknowledge arthur graham had confided a responsibility to me id made a promise to carry that through and there was an end to it his past was never mine to judge and caring hadnt altered that i must go to kent id done both arthur and his family a disservice by putting off doing what id sworn to do if nothing else they should have a chance to carry out arthurs last wish their duty and not mine honor above all things id heard my father drum that into his subalterns and his younger lieutenants what i needed now was to hear my father say that it wasnt selfishness that had held me back after all it had been a matter of another duty and id had to answer that call first that arthur hadnt misplaced his trust to put it bluntly i wanted comforting but he didnt answer that need and i couldnt ask my own guilty conscience nattered at me instead and the colonel was right there was no excuse for failing in ones duty no comfort to be given i thought bitterly whatever i discovered in kent would teach me that dying heroes sometimes had feet of clay then my father said gently bess if youd gone down with britannic there would have been no one to deliver his message which brought me back to the nightmare that had haunted me on my long journey home full circle i cant go now i gestured to my arm you arent fit enough to travel again just now and you must write to this brother first and ask if the family will receive you your mother would tell you that war or no war the rules of courtesy havent changed he smiled you do know how to reach the grahams he made me memorize the address as well my father studied my face i wanted to squirm as id done as a child when id got caught in a mischief he said its not wise to get close to a soldier bess ask your mother i wanted to cry but i forced myself to smile for his sake yes so youve told me a solicitor a banker a merchant prince but never a soldier but in my mind i could still see arthurs face the worst of it was i knew very well hed have done everything in his power to carry out my last wishes how could i have let him down besides i would probably have never known about that other girl if hed lived chapter three somerset late december my arm was stubborn and refused to heal properly by christmas i still couldnt brush my hair with that hand it was so weak dr price fretted over it threatening to send me to a specialist in london my mother urged me to go anyway to see what could be done youre lucky theres been no infection what with the cut there will be a scar im afraid well ask nora for some lotion or ointment to make it look a little less angry the gash had gone deep very deep the scar was raised and ugly still im not worried mother bones take their time you know lets wait another week but it was the duty of mothers to fuss and truth was i was glad to be home for a bit leaving decisions to others my father on the other hand was after me to exercise my arm theyll not take you back again until its strong enough he warned me you cant swim in this weather worst luck but we can have you sit by the bath and move your arm back and forth in warm water that should help its what they did for my leg in india hed broken it playing polo ill try i promised and did i also had my own ways of keeping the arm working exercises id learned aboard britannic listening to doctors instruct wounded men muscles atrophy without use theyd explained leave a limb in a cast too long and it will be worthless a baby could knock you over but this and men had done their best crying sometimes from the pain or the frustration as they worked id learned an entirely new vocabulary from my patients most of it unacceptable even to tease my father i found myself thinking at one point that in coming home wounded id somehow stepped back into the old pattern of parent and child it was strange after being responsible for lifeanddeath decisions in a hospital ward id grown used to responsibility and consequences to holding back my own emotions in order to give comfort to someone else to handling recalcitrant patients or men so far gone in delirium they thought they were still fighting the germans now i was tucked up in bed with a glass of warm milk just as id been at seven when i had measles the truth dawned on me slowly my mother and father missed the old bess and they were still recovering from the shock of britannic going down it must have been days before they had had news of me whether i was alive or drowned and so i drank the milk without complaint and let them heal too one day my father stopped by my chair in the small parlor where i was trying to read have you done anything more about your promise i wrote to jonathan graham i asked to meet him adding that it concerned his late brother you want to see this girl for yourself i think the one arthur abandoned he was half teasing half serious not at all i answered with more heat than i wanted to hear in my voice i must deliver my message in person its what i was asked to do arthur told me over and over againa letter was useless i had to speak to jonathan facetoface jonathan may be at the front no ive asked friends apparently hes at home as well convalescing then go before your leave is up yes i shall he said nothing more but a week later he brought me a letter from the post and dropped it in my lap i took it up dreading it thinking it must be my orders my father said theyve answered and i turned over the envelope the sloping handwriting was unfamiliar but the return address i knew all too well opening the letter i scanned the contents quickly it appears that jonathan graham is willing to see me to conceal my relief i added dryly hes probably bored to tears or else hes already got his orders to return to the front im to come at my convenience and thursday next will do very well my father laughed then added you arent ready to drive my own motorcar the one id fought my father for was now in the stables collecting dust tucked safely out of range of the zeppelin raids on london since the colonel refused to sanction the purchase id had to ask one of my male friends to advise me i wanted the independence a motorcar could give me i hadnt counted on it breaking down during my first visit home my father i told you so written all over his face had brought simon brandon with him to ferry me home while he consigned the offending motorcar to a nearby smithy simon brandon was younger than my father by more than twenty years hed risen in the ranks to become the colonels regimental sergeant major and was nearly as domineering but much easier to cajole he treated my mother like the princess royal and rumor had it that he was in love with her because hed never married as usual rumor had got it wrong i can manage quite well i told my father now there were times when i drove ambulances in france and anything at gallipoli that needed being driven including an officers motorcar when he lost his leg my dear its the train or else i drive you i didnt want him going to kent with me very well the train then ill see to it meanwhile simons invited you to luncheon my father drove me to the station and saw me off with misgivings he kept to himself my mother had scolded me warning me against taking a chill worried that the grahams wouldnt look after me properly wanting to keep me home and safe for as long as possible she didnt see me off claiming the press of getting my uniforms ready before my orders came but i knew she was afraid of crying if it had been left to her id never be out of her sight again it was a measure of how frightened shed been she had said to my father once when she thought i was not within hearing with that arm broken she would have drowned it had been a cry for comfort but my father had answered her and she didnt dont make her timid my dear courage will keep her safer than fear my mother had said to me afterward your father is a fool when i asked her why shed shrugged men generally are shed retorted and changed the subject i had found myself wanting to hug her but i didnt dare knowing she would have wondered why and probably guessed she is good at reading hearts my mother the trains carriages were filled with eager young men on their way to war leaning out their windows and talking excitedly to others boarding at each station i looked at their faces and felt sad the captain of artillery sitting next to me said under his breath little do they know when a rousing cheer went up as we pulled out of the next small town we werent winning and the killing would go on and on that was the fate of trench warfare of a stalemate neither we nor germany could break id seen that the captain wore one arm in a sling as well and i asked him where hed served france he answered im on my way back again is your arm healed near enough i dont have to carry a rifle or a pack itll do how is yours healing i had to admit it was not doing as well as id hoped he knew jack franklin as it turned out and we spent the journey to london in conversation jack had been our neighbor before hed married and gone to live in warwick my father had had high hopes for him in the army and captain banks promised to give jack our best wishes when next they met in london i changed trains for tonbridge and we rolled through a dreary rain that lasted almost all the way lashing the windows and dampening my spirits after sevenoaks i was alone in the compartment and i removed my sling tucking it in the small case beside me flexing my fingers i gingerly tested my arm if i was careful it would do the early dark caught up with me long before id reached my destination but through the rainwet windows i could see rolling downs the lights of farms and the houses of villages through which we passed with only the briefest of stops the fruit trees were bare but i had seen clouds of blossoms coming up from dover the spring we arrived in england from the colonels last posting in india and their beauty had taken my breath away after the dry featureless expanse of the northwest frontier now the hop fields were flat and hardly recognizable save for the oast houses like broken windmills in one pasture sheep huddled backs to the wind and almost invisible in the shelter of a stone wall a man in a cart crouched wretchedly under his umbrella as he waited for the train to thunder past a crossing i think my resolution dropped with the weather and i wished myself home again sitting by the fire in comfort in his letter jonathan graham had told me that i would be met but when the train pulled into tonbridge the winter dusk had turned to darkness and there was no one waiting as i stepped out onto the windswept platform for a mercy the rain had stopped i could see the station master talking with the engineer and so i walked into the booking office where it was warmer it too was as empty then through the front window i saw the flicker of a lamp in the street beyond and heard the sound of a horse being turned i went through to find a small dogcart there and a driver muffled to the teeth against the cold miss crawford yes im miss crawford he grudgingly got down to fetch my valise and my small case from the platform then returned to hand me up into the cart but i shook my head ill ride with you instead reaching for the blanket folded on a seat i realized that it was colder than i was without a word he settled me into the seat next to him as he climbed up to join me his bulk blocked the worst of the wind i huddled beside him and set my teeth to stop them from chattering in the cold air my arm ached broken bones tend to do that the horse snorted and began to walk on and i said to the man holding the reins what is your name please robert it was all the information i got for several miles as we left the lights of tonbridge behind and the darkness settled around us like a cloak the blanket across my knees began to unthaw and i kept my gloved fingers cradled in an edge of it i watched houses and then the occasional farm pass by windows lit people no doubt just sitting down to their tea i felt remarkably alone and even unwanted i could sense roberts hostility and in a way understood itit was my fault hed had to drive out on a night like this we must have traveled five miles or more beyond the last village when we came to a large rambling house set back in the trees behind a high wall it was brick and every window seemed to be blazing with light at first i thought it must be my destination ready to welcome me but as we passed by robert must have sensed my surprise the asylum he said and fell silent again the horse trotted on the sound of his hooves and the cart wheels filling the night robert reached behind him into the cart and brought out a rug i hadnt seen in the darkness at the station he thrust it toward me and i took it gratefully wrapping it over my shoulders the wind seemed to cut straight through my traveling coat touching my skin with sharp fingers some time later the carts nearside wheels dropped off the road into a deep rut the jolt caught me off guard and i was nearly thrown from my seat onto the verge roberts hand came out in the nick of time and caught me holding me back as the horse regained the road and the cart stopped rocking wildly i hadnt even had time to cry out it had all happened so fast but for the quickness of the man beside me id have been pitched out on my head or worse perhaps on my stillhealing arm i shuddered at the close call and robert said beg pardon i must have dozed off my heart was racing and i could still feel his fingers in that bruising grip id have been happy to see a stoat or a fox along the road any living thing by the time i could glimpse the lights of another village ahead of us cottages houses then a pub the bells its sign swinging in the wind a cricket pitch on the other side of the road and then the tall silhouette of a church set on a slight rise behind a low stone wall to one side was what must have been the rectory a lovely tall black and white tudor house and through the mullioned windows i could see a comfortable parlor done up in blue and cream with a pair of china dogs set on the windowsill their backs to the stormy night we turned the other way under the sheltering limbs of two great trees overhanging the wall and then another turning brought us into a lane with four or five houses in a row the largest of them was georgian and backed up to the far side of the churchyard gardens that must have been colorful in summer lay in the shadow of an iron fence and a gate set into it led up the walk to an elegant door a single lamp burned above it and the horse drew to a halt as if he knew he had come home robert got down and came around to help me taking the rugs from me then he opened the iron gate for me and carried my valise and case up the walk before lifting the knocker a maid answered the summons almost at once opening the door wide and welcoming me inside robert set down my bags then disappeared into the night as the door shut on him mrs graham asked me to show you directly to your room miss crawford theres dinner in half an hour ill come for you to show you the way and you are susan miss she bobbed a curtsey smiling in welcome thank you susan i was glad not to have to present myself to arthurs mother travel worn and with muddy hems the hall floor was patterned parquet and on a gateleg table between two doorways stood a vase with dried flowers arranged in it above it was a fine oil painting of a black horse and i wondered if this was merlin the wise as i followed susan up the lovely curving stairs and down a wide passage i thought of my mothers last words of advice if you wish to make an impression my dear wear the blue gown as always she was right the blue gown suited this house very well there was a fire on the hearth of the room i was taken to and warm water in the pitcher on the stand i washed my face and hands then changed my clothes i was just tidying my hair when susan came to collect me we went down to a dining room where only one end of the long table had been set a woman was standing near it waiting for me arthurs mother she was not at all as id pictured her in my mind somehow the words i did it for mothers sake had prepared me for someone small and fragile and perhaps more than a little domineering instead she was younger than id expected and tall with graying dark hair blue eyes and a confident carriage that spoke of years of managing her family on her own after her husbands death i looked for any resemblance to her son and decided it was in the height the dark hair the strong chin she greeted me with a warm smile of welcome but i knew very well shed been examining me even as i examined her hello my dear robert tells me you came close to a nasty fall are you all right should i send for dr philips no harm done i said lightly thank you for asking her eyes were searching my face you knew arthur well did you id met that look before from mothers and sisters and wives wanting to know how their dear boy had gone to his death wanting some crumb of comfort and love to fill the emptiness that lay ahead of them he was very brave i said when he was wounded he took it well i often read to him and a few of the others when i had time or wrote letters for them i wrote his last one to you he couldnt hold a pen you see and he wanted desperately to tell you how much he cared yes ive cherished that letter a fine young man i think in many ways he was my favorite though a mother shouldnt say that should she he was a man any mother could be proud of i answered with sincerity though i had said it many times in many letters to women i would never meet yes yes he was remembering her manners she said please sit here by me jonathan will be down before long hes here on convalescent leave arthur told me he had three brothers are they all in the army her face clouded timothy isnt servinghe wasnt allowed to join the army you know he was born with a clubfoot and although he walks very well he was considered unsuitable he feels rather cut up about that with everyone else enlisting or already at the front im sorry dont be to tell you the truth its one less worry for me ive suffered enough with arthur and johnnie before she could tell me about the last son jonathan walked in i knew him at once because of his wound he was a paler version of arthur his hair a lighter brown his eyes a less vibrant shade of blue he had a terrible scar across his face shrapnel at a guess it was still half covered by bandages but i could see where the wound began high on his forehead near the hairline and then the last thin line of it passing down his jaw and back to his chin his mother made the introductions and he shook my hand where were you wounded i asked before i thought but i was used to talking to bandaged men and more often than not they wanted it known where they had served mons he said shortly and went to kiss his mothers cheek she turned to him with a softness that spoke of her love for him and i glanced away it was such a private moment and touching another man leaning on his cane came in at that moment he was fairer than either of his brothers with grayblue eyes again i was introduced this time to timothy and he said at once mother tells me you knew arthur i was his nurse for some time yes he nodded we were grateful for your letter afterward its hard to think of him dying so far away we expect him to walk through the door any day smiling calling to one of us they spoke of arthur with such warmth almost as if he were still alive it occurred to me that under different circumstances i might have been brought here after the war arthurs arm linked with mine as he presented me to his family what would they have thought of me then not as florence nightingale who had nursed their brother but as someone who mattered to him arthur had asked me to marry him before he lost his leg hed been in high spirits after the doctor moved him from guarded to satisfactory condition believing hed heal now id smiled and lightly given my usual response to impetuous proposals you must speak to my father first he outranks you you see it hadnt put him off as id expected on the contrary hed wanted to write to the colonel directly but nothing more had been said about that after the amputation susan appeared with the first course as we were sitting down as she served us we talked about people we might know in common about london about the sinking of britannic i found myself thinking that this was a family like so many others in britain tonight trying to pretend that life was going on as it had before despite the empty chair at the table and the shadow hanging over jonathans future the door opened again and i thought that the third son must be making his appearance at last but it was an older man who stepped into the room and nodded to mrs graham he was tall with broad shoulders and a barrel chest a handsome man with thick fair hair that was graying i realized all at once that this was robert i hadnt seen him clearly in the dark muffled as he was in scarves his hat pulled down against the wind there was an air of impatience about him and his manner was very different from that of the man in the cart hardly a servant was my first thought yet hed been sent to fetch me if you need me ill be in my room he said and was gone mrs graham turned to me i dont know if arthur told you about robert hes a douglas a cousin on my fathers side he was such a blessing to us when my husband died there was no one to take my sons in hand and robert saw to it that they were given the opportunities my husband would have wished robert taught them to ride and to shoot and to be men arthur had said nothing at all about him but i made polite noises and she turned to another subject the journey from somerset i could see that i wouldnt have an opportunity tonight to speak to jonathan privately tomorrow i thought would be best i had the feeling as the evening wore on that arthurs mother was anxious as if shed wanted me to come here and now that i was under her roof wasnt certain how to entertain me she was often silent as jonathan and timothy talked to me about the war and i tried several times to change the subject for her sake we finished our meal and went into the parlor where the tea tray had been taken after another hour or more of polite conversation i excused myself saying that the journey had been tiring and went up to bed i carried with me the picture of a close family still grieving for their loss in the morning susan tapped lightly on my door and took me down to the dining room where breakfast was waiting jonathan and timothy must have come and gone judging from two empty cups and saucers on the table mrs graham was just helping herself to a dish of eggs from the sideboard i filled my own plate and sat down taking up my cup mornings arent my best time and i let the tea flow through me waking me up mrs graham was cheerful and the conversation general until wed finished eating and then she said setting her knife and fork across her plate you have a message you said from arthur i set down my knife and fork as well though i hadnt finished eating the message is for jonathan mrs graham though arthur sent you his dearest love yes i understand but surely you could share it with me imim not sure that was what arthur wished me to do but i think jonathan should be the one to answer that she was frowning at me her back straight her shoulders squared as if bracing herself for an argument and then she relaxed of course youre right my dear its just that im hungry for any crumb of comfort you cant imagine what it is like to know your child is buried at sea in a foreign place and will never come home again i havent been able to believe hes gone forever i tell myself and then i slip into the habit of putting it out of my mind i thought she was cajoling me but i was saved from an answer when jonathan came into the room and said miss crawford if youve finished your breakfast perhaps youd like to see the memorial to arthur in the church yes i saidnot too quickly i fervently hoped but my relief must have been plain on my face i would like that ill ask susan to fetch your cloak while you finish your toast thank you while mrs graham watched with a mixture of frustration and worry i drained my cup and rose to leave the room as i reached the door she said forgive me for pressing wont you yes of course im sorry to have made you uncomfortable and i was gone hurrying to the hall where susan was just bringing down my cloak jonathan was standing there his face unreadable but one hand was clenching and unclenching as if he dreaded what was to come i wondered fleetingly if he already knew about the girlor was she merely a figment of my own runaway imagination i was beginning to think she was certainly susan who must have been closer to forty than thirty wasnt a likely candidate for arthurs affections we went down the front steps and turned toward the churchyard the wind had dropped and the air was crisp i said as we walked im afraid ive upset your mother but arthur was still very much in command of his faculties when he asked me to speak directly to you i dont think he intended i broke off we were close jonathan said but somehow i hadnt got that impression from arthur hed not spoken of his brothers except in passing i knew very little about any of them we opened the iron gate and walked through it into the churchyard my boots crunching in the cold dead grass above us the golden stone of the church apse led the eye upward to the pinnacles gracing the top against the bluegray sky they stood out like sentinels the church door was not locked and we went inside where the cold stone seemed to hold on to the stormy chill of last night i pulled my cloak around me as jonathan led me to the brass plaque that had been set in the wall between two windows the stained glass spilled color onto the floor at my feet and i looked up to the figures of saints high above my head before i could bring myself to look directly at arthurs memorial he was gone there was a finality to that as i read the name and dates engraved into the brass beneath them were the words beloved son and brother in graceful script i very much wanted to reach out and touch it but not with jonathan there i had not been at the service when his body was committed to the sea i had been standing in the operating theater fighting to save another life i had felt the ship slow then resume her speed and not allowed myself to think why i swallowed my tears and said as steadily as i could he would have been pleased yes we turned away without another word and walked back into the sunlight standing in the shadows of the west door jonathan said i expect ill be as ready now as i ever will be what was it arthur entrusted to you to say to me chapter four i turned away looking at the gleaming white walls of the rectory in their black framework the tiny panes of glass set into the windows like small diamonds glittering in the morning sun go on there was impatience beneath the urging i took several seconds to think to wonder if id done the right thing in coming here the message seemed different suddenly futile and somehow infringing on something i didnt understand i tried to set the stage so that jonathan graham could see what i had seen he had finished his medicines and he took my hand pulling me closer i thought at first that he was having difficulty seeing me but it was only to drop his voice so that no one else could hear him he asked me if id carry a message to his brother for him it was very brief i had no difficulty remembering it tell jonathan i lied i did it for mothers sake but it has to be set right and afterward he made me promise to deliver the message to you in person he was watching me his gaze intent tell jonathan i lied i did it for mothers sake but it has to be set right yes exactly as he told me and what did you make of his request i could feel my face flushing i could hardly say what had gone through my mind over the weeks that had passed it would have sounded presumptuous even to hint at it i answered only i dont know lieutenant graham id hoped you would and he didnt explain to you what it was he was trying to convey no to be frank i dont think he would have said anything at all if he hadnt realized he was dying but something was preying on his mind i could see that and it was disturbing enough for him to try to do something about it while he could still speak then why not write it in your letter i dont know i said again it was almost as if i stopped as if what it was almost as if he hadnt wanted to put it in writing he was insistent that i come to you personally but arthur has been dead some months if it were a pressing matter surely it would have been better to come here at once i prevaricated you were in france lieutenant graham and there were my duties as well and this i indicated my arm im sorry i wasnt thinking he continued to stare at me but his mind was elsewhere then he said again and thats all of the message youre quite sure yes ive given it word for word thank you miss crawford it was kind of you to carry out my brothers wishes but i think you liked him a little is that true he was a very likable man i answered honestly very popular with the men and with the nursing staff and he said nothing about this matter until he wasdying to my knowledge no none of the other nurses told me anything about promises but then you didnt tell them either did you no why do you think he chose you i knew i was pink again because i took the time to be with him during his last hours i assure you he wasnt the only one i watched over or read toor wrote letters for its hard to explain lieutenant graham but when you are sitting by a wounded man and hes telling you what to say to his mother or his wife or his sweetheart theres an intimacy that cant be avoided i have had men say things to me that were terribly personal messages to their wives that they would never have shared in any other circumstance i paused its almost as if im not there theyre simply talking aloud but i hear these things and try not to listen at the same time if you understand what im saying jonathan graham nodded yes ive asked the nursing sisters to write letters for me when the bandaging covered my eyes after a moment he roused himself from whatever thoughts were distracting him and said again thank you it was a great kindness i hope youll consider staying the weekend i think my mother would be grateful if you could i dont wish to impose its no imposition she would take it as a great favor we walked on the wintry sun trying to peer through the bare trees have you been to owlhurst before miss crawford no its my first visit to this part of kent we were once famous for our owls on the far side of the churchyard theres whats left of the great expanse of wood that covered much of kent in the distant past an almost impenetrable forest when my parents were first married im told they could walk through it of an evening and count two or three species of owl calling in the dusk i daresay theyre still there those owls i like to think of the continuity of life here it helps a little in the trenches i remember arthur saying something about them he could never find where they nested jonathan smiled that was arthur for you always trying to get to the bottom of things my mother will tell you he was a very clever child interested in science but with a leaning toward the law i expect hed have become a solicitor but for the war i said nothing arthur had told me that he had turned away from the law as a profession i tried to remember his words theres evil in goodness and goodness in evil hed said ive seen too much of the evil in the law to be comfortable with it what would you like to do then when the war is over i think id like to grow coffee in east africa somewhere new where i could start over why should you wish to start over because there would be no memories of the past infringing on the present id thought he meant memories of the war now i wondered lieutenant graham id like very much to ask you a question though you neednt answer if you dont wish to of course what is it can you right this wrong for your brother is it in your power why should you doubt me his voice was cold it isnt doubting you so much as wanting to believe that his faith in both of us wasnt misplaced i saw his distress this was on his conscience if you will he was helpless to rectify what lay in the past but he thought you might be able to do that for him id like to leave here with the feeling that arthur will rest easier now your sense of duty does you credit miss crawford you can rely on me to see to it that arthurs last wishes are treated with the greatest respect indeed thank you lieutenant we made our way back to the house in silence and i tried to tell myself that i had faithfully kept my promise there was after all nothing more i could do or say and if arthur had trusted his brother i must believe he knew he could then why did i have this feeling that treating arthurs last wishes with the greatest respect wasnt the same as promising to carry them out i could almost hear the colonel sahibs voice walk away bess if arthur had wanted more from you hed have told you more the question really was would arthur have felt satisfied well to be fair it was possible that jonathan graham knew what it was arthur wanted but not how to go about it after all hed had only a matter of minutes to digest my message who are you to talk my conscience demanded after leaving your duty to the eleventh hour what would you have done my lass if lieutenant graham had died of his own wounds i sighed as we walked through the door and would have liked to go directly to my room for a bit but mrs graham was standing there waiting for us as if shed watched our progress from a window and she rushed me into the sitting room the instant id handed my cloak over to susan you must be freezing my child come and sit by the fire would you like something warm to drink no im fine mrs graham thank you you saw the memorial it wastouching i said trying to think how to answer yes i think hed have been glad of it jonathan had gone to some other part of the house and i wondered if he would tell his mother any or all of that message or what he would tell her i was just grateful now that she hadnt brought up the subject again after lunch she asked if id care to walk around the village for the sun is stronger now and it will be more comfortable it was the last thing i wanted the cold after the mediterranean sea was penetrating my arm preferred to sit by the fire but i smiled and said that i would and she sent me up for my coat muffled once more in scarf and gloves i followed her down the lane and into the churchyard i thought at first she was going to take me back to see the memorial instead we walked a little way among the gravestones and i could admire the lovely mellowed stone of the church above us its air of age was comforting like an anchoror a rockthat spoke of centuries past and centuries to come neither of us mentioned the raw graves marking where men had come home to die arthur might have been among them if his leg had waited another few weeks to turn septic in the sea there were no markers for the dead no place in the deep to mourn no place to leave flowers just degrees of latitude and longitude on a chart mrs graham nodded toward the rectory we have a new rector now and a new doctor times are changing but then nothing stays the same forever does it even ones children grow up and go off to die youre worried for jonathan i said dr philips tells me the bandages will be off in another fortnight after that it will be a matter of days before his orders come i could hear the pain in her voice and for once was thankful that my own mother had not had a son theyre in desperate need of men i said it was not what she wanted to hear she gave me a sharp glance and didnt answer we walked on down the street where brick houses lined the road one of them set back a little was covered in what would be honeysuckle and roses in summer their bare branches arched across the front of the house trembling in the wind mrs graham caught the direction of my interest and said thats the doctors surgery and just down there is the house that arthur would have had if hed lived its part of our property going to the eldest son on his marriage theres a caretaker now one of my school friends who fled london at the start of the war she was that certain the kaiser would sail up the thames before she could pack her boxes it was a handsome house with a front garden set off by a low wall and a cat curled on the doorstep waiting to be let in i smiled without realizing it and she said yes the cat goes with the house it or its ancestors have always lived there arthur was fond of cats did you know but he hadnt said anything to me about cats or dogs i would have replied if anyone had asked me that wed spoken of everything under the sun i realized now that everything hadnt included his childhood or his family how much had i told him about the colonel i couldnt remember wed lived in the present it turned out to be all there was though hed wanted a future at the next corner where a row of shops began we paused did you know this was once a famous smuggling area goods were brought up from the coast and hidden wherever the hawkhurst gang believed they were safe theres a hotel now where the inn stoodit provided the horses and wagons for the smuggled goods and the story has come down that an underground passage ran between the rose and thorn and the church we couldnt find arthur and his brothers one afternoonhe must have been twelve or thirteen at the time we finally discovered them in the church searching for the secret door to the tunnel i had to explain to them that nearly every village with a smuggling past has such stories of underground passages they were sorely disappointed i smiled as we turned back the way wed come it was probably a story the smugglers themselves invented to keep customs officials busy searching in the wrong places a little silence fell i could sense that mrs graham was on the point of asking me about what id told jonathan and i was bracing myself to meet her pleas i was grateful when a young man came out of one of the other houses wed just passed and called a greeting to her heavy with relief just the person i was after could i borrow your susan mrs graham ive got an emergency on my hands and betsy is with mrs booth awaiting the baby he caught up with us nearly out of breath and flushed with worry certainly not mrs graham answered him we have a guest at present and susan is indispensable she turned to me her face stiff with disapproval miss crawford this rude young man is dr philips my pleasure miss crawford and my apologies but im shorthanded and theres little time for polite exchanges i interrupted him im a trained nurse i said can i help in any way the doctor stopped short are you indeed oh thank god will you come with me he hesitated you arent put off by swearing are you not at all then i must take her mrs graham and return her to you later in the day forgive me but its urgent mrs graham wanted no part of this arrangement she said dr philips miss crawford will not accompany you you may have susanunder protestbut you must make certain shes back in time to serve our luncheon he glanced at me and then said miss crawford volunteered i believe ill have her back to you no harm done as soon as possible come along theres no time to waste dr philips mrs graham was indignant its quite all right mrs graham i have a duty to help forgive me but i must go i could see the anger in her eyes id disappointed her in some way but there was nothing i could do about it now dr philips he touched his nonexistent hat to her then took my arm and led me away his strides twice the length of mine i expect ive caused you no little trouble miss crawford but im rather desperate and my patient comes first ill do my best to smooth matters over for you he was a tall man prematurely graying with dark eyes a strong odor of pipe tobacco swirled in his wake as i tried to keep pace with him wed reached the house hed just come from and were hurrying up the walk whats the matter with your patient as i spoke i looked back mrs graham was standing where wed left her staring after us i turned away and followed dr philips through the door of the house dr philips was saying this is a man who suffers from shell shock you dont have any preconceived notions about that do you cowardice and all that no thats good he terrifies his poor wife but theres nothing she can do when he has one of his spells ill give him an injection and hell calm down but youll be there to see to it that he does himself no harm meanwhile i had had some experience with shell shock none of it the sort of thing i wanted to walk into the middle of not knowing the circumstances who is in the house with this manbesides his wife i asked no one at the moment worst luck its the housemaids day off and shes gone to cranbrook to visit her sister we stepped into the cold entry went through the inner doors and turned down a passage on the left side of the stairs a harried young woman stepped out of the nearest room she had been crying she said im sorry im sorry i didnt know what else to doi left him there i couldnt watch him any longer you did just the right thing mrs booker now run along to your mothers house and let her take care of you miss crawford and i will see to ted he was walking on as he spoke opening the last door along the passage pushing it wide for me to enter it was a small back parlor where a man sat in a chair in front of the windows a shotgun across his knees i stopped surprised i hadnt expected to find him armed small wonder the mans wife had been terrified come along ted philips said in a strong voice you arent going to kill yourself here in the house certainly not in front of this young woman you dont want to upset her do you let me take the gun and give you something for the pain from across the room ted booker stared at him unaware who the doctor was i could see the blankness in his eyes ignoring us he went on talking to invisible companions men he could see clearly and appeared to know well he was arguing vehement and insistent and profane it appeared that a sniper had already killed three of his men and he was on the field telephone asking someone to do something about it i can give you his range damn it his voice was ragged close to the breaking point we cant hold out much longer i tell you the huns got us in his sights he ducked then swearing and shouted someone stop that bastard no not you harry there was a garbled exchange as if he were struggling with another man the shotgun jerking wildly in his grip and then he cried out screaming harrys name over and over again springing to his feet and finally bending to someone lying there in front of him pleading with the man not to die i said quietly to dr philips who is harry his brother dear god no wonder this poor soul was distraught the doctor tried again but i could see he wasnt getting anywhere asking the man to buck up and put the past behind him ted booker was in a dark place no one else could reach but there might be a way ignoring the shotgun i crossed the room to take bookers arm we must get him to the dressing station i told him urgently hurry hes bleeding badly he shook me off harry speak to me for gods sake speak to me if you wait any longer hell die i reached out and took the shotgun away as his hands flexed open trying to help the wounded man i put the weapon behind me and dr philips was there i could feel his grip above mine then he stepped back i held on to bookers arm what rank was he do you know i asked dr philips in a low voice erlieutenant i think dont stand there staring lieutenant booker here take his shoulders ill get his feet he seemed to rouse himself looking up at me then telling harry it would be all right there was help now and then between us we lifted the wounded man i couldnt see and booker started out the door and down the passage with him between us urging me in his turn to hurry hurry confused as we entered the passage by the stairway booker hesitated i said that cot over there doctor this case is critical we put harry down at the foot of the stairs with dr philips hovering in the background well done lieutenant look heres someone to see to harry now sit down over thereyes out of the way i led him to a chair against the opposite wall put out a hand and dr philips set the needle into my palm here youre exhausted you must be calm when you see him again let me give you this the needle went home and ted booker started up i thought for an instant he was going to strike me steady young man or ill make you wait outside the tent i said harshly the voice of matron and not to be trifled with now sit down and be quiet while we do our work but he shook me off still calling to harry dr philips came up took his arm as i had done and said soldier youre in the way i cant worksit down see youre distressing the wounded man i turned my head to stare at himit didnt sound like dr philipss normal voice at all it sounded like a medical orderly giving orders we had found ourselves swept up in ted bookers nightmare playing our roles to an invisible audience booker distraught clung to him harry he began harrys in good hands you mustnt let your men down you know good example and all that we finally got through to booker and then he sat down on the floor and began to cry holding his dead brother in his arms and rocking him like a child it wouldnt be long now before the injection took effect i said softly to dr philips the shotgun get rid of it he turned to do as id asked and i bent over to touch bookers shoulder lieutenant come in here out of the rain ted booker got up stumbling a little and let me lead him toward the dining room halfway there he twisted free and went back calling for harry but his words had already begun to slur and it was just a matter of minutes before he was half conscious and easily led up the stairs to the nearest bedroom we got him onto the bed his shoes off his collar loosened and a blanket over him against the chill by that time he was out and snoring from the drug dr philips said thank you for your help you must have done this beforeyou got through to him i couldnt tell him id never dealt with such a severe case before not alone but id learned from dr paterson not to interrupt whatever world the patient inhabited it was easier to enter it and use it to help theyre accustomed to the sisters they usually mind well enough i was suddenly very tired a reaction to the tension wed been under one of these days hes going to do himself a harm he thinks he got his brother killed most of the time hes all right but today something set him off his wife sent the man next door to call me he was as bad as ive ever seen him hes in torment i said and it wont go away you cant keep him drugged no ill take the shotgun home with me and bury it in a closet i should have thought of looking for a weapon before this but truth is i didnt know it was even in the house until today we sat down on the two chairs in the room one by the window and the other near the bed dr philips looked as tired as i felt a long night i asked him he roused himself to answer a difficult delivery and another biding its time theres no doctor in the next village i work there as well when im sent for where did you serve france i was on britannic good god that explains why youre visiting the grahams arthur graham died on that ship yes i was there a putrid wound from what i hear the doctors tried amputation but the infection had advanced too far yes sadly once it has got a grip theres not much hope arthur was a strong young man but that seems to make little difference did you know arthur well i asked him i came here just before his first leave dr hadley had died from overwork if you want my opinion another doctor i know suggested i take over his practice because of the need im surprised you arent at the front yes well im not fit enough to go so they tell me i have a heart condition and yet youre working yourself into exhaustion because you feel guilty about not serving he smiled you are to the point arent you i was hoping to find someone who could tell me more about arthur graham i took care of him when he was wounded and i got to know him so i believed then i realize now how little that was wrong person dr hadley now had been the family physician for most of arthurs life he could have told you about measles and falls from a horse and whatever else you desired to know i smiled ive met jonathan and timothy but theres another brother isnt there im sure arthur told me he had three brothers i was reluctant to askhe might be dead they dont mention him apparently he did something rather dreadful and was sent away to prison i asked taken aback no hes in an asylum if you came down on the train you must have passed it on the road here the house ablaze with light how awful for the family peregrine is the eldest a half brother to the younger three a tragedy that we cant cure minds my father had told me that ambrose grahams first wife had died in childbirth peregrine would have been her son then but what did he do hes said to have killed someone one of the old spinsters here in owlhurst mrs clayton told me all about the family skeleton she said he strangled a girl in a moment of passion disconcertingly he grinned small wonder no one mentions peregrine i have to take most of that with a grain of salt he added in apology by my calculations peregrine was hardly more than fourteen when it happened mrs clayton is a wonderful old gossip i love her dearly but she has a lively imagination fed in part by senile dementia still he was banished from owlhurst at a young age and in the dark of night according to what ive gathered would you care for some tea its the one thing i can manage along with toast if my cook left me id starve to death ted booker was deeply asleep after making certain we went down to the kitchen and dr philips found the tea things blew up the fire in the stove and soon had the kettle on the boil it was fairly decent tea and i told him so afterward we went to sit with ted booker for another half hour then dr philips stood up stretched his shoulders ill leave you here shall i until i can find someone to replace you he wont be any trouble for several hours hell be dry as a desert and have a thundering headache when he wakes up he took my hand thank you for volunteering i hope i havent upset any plans mrs graham may have made for your entertainment how long are you staying just the weekend he nodded wretched beginning to your visit but there you are and he was gone his footsteps echoing on the stairs i looked out the window and saw he had the shotgun under his arm broken open i went back to my chair and made myself as comfortable as i could listening to bookers heavy breathing thinking about his anguished obsession with his brothers death and in the silence i also considered what dr philips had told me about peregrine a tragedy that we cant cure minds arthurs words came back to me then tell jonathan i lied i did it for mothers sake but it has to be set right what had to be set right had arthur objected to his brother going to the asylum instead of prison but said nothing was that it but if hed gone to prison surely hed have been hanged no not that young i knew little about prisons but enough to understand that an asylum might well be a better choice for a deranged man perhaps the authorities had tried to spare the family the nightmare of a trial and conviction by sending peregrine to where he mightor might notget the treatment he needed at least there he was no longer a threat to anyone he wouldnt be the first nor the last to be put away in that fashion i shivered remembering the lights in every room was a madhouse better than hanging only peregrine could answer that if he understood at all what hed done and what choices had been made for him and then it occurred to me that id worried about trouble with a girland in a way perhaps my instincts had been right but in a far different sense than i could ever have guessed had the dead girls family been considered or had their wishes their feelings been swept away in the rush to protect mrs graham and her children from scandal belatedly faced with his own death had arthur suddenly come to realize that they hadnt been consulted that they had been wronged he would have wanted jonathan to recognize that revelation as well at the same time he wouldnt have wished for this to distress his motherand he must have felt that he couldnt confide the family skeletons to me or to paper if the girl had come from a poor family what recourse had they had against the grahams and their money or influence i found myself feeling a new respect for arthur id been sitting in that same uncomfortable chair for another half hour wrestling with my own thoughts when the outer door opened and a voice called tentatively up the stairs where are you i stepped to the door and answered quietly who is it im sally bookers mother were in here the bedroom nearest the stairs she came up heels clicking on the treads a small grayhaired woman with lines of worry on her face is he all right she peered in the room then sighed i dont know whats to become of him he was the most wonderful young man i was so happy when sally married him and now look at him he cant help it i said in defense of booker yes i know that it doesnt matter does it hell never be the same and sally is at her wits end i feel so deeply for both of them are there any children yes a boy hes away at his cousins thank god she took a deep breath then said im marion denton im elizabeth crawford im here to visit the grahams and dr philips commandeered me to help yes thats what dr philips told us when he looked in to let us know how ted was faring thank you for your help i dont know how we would have managed the doctor said it was easier with a woman here that surprised me sally isnt able to cope with ted in these moods shes his wife i said simply thats harder true ted coughed and then moaned a little in his sleep he doesnt rest at night you know thats the roughest time for him he lost his brother i understand they were twins im told its harder with twins she came in to take the chair that dr philips had occupied and we sat in companionable silence for a time then she said how did you come to know the grahams are you a relation no i was a nursing sister on britannic when arthur was brought onboard i was with him when he died i was fond of arthur a very nice boy who grew into a very nice young man timothy and jonathan seemed to collect trouble the way a dog collects burrs theyre closer in age of course and what one couldnt think of the other could their father died when they were very young it isnt surprising they ran a little wild mrs grahams cousin did what he could to manage them but they were headstrong of course they turned out well enough i must say i thought for a time that sally might choose johnnie or tim i didnt know peregrine well the family always claimed he was a little slow a little different but i never saw it myself still his tutor despaired of him and he must know better than i she turned to stare at the man on the bed so was ted a nice boy i was that fond of him and he was a good husband to sally look at this househe saw to it that she wanted for nothing and now she cant bear to come here to him shes begged me to send him back to hospital where they know what to do with his kind maybe it would be best after all if he used that shotgun i dont know what peace hell ever have i was shocked he cant help but relive his brothers death he feels the burden of responsibility its not something one gets over easily but thats the point isnt it his brother is dead its time to move on and live for his wife and son its not that easy i repeated trying to make her see that his memories were beyond ted bookers control but she had no experience of war or any other horrendous event that shocks the mind and her callousness was in defense of her daughter i might as well have been talking to the wall she turned to me whats not easy about remembering your family the boy is afraid of him and sallys told me that when she promised to love him in sickness and in health there was nothing said about madness it isnt madness shell shock is an affliction of the brain i call it madness to sit in a dark room and talk to the dead and threaten to use that shotgun i tried taking it away once but he came raging over to my house and demanded it back and i was afraid to say no it takes time no it doesnt he needs to brace up like a man and say goodbye to his brother and remember hes still alive with a family looking to him for love i lost my patience you werent in the trenches with him mrs denton you dont know what its like when one mistake kills dozens of men right in front of your eyes where a simple lapse in concentration means youre hanging on the wire dying and no one can bring you back without dying beside you you dont smell the dead with every breath and know that some of whats nasty under your boots were your friends before they were blown to bits she replied righteously yes thats all very well isnt it thats in france where such things happen this is kent and he must learn the difference it was useless instead of trying to persuade her i suggested that she have a long talk with dr philips to see what could be done to help ted booker cope he doesnt have any answers except for the powders he gives ted that make him like thisasleep and useless for hours at a time how is he ever to earn a living and support a wife and child i ask you perhaps you and sally ought to visit such a hospital yourselves before deciding where your soninlaw belongs i suggested i trained in one and it was heart wrenching but this woman could only see her daughters misery and the anguish that drove ted booker into the past was as foreign to her as the monkey gods of india or the typhoons that killed thousands in the flat deltas below calcutta the outer door opened and dr philipss footsteps rang on the stairs he came in looked at the two of us sitting there in a huffy silence and then crossed to the bed to examine ted be careful he doesnt choke he said he cant fend for himself just now yes ill be careful mrs graham is very upset with me she wants you to come back to the house straightaway shes a guest she tells me and not here for your convenience surely youve found someone to sit for a while hes harmless poor man as he is yes ive found someone but shes nearly as frightened of ted as his wife is she needs the money and so shell come whats to become of him back to hospital i fear mrs denton here and her daughter have had enough i cant say that i blame them but booker is my patient and i had hoped that in surroundings he knew from before the war there was comfort what set him off this morning it was mrs denton who answered me its their birthdayhis and his brothers i felt a wave of sadness poor man i went on out of compassion ill sit with him a little longer if you like but the doctor answered with a shake of his head mrs graham will nail my medical degree to the church door if i leave you here a moment longer can you find your way back or do you need a guide no ill be all right stay with your patient goodbye mrs denton i hope that all will be well with your daughters marriage before very long she thanked me and i went down the stairs and into the street the wind was at my back as i walked and i looked at the houses on either side of the bookers arthur had told me that this was once ironmaking country and so it had prospered but the trees that fed the furnaces had gone long ago and now it was pasturage for sheep and fields of corn and hops that kept the villages flourishing i found myself thinking that the grahams had secrets as painful as ted bookers it wasnt surprising now that arthur hadnt told me about his brother hed have had to explain too much and so it was easier to say nothing had arthur and peregrine been close as children they were nearest in age how had mrs graham managed to tell her remaining sons why peregrine was being sent away surely not the truth not until they were older i understood now my feeling when i met her the feeling that she carried a heavy burden the church door was open as i came by and for a moment i stepped inside out of the wind not quite ready to return to the graham house i stood in the nave and looked up at the stainedglass windows shining in the bright sun before walking a little way down the aisle i didnt want to go as far as arthurs memorial i just needed the silence here to wipe away the stress of dealing with ted booker and then listening to his motherinlaw wish him dead she didnt know how near shed come this time to getting her wish someone was moving over my head the sound of a bench being dragged across the wooden floor the rustle of papers and i realized that whoever it was must be in the organ loft then without warning the stone walls filled up with the raw scrape of a saw biting into wood it was so unexpected that i walked down the aisle and looked up at the loft all i could see was a man bent over something and then as the sawing stopped hammering began as he stood up i could see his clerical collar and shirtsleeves rolled to the elbow he was looking down at his handiwork as if satisfied and then he gathered up his tools and moved toward the stairs i strode quietly up the aisle and was out the door before he could encounter me in the nave chapter five i had missed luncheon and was beginning to wish dr philipss culinary skills had extended to more than making a cup of tea but susan met me at the door with the news that mrs graham had asked her to set my meal aside mrs nicholsshes our cookhas gone to have a little nap come along into the kitchen its warmer there she urged and i followed her as she took my plate out of the warming oven she went on shyly ive been wanting a chance to ask you about mr arthur how it was at the end ive not got over his dying it doesnt seem real to me somehow i think of him away fighting as i always did and then must remind myself that hes not i told her what id told the grahams and she listened with tears in her eyes he never gave up hope i ended and everyone who knew him was saddened by his death he was as popular a patient as he was an officer and it was some time before the staff got over what had happened i could feel my own throat tightening i dont believe he suffered i lied for susans sake and he was unconscious for the last hours that was a kindness she nodded turning her back to me i saw her lift the corner of her apron and wipe her eyes she busied herself about my meal until she was sure her voice was steady then said huskily thank you for telling me i didnt feel right asking mrs graham she took his death hard she set a bowl of soup before me thick with barley and then slices of chicken with potatoes and swede after the tension of dealing with ted booker i was hungrier than id imagined and susan watched me eat with pleasure nice to see someone enjoying their food she said with a smile they never say much abovestairs i try to please but its hard to find the meat and vegetables theyre used to the war and all im at my wits end sometimes how long have you worked here since i was sixteen i came with my mother and after she left to live with my brother i took over as housekeeper more or less they dont call me that but they might as well give me the title i do the work were there others in service here before the war her face clouded a bit but she said half a dozen except for mrs nicholsand she was too old to consider war workthe women left one by one as the men went off to fight the footman died on the somme and we lost the coachman soon after youve only to walk in the churchyard to see how bad its been for us yes i noticed the graves and thats only them that died at home as i was finishing my pudding there were footsteps on the stairs and mrs graham came into the kitchen frowning my dear i didnt intend for you to be served here susan what were you thinking susan went red in the face and i said quickly the kitchen was warm and i didnt wish to put her out its my fault truly as id finished my meal she carried me off to the sitting room apologizing again for dr philipss demands on my time and skills he has no sense of what is right you didnt come here to deal with ted booker a tragedy im sure but not ours i dont know what your parents will think of me letting such a thing happen they will understand im trained to help it would have been difficult for me to say no to change the subject i asked about the rector and the work he was doing in the church its the war she said with a sigh as if that explained everything our sexton lost an arm at ypres but he can still carry out most of his duties and so he was given his old position back but the church needs constant upkeep and when no one is looking the rector mr montgomery sees to it there were protests at first but he reminded us that christ was a carpenter and i must say hes got quite good at what he does and it has saved church funds time and again but it isnt right somehow call me oldfashioned if you will but this making do at every turn is trying i said of course his own duties come first but it must give him a sense of satisfaction to know that the fabric of the church isnt suffering from the war she tilted her head as she considered that i hadnt looked at it quite that way but im sure youre right he was on a ladder inspecting the stainedglass windows last week when i went to see to the flowers and he said the saints were taking the war in stride i see now that he was pleased id taken his remarks to be ratherirreverent she got up to poke at the fire though it didnt need it perhaps i ought to ask robert to speak to him to offer help if hell accept it robert has been my right hand for so many years i dont know how i could have survived without him there was a warmth in her voice that conveyed the closeness of that relationship he was always my favorite cousin you know and the only one who stepped forward in my time of need i was so young when my husband died and the responsibility was overwhelming the estate to run my sons to care for i hardly knew where to begin and all these years later arthurs loss to endure i wondered where she was going with this unexpected confession of vulnerability she was a strong woman id felt that from the beginning i should have guessed what her purpose was turning from the fire she came to sit by me jonathan has spoken to me are you sure arthur didnt tell you the circumstances surrounding his message absolutely he entrusted me with that and nothing more i didnt add that my imagination had been busy filling in the blanks yes well its rather a mystery was he perhaps being given morphine or was he out of his head with fever hed been given something for pain but he knew what he was saying i think he died more comfortably knowing his duty was done duty thats an odd way of putting it she sighed i really dont know what to make of it i found myself wondering if that was true and she was intentionally blinding herself to what arthur wanted on the other hand i couldnt help the growing suspicion that she was probing to discover how much i knew about the matter it was hard to judge what lay behind her sad smile as she stared into the fire and i was feeling rather uncomfortable what surprised me was that jonathan had confided in his mother had she importuned him until he had given in i couldnt stop myself from commenting perhaps he expected jonathan to understand the message was meant for him after all i did it for mothers sake she repeated the middle of it as if trying to work it out but what was that sometimes its a girl her eyes flicked to my face what makes you think such a thing ive sat with many wounded men mrs graham and some of them were in love when they went off to war but their family or the girls family refused to let them marry that sometimes weighed heavily on their minds at the end they often wanted the girl to know that they regretted not marrying her my sons havent been involved with any young women her voice was harsh id met that resistance before mothers who believed that their sons had formed no attachments because they were too youngi knew better id written passionate letters to sweethearts from men barely old enough to enlist i didnt mean to suggestwe were speaking of what men at war talk about at the end when they know theyre dying she smiled that was pompous of me my dear certainly there was no one in owlhurst for whom arthur and jonathan had feelings and it was natural to assume there was a brief hesitation of course theres sally denton timothy was quite taken with her for a time but i cant believe it was a serious attachment then perhaps it was something left undone something that hed expected to set right when he came home again undone no surely not typical of arthur hed put everything in order before he sailed well i expect well never know what was in his mind you must be tired my dear after your experiences with dr philipss patient and ive selfishly kept you sitting here talking would you like to go up and lie down for a while i wouldnt but it was a dismissal as if she preferred to be alone with her thoughts and i was very happy to escape this conversation i said yes thats very kind of you if you dont mind not at all she put out her hand to take mine i cant tell you how happy it has made me to have you here i closed the sitting room door behind me and walked toward the stairs timothy was standing in the shadows of the hall and he turned as he heard me approach how is booker he asked resting quietly when i left what a nightmare it must be is there nothing to be done for him im afraid not somehow he must find the will and determination to let go of the past and often even that isnt enough his wife is afraid of him which doesnt help matters they say time i let my voice trail off we didnt know enough about shell shock to offer hope but i didnt want to admit that we were friends before the war ive seen little of him since he came back perhaps he needs his old friends i suggested tentatively to take his mind off his brother what do i know about war timothy asked bitterly its not something i could share with him is it the experience of the trenches the fear of dying when you go over the top it isnt war he needs to talk about you see its ordinary things the life that was id have married sally if she hadnt chosen ted theres that as well men and their wretched selfimportance if ted booker shoots himself there may be another chance for the two of you that shocked him and he looked at me with surprise and distaste i dont want her that way well think about ted booker in his dark world will you an effort on your part to save her husbands sanity will be a gift to her if you loved her youd want to do that he swore under his breath i wasnt trying to distress you but i just spent several hours watching a man who wants to die there are too many dead mr graham and im heartily sick of bodies to be buried i turned to walk away and he called to me did you see through arthur as easily as you see through me i dont know that there was anything to see through he was dying and that tends to sweep away the trivia of living he wanted something done and thats why i came because it was so important to him were you in love with him most of the girls were he was the pick of the grahams you know better than all of us i answered carefully i liked your brother very much perhaps more than i should but i watched him believe in his future and then i watched him give up all hope that made me feel something for him compassion pity affection sometimes you see briefly into someones heart and it becomes a bond between you that goes beyond friendship but not as far as passion youre blunt i smiled am i its my training i suppose and this time i walked on he didnt stop me from going my intent was to go up to my room but the house seemed airless suffocating i went to the kitchen instead and begged susan for a cloak from the entry pegs and walked out again this time i didnt turn in the direction of the rectory but went down the lane on which the graham house stood it ran for a short distance then split and i took the left fork the houses here were comfortable but not as fine as the grahams at the end of this lane where another crossed it i found myself in a row of small cottages some of them very old but well kept up i had walked almost to the end of these when a door opened and someone called susan is that you i turned to see an elderly woman peering out at me squinting to make out who i was it was then that i realized that susan must have lent me her cloak no im afraid not i answered im staying at the house and borrowed her coat to walk a bit then you must be half frozen come in to the fire do and ill make you a cup of tea i debated accepting but she was holding the door open for me and i turned up the path with a word of thanks as i gave her my name mines west matty west she shut the door behind me and shivered i think its colder this winter than last though its probably my bones a year older leading the way into the kitchen she pointed to the kettle on the boil its nearly ready sit down and warm yourself ill see to the pot as she bustled about she said youre at the house you say i didnt think they were taking on more servants at present actually i came because i knew arthur graham and was with him when he died she stopped her hands holding the saucers you knew mr arthur oh my dear tell me he died peacefully yes it was very peaceful i replied did you know him well i was housekeeper there while the boys were young then my son lost his wife and i came to keep house for him and his children oh youre susans mother when id been told shed gone to live with her son id assumed distance as in dorset or hampshire not in owlhurst indeed i am she went on setting cup into saucer finding a spoon and the jug of milk he was my favorite of the lads though mr peregrine was the eldest you know mr peregrine wasdifferent i was never sure why his father blustered and tried to make out that the boy was bright nothing wrong but his tutor said it was a shame about him it must have been true i put it down to his mother dying so young but then he never knew her did he when his father married again he was still hardly more than a baby they never speak of peregrine i ventured is he dead i felt guilty for lying but my curiosity got the better of my conscience as good as i remember him wellhappy and busy and strong he was where is he now she looked away its not my place to tell you miss he got himself into some trouble and was taken away mrs graham sobbed and cried and the doctor feared for her but i thought it was no more than an act she never loved mr peregrine the way she loved the others if she had to lose one of the boys it would have been mr peregrine shed have sacrificed she admitted to me that arthur was her favorite he was mine as well a finer young man youll never see when the word came he was dead she took to her bed for two days i left the subject and said susan has worked for the family a long time she would make a good wife and mother shes devoted to the grahams theyre all the family she needs id hoped there might be something between her and mr robert but there never was it was robert who brought me from the station hes a strange one keeps himself to himself but hes never failed the family i will say that for him mrs graham told me he was a blessing dealing with the boys after her husband died they were a rowdy lot right enough just the wrong age to lose a mans firm hand over them mr jonathan was the worst always coming up with this bit of mischief or that i was that surprised he went into the army not one to care for discipline was he his mother tried to get him off but he was determined to go and he got a medal for bravery as well hotheaded id have called him but i expect in a war thats useful i smiled sometimes yes the tea was ready and she poured my cup then her own im supposed to be having a nap i confided to her yes well youre young old bones feel the wind more how did it happen you were with mr arthur when he died i volunteered as a nurse i was assigned to britannic until she was sunk by a mine i didnt want to drive omnibuses or till the land my father had been in the army you see and i felt i had to do something for his sake nursing was much harder than id dreamed it was helping people yes i liked that but watching them suffer and die was dreadful im still not used to it susans mother nodded i was midwife for a time i just fell into it because i was the eldest of seven and my auntie had six and there was never time to call the doctor to them when a baby died i felt guilty as if id done something wrong i still dream of it from time to time not as much as before but sometimes those wee little faces so still and pale no future for them no love nor laughter nor happiness i understand i expect you do we talked for another quarter of an hour and then i took my leave she asked me to remember her to her daughter for she has no time for visiting just now with the maids all gone thats why i was glad to see what i took for susan coming down the road i promised and walked back to the house coming in again through the kitchen and passing on to susan her mothers greetings my brothers children are grown now and she keeps house for him but this is still her family as well i expect she was as glad of news of mr arthur as i was hardly happy news no would you like some hot chocolate miss i was just about to put the kettle on thank you no i was awash with tea im going up to my room susan grinned at me mrs graham said you was sleeping i didnt tell her otherwise i got to my room without encountering anyone and susan brought me a pitcher of hot water shortly afterward i sat down in a chair by the window and the next thing i knew there was a tapping at my door it was mrs graham inviting me down to the sitting room i went with her and we sat by the fire talking about the war and any expectation that it would be over by the spring will you be going back to sea she asked me at one point i expect to be assigned to another hospital ship yes but the decision isnt mine i might be sent to france youre a brave young woman she said thoughtfully i shouldnt have cared to be sunk as you were it was in all the papers you know but what do you expect of the hun im sure the mine was intended for bigger game not an empty hospital ship where did you live as a child in somerset no i traveled with my parents we lived in india for a time and then wherever my father was sent by the army i had a few friends my own age but most often i got to know the country through the servants she raised her eyebrows at that i explained we had any number of servants in india my ayah what you would call a nanny was particular about where i went and what i did but sometimes the gardeners or the grooms would take me to market with them our cook was a man and quite good he would bargain ferociously and he had a reputation for being a hard man to cheat you enjoyed this way of life did you among the heathen and their idols i knew nothing else you see since i was an only child my parents preferred to keep me with them rather than to send me to england to be educated i realize now how fortunate i was jonathan came in at that point and the subject was changed he was fretting over his wound it seemed to be irritated by the wind and hed stopped in at dr philipss in the hope of being given an ointment for it but he has his hands fulltwo births and of course booker the mans a coward he should be shut away with others of his kind i opened my mouth to argueand shut it firmly his mother said thats unkind youve known ted almost all your life hes not a coward its different mother when youre fighting you see a man in his true colors then whether or not he lets his side down your own brother has been called a coward because he isnt wearing a uniform it has hurt him very deeply surely you dont believe its true tim was born with a club foot its not his fault thats very different his brother came in at that moment and we all sat there with feathers on our faces as if wed eaten the canary timothy looked from his mother to his brother and said what is it we were talking about ted booker its a painful subject for your brother mrs graham answered him yes sometimes i think that medal has gone to his head they glared at each other but there was a tap on the door and robert stepped in theres been a message peregrine has pneumonia there was a stunned silence and what are we expected to do about it mrs graham asked after a moment he needs nursing they would like to bring him here jonathan said explosively no mrs graham spoke over him saying we dont have the staff to look after a sick man tell them that they think hes dying they would prefer that he do it elsewhere i could hear timothy swearing under his breath then we have no choice he said to his mother her face was set grim i want no part of this business for one thing its not safe hes no danger to himself or others in his present condition tell the messenger it isnt possible timothy said mother it was a warning and a glance passed between them if hes delirious if you like i could stay a day or two and care for him i said before id thought ive some experience with pneumonia they turned to stare at me as if id offered to climb to the roof and sweep the chimney its what i do i said nursing robert considered me he said to mrs graham its true she helped dr philips to manage booker this morning i saw mrs denton in the stationers shop she was regaling the marshalls with a full account you know thats not possible bringing peregrine back god knows what thoughts or memories it might trigger mrs graham added forcefully hes going to be sent here whether we like it or not robert retorted ive told you they dont have the staff to care for a dying man it will most certainly kill him to bring him out in this cold jonathan put in his mother turned to him her mind working it was an odd feeling sitting in the midst of a family that was deciding the fate of one of its own as if he were a stranger but it occurred to me that after all these years he might seem to be if hes wrapped up well and theres a way to keep the air he breathes warmer he could travel i said doubt in my voice i wouldnt recommend it but if hes not likely to be given proper care hes in the asylum timothy answered you must have seen it last night when you came from the station robert had pointed it out as if i should know its significance as if he was certain that arthur must have told me about peregrine the messenger is waiting robert reminded them quietly i was beginning to see that he had more influence in this family than a cousin ordinarily possessed mrs graham bit her lip no she said finally it cant be done perhaps dr philips could care for him i suggested absolutely not mrs graham responded not looking at me perhaps i should leave you alone while you decide what to do i started for the door but robert was blocking it it might be the best course he said ignoring me if you think about it mrs graham stared at him as if she could read his mind and then she nodded once as if she understood what he was suggesting all right then let them bring him here if miss crawford will be kind enough to see to him until its over i would be very grateful mother jonathan began no roberts right as usual this is perhaps the answer we were looking for thats settled then robert shut the door mrs graham said timothy if you dont mindid like a whiskey and water she sat down as if her knees were about to give way he went to the drinks table and poured a little whiskey into a glass and added the water she drank it almost thirstily as if she needed the support it offered then she turned to me i have imposed on you my dear it is not something i would have wished if id known she broke off and looked at her empty glass when peregrine arrives we must do our best to make him comfortable timothy would you ask susan what is needed to open his room he left us and jonathan said mother i hope to god you know what you are about i asked tentatively why their son and brother was in an asylum it was expected of me and i didnt want them to know what dr philips had already told me because my dear he murdered someone in cold blood but not in his right mind the suffering on her face was real she hadnt beaten about the bush i hardly knew what to say thatsit must have been a terrible time for you peregrines never beenhe had difficulties as a child you see but we never suspectedthe truth is you dont suspect your own flesh and blood ofof having that sort of nature there was distress in her voice a tightness that must have been a mixture of shame and of inexpressible shock as she looked back at the past her emotional confession made me wonder if perhaps id been a little hasty in offering my services she knew better than i just how safe her stepson was but i couldnt take back my offer now the colonel sahib would tell me that retreat was the better part of valor but i knew for a fact hed never retreated in his life i wasnt about to spoil the family record now she must have read something in my expression because she said at once you neednt fear him they say hes become quite docilehes accepted his fate she squared her shoulders as if preparing herself to face what was to come robert is right they dont have the means to care for my son as ill as he is so many of the orderlies and the nurses went off to war that theyre fortunate at the asylum to be able to function at all after that we waited in an uncomfortable silence expecting the knock on the door at any time that would announce the arrival of the sick man i thoughtbelatedlythat i must send a telegram to my parents i wouldnt be coming home as planned finally almost when wed given it up for the evening the door knocker sounded like the crack of doom i went out into the hall with mrs graham and she opened the door herself a man in a heavy coat stood there and behind him were two stout men with a stretcher between them their breath steamed in the cold air on the stretcher lay a tall man swathed in blankets just then i heard him cough and i knew the worst his lungs were terribly congested and the cold air during the journey had done them no good nor had standing there in the winter night the stretcher bearers were coming through the door now and somehow between them they managed the stairs grunting and struggling every step of the way i thought how difficult it must be for the man they jostled and tilted like an egg carried in a spoon but he never complained i went up after them but mrs graham stayed below talking to the third man somehow susan had managed to make a room ready and i watched the stretcher bearers settle their burden in the bed drawing up the sheets to his chin he lay there exhausted his face gray i went to the side of the bed as the two men left and looked down at peregrine graham as murderers wentand i was most certainly no authorityhe didnt appear to be any different from the dozen of pneumonia cases id dealt with on britannics nexttolast voyage he opened his eyes then and they were dark pain and exhaustion mixed in their depths as he struggled to speak i wondered if he was dumb his mouth moved but he appeared not to know how to shape words finally he managed where am i his voice was a husky whisper i could barely hear the words where have they taken me i realized that no one had told him what was happening youre in your own home at owlhurst im here to take care of you home his eyes looked around as if trying to place his surroundings i must be dying early days i said and then watched him start to shiver as the fever came on again i ran to the stairs to see if the men had left any medicines for me but they were gone and mrs graham was still standing in the hall her face turned toward the door i said could you send robert to dr philips i need something for a heavy fever and something as well for a cough and congestion in the lungs she turned to me looking up the stairs with shadows on her face that seemed sinister in the low lamplight i was told he was dying that medicines were of no use we need to make him comfortable to the end i pointed out after a moments hesitation she said robert will see to it and an hour later timothy was at the door with a small box containing the medicines id requested but he wouldnt come into the room it was as if he had no wish to see his brother it was a measure of the familys feelings uploaded by coral chapter six i lost count of time i had almost no rest sitting up through the nights and again through the days eating the meals that susan brought up to me and working hard to make the poor wretch on the bed as comfortable as possible id expected dr philips to appear at some stage or even the rector but no one came not even peregrines mother but then she was his stepmother wasnt she and this son had disgraced the family the only respite i had was a letter sent on to me by my father it was from elayne one of the women with whom i shared the small flat in london i recognized her sprawling hand at once tearing open the envelope i was immediately lost in her words so like her voice i hope the arm is healing as it should im eager for news heres mine youll never guess darling what has happened to me im in love and hes wonderful i met him on the ship bringing the wounded back from france he broke his shoulder wrestling a mule judging from the size of him i wonder how the mule fared did i tell you hes staff quite safe behind the lines so i shant fear losing him hes coming to visit when hes out of hospital and meanwhile im off again to france hes asked me to smuggle a bottle of good wine back for him ive left a small package at the flat for yousomething i found for you in dover if you havent received orders by the time im home again come to london and meet anthony but mind you dont fall in love with him yourselfhes claimed smiling i folded the sheets of blue paper and returned them to the envelope elayne dear friend that she was was tall and plain and had told me she thought she would never marry like one of her favorite jane austen characters just then peregrine twisted in the bed choking on his own phlegm tossing my letter on the bedside table i bent over the sick man lifting him turning him to slap his back forcing him to eject the heavy plug that exhausted him and i settled him again adding an extra pillow under his head to help him breathe where was dr philips i asked susan the next time she brought my meal but she shook her head and replied that she hadnt been told he was expected peregrines breathing filled the room raucous and painful my only companion and there were times in those early days when i thought it had stopped altogether and then he would cough and struggle to find air and finally slip back into the steady rough pattern as before fighting to help him i used all the skills id learned since entering my training hot water with the fumes of pungent oils that made my own eyes water poultices on his chest cool cloths for his head aspirin to ease his fever he soaked the bed time and again with a sour sweat and i changed the sheets setting them outside the door to be washed and brought back to me with an invalid cup less likely to spill i fed him sweet tea and broths that susan brought to me in thermoses although much of both wound up on the towel i put across his chest still each time he swallowed a little it gave him the strength to keep fighting it was easy to see why the asylum had despaired of him without the staff to sit with him hour after hour and fearful that the grahams would accuse them of neglect in his death how were they to know his family wanted no part of him despite his thinness peregrine graham was a strong man and in the small hours of the morning of the fifth day his fever broke he lay there in utter exhaustion trying to breathe still coughing when the breath was too deep unable to care for himself or even speak i considered what to feed him but i didnt think he could keep anything down and that the effort of trying would be too much the broths and the tea would have to do his eyes followed me about the room and i wondered what was going through his mind was he aware that if he lived he must return to the asylum would he have preferred to die still people often clung stubbornly to life willing themselves to live despite severe injuries or illnesses even though hed appeared coherent in that brief moment on his arrival peregrine hadnt spoken since and it was possible that he didnt completely understand his situation perhaps it would be a blessing if he didnt it was not until late into the afternoon of the sixth day that he had the strength to whisper are you arthurs wife i turned quickly from the window where id been watching the light fade into the early winter dusk no but i knew your brother i was with him when he died his dark brows rose arthur is dead how had no one told him surely they had or was it that his mind couldnt absorb family news in the war it isnt over the war no sadly it hasnt finished what day is this what year i told him he frowned as if hed lost track of time how did he die arthur bravely at peace youre lying surprised i said why should i lie to you kindness i wasnt sure how to respond it was a remarkably rational exchange but i was saved from answering as peregrine began to cough i offered him a drink of water and said you must rest now youre a little better but not out of the woods yet sleep if you can obediently he closed his eyes and was quiet for some time then he said still in that painful whisper why was i brought here i dont think there was anyone to take care of you where you were i want to die well i dont think its up to you i said briskly modern medicine can work wonders without your help id rather be dead no you mustnt say that i replied coming to the bed to look down at him if god sees fit to spare you then theres a reason something you need to finish i stopped for him all there was to finish was his life sentence in an asylum his mouth twisted indeed there it was again that logical comment with its touch of irony but he slept after that and when susan came to the door with my dinner asking how he was i said only theres no change still if mrs nichols could prepare a soup for menothing too heavy chicken stock and rice to thicken it and a little meat minced fine and perhaps a little wine too ill see if he can keep it down hes frighteningly weak we must do something theres fresh bread as well for sops she told me and then left without asking to see the sick man two hours later she brought the soup in a covered bowl and half a loaf of bread wrapped in a linen cloth handing them in at the door i was able to cajole peregrine into trying a little and it must have been to his liking because he took nearly a third of a cup and he kept it down which i told myself was a good sign close to two oclock i brought him more and again at six finishing the container a little after eight the next morning i spent the night in my chair where i could watch him and hear the slightest sound though by dawn my cot beckoned and i felt the stiffness across my shoulders and in my back the chances of a relapse were very good and i couldnt risk that but as the new day dawned he was cool to the touch and resting well i rested myself that morning realizing how hard a vigil it had been and was grateful for the hot water that susan brought with my breakfast so that i could wash my face and hands it did very little to wake me fully my patient studied me in silence as i moved about the room and i grew accustomed to finding those watchful eyes on me whenever peregrine was awake why are you here he asked me late in the afternoon to look after you no why are you here i was with your brother when he died there were messages he wanted me to carry for him messages personal ones to his brother do you carry such messages to the family of every soldier you nurse i could feel myself flushing no but in arthurs case you see he thought he was recovering and then everything changed he didnt reply and i thought perhaps hed fallen asleep if id had any doubts about his ability to understand his surroundings they were erased now he could think he could reflect on what was said and draw coherent conclusions and he spoke like a rational man but madness had its rational moments i reminded myself whats more i had no knowledge of what he was like before entering the asylum or what help if any he was given there if his tutor had despaired of him why was he able to use his brain so well now and if he had been given treatment that produced this mental agility why did he not know his brother had been killed how the war was progressing or what year it was it was a contradiction i couldnt quite fathom what he said next shocked me a pity it wasnt jonathan who died rather than arthur his eyes were still closed you cant mean that i said thinking how cruel it was i do ive hated him for years ever since i can remember i didnt know quite what to say and then i recalled that others had called peregrine different perhaps that was why he disliked his brother so intenselyif jonathan had been held up as an example of what peregrine ought to have been and failed to achieve it would breed jealousy frankly i wouldnt have put it past jonathan to tease peregrine unmercifully not after what hed said about ted booker finally i replied hes your brother i doubt it i smiled i had heard children quarrel in much the same vein but then those dark eyes flicked open and he seemed to pin me there in my chair i was separated from my brothers at an early age there was little love lost between us do you know why you were kept away from them he turned his head to look out the window agitated i always believed it was because my father died i had the feeling that this wasnt a safe subject for conversation until now peregrine had made good sense sometimes madness turned on small grievances and i didnt wish to provoke him into violence that must have been a difficult time for you you must have been little more than a child id meant it as conciliatory but he didnt take it that way later i wondered if she killed him or if she persuaded robert to do it for her that was surely a madman speaking there was a tap at the door startling both of us we turned toward it as if expectingwhat after the briefest hesitation i went to open it it was susan with another covered jar of soup i took the jar from her and set it on the hearth by the time id spooned half a cup of it into his bowl peregrine seemed to have forgotten what we were talking about i wasnt about to bring it up again he drank the soup without comment and lay back against his pillows tired enough to sleep i went back to my chair i hadnt been trained in the field of various forms of madness wed been more concerned with the destruction of the body by illness or weaponry i wished i could ask dr philips for his opinion and now i was uneasy in this sickroom where i hadnt been before but i neednt have worried that was the only time my patient broached the subject of his brothers or his fathers death later that evening as i sat by the fire peregrine cried out it was so sudden i nearly leapt out of my skin but when i turned toward the bed he was lying there asleep one arm flung out and his body half twisted to one side i realized that he was dreaming i heard him say his voice muffled please and again as if pleading please after that he was quiet and didnt rouse again until it was time for his soup at ten oclock it was while peregrine was finishing the cup that timothy came to the door knocking tentatively to ask about his brother but when i opened it he stepped back as if afraid he might find himself looking into the room beyond it occurred to me that the family had expected that my nursing skills were not up to saving peregrine graham and they were now wondering why i hadnt appeared with the sad news of his death they had made no effort to send dr philips to the patient i wondered if they would have if id sent down to ask for his help im cautiously optimistic i responded to his question its too early to say what the outcome may be it was a habit id fallen into working with the wounded orders were to find them fit again as quickly as possible and send them back to the fightingmen were in short supply malingerers not tolerated i often sought to keep a man who was exhausted still weak or pretending he was healed when i knew very well he was not it made no sense to me to send someone back to die his first day and i wasnt convinced that this patient was well enough for the long cold ride back to that tall forbidding house behind its high walls as well the building clouds at dusk had spoken of snow and i had seen the winter birds huddled in the bare trees out of the wind a sign of foul weather timothy nodded thanked me and quickly walked away peregrine who had overheard the brief conversation said with some bitterness i expect theyre eager to see the back of me or else hes afraid i must be well enough now to overpower you and run amok in the house we shant worry about that until you can overpower your soupspoon i retorted for his hands shook with the palsy of weakness as he tried to drink or feed himself when he didnt reply i said mr graham would you wish to see the doctor or the rector ill ask for them on your behalf if you like the answer was emphatically no i dont think they are the same men you remember i told him your mother made some mention of newcomers he remained adamant would you like for me to read to you im sure i can find a book that might interest you he shook his head drifting into sleep almost as soon as i took away his bowl and cup i debated leaving him for a while and going to my own room i hadnt had a change of clothes for days and a bath would have been heaven but i was afraid to leave him alone i didnt want to address the reasons why and so i settled back in my chair falling asleep myself to the rise and fall of his even breathing i woke sometime later with night creeping through the window and the lamps unlit as i stirred i could sense movement from the bed and an instant of panic swept over me then i realized that peregrine had pushed himself back on his pillows and was asking if there was any of that soup left i got up and drew the drapes across the window then found and lit the lamp susan had brought me a spirit lamp to keep the soup from thickening and i heated it a little before giving him the cup to drink his hand was steadier now and i left him to hold it for himself over its rim his eyes were speculative and i was suddenly nervous if they told you what id done he asked why did you allow yourself to be shut in here with me i dont remember much about the events leading up to my removal to the asylum dr hadley kept me heavily sedated but i have nightmares all the same if they are true then im a monster its dr philips now i reminded him dr hadley is dead as for my agreeing to care for you i hardly expected a man with terminal pneumonia to present a problem ive had to deal with men raving from pain and from night terrors im stronger than i look and my father would tell you i didnt have the good sense to be afraid i hesitated and then asked have you tried to harm anyone since thethe events that put you in the asylum he moved restlessly among the bedclothes im not a lunatic i never suggested you were there was a determined knock at the door and i went to open it mrs graham stood there in the passage i thought her eyes were nearly as darkly circled as my own timothy tells me that my son is going to live is that true i thought she was glad and was on the point of telling her that he would but she went on with a coldness in her voice that i was sure peregrine could hear from his bed i shall inform the director of the asylum to send someone to fetch him at once i dont think hes ready to travel nonsense he survived his journey here and he will survive his journey back where he belongs she turned on her heel and walked away i shut the door slowly not wanting to see the look on peregrines face he said theres an end to it in a clipped voice i did turn then and caught the expression of despair before it was smoothed away his keepers came for him the next morning it was the first time id ever seen a patient of mine manacled before he was taken away yet peregrine graham was too weak to walk down the stairs unaided it took two stalwart warders on either side and still he was in danger of falling to his knees yet somehow he managed it and i wondered if it was sheer pride there was no one in the passage by the stairs or in the hall to bid him farewell i threw a blanket around my shoulders and went out to the ambulance they had sent for him in the end i put the blanket around him on the bed to which he was chained for there was nothing to cover him against the cold the driver waited impatiently and i could see clearly what it was he was thinkingthat i was wasting pity on a man who should have been hanged if his family hadnt had the money or position to send him to an asylum for the insane instead i went back into the house and slammed the door unwilling to watch the ambulance pull away and turn back the way it had come timothy appeared at the head of the stairs hes gone then an animal would have been treated better i snapped without thinking about the fact that i was a guest here and should hold no opinions about circumstances of which i was ignorant he is an animal timothy said you saw him ill and weak not in his full strength im a nurse i said trying to rein in my anger not a keeper i look at a patient not a prisoner as you did with booker yes which says much about your capacity for compassion timothy turned away and was gone i went back to the room to clear away the bedding and the spirit lamp and what was left of the broth but susan was there before me she said ill boil these sheets miss and see that everythings put away i thanked her and went about collecting my own things we was all amazed that he didnt die mrs graham said it must be your fine nursing that did it to tell truth i dont know how you could bear it he was ill a nurse doesnt ask who her patient is or if hes acceptable in society no miss i think his mother would have preferred to see him dead it was a terrible blow to the family to have a son of the house taken up for murder i dont understand why he wasnt sent to prisonor hanged because he was so young and never right in his mind miss and the doctor and the rector and his tutor all spoke to the magistrate it was decided that the asylum was for the best but who did he murder i dont know miss it didnt happen here mrs graham had taken him to london to see a specialist he hadnt been well there was nausea and vomiting and he walked like a drunken man hardly able to keep his feet dr hadley didnt know what else to do when she came home from there she was as distraught as ive ever seen her and mr peregrine was locked in a room at the rectory she sent for the rector and then for the magistrate and i never saw mr peregrine again not even when they brought him here the other night mrs nichols and i were told to stay belowstairs and then what happened after mrs graham spoke to these people he was taken away and mrs graham cried for days it was the saddest thing arthur was here oh yes miss as grim as i ever saw him he didnt speak to anyone for days master timothy tried to comfort his mother he kept putting his little arm around her shoulders master jonathan paced the floor until mr robert came and spoke to him and after that he was quiet still he sat in his room pale as his shirt worrying about his mother because she was crying i tried to tell him that she was a strong woman shed be all right but he wouldnt hear me he was angry with everyone because he didnt understand what was happening mr robert explained that master peregrine had been taken away because he was ill in his mind but they were too young they blamed him for everything especially for having to cut their holiday in london short but mrs graham was strong she stood up to all of it like the lady she is all the gossip the stares i heard her tell mr robert that those were the worst days shed ever lived through no soldier could have been braver i couldnt help but admire her but what about the victim the person he murdered surely the victims family came to the inquest and gave evidence against him susan was confused i dont knowi never heard they were there and she wasnt killed here thats why the inquest was in london what was the finding i asked i dont know miss i wasnt there but mrs graham came home her face red from crying mr peregrine was already in the asylum had been for days and she told us all that hed never leave it hed stay where he couldnt harm anyone else i was more than a little confused the inquest was held in london but mr peregrine had already been taken away yes miss it was decided in london that he was in no state to be shut into a prison there was a doctor at the asylum who treated such cases and it was his opinion that mr peregrine should be brought to him straightaway that doctor and dr hadley here the rector the tutor the local magistrate they all sent depositions to london asking that mr peregrine remain in that asylum where he could be cared for properly i heard mrs graham tell dr hadley it was a great kindness she said she couldnt have faced her husband in heaven if shed let his son go to the hangman but i dont think it would have come to that i dont think theyve hanged anyone his age in a hundred years not at maidstone they hadnt i shivered at the thought how old did you say he was he wasnt even fifteen when it happened and not well in the bargain if hed been taken away and put into prison it would have been a terrible burden for the family to carry wouldnt it she collected the bundle of sheets ive said enough more than i should i handed her the pillow slips that id been removing and asked you arent going to have to do all these by yourself are you no miss thank you for asking theres a laundress comes to see to the washing and ironing after susan had gone i stood in the empty room and thought about the man who had lain so ill in that bed perhaps it wasnt the first time peregrine graham had attacked someone but that was neither here nor there his brothers had had to grow up in the shadow of his crime of murder and it must have been exceedingly difficult while peregrine had for the most part been civil and seemed perfectly sane as far as i could judge who knew what lay beneath the surface i had glimpsed the force of his anger once and that had been enough it was to his credit that peregrine acknowledged what hed done he hadnt tried to pretend to me that he was an innocent man or that he didnt deserve his fate he knew very well that he must return to the asylum and he went back peaceably but his family knowing his history better than i did must have spent a good many uncomfortable nights while he was under their roof chapter seven when we gathered in the dining room for our noon meal mrs graham was profuse in her apologies for using a guest so poorly and added her gratitude for saving her sons life i wasnt sure i believed the latter the grahams could decently mourn the dead and admit that theyd loved him even if they choked on the words how would my own parents feel if i were taken up for murder a sobering thought that made the grahams dilemma strike home and yet i couldnt forget that they had protected themselvesat whose expense my training wasnt solely for the battlefield mrs graham i was taught to work with the sick as well i reminded her we heard almost nothing from the sickroom except the endless sound of his coughing didwas peregrine able to speak i worry that they were treating him well that hed had proper care i knew what she was fishing for she could have come and asked him about his care herself he was hardly able to speak more than a few words i told her he asked where he was and if the war was still going on he asked what year it was i let my voice trail off as if i were having trouble remembering anything else i most certainly couldnt tell her that he believed she or robert had killed his father she seemed to be surprised that he didnt know what year this was but surely they tell him she stopped then went on in a different direction well hes always been troubled in his mind even as a child at least he doesnt appear to be any worseviolent difficult to manage i dont think he had the strength to be difficult we had just finished our pudding when dr philips came to the door and asked to speak to me while i was playing angel of mercy ted booker had tried again to kill himself and it had been necessary to strap him down to a bed and keep him at the surgery i dont know what will happen to him i feel ive failed him in some fashion he wants to see you meanwhile i must contact the clinic and tell them to hurry booker cant wait six weeks for space not now hes asking for me im surprised he remembers me at all i expect his wife may have told him will you come mrs graham protested but this time it was more form than substance i went to fetch my coat and stepped out into the still cold air when i heard that peregrine was ill dr philips said as i preceded him down the walk i offered to come they told me you were managing very well i wasnt surprised id already witnessed a little of your skills i turned my head to look at him buti kept wondering why you hadnt at least overseen what i was doing im sure mrs graham would have sent for me if shed believed he was truly in danger it was a compliment that she trusted to your training i opened my mouth to tell him just how ill peregrine graham had been how id lain awake hour after hour worried as he struggled to breathe and then i stopped myself in time what good would it do to make him wonder why mrs graham had turned him away it hadnt yet begun to snow and i made some remark about how heavy the clouds were dr philips told me snow was unlikely the awkward moment passed we walked in silence to his surgery cutting through the churchyard i told him about the rectors carpentry hes quite good with his hands i could wish him a stronger forcehes sometimes of two minds about what should be done when he ought to be taking a stand perhaps hes chosen the wrong profession you havent heard his sermons theyre quite good as well the doctor assured me its solving problems of a practical nature where hes something of a paradox i wondered if he was thinking about the rectors views on ted booker the doctors housekeeper met us at the door and let us into the surgery saying as i entered youre the young woman who knew arthur i did yes we all mourned him such a shame what do you say in response to that i smiled and she took my coat before leading me back to the small room where they had put ted booker he lay on the bed his eyes closed but he opened them when dr philips said quietly shes here i saw such misery in their depths my heart went out to him but i said in my brisk voice whats this i hear about you doing yourself a harm he looked at the doctor and both dr philips and the housekeeper withdrew shutting the door softly after them lieutenant booker said im a coward just as they say a brave man would have got it done properly perhaps it isnt your time to die i replied it was an echo of what i had said to peregrine graham had you thought about that no it was blunt well its something to consider hasnt your poor wife suffered enough even for harrys sake he would be the first to tell you to put the living before the dead you wont bring him back by sacrificing yourself as well you know and he doesnt have a son to carry on his memory but you do and its your duty to see that your own son remembers his uncle with pride and honors him for his courage he held up his wrists bandaged now i couldnt do it not even for harry then im proud of you something deep inside prevented you and that means in time youll heal the living must go on living or we fail the dead it wasnt that i heard my brother crying out to me as clearly as i hear you now he stopped me i didnt stop myself i digested that then said which proves i was right there was some reason for you to live it shook me to the core i could see that it had of course it did i pulled up the only chair in the small room and sat down by the bed i expect he watches over you and always will he stared at me i told myself it was proof of my madness id say rather proof of your sanity why did you send for me because none of them has been to war youve come close he frowned i thought id seen you in france when harry was taken to the dressing station it was dark you were very upset we look alike in our uniforms thats true he hesitated will you tell the doctor that i wont try again he wont believe me my motherinlaw is set on sending me back to the clinic i want to stay here dr philips has already given you one chance and mrs denton is sick with worry for her daughter wouldnt you be in her shoes i tried to make her understand about harry he said defensively oh dont be silly lieutenant if you had a daughter and shed married a soldier who seems bent on breaking her heart if he doesnt frighten her to death first what would you do he gave me a twisted smile id try to knock some sense into the bas he broke off beg pardon sister thats precisely what sallys mother feels tell them im sorry tell them to give me one more chance i wont let them down his eyes pleaded and i tried to judge whether he meant it at this moment but would succumb to his nightmares again there was no way of telling ill speak to dr philips i cant help that the trenches come back thats not your fault i agreed thisi gestured to his surroundings the bandages and the straps holding him downthis is your doing he shut his eyes and i could see tears beneath the lids men dont like to be seen crying i turned and quietly left him alone i wasnt sure dr philips believed me when i told him that ted booker had promised not to do anything rash again i could read the skepticism in his face after all i was a nurse and he was the medical man walking back to the graham house i was overtaken by the rectorhe called to me introducing himself in the same breath miss crawford i say im christopher montgomery the rector i turned to meet him as he caught me up he was a man of middle height with light blue eyes and fair skin i put his age at forty perhaps fortyfive i understand you were with arthur graham when he died yes i was i came to owlhurst with messages for his family we nearly met before rector i was in the church the other day when you were repairing something in the organ loft he smiled ruefully i must have been making a terrible racket but the bench was wobbly according to my organist mr lessing and i took it upon myself to find a solution thankfully all four legs of the bench were even when i finished i laughed im sure they were i saw you leaving the surgery just now i was looking in on lieutenant booker yes i sat with him earlier a sad case i dont understand what shell shock does to the mind but i can see very clearly how much hes suffering i was a chaplain in the first months of they sent me home because i had a very bad case of trench foot embarrassing to say the least but ive thought for some time that it might have also been my reluctance to convince men that god intended for them to die for king and country there are worse cases than mr bookers he shook his head thats beyond my ability to imagine we had turned to walk together toward the church gate where i would take the shortcut to the graham house the rector said after a moment i wanted to ask you about peregrine graham i was immediately on my guard it wouldnt do to gossip about the grahams behind their backs it came to my ears that hed been brought home and is not expected to live is it true hes much improved im happy to say someone came for him only this morning yes the neighbors were quick to inform me that the ambulance had returned but they couldnt tell me whether it took him away alive or dead i tried to call one morning but was turned away they told me peregrine had no wish to see me i hadnt known that hed called i said trying to be judicious i dont think he was really well enough for a visitor it was kind of you to help the family in their hour of need it hadnt been kindness it had been necessity i was glad i was here to step in i answered instead where have you served i told him trying to keep my voice neutralan experience but stiff upper lip and all that we were halfway across the churchyard now he stopped it must have been a very nerveracking experience i cant imagine coming so close to drowning and how is your arm i see you arent keeping it in a sling much improved i smiled friends at the front are exhausted from deciphering the letters i wrote with my left hand it will do much for fighting morale when i am legible again the rector chuckled then he said going back again to peregrine ive always been of two minds about mrs grahams son and what he did i didnt know that you were here erat the time i was not but my predecessor kept journals for his own guidance and left them to me for mine i have read the pertinent passages he writes that peregrine had been taken away quietly he seemed to be comfortable with the decision he felt that the family had suffered enough i wonder if that was fair to peregrine would prison have been better surely not if there were doctors at the asylum who could work with him as to that i cant say my predecessorcraig was his namespoke of a damaged mind and the fact that the poor soul had never successfully been educated that would have been taken into account certainly i knew my surprise showed in my face is that what he wrote he felt peregrine graham had the mind of a child hardly the man id just dealt with was that the generally accepted view or just mr craigs i can only tell you his given opinion apparently the boy had been having some difficulties while his father was alive the tutor complained he was slow to learn unable to concentrate on his lessons but when his father died the boys mind broke with his grief and so they kept him close to home after that at any rate i thought while peregrine was ill i could offer him christian solace before he returned to that place i went to bartonsthe asylumsoon after i took up the living here but they told me he wasnt allowed visitors i was astonished i thought the family would havebut i was told he was allowed to see no one were these the terms of his confinement thats possible of course ted booker told mr craig that one day he was passing the asylum and there was peregrine sitting on a bench under a tree manacled to it this was some years ago well before the war booker could see him through the gate and called to him peregrine turned his head away booker was shocked by his appearance and said something to arthur about it the rector reported in his journal that booker was the only person to have seen him since he was taken there and id just missed my chance to ask ted booker about peregrine graham i next expected the rector to ask me what i thought of my patient but he didnt it was the journals that were on his mind i could see that he was fascinated by his predecessor well water under the dam he went on ive never spoken to anyone else about the journals you know it seemed best there are comments in there that are more honest than most people could stomach mr craig believed in the truth at any price i understand i wasnt to chatter about them i think you do thank you we had reached the far gate of the churchyard he opened it for me and said rather shyly perhaps youll call at the rectory before you leave id be glad to show you the journals i should be leaving shortly im awaiting my orders now with britannic at the bottom of the sea im sure london is at sixes and sevens trying to decide where to put all of us one of the nurses on the ship with me has just been posted to poona in india thats a long way from home he said i didnt tell him id spent part of my childhood in the east i simply agreed and he said goodbye but then called me back to ask do you think peregrine graham lacks spiritual comfort where he is is he capable of recognizing his needs in that direction i think i responded slowly that he despairs of comfort but its a matter you must take up with the family or the doctors at the asylum mr craig was also chaplain there but ive not been asked to fill his position perhaps i ought to speak to someone in charge and see what the need is yes that might be wise i said goodbye rector we shook hands and i turned away to walk the rest of the way alone there was much curiosity at the house regarding my summons to speak with ted booker susan was the first to ask and then over our meal mrs graham brought up the subject not wanting to add to any gossip about his attempt to kill himself i merely said he felt that id been closer to the war than his family i think he wanted reassurance that his problems are not his alone i should think a rational man would do his best to heal quickly and return to the fighting god knows we need soldiers would she have wished her own son back before his time was up i could have answered that it wasnt surprisingthe casualty lists continued to be unbearably long but i said instead it takes time to heal the mind just as it does the body did he ask you about peregrine about peregrine i dont believe he even knew your son was at home ill no i meant dr philips i think my guilty conscience for having spoken of peregrine with the rector must have shone in my face but i said resolutely he complimented me on my skills you neednt avoid the question you know but im not he did tell me hed called to see if i needed his help i wish id known it at the time she nodded thank you for your honesty and ill be equally honest in return i didnt wish people in owlhurst to gossip about my son im well aware that a medical man must keep matters concerning his patients in strictest confidence but i dont know dr philips that well yet timothy came in just then and said did you hear booker tried to slash his wrists fool that he is his wife must be in despair he sat down to take his tea and then too restless to be still stood up and carried his cup to the window she made her choice timothy its not for you to judge her decision ive always felt one of the loftlan girls would be more suitable we could invite the family to dine with us it must have been an old argument because i saw timothy twitch one shoulder as if trying to shrug off her words id just like to think shes happy he said brusquely more to the point safe how can she be under the circumstances mrs graham turned to me sally was quite popular everyone liked her and she had a sweet nature that i thought spoke well of her upbringing she and ted booker were an excellent match everyone was pleased for them she saw him in uniform and that was that timothy added sourly jonathan came in late as usual and said sorry to his mother before nodding to me taking his cup he said there was a message from the asylum brother peregrine made the journey back safely i dont know who is more disappointed in that the asylum or us jonathan his mother said sharply what sort of life does he lead mother id hate to be caged up and if he complains its maidstone instead the poor devil could live to be eighty in that place is that what you want for him do you think prison would have been better do you want that on the family escutcheon timothy asked from the window jonathan wheeled on his brother peregrine is an albatross about our necks alive or dead jonathan his mother spoke his name in such a cold tone that both of her sons stared at her well hear no more about peregrine if you please the matter is closed yes well hes still fathers heir when you die mother we havent got round that problem yet have we peregrine could well outlive us all she told him as you said which reminds me someone needs to bethink themselves of a guardian for him if anything happens to me jonathan said only let timothy see to that im not setting foot in that place dont ask me to go thats why we have a family solicitor timothy retorted i sat there in embarrassed silence trying to pretend i wasnt hearing such a private family issue being discussed robert came in to speak to mrs graham he stood there leaning against the doorframe as if he belonged in this room and was not happy at being excluded remembering his gruffness when he met my train it occurred to me that he hadnt wanted me to come to owlhurst he was close to this familyit was possible that hed guessed what arthur would say on his deathbed and knew it would open old wounds even i could see that robert felt free to express his views his had been the deciding voice in allowing peregrine to come home to die watching him there as he and mrs graham discussed a problem with a tenants cow i was reminded of what peregrine had said about who might have killed his fatherhis stepmother or her cousin it was hard to give credence to his wordsthey hadnt married after all and i couldnt think of another reason for killing a husband yet they were close as cousins sometimes are clearly the two of them were of the same mind in this problem with the cow and robert had come out of duty rather than from a need for guidance when they had settled on a course of action regarding how to treat the animal he nodded to me and left mrs grahams gaze followed him to the door a frown between her eyes then she turned back to me and said youve heard us speak of things that are private my dearin regard to peregrine i must apologize but his circumstances make it necessary for us to think and act for him painful as it may be was she testing me again to see if id noticedor failed to noticesomething in regard to her stepson it dawned on me that perhaps the talk about peregrines mental deficiency during his childhood might have been the familys way of covering up something worse better to tell friends and neighbors that the boy was slow than that the boy was dangerous it explained too why id not found him deficientif anything articulate and sensible i smiled with understanding it must be very difficult i dont envy you jonathan said i dont wish to appear to cut short your visit miss crawford but ill be traveling to tonbridge tomorrow ill be happy to take you to the train if thats your wish mrs graham said in protest jonathan thats not necessary robert will drive her when shes ready but i knew what was expected of the guest who had stayed overlong it would be lovely if i could go with you lieutenant graham much as ive enjoyed my visit i must have everything ready to return to duty when my orders come there was protest but halfhearted i smiled told jonathan id have my luggage closed before i came down to breakfast and the subject was dropped i wasnt ready to leave but i didnt know how to prevent it beware what you wish for dr philips was at the door just before dawn pounding insistently until susan answered the summons then awakened me ted booker had stripped away his bandages in the night and succeeded finally in killing himself i was shocked theres to be an inquest dr philips was saying urgently you must tell them that he was not in his right mind that he didnt know what he was doing he promised i said he told me he understood what his wife was suffering i believed him i could feel hot tears stinging my eyes poor man poor poor man youll be the only one to weep over him dr philips said his motherinlaw is telling the world that hes gone to a better place he stopped im sorry miss crawford i am so sorry to bring you this news but i have nowhere to turn i dont quite know how to take it in he was upset i understood losing a patient ill fetch my coat and come with you dr philips shook his head theres nothing you can do not now ive seen to theernecessary steps that follow on the heels of sudden death i am refusing to sign the death certificate until another doctor has seen the body dr blessing is coming from tonbridge dr philips come with me he seemed almost grateful to follow me to the kitchen where susan was just stoking the fires i gave him a cup of tea and with susans permission eggs and bacon and toast as well he kept murmuring this is most kindmost kind when susan had taken the tea tray up to mrs graham i said quietly something more than ted bookers death has upset you whats wrong someone came into the surgery in the middle of the night i was asleep id had a long day then i woke to the sound of something heavy falling and when i went down i found a muddy print in the passage and it wasnt mine and it wasnt bookers his shoes were still where id put them in the small closet where i keep my coat and wellingtons i dont want to believe that someone came into my house and talked to booker and left him in a state of mind where he killed himself but the evidence is there what size print a womans a mans i cant judge a muddy smudge is more descriptive he rubbed his face with his hands i dont want to believe it was mrs denton but who else and what am i to do you said youd spoken to her what was she like anxious unsettled afraid that you knew what shed done as usual she was full of concern for her daughter glad that her suffering was over claiming this was a blessed release for booker sometimes i think she could have killed booker for her daughters sake and never blinked an eye and then i look at her and tell myself shes not vicious just a mother fearing for a childs situation i tried to bring mrs denton back to mind i thought it very likely that she might have tormented ted booker to the point he chose to die and release his wife not intending perhaps to kill him but driving home what she considered to be the truth that he was a poor husband for putting his brother before his wife sometimes the mrs dentons of this world get their way through sheer cruelty i said with resignation and then they deny what theyve set in motion because they blotted out the possible effects of their words they convince themselves do i tell the police it would create a sensation if i did and if i am wrong ive done to his motherinlaw what she may have done to booker he looked up at me pain clear in his eyes ive never had to deal with the murder of a patient before and i dont know why i should turn to you because im an objective observer and i did have a long talk with lieutenant booker whether it helped or not well never know now i thought at the time i had his full attention that he was listening i considered for a moment the police must know whatever you can tell them about ted bookers state of mind as for the inquesti was leaving today ive trespassed long enough on the kindness of the grahams ive more than enough space in my house but im afraid as a single woman no it would cause talk i understand is there anyone else i could stay with preferably someplace where im needed it will look less like the grahams had pitched me out mrs turner has just had appendicitis but what she needs isnt a nurse so much as someone to cook and clean until shes on her feet again that will do ive done as much onboard ship when we were shorthanded i must draw the line at doing the wash i indicated my arm you can use the laundress who comes to the grahams and sees to my needs as well mrs abbot then ill break the news to the grahams somehow i was sure they wouldnt be best pleased you can come and collect me at ten thats when i was leaving for tonbridge with jonathan graham very well he got up smiling women always know whats best dont they food and a willing ear are you single miss crawford you would make an admirable doctors wife he was smiling as he said it and i gave him my answer with a matching smile why dr philips whatever would you do if i said yes we laughed and he went out the kitchen door rather than through the house again i thought he didnt want to encounter the grahams susan came down the back stairs and said what brought the doctor here at such an early hour ive never seen him so agitated ted booker killed himself last night despite all our precautions oh my dear lord she set down her tray and shook her head im that sorry he was such a nice young lad i was quite fond of him well theres the war of course its taken so many young men i went to see mrs graham just before breakfast and told her that ted booker appeared to have killed himself and i would most likely have to give evidence at the inquest im so sorry i added its an inconvenience to everyone but dr philips is making arrangements mrs graham frowned i dont like the way dr philips is using you miss crawford thats what it is youre a young woman of good family what would your father have to say to the doctors inconsiderate behavior if you stay in owlhurst you remain with us thats all there is to say she pressed her fingers to her face for an instant and then added i must call on mrs denton its my duty perhaps youd like to go with me i dont think she will care to see me at such a time ive defended her soninlaw to her yes well perhaps youre right ill dress and go directly after breakfast there will be arrangements to make robert will know what to do about that ill ask him to come with me how tragic miss crawfordit could have been jonathan you know scarred in his mind the wound on his face could easily have affected his brain it was deep very deep i didnt try to explain that shell shock didnt begin with a physical wound she excused herself and i went to my room to write to my parents then realized that id be giving my father an excuse to come and rescue me shell shock murder inqueststhe colonel sahib couldnt have stayed away if need be hed bring the household cavalry with him i had packed my belongings the night before but didnt have the spirit to take them out again instead i sat at the desk by the windows of my room and began a letter to elayne when it was finished i left it on the silver salver on the little french table in the hall where someone would see that it was posted after that what to do with myself i opened the door of the house and stepped out looking at the sky to my surprise the clouds had broken the winds had died down and after the long spell of frosts and cold the day was warming quickly i went up to my room collected my coat and hat and gloves and set out for a walk as i did i saw mrs denton and her daughter leaving the rectory arranging poor ted bookers services i thought i would have liked to offer them my sympathy this was my first opportunity to observe sally she appeared to be a little younger than i was but she had a small son and was now a widow i thought about teds promises to me and felt sad he had wanted to heal i wished i could tell his wife that for her sake her future bleak her life a shambles now it was still possible that sally booker might find happiness again in time with timothy a little voice in my head asked chapter eight the rector walking briskly across to the church waved to me and when i waved back he waited for me to catch him up lovely weather i see youre enjoying it mr montgomery said as i came within earshot come in if you will i need to work for a bit this business of ted bookers death has disturbed me i joined him and we turned toward the church i thought it was your duty to comfort the ill and the grieving yes so it is but to tell you the truth i feel very uneasy in my mind he killed himself while devastated by the death of his brother i said bristling on ted bookers behalf i cant see how he could be held accountable for his actions given his state of mind thats not what i was driving at no i wonder if we couldnt have made a greater effort taken the burden from his wife and her mother i understand twins are very close closer than brothers even harrys death was a terrible shock to ted it was wrong of us to expect him to recover from it quickly i dont know that he would have done ive had some experience with what he was suffering its not as simple as grief at the loss of a loved one its a measure of guilt and the mind dwells on what was done or not done trying to find a way to change the outcome but of course thats not possible and so theres no way to escape what happened i found myself thinking of peregrine graham he might have had problems for years and i think that frightened him as much as harrys death you are very understanding for one so young he said smiling ive dealt with broken bodies and broken minds you learn how to cope and how to care are you staying on with us for a time we went into the church and felt the cold in the stones that todays sun hadnt begun to warm i reached in my pocket and pulled on my gloves i was to leave today but with mr bookers deathits possible ill be called to give information at the inquest indeed thats very kind of you before thinking i blurted it isnt kindness i thought he had turned a corner so to speak and was better but in the night the darkness must have come down again i should have stayed with him i thought dr philips would have arranged for someone he tried but it wasnt possible i would have come if hed asked but he did mrs graham told him you were leaving this morning and that she wouldnt interrupt your rest i would have sworn if i hadnt been in a church with its rector before i could answer that mr montgomery went on did you know that jonathan went to speak to him around ten oclock last evening i was just coming home from mrs turners sickbed when i saw him he waved in my direction but didnt wait to speak to me i thought perhaps their conversation had brought the war back to him as well still i was glad hed gone to see ted the two families had grown apart with the war it was kind of him i said doubtfully jonathan can be very blunt and to the point without sympathy sometimes but there is good in everyone we walked down the aisle and he paused to examine the cushion on one of the kneeling benches im afraid i was partial to arthur he was such a good man yes he was i responded sadly he removed the cushion and took out a needle and thread we sat down in one of the pews and he mended a corner that was worn i watched his hands deftly ply the needle and the work was as good as i might have done but the next cushion was beyond his skill and he set it aside i could ask the women to do this task but most of them are busy trying to help the war effort bandages knitting scarves and stockings for the men even vests but i must admit to the sin of pride when it comes to my church and i quietly do whats possible before asking for help we moved on and i found it soothing to watch him at work and i think he enjoyed the companionship as well my mind wandered in the stillness my eyes on the memorial brass that caught the earlymorning sun arthur ted booker peregrine graham three men to whom fate had not been kind arthur should have lived ted booker should have been given time to heal and as for peregrineas for peregrine he had been lost at fourteen and there was no way to bring him back i sighed and mr montgomery said over his shoulder thats the point of working with ones hands you see it gives the mind something else to do besides worry thats a very comforting philosophy when you enjoy mending and carpentry he laughed and gave me the end of a cushion to hold while he repaired a seam the needlepoint pattern was floral nasturtiums and petunias entwined in a vine of leaves a subaltern in my fathers last command had been fond of gardening and his mother had sent seeds for him to plant only the nasturtiums survived the heat i wondered where linford might be now dead the rector had set aside two cushions that were beyond his skill he put away his needle and said there enough for today collecting the cushions he said youre concerned for peregrine that does you credit i hadnt realized that id spoken the three names aloud then something occurred to me there was a new rector a new doctor was there as well a new policeman here in owlhurst i asked the rector and he said yes how did you know inspector gadd a wonderful man died of a brain injury some two years after peregrine was taken away inspector howard is our man now not as sharp as gadd you know but early days early days all of which meant that those who might have had some part in sending peregrine to the asylum had diedpoliceman doctor rector and what about the magistrate is he still here she yes of course if youre concerned about the coming inquest it shouldnt be terribly difficult for you would you like to go with me while i deliver these cushions its partly pastoral call and partly a way of dispensing charity in a way that doesnt offend mrs clayton needs the money and shes a wonderful seamstress and i think she might be glad to hear about arthur from you dr philips had mentioned her name ive nothing else to do i agreed if you dont think shell mind my coming along shell be delighted youll see we walked from the churchyard down past the bells and along the cricket pitch to a cottage tucked away down a narrow lane it sat with five of its neighbors in a tiny culdesac that time had passed by the cottages were like the rectory tudor in style their roofs running together and almost swaybacked with age mrs clayton had just stepped out to sweep the large stone that was her stoop and mr montgomery hailed her she looked up and said what brings you calling rector discovered my secret sins have you and she cackled like one of the hens scratching in the grassy patch of land at the end of the lane her eyes were watering in the cold air her teeth had gone and she was as wrinkled as a prune but her spirit was still young ive brought more work for you mrs clayton and a visitor she passed from her inspection of him to me standing a little behind the rector and said is this the lass who came about poor dear arthur news travels fast in small villages yes its elizabeth crawford mrs clayton how are you this morning from the start hed raised his voice a little to accommodate her loss of hearing is there anything you need im poorly but still breathing thankee she turned to me was it you nursed mr peregrine when he was sent home with that pneumonia it was fortunate i was there he had a close call if she knew and repeated this much gossip how was i to ask her about peregrine but i neednt have worried she invited us in for tea took the worn cushions from mr montgomery and then as she set cups in front of us followed by the teapot she said i was once maid in that house i knew mr graham and his first wife margaret now there was a lovely one was miss margaret she died in childbirth you know they feared for his sanity but men are fey creatures six months later he was in love again this time with the present mrs graham a montmorency she was before her marriage and they had three sons of their own in quick succession hardly one lying in past and it was near time for the next it was a house full of joy but it didnt last first mr graham was taken and then peregrine you might say and now arthur he was so like his father mr peregrine was and may still be for all i know id say that arthur favored his father as well i cant say as much for the other two very like their mother both of them then mr graham died after his carriage horse bolted and threw him out on his head a gypsy woman had foretold his death you know a horse will kill you and you will not see the hand that sends you to your death well it was a child with a hoop run out in the road that startled the horse into bolting and i doubt mr graham saw her until she was under the hooves of his horse it was all too quick both dead in the blink of an eye mrs clayton loudly sipped her tea through pursed lips and sighed i always did like a nice darjeeling susan sends me a packet now and again tell me about robert i said curiosity getting the better of me robert he came to owlhurst with mrs graham it was said to look after her her father didnt want her moving to kent if you ask me if that was his fear he shouldnt have given her a london season but the montmorency family comes from northumberland and whatever nonsense they get up to there it makes them a suspicious lot its been whispered that robert was a poor cousin and mr montmorency was looking for a way to keep him employed mr graham took him on to run the farm the rector smiled into his cup and i thought perhaps i ought to drop the subject of robert i neednt have worried mrs clayton was off again when she learned i had lived in india for much of my childhood she said and ive never been as far as chatham though i came that near to seeing london once she pinched her fingers together to indicate how close it was i didnt need to prod her she launched into the story of her own accord mrs graham was to take a house in london to show her sons the sights and so forth wed heard she was having mr peregrine seen by a specialist as well but nothing came of that i was to accompany her and i was that excited i told all my acquaintance they could write to me at number carroll square she spoke the address as if it were a talisman grinning toothlessly at me then went on i should have saved my breath mrs graham changed her mind and decided to keep the servants who came with the property and leave us behind i dont think ive ever felt such disappointment because that chance wasnt likely to come my way again i wanted to ask if this was the visit to london that had turned out so disastrously but id reckoned without mrs claytons sense of drama she added now that was when mr peregrine was said to have killed one of the london maids and i was grateful it was none of us dead at his hands still ive always been of the opinion he wouldnt have harmed someone brought from owlhurst he was used to us and our ways comment was expected from me i could see it in her face how terrible for everyone i said did the poor girl have any family i never heard of any how sad was mr peregrine considered dangerous before this murder not dangerous that i was ever told no but given to anger sometimes and not clever at his studies mr jonathan he was younger but hed torment mr peregrine when no one was looking and mr peregrine hed fight back then mr appleby the tutor would send him to his room as punishment it was mrs graham who decided they should be taught separately so that mr peregrine wouldnt hold the other lads back in their studies we had finished our tea and had no excuse to linger we thanked mrs clayton and rose to leave she said a shame about poor mr ted isnt it i was that fond of him and of harry have they set the day for the services rector not yet ill be sure to let you know mrs clayton i hadnt considered the fact that she would have known the bookers as well as the grahams i said would you tell me a little about harry what he was like how the two boys got on together we were standing at the door the rector with his hand on the latch mrs clayton said they was so alike you couldnt tell one from the other what one did the other was his shadow and close they could read each others thoughts ill be bound i remember once ted was in the greengrocers talking to me and almost in the middle of a sentence he said i must go mrs clayton harry wants me and i said where is he then and ted told me hes over by the cricket pitch i followed the boy out of the shop and he was walking straight toward the cricket pitch i could see harry in the distance standing there watching for him so i said to him when he came back from france you must miss your brother something fierce and ted answered hes still there inside my head and he calls and calls but he cant find me i wanted to weep for the two of them nasty war i shivered im surprised they were allowed to serve together i dont see how anyone even the army could have kept them apart she thanked us for coming to visit and as we stepped out the door wished me a safe journey home adding perhaps its a kindness that now they are together again those two it was as good an epitaph as any its so sad isnt it i said to mr montgomery what war does to families mr montgomery replied you mustnt take our burdens on your shoulders miss crawford i was warned when i went to france as chaplain not to dwell on all i saw or heard it was a hard lesson but it has stayed with me here in my parish i am the better for it but i thought he mended his church because he couldnt mend the broken lives and minds brought to him for comfort we walked in silence for a time and then he asked did you want to save ted booker because you couldnt save arthur graham his eyes were on my face dr philips has told me how hard you tried and you worked a miracle saving peregrine graham you must count your debt paid in full idont know if thats true or not i wont know until ive left here when theres distance between me and owlhurst i said unwilling to discuss my feelings with him then i heard myself admitting i kept putting off coming here oddly enough as if acknowledging my confession mr montgomery made one of his own i wasnt cut out to be a chaplain although i did all i could for the men who came to me i just didnt let them see the cost of helping them we walked on in silence and i said goodbye to him near the rectory before turning in the direction of the graham house something hed said earlier came back to me that hed seen jonathan leaving the surgery later in the evening i thought grimly had he undone all that dr philips and i had tried to accomplish jonathan hadnt shown any sympathy toward ted booker why the need to visit him timothy i might have understood but jonathan and speak of the devil here he was coming toward me i stopped a few paces from him and asked the question that was on my mind i didnt know youd visited ted booker last evening i wonderwas he in better spirits or had the depression settled over him again how did he strike you jonathan looked at me with a frown between his eyes i didnt go to the surgery last night why should i i had nothing to say to the man he nodded and walked on i stood there staring after him the rector had just told mebut perhaps he was wrong and it was someone else he might have assumedthat made no sense either i somehow hadnt had the impression that the rector was guessing at the visitors identity a little unsettled i had just reached the graham house to find a man turning away from the door and coming toward me he was lifting his hat to me as if he knew me miss crawford if im not mistaken yes i didnt know him tall middleaged dark hair already thick with gray and blue eyes that were pale with a darker rim disconcerting sorry to have to introduce myself here in the street im inspector howard i was just asking for you susan told me you were having a walk i must speak to you would you be more comfortable in the house with mrs graham present of course i wouldnt but i couldnt say so perhaps we might continue to walk a little i said certainly thank you he seemed relieved at my suggestion we turned back the way id come along the church wall toward the bells im here as you might have gathered to ask you about lieutenant booker dr philips tells me you had a good grasp of his medical situation and that you had spoken to him several times in fact just after his initial attempt at suicide a formality what was i to say that ted booker had been driven to his death by wellmeaning people who believed that a stiff upper lip and all that it entailed would set him right again that a good husband and father ought to know what was expected of him and do his duty however painful inspector howard waited finally i said i dont think he wanted to die he just didnt know how to go about living it was too overwhelming i was just speaking to mrs clayton and she told me how close the twoted and his brother harryhad been all their lives do you have a brother inspector he grimaced three sisters i had to smile then you cant very well put yourself in lieutenant bookers place do you feel that dr philips did everything possible to prevent bookers death so that was the way the wind was blowing mrs denton must have said something to leave the impression that dr philips was to blame on the heels of her own spoken wish that her soninlaw would die how like her now to try to make a case for neglect so that her daughter wouldnt be burdened with the stigma of a suicide we had come to the bells and walked on past their garden gate toward the cricket pitch not only was he convinced that lieutenant booker was on the mend that his word could be trusted i was as well neither of us would have left him if there had been any doubt in our minds he was contrite about frightening everyonehe said as much then why the turnaround he kept his pace matched to mine and watched my face without appearing to do it it must have taken some determination to tear off the bandages and reopen his wounds i take it the restraining straps had been removed when he was calmer yes i could have told inspector howard that according to the rector and dr philips there had been a late visitor to the surgery but there was no proof that whoever it was had even spoken to ted booker the police would believe jonathan graham if he claimed he was nowhere near the doctors house and it would add tinder to the fires of doubt regarding dr philips that his surgery was not properly secured i knew i had felt my own share of guilt for what had happened but it was emotional not rational dr philips must have experienced the same thing people died however much you tried to save them sometimes i said lieutenant booker was unable to tell the presenttoday his wife his son his responsibilitiesfrom the pasthis duty to the men serving under him he could easily have awakened confused not understanding where he was or why he was bandaged and tried to return to his unit not realizing that in the attempt he was going to die we stopped and the inspector stood there his eyes on the cricket pitch you think it was confusion about where he was and what he was doing that led to his death remembering how hard ted booker had fought to save harry i nodded he would have done anything sacrificing himself if need be to keep his brother alive its the only explanation i can offer as for dr philips ive known him only a very short time but hes well trained and compassionate id trust him with my own life and yet i understand that when mrs grahams son peregrine was very ill she didnt call in dr philips to oversee his care the gossips had been busy you are well informed i said well yes the asylum notified us that mr graham was ill and in the care of his family there were constables within call as long as he was in owlhurst it was reported that dr philips came to the house once but was turned away hardly turned away not really needed is closer to the mark i answered my voice nearly betraying my surprise at news of the constables i was in charge of the sickroom i didnt add that peregrine grahams case had been such a near run thing that id had my hands full dr philipss presence would have been reassuring besides the grahams werent turning him away as much as they were keeping peregrine behind closed doors out of sight and out of mind and jonathan graham isnt attended by dr philips in spite of a rather nasty war wound dr philips isnt a surgeon inspector howard lieutenant grahams bandages havent been removed and he may require more surgery before hes fully healed i daresay hell remain with the medical staff in charge of his case until they are satisfied that there is no infection i see he nodded as if he did i ventured one last remark let the crows come home to roost im sure mrs denton is distraught over her soninlaws death but its unkind to blame dr philips in my opinion for what its worth she was not as sympathetic as she might have been during lieutenant bookers illness and perhaps thats weighing on her mind now he smiled you are very forthright miss crawford i knew then the crows had found their rightful nest yes mrs denton had been busy protecting her daughter that was as it should be but she had also been partly responsible for ted bookers plight i wasnt about to let her ruin dr philipss reputation as well i spent several hours in mrs dentons company one afternoon while we watched over mr booker i had the opportunity to witness her feelings about him a little silence fell finally inspector howard turned back toward the church let me walk you home miss crawford youve been very helpful he asked what had brought me to owlhurst and i told him he said its a great sadness this war so many young men lost to us my sisters son for one he was a bright boy he could have made something of his life now well never know what it might have been are you married inspector indeed i am and ive been blessed with three young daughters we laughed together will you speak at the inquest he appeared to be offering me a choice if my opinion carries any weight of course i shall ahead of us was the church he said would you mind if i left you here you know your way i think ill be fine thank you he turned to go and then had one last question for me in your opinion was ted booker mad not mad no i looked toward the church steeple thinking about peregrine graham not as we think of madness he was as wounded in spirit as jonathan graham is wounded in the flesh inspector howard touched his hat to me as he thanked me and then walked on toward the high street of owlhurst looking after him i wondered how much good i had really doneand how much harm on the whole i thought the colonel sahib would have been pleased with his daughters handling of that interview inspector howard was no fool when i reached the house i could almost sense the curiosity welling behind that front door and the questions id be asked about what the inspector had had to say to me the very thought was enough to make me keep on walking i wasnt ready to answer them and i refused to add to any speculation about police interest in dr philips and so with nowhere else to go and my feet feeling like numb blocks of ice i called on susans mother it was the only other sanctuary i could think of where there was a fire and a warm welcome no one had told her the sad news about ted booker and tears came to her eyes as she sat down in the nearest chair oh my good lord no i tried to comfort her but she took his death hard i was that fond of the booker twins the truth is i liked them better than the graham boys barring arthur of course steady lads honest and caring thats what they were sons a mother could be proud of i was surprised but then peregrine was a murderer jonathan seemed to be callous and uncaring and timothytimothy i hadnt really understood yet he seemed to be open and honest but sometimes that appeared to be what was expected of him as if to show he bore no ill will to fate for having given him a clubfoot again that english insistence on stiff upper lip pretending nothing is wrong susans mother sat there for a time reminiscing about the booker twins and then said i dont know how many more shocks i can bear first arthur and then harry and now mr ted she shook her head i ought to count poor mr peregrine as well hes as good as dead isnt he i was talking to mrs clayton earlier she told me she had expected to go to london with the family until plans were changed at the last minute were you to go as well i was to stay here i can tell you i was more than a little envious of hester clayton at the time as it turned out i was glad i wasnt there it was a terrible shock i heard mrs graham speaking to inspector gadd describing how hed ripped that poor girl to pieces in an orgy of lust and blood very like jack the ripper it was thats how she put it i didnt sleep for two nights picturing it and mrs graham walking in to find the body and peregrine there with blood all over him its a wonder she didnt lose her mind shocked i said i thought but i dont know what i thought a nice quiet killing with no blood and the victim someone i didnt know and never would appalling and all that but somehow until now not real mrs graham cried all night saying she wished hed died there and then so she could bury him beside his father and have done with it and never have to think about it again ever there were tears in her eyes again and she bit her lip to hold them back i was that fond of him as a boy very like his father he was when he was young i tell you it was such a blow but then he went away and we all tried to go on as if nothing had happened it wasnt as if wed seen him every day even when he was young running about and coming in from some lark muddy and looking for a bite to eat i used to save a little treat for him setting it aside before he was found to be different after that he never came down to the kitchen and his tutor told us that he must be quiet or it would damage his brain damage medically unless he was subject to seizures that didnt make much sense but of course the tutor was not trained to deal with such a child and he probably meant well i never liked that tutor susans mother was saying sly he was and not much one for conversation in the servants hall he took his meals separately a step above the rest of us but he would come down sometimes and speak to one of us about mr peregrines needs as if the prince of wales was wanting something mind you and the tutor was the lord chamberlain i never resented it knowing what the poor boy must be suffering his brothers running and shouting about the house or in the back garden while he must sit by his window and watch there was talk that little prince john had such seizures and was sent away i remember that and i thought poor mr peregrine and wondered if he was to die young too she seemed to tire her face drooping a little i should never have told you such things you wont let on to susan or to mrs graham will you no i wouldnt dream of speaking of ittruly i wouldnt wish to remind any of them youre kind miss its been bottled up in me all these years and i thought id carry it to my grave but ive been that upset over mr ted will you be all right if i leave you yes go if you dont mind i need to rest thank you for coming miss i made my farewells and slipped out the cat jumped into her lap as i latched the door and she bent her head as if nodding i walked back to the house and went up to my room without meeting anyone i was grateful for the respite small wonder no one in the family wanted to see or speak to peregrine graham while he was there ill even after all these years the memory of what hed done must still be raw it explained too why there were constables on watch and why at the first sign of recovery peregrine had been sent directly back to the asylum while he was still too weak to do anything frightful again chapter nine the magistrate the aging relict of the man who had held that position before her was nearing seventy hunched and sharptongued dr philips pointed her out seated nearest the roaring fire one of her grandsons beside her she had commanded that we hold the inquest at once so that she could visit her granddaughter in canterbury in time for the birth of her first greatgrandchild and everyone from the grahams to the police agreed without argument it was the day after poor ted booker had been buried indecent haste i thought but perhaps no more than a duty to lady parsons i didnt know the coroner a dour man of fifty who according to dr philips had come down from tonbridge to conduct the proceedings i listened to the evidence given about theodore russell bookers state of mind as if he were a stranger the witnesses barely knew an embarrassment something to put behind us quickly so that we get on with living dr philips gave a very clinical report on his mental state and then added i think perhaps we havent considered the whole man he and his brother were close and harolds death must have been appalling theodore booker was not in another part of the front word coming secondhand he was there a witness he held his brother in his arms as harold died we must accept as well our failure as a member of the medical profession to find a cure for horror and heartbreak if theodore booker took his own life while in the grip of such painful memories it was not his fault it was the fault of war and of our inability to understand how to save him there was silence as he stepped down and walked to his place next to me we were in the bells in a parlor that was more often the scene of parties and filled with laughter not talk of death the dark beams over our heads and the dark paneling of the walls added to a dreary day with rain coming down in sheets fit our somber mood i reached out to touch the doctors arm as he sat down then heard my own name called to give evidence i did so to the best of my ability remembering that i was under oath but i also told the truth as id observed it on the night of his death i had felt so strongly that lieutenant booker had turned a corner then like dr philips i added more than i was required to tell he loved his wife very much he told me that he tried to heal for her sake i felt a great pity for him because he wanted to be a good husband there were two questions for meone to do with my training and whether or not i knew enough about such cases to judge the circumstances surrounding teds death and the other to do with whether or not theodore booker was in my view of sound mind i answered grief is difficult to bear at the best of times ted booker was perfectly sane but so overwhelmed by what he saw as his responsibility for his brothers death that he couldnt find his way back to the man he was i wanted to add that a little more understanding from his motherinlaw might have gone far in saving him but i held my tongue she was seated in the front row with her daughter her face smug with satisfaction that the troublesome man was dead sally was so shrouded in widows weeds that her feelings were hard to read there was no way of knowing whether she felt relief or despair indeed most of the people attending the hearing seemed to be unsympathetic to the dead man i had a fleeting thought that the poor man was well out of it these were neighbors and friends they had known him since he was a boy and yet they had turned away from him when he most needed them was that what had happened to peregrine graham in his own hour of need in the end the finding was that theodore booker while not in his right mind due to grief over his brothers death had taken his own life the stigma of suicide had been lifted from the survivors that was all mrs denton had wished for no mention was made of dr philips or his skill as a physician i hoped that my conversation with inspector howard had well and truly spiked those guns as i was walking out of the bells glad to be away from the crowded room inside i looked out at the rain and thought about going back to the graham house then decided to sit in the church for a few minutes until i felt a little more tolerant jonathan graham had said nothing about going to see ted booker and the coroner hadnt called on him to give evidence i had seen mr montgomery look at him several times as if expecting him to add what he knew but he didnt speak up and neither did the rector i had closed the churchyard gate behind me and was walking toward the stainedglass windows of saints when i heard someone shouting i turned to see who it was it was a rider coming fast and calling to jonathan graham as he was escorting his mother home they had reached the large trees that overhung the churchyard wallnot twenty yards from where ted had been buriedwhen they heard the shout they turned as one and the rider came up to them reaching down to hand them a letter as jonathan opened the envelope his mother was questioning the man on horseback i realized then that it was robert douglas holding the horse steady as he answered jonathans face was flushed with something very like fury but he nodded curtly passed the letter to his mother and she bent over it trying to see it in the shadows cast by the bare limbs and her black umbrella i thought for an instant she was going to faint but she steadied herself said something more to robert who wheeled his horse and went back toward the stragglers just coming out of the bells i realized that he was looking for timothy who was speaking to mrs denton while sally was being handed into a carriage by the young man id seen with lady parsons during the proceedings timothy broke off excused himself and spoke sharply to robert who answered and pointed timothy graham turned toward where his brother and his mother were standing and without a word of farewell to mrs denton strode away to join them rigid with emotion robert lifted his hat to mrs denton with a brief word then put his horse to a trot to follow timothy no one had seen me there by the church nave and i stood watching the little scene play itself out as timothy also read the letter and then passed it back to his mother the grahams walked briskly toward home robert riding ahead to stable his horse from their posture heads together backs rigid i knew that the news was bad all i could think of was that the journey back to the asylum had been too much for peregrine graham and that he had got his wishhed succumbed to his pneumonia after all chapter ten i hurried into the church and sat down in a corner near the pulpit where no one could see me huddled into my cloak for warmth and comfort this wasnt the right moment to go to the house let them have their time to grieve but it was cold in the church as cold as the tomb i couldnt stop myself from thinking and so after a time though the rain was coming down hard i left the church and crossed to the rectory my shoes wet to my ankles and the hem of my skirt dragging a middleaged woman opened the door when i knocked and ushered me into the hall clucking over how wet i was the rector wasnt to home she informed me hed gone to speak with the widow to offer what comfort he could after the inquest at first i thought she meant mrs graham and then i realized she was speaking of sally booker i turned away wondering where i could go now and she said no you mustnt leave here so wet as you are miss the kitchen is warm ill dry your shoes and your cloak while you have a bite of something ive a nice bit of soup thats just the right thing on such a day rector wouldnt like me to send you away just because hes not to home she glanced at the sky i dont think this will last for more than a quarter of an hour see its brighter to the west i smiled trying to hold back tears of gratitude thank you theres nothing to thank me for its rector says turn away no one in need was i in need yes in a way i wanted to go home to see colonel sahib to listen to my mother being sensible and comforting at the same time right now being tucked into bed with a glass of warm milk would have been the epitome of happiness ted booker was dead there was nothing i could do to change that and now peregrine graham had died because he had been sent back to the asylum over my objections coming to kent had been a bad decisioni was sure no one would carry out arthurs last wishes nothing would be done about whatever it was he wanted set right i tried to come to grips with my despondent mood and couldnt the housekeeper took me down the passage to the kitchen and as i glanced over my shoulder i could see the two china dogs in the parlor window staring back at me id glimpsed them on my first night in owlhurst and this was most likely my last night she introduced herself as mrs oldsey housekeeper here for many years because the last two rectors hadnt been married not that ive lost hope for rector she added as she helped me out of my heavy wet cloak and draped it in front of the kitchen fire hes young yet weve six bedchambers in this house did you know that and only one of them being used i long to see children about the house i wasnt blessed with any myself but i sincerely do love the little ones she bustled about setting the kettle on to boil as i removed my wet shoes and looked around it was an oldfashioned kitchen with no wife to complain and have it redone but mrs oldsey seemed not to mind what brought you out on such a morning as this she asked as she set down cups and saucers from the cupboard i was at the inquest yes the poor booker lad sad i didnt have the heart to go i remember him and his brother imps they were but goodhearted what was the verdict brought in death by his own hand in the throes of grief for his brother ah well best that way he can be buried in holy ground and his widow doesnt have his memory hanging about her neck like something to ward off the plague amused by her way of seeing life i said thats what her mother hopes as well mrs denton a piece of work that one though it isnt christian of me to say so but a spades a spade for all that i kept my opinion to myself but the twinkle in mrs oldseys eyes told me she suspected i shared her views she fed me tea and toast and a cup of soup warmed up from the night before i ate because i was hungry and because i dreaded going back out in the rain to the graham house mrs oldsey rambled on sitting across from me as if we were old friends having a gossip i found the courage to ask her about peregrine she frowned that was another tragedy he used to come to services with his father a handsome child with good manners and then he stopped coming and later the whispers began that he wasnt quite right in the head i thought often enough that mrs graham was ashamed of him else shed have seen to it that he lived as normal a life as possible gossip or no gossip but she didnt and as i never set eyes on him again until he was almost fourteen whos to say what was right and what was wrong you saw him when he returned from london oh yes they brought him here he was in such a state of shockwhite as his shirt shaking with fright and unable to utter a wordthat i thought he ought to be in his own home and his own bed but mrs graham wouldnt hear of it ive three boys to think of she told me and i cant go to them until ive settled peregrine ive sent robert for inspector gadd and dr hadley can you find the rector for me please and she asked me to send for lady parsons sir fredericks widow i kept the boy down here in the kitchen trying to warm him up a little and wash his hands but he wouldnt let me touch him whatever i said then they insisted on locking him in one of the bedchambers without so much as a word of comfort to him after a bit they went up for him and took him away him still all bloody and without a coat and rector told me later he was in the asylum i wouldnt wish my worst enemy in a place like that not to speak of my own child i didnt learn until later that hed killed someone i thought somehow hed done himself an injury all that blood they never said who hed killed and when i asked rector he told me it was best i didnt know that it was horrible beyond human imagination i never forgot that horrible beyond human imagination she repeated it as if the words had been imprinted in her memory most folks have forgotten mr peregrine you know perhaps thats for the best but theyd remember all the whispers soon enough when he was brought back to owlhurst to lie next to his father i had a feeling it would be a brief graveside service with few mourners though the curious would be there to gawk she went on with other stories about her years as housekeeper and after a while since the rector hadnt returned i put on my stilldamp shoes and my cloak and set out for the graham house the rain had let up just as mrs oldsey had prophesized and i was grateful i let myself in the front door there were no sounds to greet meno conversation somewhere in the downstairs rooms and no voices on the first floor as i quietly went up the staircase i wanted to find susan and ask her what was happening but she too seemed to have vanished i expect she had gone to visit her mother and give her the outcome of the inquest she had one afternoon off a week i sat by the fire in my room and waited there was nothing else i could do but it wasnt mrs graham who came to speak to meit was robert he knocked at my door and when i opened it he said gruffly mrs grahams apologies miss crawford but theres been terrible news mrs graham would take it as a favor if you could be in tonbridge in time for the six oclock train tonight ill be taking you myself as soon as youre ready i had expected thisand i hadnt all i could manage to say was i can be ready in an hour id like to say my farewells mrs graham begs you to forgive her if she isnt able to wish you a safe journey ill ask susan to pack a box of sandwiches for you and a thermos of tea to see you as far as london im to send a telegram to your father to meet you there i could hardly tell him that i would rather leave in the morning than arrive in london so late instead i thanked him and added ill write mrs graham as soon as i reach somerset please tell her shes been more than kind i didnt know what else to add he nodded and was gone i packed my belongings for a second time and looked around for elaynes letter to me to read again on the train id forgot the name of the man she was so sure shed marry but it wasnt in my case and it wasnt in the little desk between the windows id last seen it in the sickroom and i went there to find it it wasnt on the table by the bed nor on the mantelpiece and i knew that if susan had found it shed have brought it to me as a last resort i got down on my knees and lifted the coverlet to look under the bed and there it was the three pages scattered there i chuckled susan hadnt used the carpet sweepermy fingers came up with dust clinging to them i looked again for the envelope but it wasnt with the pages that she might well have found without the enclosed letter and tossed it in the grate i took the letter back to my room and after closing my case i left it outside my door with my valise for robert to take down i was ready when he came for me and in the dogcart i saw the box with my sandwiches he handed me warmed rugs as i stepped into the cart and i settled myself as comfortably as i could he draped a length of canvas over my baggage and my lap handed me a large black umbrella and then mounted the box no one had come to see me off i watched the house disappear and then the church dwindle to a distant smudge as we turned away and the bells with it and then owlhurst was gone i felt like crying nothing had happened the way id hoped or even expected and somehow id lost arthur as well i had liked dr philips and the rector and was sorry not to say farewell to them but surely they would understand soon the asylum loomed ahead in daylight a grim place with no redeeming softnessas grim i thought as a prison at least peregrine was free of it and his suffering over like ted booker he would be buried in a wintry churchyard and forgotten before the spring i was thoroughly miserable when we finally reached the station in tonbridge and the train was already there white plumes of smoke curling about the booking office roof as the engine worked up a head of steam robert left me in the cart while he went quickly inside speaking to the stationmaster i could see them through the grimy lamplit window the winter darkness had come down and it fit my own dark mood and then robert was back again my tickets in his hand hurrying me toward the train i had forgotten my sandwiches and with a muttered word he went back for them then caught me up all the while the stationmaster was fingering his watch impatience in every line as he stood by my compartment i expected robert to leave me then but he helped me up into the train settled me by the window then stowed my case and valise where i could reach them if i needed them that done he stood for a moment looking down at me as if he didnt know what to say finally he took my hand and held it for a moment like a gentleman telling a lady goodbye without a word he touched the brim of his hat and was gone and the train started with a lurch almost before his boots had touched the platform again i sat back in my seat and prepared myself for the long journey ahead we were just coming into sevenoaks when a thought brought me out of my drowsiness i remembered timothy and jonathan arguing in their mothers presence about who should inherit when peregrine was dead well they would soon know i found that i didnt care in sevenoaks i got off the train to send a telegram to my father telling him i would like to stay in london a few days with elayne he had no way of knowing she was in france and i needed a respite before i faced his sharp eyes or my mothers intuition so much for longing for their comfort that had been a moment of weakness and i was rather ashamed of it now that id put some distance between myself and owlhurst the train was slow a troop train taking precedence up the line and i listened to two elderly women comparing notes on the funeral theyd attended in tunbridge wells i knew tunbridgeit had once been a garrison town and id visited friends of my parents there on one of my fathers leaves but dissecting a funeral was not a comfortable subject for me and i tried to shut out their voices with a book i borrowed from the gentleman across from me he had just finished it and was stuffing it back in his case when i asked to see it it was a treatise on the history of the turkish empire and i found it quite absorbing our p o boat had stopped in istanbul on our return from india and i had spent an afternoon in a carriage touring the city i fell asleep all the same and then we were pulling into london the outskirts a series of back gardens and small industries depressing in winter garb but mostly i could see only my own reflection in the glass as i looked out from our brightly lit carriage and there were circles under my eyes nearly as dark as those i saw in the glass on my way home from greece in november the two ladies were met by a young man with one arm his sleeve pinned to his coat without a word the man from whom id borrowed the book helped bring down our bags and then a porter was there to pile them on his cart theres no one to meet you the book lender asked as i gave in my ticket and stood there wondering how i was to arrange to have my heavier valise delivered i daresay theyre late i answered smiling not wanting a portly knight in shining armor to see me home the relief at not finding my father on the platform made me feel giddy then let me summon a cab and see you into it i thanked him and in ten minutes i was in the cab and on my way to the flat i was tired despite my brief nap it was late and i would be glad for a nights sleep mrs hennessey wasnt there and i asked the cabbie to leave my luggage outside her door shed see that it was taken upstairs the dustman always stopped for an early cup of tea and the promise of a slice of cake or tart would be enough to send him up with it i went up the steps feeling each one thinking that all i required would be a warming cup of tea and then my bed that is if elayne had thought to replenish our dwindling supply of tea after all it was her turn id learned long since to do without milk but we kept a tin of sugar i took my hat off as i passed the landing and had it in my hand as i reached into my pocket for the key it slid into the lock the door opened and i stepped into the silent flat with a sigh of relief i was home i set my hat on the table near the door and felt for the light switch it didnt turn on which meant that elayne hadnt replaced the bulb when it burned out i fumbled for the candle and matches we kept on a shelf as it spurted into gold and blue flame and the candlewick flared and then steadied i began to remove my coat the flat was chilly as it always was at night and for an instant i regretted not going home to fires on the hearth but never mind i made myself a cup of tea drank it to warm me and then went down the passage to the room at the back that was mine the quiet was comforting and the sense of being in familiar surroundings was what i needed there was a small package on my pillowelaynes gift i opened it feeling a surge of happiness one never knew what elayne might consider a gift this time it was a pair of black french glovesheaven only knew where shed found themwith tiny pearl buttons at the wrist and leather soft as silk and they actually fit i smiled elayne had borrowed my operalength gloves often enough to know my size perfectly id have to return the favor next time i saw something that suited her as well as these suited me feeling more cheerful i bathed my face and hands undressed crawled between damp sheets and huddled under the layers of comforters until i had warmed a space for myself my last thought as i drifted into sleep was we must find ourselves a catmy feet are cold i didnt have the energy to heat water for the bottle i kept in the little table by my bed it was close on to three oclock when i came awake with a shock hearing something in the front of the flat elayne or one of the others theyd seen my things downstairs and were trying not to wake me which of course is noisier than going about their business quietly i threw on my dressing gown and cringed as i put my warm feet into cold slippers opening my door i walked down the passage a candle burst into life just as i reached the end of the passage and i caught my breath in alarm there was a man standing in what we euphemistically called the kitchen his back to me he was rummaging through the box of sandwiches id brought with me id eaten only about half of them on the train my other luggage was at his feet anthony i asked thinking this must surely be elaynes staff officer how had he slipped past mrs hennessey he turned sharply thank you for i broke off knowing in that instant that my heart would surely stop the single candle illuminated his face now and i couldnt believei was dreaming there wasntit couldnt be feeling faint for the first time in my life i put out a hand to touch the passage wall beside me youre dead i whispered finally i nearly am he said holding one of the sandwiches in his hand i havent eaten for three days do you mind he sat down suddenly in the nearest chair ive lived on tea and that small box of biscuits i found in your cupboard it was peregrine looking as pale as his own ghost the hand holding the sandwich shaking as if with a palsy he was wearing an illfitting suit of clothes his hair tousled from sleep and his face drained of all feeling as he watched my changing expressions the heavy shadow of his beard gave him a sinister cast as my brain began to work again i could feel a ripple of fear run up my spine what are youhow did you knowmrs hennessey she hadnt been there when i came in earlier and this man was a murderer is that who she is i saw her stepping out the door and waited until she was down the street ive heard her since coming and going she owns this house shes my i paused not wanting to tell him too much he was frowning why did you say just now that i was dead i saw robertit was just after the inquest for ted bookerrobert came to find mrs graham and jonathan i could tell he brought bad newsmrs graham and jonathan were very upset as was timothy i saw them from the church as they were walking home ted booker is dead yes i thoughtthey were so upset i expect theyd learned id escaped from the asylum he told me grimly did youyoure wearing someone elses clothingwhat happened to the man they belong to i didnt kill him if thats what youre thinking i gave him a handful of the powders i took at night they must have been sedativeshe probably slept the night through in my bed who was he one of the doctorslook do you mind if i eat this if not ill pass out at your feet i nodded and he bit hungrily into the sandwich i waited and as he swallowed the first mouthful he said i told them i thought my fever was back id rubbed my face until it felt warm flushed the staff doctor was just leaving and he came to my room to see what the matter was id been given my powders or so he thought and i was hardly likely to attack him he asked me to open my mouth and as he bent forward to see my throat i had him in a headlock no one heard him cry outtheres too much of that at night anyway i knocked him down turned off the light so that my room was dark and forced him to eat the powders then i changed my clothes for his and left thats the only time the main doors arent watchedafter everyone has been locked in the staff can come and go without disturbing the house i walked through the fields until it was safe enough to return to the road about three miles on a farm cart offered me a lift to cranbrook he went on eating his hands hardly able to bring the sandwich to his mouth i stood there not knowing what to dowhether he would kill me or let me live whether i should find a weapon and try to overpower him while he was still lightheaded from hunger or try to talk him into going back to owlhurst picking up the thermos he could hear tea sloshing about inside and he drank nearly half a cup in one gulp it must have been lukewarm but he didnt seem to care god i dont know what id have done if you hadnt brought food with you he said what did my relatives do send you packing they told me theyd had distressing news i thoughtfrom their faces i thought theyd been informed of your death and so i left to be out of the way robert douglas took me to tonbridge there was money in the doctors pocket i used it for the train and i walked here from the station he gave me a twisted smile id tied a bandage around my head so that people would help me i didnt remember how to take a train much less how to reach london but there wasnt enough money for food theyll trace you to the train it wont be long before they come looking for you not in this direction i bought a ticket to dover when i reached rochester then i asked a woman if she would purchase my ticket to london for me i told her i couldnt see well enough to know if i was being charged the correct amount she took pity on me and told me her brother was in france he could pass for a wounded soldierhe hadnt fully recovered from the pneumonia his eyes sunken his face pale from long years in the asylum theyll be looking for a man with a head wound not at first i expect youre wondering what to do with me you cant stay hereothers live here theyll be back soon yes elayne it was her bed i slept in shes still in france i expect the letter still mrs hennessey is prying shes never allowed men up here shell hear you and report to my father that theres a man in my flat he wont like it i dont intend for mrs hennessey to hear me and ive no more money i have nowhere else to go but what brought you here to london i mean you could have disappeared in canterbury or dover just as easily i came to london to relive what happened to me the timbre of his voice had changed there was a harshness now that worried me i couldnt stop an indrawn breath he laughed bitterly not in that way i was fourteen frightened out of my wits i saw things that i cant remember except in my dreams to distract him i asked how did you unlock the flat door your friend elayne hadnt locked it in her haste to leave if id had to id have found a way to persuade the dragon at the gate to let me in i could hardly sleep on the landing you must go ive done you no harm i did my best to save your life you have no reason to hurt me ive told you im here for reasons of my own look lying there in a bed i havent slept in for nearly ten years my mind was playing tricks on me i expect it was the fever but that doesnt matter i need to knowcertain things ill spare you the details they arent pretty help me and ill either go back to the asylum or put an end to an already wretched life your only fault was in nursing me too well for that sin you must put up with me for a day or so longer you cant stay here my father he had started the second sandwich and i could see he was strongerid missed my chance he said his gaze holding mine i have a pistol with me jonathans war souvenir it only has four bullets in the clip but ill use them if im forced to my shock must have shown in my face you cant haveyou were barely able to stand much less rove through the house looking for a weaponand jonathan will know its missing youll be considered armed mentally unstable and youll be shot on sight thats my worry not yours go back to bed lock your door if you wish but i wont do you any harm he laughed a grim laugh that frightened me i couldnt lift a finger if i had to still im going to bring bedding out here you cant leave without stepping on me remember the pistol and dont try the door of my room didnt lock id never given that a thought until now colder than the cold of the flat i turned and went back to my bed shoving a chair under the knob of the door i huddled in the bedclothes listening for snoring that would tell me he was asleep chapter eleven the next thing i knew a watery sunlight shone through the curtains and splashed across my bed i sat up with a start dressed hastily and removed the chair from my door peregrine graham was asleep across the threshold of the outer door and the instant he heard me he opened his eyes and stared at me as if he hardly knew me im awake im cold i want my tea will you let me prepare it go ahead i busied myself with the tea things then said youve got yourself a small problem theres no food in the flat well both starve ive considered that youll go and buy what we need if you call the police or in any way betray my whereabouts ill kill mrs hennessey if shes out ill shoot the first three people i see on the street and then myself im a murderer what can they do to me a man can only hang once i couldnt tell whether he was mocking me or not your family will be hurtit will bring up all the old gossip and make their lives a misery except for arthur who is dead and beyond hurting i dont really care thats a vicious thing to say he rose from his bedding then faced me taller malevolent my stepmother treated me worse than an animal she slept with her cousin before and after my fathers death i dont know if any of my half brothers are related to me what do i owe any of them her cousin robert douglas he was always decent to me i give him thatbut he did nothing to protect me well i thought that certainly explains a good dealif its true he saw the surprise in my face and added i should have thought youd guessed you must have seen them together you must have seen the resemblance between timothy and robert if not jonathan but id thought they favored their motheri said as much yes yes i know he responded impatiently but you havent lived with them and watched as i did when we were young look at their hands theyre his and the way their hair grows the way their upper lips curl when they say words like church or children it sounded more like obsession than observation and he must have sensed my disbelief because he went on earnestly persuasively i had no idea until one day i caught them in bed together i was a child i didnt know what that meant but that evening i was locked in my room and seldom allowed to join the family again until we were taken to london i didnt know whether to believe him or not the only confirmation i had was the ease with which robert came and went in that house and his familiar attitude toward mrs graham but of course they were cousins you have a devious mind for someone the world claims is halfwitted i was told often enough that i was slow stupid i had trouble concentrating and jonathan took pleasure in taunting me about it mr applebyour tutordid nothing to stop him id be tonguetied with anger and i must have seemed dull and belligerent and unable to learn but in the asylum i saw how halfwitted children behaved and i knew i wasnt like them still id been told the alternative was hanging and i stayed in that godbereft place and held my tongue literally they thought after a time that i was mute that it was the shock of what id done or where i was they got used to not hearing my voice from one month to the next i hadnt heard him speak when he arrived or as he left my care only in the privacy of the sickroom had he talked to me and then not in the beginning the teakettle began singing merrily jolting both of us i made the tea and while it steeped i said surely you remember what you did that sent you to the asylum my memory isnt clear some of it was shock some of it was the nightmare of being taken from london directly to the asylum and never going home again i was kept at the rectory until arrangements were made i was dazed confused frightened out of my wits i do remember being led away from something too ghastly to look at anymore i could smell the blood on my hands and feel the stiffness of it on my shirt and i remember vomiting on the stairs as we started down them robert took me away and tried to clean my face and hands then shut me up somewhere they were amazed to find me asleep on the floor when they came back for me i remember they were shocked that i could sleep after what id done i remember all that but not what happened in that roomonly in my dreams does it come back again and for years id wake up screaming i also remember standing in the drawing room of the london house and my stepmother was telling someonea policeman i thinkthat she blamed herself for allowing me to accompany the family to london she said that shutting me away in my room had made me resentful and angry and twisted something in me but she had thought london might be good for me shed wanted me to see a doctor there it was the first id heard of it she saidi can hear her voice nowthat id killed the woman the way id have liked to kill her that shed found the pocketknife that my father had left me buried deep in her pillow one night and never spoken of it i felt cold despite the tea peregrine was madhowever lucid he might seem at times but what was the difference between this man and ted booker my conscience wanted to know you were sympathetic enough to the soldier i tried to think of something else to talk about something to take his mind off killing did you know where you were in london did you know the house where all this happened i was sure he couldnt tell me we were to spend the autumn in london a month my stepmother had friends there relatives we went up by train and i was allowed to look out the window as long as i didnt speak to anyone the house in london seemed small after owlhurst but timothy and jonathan shared a room and arthur and i were put together robert took them to the zoo but i stayed behind because i might make a scene i was never allowed to see people and my tutor told me that i was different and mustnt make a fuss when i was told to stay in my room he said people would stare at me and be unkind i didnt want to be stared at and so they went to the tower and arthur told me afterward about the cannon and the ravens everything was the same id come to london but i might as well have stayed at home there was an upstairs maid she was pert teasing when no one else was about i didnt like her and told her so to her face my stepmother put me in a room by myself as punishment one night there was a dinner party and my stepmother went taking robert with her i wasnt well i hadnt been since i was put in the room alone my head swam and my stomach was queer i remember lying on the floor because it was cold and it felt good the rest is hazy a botched jumble of images he rubbed his face with his hands scrubbing at it i could hear several days growth of beard rasping against his palms and his voice came through his fingers in an odd sort of echo that made it sound like someone elses thats why it haunts me i cant make sense of things what happened when and who was there are you trying to tell me you didnt kill that young woman i thought he was hoping to win me over with a lie i killed her of course i did when the police showed me my knife i told them the truth do you think id have lived nearly fourteen years in that godforsaken asylum if i wasnt sure what id done the admission was shocking but you just saidyou havent come to london to remember you already have if i hadnt been afraid before i was now you arent listening i want to remember why i wanted to kill her why i picked up that knife and when and how it felt to do what i did that night ive shut it out its all missing and when i was so ill when i thought i was dying i realized that i had to know i had to put it all together and look at it in the light his eyes were intense and i wondered if i would live through his nightmare or since he knew what murder felt like whether he would be eager to experience it again id read somewhere that when men kill as in wars they lose a little of their humanity each time until it becomes easier less awful and they accept killing in a way that civilized people cant tolerate whether it was true or not i didnt know but in front of me was a man who had killed not in war but on a quiet london street without provocation or as far as i could see a drop of repentance peregrine graham must be as dangerous as his family claimedit would behoove me to be very careful or i could trigger his anger and suffer the consequences a part of my mind said they should have hanged him when they had the chance i asked clearing away the tea things in an effort to keep my hands from shaking peregrine what good will it do to remember what will you have gained bringing it all back again i can heal it was such an unexpected answer that i stared at him you dont know what its like to look in the mirror every time you shave and see a normal face when you know that beneath the flesh and bone theres a monster inside i told myself there in the bed in owlhurst that if god forced me to live id find a way to force myself to face myself i caught my breath it was all so logical and so macabre i didnt know how to respond he smiled crookedly this is a poor recompense for saving my life but then i didnt want it to be saved he reached into his pocket and pulled out the crumpled envelope from elaynes letter you gave me the means unwittingly i wanted nothing more than to turn back the clock arrive on my doorstep and find the flat emptyor filled with my friends and their friends all of them real all of them normal i was allowed to go and do the marketing a little later in the morning i was reminded that mrs hennessey would suffer if i talked to anyone or sent a telegram to kent she was there at her door when i came back smiling at me asking how my arm was faring and if id come to london to take up my next posting i answered her questions smiling as if nothing had happened to change my world or hers i told her that id been in kent and had returned to london to spend a little time with friends that i had missed them shut away in somerset she nodded and told me that i had only to ask and she would bring me anything i needed i thanked her and went on up the stairs feeling peregrine in the darkness at the top watching and listening he had the door open for me and then shut it behind me that was well done ten minutes later he was asking me how to go about finding a particular house in london you dont remember where you were staying i asked surprised you dont understand i was never told these things i was taken to the train i was taken to the house and i never left it until we returned to kent i can only tell you what i saw from my windowa fenced square with trees a walk several benches and a gate on four sides the house across from ours was a pale cream with six chimneys a false balcony on the upper floorsno more than an ornate iron railing in front of the windowsand a black door with a brass knocker and short iron railings up the two steps to the door there are any number of houses in london that match that description i debated how far i should go in helping him whether dragging my heels would wear him down or if helping him would buy some protection in the end then well walk the streets until we find the right one you arent in any condition to walk the streets this is winter and london is damp cold you could find yourself ill again pneumonia can come back it behooves you to help me the sooner the better i made up my mind ill take you to a place i know that fits your description it may be the wrong place but its somewhere to start fair enough i had bought a razor for him while i was out and he used it ridding himself of the dark beard and with it some of the sinister expression that i hadnt seen while nursing him id kept him reasonably well shaven then because of the need to wash his face after his fearsome coughing fits we left the flat together i expecteddreadedmrs hennessey popping out her door and asking who my young man was an escaped murderer mrs hennessey my father will be horrified but she didnt come out her door and then we were in the street london in winter is cold the damp from the thames pervades the city and the wind seems to sweep down the long streets without hindrance as if blowing across arctic ice floes a bitter and penetrating cold the sort that makes life miserable for those who live here we found a cab in the next street and i gave the driver the only address i could think of the one that mrs clayton had mentioned in her enthusiastic account of nearly visiting london but would peregrine know it now would he recognize the square or the houses we said very little to each otherfrom the time we left my flat our conversation had been limited to necessities i could feel his presence beside me determined and surely dangerous if crossed we got down by carroll square in the center of it the garden was winter bleak trees that blossomed in spring showing bare branches to the steel gray sky and the earth of flower beds looking like the burrows of fat invisible animals i began to walk along the street looking up at the houses as we passed i could see number now across from the southern gate into the square it was a handsome house white with black shutters and there were two small evergreens in pots on either side of the black door i looked across to the other side of the square number was almost a mirror image of the house directly opposite across the garden in place of the ornamental pots there were decorative mock wroughtiron balconies at the firstfloor windows and railings at the shallow steps to the door i didnt draw attention to either house but watched peregrine as he gazed from one to the next let any flicker of memory be his and not a reflection of my knowledge but i thought perhaps this was where the murder had occurred and wondered what might be stirring in peregrines mind peregrine looked about him with a frown on his face the trees in the square are different it was probably early autumn when the trees were in leaf yes of course there was no one about at the moment and we had the street to ourselves we strolled around the square as he sought to find something familiar i dont think this is the right place he murmured to himself and then as we went around for a second time he said i should be in an upstairs bedroom looking out at this level nothing is the same i dont think we would be welcomed no we had come back to number peregrine stopped to gaze up at the chimney pots of the house across the square a constable strolled into carroll square and came toward us i could feel the tension that gripped peregrine graham at the sight of him did he have that pistol with him my throat was suddenly dry peregrine said under his breath if you do anything to attract that policemans attention ill kill him there was no emotion in his voice i believed him we walked on two people enjoying a companionable silence i could feel the smile plastered on my face begin to crack from the strain of keeping it in place but the constable looked at us anyway i realized that i was a respectably dressed young woman while the man at my side was wearing a suit that didnt fit him and his face was still pale with dark circles under his eyes oh my god does he look like a convictor someone just escaped from an asylum or will he pass for a wounded soldier in civilian clothes hes outgrown the constable walked on in spite of the second glance hed given peregrine i started to breathe again if were to promenade around london like this you must have decent clothes i said my voice angrier than id intended but i could see again in my minds eye how that constable had stared and if hed stopped us it didnt bear thinking of peregrine turned to me amusement in his eyes you dont care for the good doctors taste in clothes i retorted if you attract attention to yourself because you dont appear to belong in a neighborhood like this one it wont be my fault he looked down at his clothing i dont believe hed given a single thought to his appearance except for the beard i have told you i have no money theres nothing to be done about it can we go into the square it has benches i need to sit down only the residents have a key to the gates ah he did look exhausted all right i want he stopped the sun had come out from behind a cloud and suddenly the windows on the far side of the square were lit as if from within by the golden light look his exhaustion vanished in his excitement i remember now that chimney pot the one on the left sidesee theres a missing tile and when the sunlight hits it just so the shadow resembles a small dog i couldnt see it but he crossed to the square the better to see number and stare up at its windows as if expecting to find himself at fourteen gazing down then he positioned himself on the walk and turned toward the house opposite theyve painted the door a dark green but it was black once as were the shutters but by god this is the right street there must be others just like this one no id stake my life on this across the square the constable stopped to speak to a housemaid just coming up from the tradesmens entrance then he turned our way and began to stroll back toward us as if he hadnt a care in the world come away peregrine please weve loitered here long enough please before that constable catches us up peregrine seemed not to hear me his mind on something else then he turned took my arm and we walked on toward the corner i wanted to hurry to look back over my shoulder but i dared not draw attention to us again at the corner we turned away from carroll square and i felt my heart begin to beat normally again peregrines grip on my arm tightened until his fingers felt like they were bruising the skin how did you know he asked who told you where to find that house again surprised by the unexpected attack i said it was mrs clayton i dont remember anyone of that name youre lying no truly im not did you live here before is that it is that why you came to visit the grahams i asked you if you were arthurs wife you told me he was dead why were you in owlhurst peregrine mr graham i was the nursing sister with arthur when he died onboard britannic i came to visit mrs graham toto talk to her about the day arthur died he had asked me to it was his dying wish he wouldnt have asked you to come to owlhurst unless there was more to your relationship than nurse and patient you arent required to judge any relationship of mine i retorted coldly im helping you because you are here you are armed and i have no choice you saved my life he said sardonically and your letter gave me a place to hide in london and you must have been asking questions about me or you wouldnt have known about a house my family lived in for only a few weeks nearly fourteen years ago i could feel myself turning red and not from the cold wind i admit to some curiosity arthur graham told me he had three brothers but he said almost nothing about them when i arrived in owlhurst there were only two and no one told me anything about you when you were being carried to owlhurst and id volunteered to attend you your mother explained in the briefest terms what i was getting myself into i should have trusted my instincts and let you die he chuckled it was the oddest sound coming from a confessed murderer i hadnt expected a sense of humor and looked up at him startled some curiosity indeed he repeated mimicking me we were standing on radcliffe street waiting to hail a cab i felt a touch on my shoulder miss i turned alarmed and found myself facetoface with the constable wed seen in carroll square constable it was all i could manage peregrines fingers were still digging into my arm their iron grip biting through the cloth of my coat and my sweater is this man annoying you miss my eyes moved to peregrines face he had turned toward the constable and was waiting for me to answer his name is william i said in a voice i knew wasnt my own but prayed the constable would think i was shrill as a rule he worked for my family before the war he wanted to see where hishis brother had been in service before volunteering for the army hes not in the army himself the constable asked im home on leave peregrine answered pneumonia not as glorious as dying is it the constable nodded you oughtnt be out of uniform he admonished peregrine its just for today he indicated his cuffs and the shortness of his trousers ive outgrown them my mum says id added an inch since ive been in the army the constable smiled good luck to you son he touched his cap to me and walked on before i could fall down in relief i caught the eye of a cabbie coming toward us and hailed him i see what you mean about the clothing peregrine said after id given the man the address of mrs hennesseys house will you buy me a new suit of clothes for your sake and the sake of the police i have no money i cant pay you back there was the shop where my father bought his clothes and had his uniforms tailored i leaned forward and told the cabbie that id changed my mind and wished to go to oxford street he nodded and we turned toward piccadilly peregrine sat back and closed his eyes his face was gray with fatigue i sat there counting the lies id told to the police id be an accomplished liar before peregrine graham and i were done i leaned a little forward where was the pistol in his coat pocket if he was being measured for a new suit of clothes hed have to remove that heavy coat when we arrived at gladwynn and sons i was grateful to find that young mr gladwynn who knew my father very well and who must be nearing eighty years of age was not in the shop that morning the clerk who greeted me a mr stanley informed me that mr gladwynn would regret not having seen me and would surely wish to know how my father fared very well i said hes in somerset at the moment meanwhile i have brought a friend who finds hes outgrown his prewar clothes this is mrphilips and hes in need of something to finish out his leave weve a backlog of uniforms on order mr stanley informed me and my spirits plummeted but he went on eyeing peregrine like an undertaker eyeing his next customer i think we just might have something to fit his size i sat down in the chair before the tier of mirrors and mr stanley went off to find whatever he had in mind he was a thin man with thinning hair and close to sixty i wondered what tale would get back to my father peregrine stood there ill at ease it occurred to me that peregrine had never come to london to have his clothes fitted hed either been shut away at home or shut away in the asylum everything he needed ordered for him i felt a wave of pity for the child if not for the man such shops as this one have an air of their own the smell of wool blended with the beeswax polish that gave a rich luster to the wood of counters and a wall of drawers containing everything from collars to buttonhooks to handkerchiefs the bolts of cloth on the other side were mostly khaki now or in the colors of various dress uniforms from scarlet to naval blue someone had just been fitted with the dress uniform of a highland regiment and there were trays of buttons and braid ready to go back into their respective shelves the tweeds and woolens from before the war were sadly missing and there were only a few civilian hats to choose from the rest being military caps of various ranks and services they were lined up above the bolts of cloth with the precision of old mr gladwynn who was legendary mr stanley came back wringing his hands in apology i fear theres nothing in civilian clothes to match the gentlemans height he said but i have uniforms that might fit alas they were ordered by someone who died on the somme what regiment is the gentleman the gentleman i informed mr stanley was in my fathers old regiment and held the rank of lieutenant half an hour later peregrine and i walked out into oxford street again mr philips had been transformed into lieutenant philips and i wondered if i would be shot at the tower for making it possible for him to impersonate an officer but the streets were filled with officers and men and as long as peregrine remembered when to salute and when not we had a good chance of getting by with this charade and a young lady in the company of an officer would attract no attention at all such couples were everywhere i found us a cab as quickly as possible and wondered how i would smuggle my officer past mrs hennessey chapter twelve i neednt have worried she was out and the flat was still blessedly empty of my flatmates while i removed my hat and coat peregrine sat down in the nearest chair and leaned his head against the cushion it had been a long morning for him and i hoped he would sleep the sleep of the ill i hadnt had an opportunity to search his coat pockets while he was being measured he had carefully hung the coat in full view his stolen clothing had been neatly boxed up by mr stanley i could tell from the mans expression that he thought it should be put out of sight as quickly as possible the good doctor had an unknown tailor i made tea and sliced bread for sandwiches but tired as he was peregrine graham slept with one eye open the box was under his feet and when i touched it with my foot he was alert on the instant sorry i said moving a small table closer to his chair i brought a tray with his food on it and sat across the room from him as he ate i asked did seeing the house again rouse any memories he shook his head its going to be a hopeless task peregrine what will you do then i still have the pistol he said and i shivered please not here i said before i could stop myself he stared at me then shrugged one place is as good as another do you remember the name of the dead girl it might help if we could find her family i said into the empty silence lily she told us she was named for lillie langtry i was laughed at because i didnt know who she was peregrine looked across at me surprise in his gaze i couldnt have told you that yesterday i couldnt remember her name id blotted it out somehow and her last name how many hundreds of girls had been named after the jersey lily once the mistress of edward vii when he was prince of wales and so famous for her beauty that even her lackluster acting skills brought her fame and fortune but it was no use peregrine couldnt bring it back hed said something about powders theyd given him when he was first put in the asylum surely they hadnt kept him drugged all these years but then there were the powders he hadnt taken but had used to keep the doctor quiet while he escaped we ate our sandwiches in silence clearing away afterward i said youve found the house or so you believe what are we to do now i have no idea he put his head back against the cushion again ive got to get some rest remember what i told you betray me and others will pay the price for it he lifted his shod foot and placed it on the box with the doctors clothing ive got nothing to lose if i could find a telephone and call my father he could alert the policebut even as the thought formed i knew i wasnt about to do it id survived so far and i was beginning to think that if i waited peregrine graham out he might return to the asylum of his own accord where else was there for him to go he was watching my face as the thoughts passed through my mind i found it difficult to judge him his brain appeared to be clever able to connect events and reason his way through a problem i couldnt put my finger yet on what it was that was wrong with him what his tutor had seen what mrs graham might have used as an excuse to keep him segregated from his half brothers what was the christian name of your tutor i asked just as peregrine was drifting into sleep appleby was a fairly common name surely rousing himself he said his name was nathan appleby how would i go about finding someone who had been a tutor fourteen years ago and might be anywhere now including in his grave i sat there thinking as peregrine slept i had no idea where else to turn for information peregrine graham needed for that matter i had no idea whether he would be satisfied if he learned what hed claimed he wanted so badly to discover and then i remembered the journals that rector montgomerys predecessor had kept but how to get to them and what excuse could i use to go back to owlhurst it would surely arouse suspicion well then who could i send mrs hennessey wasnt up to traveling that far in midwinter could i ask dr philips to bring the journals to me in tonbridge i was going around and around in my head trying to see my way through the problem when the door opened and diana james who was another of my flatmates came in with a smile and a cry of welcome bess how good to see you and how is the arm before she could reach me to embrace me peregrine was on his feet his eyes wild and his hands clenched i leapt into the breach taking peregrines arm as i said he couldnt find a room anywhere i had to smuggle him past mrs hennessey you wont give him away will you diana looked from peregrines face to mine hes wounded diana with my free hand i touched my forehead and after a moment she relaxed as long as he isnt sleeping in my bed she said hallo lieutenant philips peregrine answered lieutenant philips sorry i was asleep when you came in his hands were trembling but he stepped back and sat down in his chair again as if his legs were unable to support him diana brought in her valise and said i hope theres something to eat im starving the train was so crowded coming up from dover i could hardly breathe yes theres food how long are you here diana four days worst luck ralph isnt here hes been sent back id hoped wed overlap for a day or two i made her a sandwich as she sat down across from peregrine ralph is my brother she was saying where were you wounded lieutenant the somme he said it was the battle mr stanley had mentioned i dont remember much about it im afraid not surprised head injuries are the very devil she went on unwinding as she described working at the dressing station along the ypres line frostbite trench foot from all the rains dysentery fevers rat bites lice even a case of measles and thats not counting the wounded she rattled on a pretty girl with tired blue eyes and blond hair that she had refused to cut even when ordered to do so it was pulled tight into a bun at the back of her neck but anyone could see how lovely it was shed maintained that the men she treated liked looking at it i didnt doubt it peregrine was pale with exhaustion but he kept up his end of the conversation as best he could falling back on his head injury when pressed about something he had no way of knowing diana ate her sandwich with zest and asked me about britannic and i told her briefly what it had been like then she handed me her empty plate and her teacup saying would you mind if i left you to wash up im going to fall flat on my face if i dont get a few hours of sleep i sent her off to her bedroom then said in a low voice to peregrine she wont be difficult and she wont be here very long and she might be able to help us why should she because she owes me a favor will you be willing to go back to kent will you risk it he watched my face as if trying to see beneath skin and bone into my brain i dont trust you i cant trust you the sooner youre satisfied the sooner im rid of you i said i protected you when you were ill but i cant condone your escape from the asylumyou arent trying to make amends for what you did you arent even trying to start life anew you want to relive it i dont want to relive it he said his voice tense i want to understand it im going back to kent there are some things i must do information i must find will you stay here with diana and not harm her shell do your marketing and shell be my hostage if i betray you i cant sit here waiting ill go with you if you do and youre recognized ill chance it he told me grimly and so that evening we set out for kent again when we reached tonbridge i found a hotel on a side street bespoke two rooms and asked if there was anyone who could take me to owlhurst in the morning they found a man who was willing and after breakfast i left peregrine cooling his heels in his room while i set out wondering what i was going to say to anyone i watched the villages come and go in silence for i hadnt slept well worried about peregrine taking it in his head to walk away he was two people the sick man i had watched over day and night for nearly a week and a man obsessed with a bloody moment in his childhood i tried to shut out peregrine but he was there a dark figure in the back of my mind i turned to the middleaged man driving me his name was owens do you know owlhurst oh yes my aunt may lived there for a time he said i visited her often enough boy and man oh dear mind your tongue i warned myself did you know an inspector gadd it was the first name that came to me other than the grahams and dr philips after all the man had been dead for some time it should be safe enough to claim acquaintance there to my surprise mr owens replied he lived next house but one to my aunt taught me how to ride my first bicycle shame about his dying so young a good man yes er do you know if his widow is still living in owlhurst she went to stay with her brother in rye she couldnt bear that house afterward rye i said hastily will you take me to rye instead he turned to look at me you said owlhurst yes but that was before i knew mrs gadd now lived in rye will you take me there and bring me back again we settled on a new price for his trouble and were soon on our way south to the small town that had once been a cinque port one of the five major harbors during the great days of the wool trade it was a journey of several hours by motorcar but i soon found myself at the foot of a high bluff on which sat a gray stone church we looked for the local police station and i went in to ask the desk sergeant if by chance he knew where i could find a mrs gadd oh yes he said he knew her well go up to the church miss and turn to your right at the corner of the churchyard turn left and at the next corner turn right again youll have a lovely view of the water from there her house is on the left the small one with black trim and an anchor for door knocker i thanked him went back to the patient mr owens and passed the directions on to him we climbed the hill went around the large gray stone church and found ourselves on a street that seemed to be eager to run straight down into the sea from the heights we had a wonderful view of gray water rough with the turning of the tide i located the house easily and told mr owens to find himself tea and something to eat while i went inside knock at the door before i go he suggested she might not be to home good thinking if i was as brilliant in questioning mrs gadd we might actually accomplish something i told myself ruefully using the anchor i tapped briskly after a moment someone came to the door she was not young perhaps in her middle fifties but her hair was still fair and her face unlined shed been a pretty woman in her youth and that hadnt faded with time before i could speak she peered over her spectacles at the man in the motorcar is that you terrence owens she asked yes mrs gadd it is how are you faring i havent seen you in a good many years well enough harry died you know your brother thats sad news my aunt is gone as well oh my dear im sorry to hear it wont you come in i think this young woman would prefer to speak to you privately but ill step in when i come to fetch her fair enough she turned to me frowning i dont believe weve met my dear my name is elizabeth crawford ive come to speak to you about something that happened in the past while you were living in owlhurst there was the briefest hesitation she knows what im here to ask her do come in out of the cold then the wind is brisk here on the bluff indeed it was i followed her inside and after she had taken my coat and gloves we sat by the fire my fingers and toes were instantly grateful for the warmth i was a nurse on britannic i began and one of the men in my care was arthur graham you probably remember him as a child i knew him as a man a very brave one he died of his wounds and i was with him until the end i spent some time in owlhurst until a week ago a guest of the graham family in fact what ive learned about peregrine graham during my visit has been confusingcontradictory i didnt like to ask his family more than they were willing to tell me but it has become rather important to me to understand about the murder of the girl called lily mrs gadd spread her hands to the fire and at first i was sure she wouldnt answer me then she said is it just idle curiosity that brings you here no you see i carried a message from arthur graham to his brother no one told me what the message meant but i came to believe it might have something to do with peregrine and i had the strongest impression that the family chose to ignore what amounted to arthurs last wish were they right to do so ill tell you something else in confidence while i was visiting the grahams peregrine was brought to the house suffering from pneumonia i nursed him back to health he was so different from what id expectedi couldnthe seemed normal as normal as arthur or jonathan or timothy graham that troubled me what will you do with this knowledge once you have it ive come back to kent and now here to rye to settle my own conscience i have no right to pry and i respect the possibility that you have no reason to confide in me id tried to be honestjust leaving out the fact that peregrine had fled from the asylum and only i knew where he was your concern does you credit my dear a duty to the dead is a sacred matter it was an echo of what my father had said to me what is it you want to hear what do you recall about peregrine and the decision to send him to the asylum how much did your husband tell you very little at first he came home that night shocked and grieving refusing to tell me anything several months later he was reminded of that night wed just finished our tea and it was beginning to rain when mrs graham sent for my husband he was gone for hours it seems that young timothy went missing we learned afterward that hed set out on his own to find peregrine i have no idea how mrs graham explained the situation to her other children but it appeared that timothy really didnt know what had become of his half brother come to that most of us werent told in the beginning where peregrine was or why and to tell you the truth the boy was so seldom seen by that time that few of us thought twice about his absence but back to timothy graham my husband learned that timothy was very upset that day hed been sent to his room for disobeying robert douglas and some time in the late afternoon he left the house without being seen and simply vanished everyone was frantic they had no idea where he was or why hed told no one where he was going there were search parties oh yes as many men as my husband could muster mr craig rang the church bell to gather them and they were out until late into the night finally someone came from one of the outlying farmsa man named hutterto say that timothy had been found in his barn asleep in one of the horse stalls my husband asked the boy why hed run away and he said that he wanted to find peregrine and stay with him it was after he was brought in that mrs graham finally admitted to her sons where their brother was and that he would never come home how sad when henry finally walked in the door he couldnt sleep he paced for two hours he was that upset and because he couldnt put it all behind him he told me about peregrine did he tell you about how theyd gatheredyour husband mr craig lady parsons and dr hadley together with mrs grahamto decide peregrines fate and then apparently london accepted their decision did inspector gadd believe it was a just solution yes and im sure he felt it was or he wouldnt have been a party to it still i was horrified id known those boys you see most of their lives can you tell me anything about the tutor nathan appleby i didnt know him well but i was of the opinion that he didnt have the character to rule four lively boys but mrs graham appeared to be satisfied with him what do you mean the character he was rather pompous for one thing and iwell to put it bluntly i overheard the rector question mr applebys qualifications when the grahams could afford the best mr graham replied that his wifethe present mrs grahamhad selected him and there was no more to be said why would she willingly choose an incompetent tutor unless she felt he would do as she asked did he stay with the graham family after peregrine was taken away yes until the boys went off to school and then he moved to chilham to a family there did your husband tell you the name of the girl who wasmurdered how could i ever forget it lily mercer did anyone ask her family how they felt about peregrine going to the asylum rather than standing trial mrs gadd looked surprised ii dont believe they were consultednothing was saidthe london police were in agreement about the asylum even though there were no witnesses the evidence spoke for itself peregrines bloody hands and clothes his mental confusion told their own story and of course there was his youth no one wanted the boy sent to prison if treatment was available at bartons yes but no one has explained why he should have killed lily i doubt that anyone knows except perhaps peregrine himself if hes able to understand his own actions you said the evidence pointed strongly to peregrine mrs graham and her cousin had gone out to dine that evening they came home to find the other boys in bed lily wasnt waiting for them as she was supposed to be mrs graham went to lilys room and found peregrine on the floor by her body they asked him of coursethe london police lady parsons the rector my husbandeveryone he seemed dazed and all he would say to them was he wanted his knife back again the one his father had given him and of course they couldnt give it to him the police had taken it away because it was a murder weapon i swallowed hard and his brothers they hadnt seen or heard anything apparently not but we had the same laundress mrs graham and i and i heard her tell my cook that when susans mother unpacked the boys luggage the night they returned to owlhurst she found blood all along the cuff of arthurs nightshirt she pointed it out to mrs wallacethe laundressand asked if such a stain would come out arthurs are you sure of that my voice was sharp i couldnt make it behave yes im certain hed had a nosebleed he said it seems he was prone to them as a child mr owens chose that moment to knock at the door and mrs gadd went to let him in i sat by the fire cold to the bone and all i could think of was the message i had carried home for arthur tell jonathan that i lied i did it for mothers sake but it has to be set right i was silent on the long drive back to tonbridge mr owens tried once or twice to draw me into conversation but i told him i was tired the truth was i was tormented by what id learned i should have risked everything and turned peregrine over to the police the first chance i had the police could have disarmed him before hed killed anyone surely and then i would never have come to rye to hear mrs gadds account of what had transpired in london i would have gone instead to somerset my fathers daughter and been told id been very brave and very foolish at the same time and i could have forgot peregrine graham in a few months id have gone back to war and put him out of my mind instead id taken up the challenge of finding out more arthur hadnt wanted to put his last wishes into a letter hed trusted to his brother to set things right for him hed been certain that jonathan would understand his message and see that justice was done but neither jonathan nor his mother had seemed to understand itmrs graham had asked me questions about it to find out how much arthur had told you my mind retorted to see if you were aware of what ought to be set right had she let me nurse peregrine because she thought i would fail to save him a young nurse where a doctors training was needed shed turned away the doctor when he came to the door and the rector as well or had she only been afraid that in his delirium peregrine might remember more than he ought i was condemning her because of my own hurt and that was hindsight and not fair at all arthur couldnt have killed that girl not the man id known on britannic not the man everyone remembered as brave and stoic he was his mothers favorite shed said as much but then shed protect her favorite the dead sons memory with all her might wouldnt she peregrine had always been blamed why do anything now surely she couldnt have known from the start i huddled in my seat listening to the cold wind whistling by my fingers already stiff with cold my feet barely warmed by the tiny heater even the rug mr owens had handed me for my knees wasnt enough i was reminded of that dreadful ride in the dogcart from tonbridge to owlhurst when the cold knifed through my coat and the rugs no motorcar to break the wind or offer a modicum of protection the cart had nearly dumped me on the verge of the road on my broken arm when robert fell asleep and the wheels went into a ditch had that been deliberate and then hed changed his mind at the last possible second and held me on the seat my mind was running away with me but in a short time i would have to face peregrine graham and i had no idea what i was going to tell him theres no proof that arthuryouve jumped to conclusions my girl and youre paying the price of it i lectured myself id wondered why peregrine had killed i could ask the same question about arthuror any of the other graham sons why kill lily it was useless i was going around in circles for nothing what was it arthur felt must be set right what did he lie to his mother about or to put it differently since he too was only a child at the time what lie did he let his mother tell to protect the son she loved best we were pulling into the outskirts of tonbridge i roused myself to thank mr owens for taking me to rye and i counted out the money i owed him for the journey as i gave it to him in front of the hotel he said i have you to thank as well id not have visited mrs gadd else it was good to see her again and all the while i wished id never heard her name spoken this day peregrine was pacing the floor when i tapped at his door and stepped into his room when id left that morning id feared he might do something foolish perhaps walk away and never be seen again now i wished hed done just that where the hell have you been he was demanding you couldnt have been in owlhurst all this time i didnt go to owlhurst after all i went to rye instead rye what were you doing in rye do you remember the policeman who talked to you that night inspector gadd yes he was kind i think he believed i was some sort of monster but he treated me gently well ive just spent half an hour with his widow she gave me the name of the girl who died lily mercer yes thats right i dont know why i couldnt recall her last name did she like arthur more than anyone else did she seem to favor him i have no earthly idea i was in my own room most of the time i dont know how they got on i took a deep breath i was just wondering peregrine i want to go back to london tonight i want to see if i can find lily mercers family what could they know that would be helpful they werent there but they knew their daughter i expect they knew what manner of girl she was a person of your background doesnt just decide from one minute to the next to strike down a servant in his household i mean to say there must be more to the murder than we knowthan you can remember she teased timothy about his clubfoot i heard her in the passageway she asked me what was wrong with me why i was left behind when my brothers had gone to the zoo and to see the tower timothy was the youngest vulnerable would arthur defend him but you dont go round murdering someone just because shes cruel unless this was the first time timothy had been tormented in such a way and arthur no hed have spoken to robertto his mother wouldnt he have what else do you recollect he frowned i was given my meals in my room as i always was i saw the staff only in passing peregrine was your tutor attracted to lily mercer mr appleby he smiled i cant imagine him condescending to a flirtation with a servant girl mrs gadd had said that the tutor was pompous still anything was possible london was a long way from owlhurst ive changed my mind peregrine i want to go to chilham tomorrow instead of london to see if i can find your former tutor to see what he could add to the story i thought someone in owlhurst had the rectors journals yes but thinkif there had been anything in those journals that the police ought to know mr montgomery would have told me hed read them over he said as much to me who is montgomery the present rector no i think it might be more helpful to speak to mr appleby let me see if i can persuade mr owens to drive me there tomorrow this time ill go with you youll be seenrecognized hardly i doubt appleby will know me not in this uniform its been fourteen years after all he had a point we had a late tea in the hotel dining room with me on tenterhooks that someone might see in the rather attractive young officer across from me a dangerous escapee from an asylum but of course no one did peregrine complained of being shut up in his room all day and needing exercise so we went for a short walk down the quiet street afterward peregrine saw me to my door and said something you learned today disturbed you will you tell me what it is i ought to know if it has any bearing on my situation i tried to smile but it faltered it was just somethingodd thats all i opened my door and he followed me into my room shutting the door behind him i tensed he said dont look like that im not going to hurt you have i in any way no then tell me the housekeepersusans mothershowed the woman who was the familys laundress a stain shed found on the sleeve of arthurs nightshirt and asked if it could be gotten out shed found the nightshirt in the valises as she unpacked after everyone returned from london there must have been no time to do anything about itor else no one noticed it it was justshe said he was prone to nosebleeds arthur was he i dont know surely my stepmother was told about the blood or the london police would have seen it and questioned arthur they might have if hed been wearing the nightshirt when mrs graham called the police had he changed it before his mother got home stop it i ordered myself answering peregrine aloud i agreed yes of course im tired it was a long cold journey and stressful im sure he nodded and was gone i stood where i was listening to the sound of his own door opening and then closing i wondered if he believed me chapter thirteen the next morning mr owens was there with his motorcar when we came out of the hotel after breakfast he touched his hat to me then shook hands with peregrinelieutenant philips eager to hear about the war firsthand mr owens was disappointed to find that peregrines wound had affected his memory we were silent watching the rain clouds build over dover in the distance we could see canterbury cathedral as we climbed the hill to chilham and came out into the wonderful square with its elizabethan buildings the gates of the jacobean manor house marked one end of the square and the churchyard of st marys the other where to find mr appleby i decided to try the flint church first walking through the gates to the arched west door it creaked as i opened it and the interior was icy as it must have been for centuries but i had been right to come here there was a woman on her knees by the altar arranging green boughs in bronze vases at this time of year the arrangement was mostly sprays of holly its red berries bright among the greenery she turned at my footsteps and smiled hello are you looking for rector actually im looking for someone who may have lived here some years ago he was a tutor his name was appleby mr appleby yes of course he tutored the laurence boys but hes no longer teaching my spirits sank do you know where he might have gone from here oh he liked chilham so much he stayed on he married one of the johnstone girls mary the eldest go back to the square and the little lane that runs down to your right just after you leave the church gates the third house is his my spirits rose again thank you im very happy to hear that do i know you she asked your face is familiar i was here some years ago my father was returning from india and we were traveling with him my mother and i colonel crawford she stood her smile widening colonel crawford the handsomest man at the dinner party of course i remember now that was the colonel sahib in his dress uniform he was quite remarkably handsome and had the charm to match let me finish here and ill show you the appleby house myself she offered id like to hear how your parents are faring they are both quite well i answered but i have friends waiting if you dont mind of course give my regards to your parents tell them sarah cunningham was asking for them i promised and made my escape peregrine was pacing beside the motorcar a frown on his face mr owens had walked up to the white horse on the corner to wait for us i told peregrine what i had learned and together we walked down the curving lane past a lovely stone house where id had cookies and milk when we called there my mother and i the tutors house was easily picked out and i went up the short walk to lift the knocker peregrine whatever he tells us promise me you wont at that moment the door opened peregrine sucked in his breath but said nothing appleby was of medium height and thin build his long face marked by a scar on his chin his hair was graying but his short mustache was darker like his eyebrows a scholarly man at first glance but his eyes were weak and his mouth was small my father had always held a theory about small mouthsthat they indicated spitefulness mr appleby yes indeed how may i help you he looked from my face to peregrines without any sign of recognition i introduced us and then said i was one of arthur grahams nurses when he was wounded and he entrusted me with messages to his family just before he died i read that hed died of wounds what a tragedy that was he was a fine young man may i spend a few minutes talking to you about him he was surprised to me erwhat information can i give you about arthur he seemed confused i said quickly i spent a few days with the grahams as arthur had asked me to do but there were questions i felt uncomfortable bringing up youre here about peregrine graham arent you iyes why are you prying into the past im not prying mr appleby i was very close to arthur graham at the time of his death i cant help but believe he died with something on his conscience you had better come in he stepped aside and we followed him into the parlor of the house it was prettily decorated a womans touch with floral covers on the chairs and small china figurines on tables and the mantelpiece i could hear someone humming in another part of the house a small dog was curled on the hearth rug she lifted her head considered us and went back to sleep appleby offered us chairs and then said look ive put the past behind me it was a fearsome situation and i felt somehow responsible because the boys were in my charge while we were in london yet you continued to work with them for several years afterward of course continuity is what children need when their world has been turned upside down mrs graham begged me to remain there until her sons were sent to public school did you know lily mercer well that took him aback well of course not id never seen her before we arrived in london he answered indignantly she was a member of the temporary staff i understand that but you must have spoken to her in the servants hall i never took my meals with the servants i ate in my room or with my charges or in the small room off the study i recalled that someone had told me the tutor kept to himself im not trying to stir up the past mr appleby but if arthur had doubts about what happened in london im honor bound to put the matter to rest you are honor bound to do no such thing peregrine graham did a wicked thing and he was put in a place where he couldnt hurt anyone again we feared for the family if you must knowthere was no other choice but to send him away no one wanted a trial it would have been devastating for the other boys that they had a brother in prison for murder would have damaged their lives beyond measure i glanced at peregrine whose face remained impassive it was as if he accepted everything that mr appleby was saying what did lily mercers family want mr appleby opened his mouth to answer me then shut it smartly after a moment he said i have no idea were you satisfied that peregrine graham had done what he was accused of miss crawford i know you mean well but let me tell you this i only saw the body briefly but the girl was covered in blood mrs graham told me later that lily mercer had been disemboweled i also saw peregrine graham kneeling there beside her splattered with her blood what conclusion would you have drawn in my place peregrine graham flinched shutting his eyes for an instant but i understand that arthur also had blood on his nightshirt i could tell from his reaction that this was something he was unaware of but he said you cant change history miss crawford however good your intentions i think you should go now mr appleby im not trying to change history im trying to get to the truth and decide in my own mind what the message arthur charged me with really meant i have given this message to jonathan graham but i bear some responsibility in seeing that arthurs wishes are carried out thats your personal choice my dear if you cared anything for arthur graham you will put this behind you and move on with your life arthur was a fine young man and it is to his credit that he was concerned for his brother he went to the asylum one year learned that peregrine was not allowed either books or writing implements and complained to the doctors they refused to give him either pen or pencil but they brought peregrine books to read i was surprised that he even grasped what was in themhe had shown no aptitude as a child what do you mean no aptitude was hementally incapable of reading no miss crawford im surprised no one has told you that peregrine graham was unable to focus his attention on anything for more than a few minutes at a time his fathers death had been a great shock to him and by the time i arrived when he was seven he was nearly unmanageable we felt it best mrs graham and i to separate him from his brothers and try to keep him as calm as possible i made every effort to teach him but i was never sure how well he had comprehended his studies he wouldnt answer my questions he wouldnt write out an examination and he refused to accept my guidance and yet the man that peregrine had become could read did you like peregrine graham mr appleby as to that there was little likable about the child mrs graham had warned me that i would find him difficult a liar and given to throwing tantrums i was not surprised to discover that she was correct and for this reason you were able to believe that a boy who had been kept from his family forwhat seven eightyears was capable of murder miss crawford the boys father had given him a very nice pocketknife as his last birthday gift it was a mans knife peregrines grandfathersand mr graham insisted that he be allowed to keep it the boy used it incessantlyto carve any wood that came to hand whether the table at which he sat or a bit of tree branch that he found in the garden he wished to use it to carve his meat but was forbidden it was taken away but he managed to find it again and hid it but he took it to london with him and that knife was in the body when it was found yes so i was told and his only remorse was that the knife was taken from him for good no feeling for that pitiful young woman im a nurse mr appleby i cant believe that a pocketknife could do the sort ofbutcherythat you described applebys face was unfriendly im not a fool miss crawford there was of course another knife one from the kitchen that did the butchery as you called it but it was peregrines knife in lily mercers throat that mattered she couldnt have screamed if shed wanted to no one had told me such details i felt a surge of nausea but collected myself and said everyone knew that this knife was a favorite of peregrines appleby was on his feet for an instant i thought peregrine also rising was going to strike him down and then peregrine had taken my arm in a firm grip and said miss crawford youre getting nowhere i suggest we leave now i thanked mr appleby for manners insisted that i should but i was furious with him he didnt say goodbye nor did he see us to the door we were outside shutting the door behind ourselves and standing in the street before i could say anything peregrine spoke first i took that knife to london he said in a tightly controlled voice but i gave it to arthur when i got there in exchange for a promise that he would speak to his mother and ask her to allow me to go with my brothers to the tower i stared at him peregrine are you certain i hadnt remembered what happened to it i saw it in lilys throat and wanted it back i told you i dont remember much about that night it comes in bits and pieces like a puzzle but i gave that knife to arthur id swear to it on my life i could feel my heart turning over in my chest it was medically impossible and yet i felt it he was a murderer he had every reason to lie even mr appleby had told me that peregrine lied and yetand yet i looked into his eyes and knew he was telling me the truth youve had years to remember this why now i shut it all out of my mind for years when i refused to talk to the doctors and they finally decided that i was mute that shock had robbed me of my voice they left me alone if i couldnt answer their questions how could they judge my progress they tried for the first two years to bring me to a sense of my own guilt but id had that drummed into me by the london police everyone in owlhurstmy own family i was dazed when they found me i admitted to everything to make them leave me alone you dont seem to understandi could smell drying blood it was everywhere all over my hands me and i couldnt escape it but no one would let me wash my face or my hands they hired a carriage and drove me back to owlhurst still covered in blood i would have agreed to everything in the hope that they would let me go to my own room and shut the door youre saying you didnt kill her no im saying that there must be more to this than ive remembered so far something happened that night something appalling i cant think why i walked into that room and killed lily mercer but there must have been a reason he turned to look up at the church his face hidden from me i want there to be a reason i want to believe that i didnt suddenly run amok striking down the first person who got in my way what if it had been arthur or timothy thats madness of a different order dont you see it never happened before that night or since that night he turned back to me since that night my dear miss crawford i was locked in a room put into a straitjacket to be taken to the offices where my doctors examined me and given nothing sharper than a spoon i was handed a sedative as soon as id had my tea because my history of violence occurred at night i couldnt have killed again they saw to that did you ever want toto kill i spent most of my childhood alone i saw my brothers sometimes mr appleby the housekeeper my stepmother robert and that was it it never occurred to me to hurt them have you felt the urge to do violence since you left the asylum he smiled suddenly just now speaking to that fool i was afraid of him as a child he could decide whether or not id deserved my dinner or was to be denied it he could allow me to sit in the garden for an hour every afternoon while my brothers were at their lessons or leave me locked in my room it was appleby who refused to take the responsibility for me to accompany my brothers to the tower i heard him tell my stepmother that the night before he was a bully but i wasnt to know that was i he walked on and i hurried to catch him up if it had been my tutor who was found butchered i could understand it i would have reveled in it mr owens was waiting for us stamping his feet and clapping his hands together to keep warm this is a pretty town he said as we came up the lane and into the square look at those houses now if old queen bess was to walk through here this minute shed feel right at home peregrine helped me into the motorcar and then seated himself beside mr owens im sure she would i answered him my mind elsewhere the black and white buildings with their beautiful diamondshaped windowpanes reminded me of the rectory in owlhurst its the oak he went on good english oak thats kept them so fine nothing like it i say would you care for a cup of tea to warm you miss before we start back i thanked him for his kindness and told him i was warm enough all i wanted was to be back in london a place i knew where the world made sense we drove back down the hill looking across the juliberrie downs toward canterbury and wove our way through the countryside toward tonbridge we made a stop along the way at a tiny village where the pub offered tea for me and ale for mr owens peregrine took nothing his face gray with fatigue i saw mr owens glance at him once or twice concern in his eyes a rainstorm on the way delayed us but we reached tonbridge just before dusk after id settled my account with mr owens i went to my room but felt smothered there as if the walls were closing in a certain sign of fatigue and worry nevertheless i caught up my coat and went out to walk past the boys school and up to the handsome gatehouse to what was once tonbridge castle the gatehouse part of the curtain wall and a broken tower were all that was left but i walked through and into the grounds crossing to the cliff that looked down on the medway and another part of the town i hadnt been there long when someone came up behind me it was nearly dark now the dusk fading quickly in an overcast sky i turned and found myself facetoface with peregrine you should be resting i said i could say the same for you we stood in silence staring down at the lower part of the town watching a pair of ducks paddling along the quiet river are you still afraid of me he asked i wasnt in owlhurst i was in london you threatened mrs hennessey remember and then any three strangers you met on your way out the door i was more afraid of you i didnt think youd help me and i needed that help i had to trust you and i wasnt certain i could would you have shot mrs hennessey id have shot myself i think if the police came to take me away i havent had many dealings with murderers though there was one i knew in rajasthan an old man who would sometimes let me ride his camel around the market he was hanged for killing his young wifes lover i didnt know that until much later i just wondered why he never came to market again peregrine was silent for a time then he said what next i want to see those journals ive lost my nerve i dont want to go back to owlhurst i straightened and turned back the way id come peregrine fell into step beside me why not i dont want to learn any more about you about arthur about the graham family arthur didnt kill lily mercer if thats what worries you but i couldnt be sure the way he had made me learn his message by heartthe intensity behind demanding my promise the refusal to write anything downit had seemed unimportant then id been too worried to ask questions prepared to do anything to bring him peace of mind at the end the arthur i thought i knew would have confessed hed have written it and had his letter witnessed and sent it to someonelady parsons hed have stood up to everyone and cleared peregrines name wouldnt he why had he told jonathan that hed lied surely jonathan already knew about the pocketknife and what had to be set right if it wasnt clearing his brothers name neither jonathan nor his mother seemed to be disturbed by the messagethat made me wonder if arthur had tried before this to make his feelings known and found his mother dead set against changing the status quo that was a rather chilling thought that they had made up their minds to ignore any protestations on arthurs part long before id appeared on the scene and where did robert stand in all this it made sense that mrs graham and jonathan had agreed to let the matter end with arthurs death but when had she confided the truth to jonathan or had it been arthur himself look jonathanif anything happens to me no it wouldnt have been that way there was too much passion in arthurs determination to set matters right as death came to collect him he tried to clear his conscience in the only way left to him but when was jonathan told the truthand why all i could think of was that hed known from the start and said nothing it was more comfortable not to everyone looked up to arthur everyone called him a fine young man even the tutor after all peregrine had been found beside the body why look any further yet until the moment peregrine had been taken to the asylum for testing mrs graham had been distraught with fear not for what was to become of him but because somehow the truth might slip out and wreck all her careful plans i sighed peregrine a dark looming shadow beside me said what is it i was thinking that truth is a very illusive thing he was silent for a moment and then he answered me his voice muffled im not sure truth exists perhaps we only think it does but in reality its only what you believe and i believe and mr owens believesthe rest is merely compromise i couldnt sleep that night at every sound my eyes flew open and i waitedfor what my door was locked peregrine couldnt get into my room without waking half the guests on this floor and yet i was on edge unable to feel safe at one point on the brink of slipping finally into a drowsy peace i thought i heard arthur calling me it was so real my heart leapt and i was wide awake again that was the last straw it was nearly dawn by then and i got up dressed and for a time walked the dark silent streets of tonbridge at one point a constable stopped me asking if anything was the matter if i needed help i told him the truthi was too troubled to sleep he said aye my daughters husbands at the front i find her out and about at all hours but mind where you go miss theres not much to worry you here but one never can tell whats lurking in the shadows i watched the night turn into a gray dawn i watched candles flicker into life in attics where servants dressed in the cold i watched the milk cart making its rounds watched as sluggard schoolboys made their way to their lessons and then watched merchants unlock their doors and set out their goods for the day i saw the gate of the castle rise above the mists of the river and quiver there like a disembodied vision it was nearly time for breakfast when cold and courting sleep i turned back to the hotel at last i was just walking up the steps of the checquers when someone came bounding through the doors nearly bowling me over i beg your pardon madam he started to say and then broke off in astonishment beneath the officers cap above the scarf i recognized the bandaged face of jonathan graham or to be more precise i recognized the bandaging miss crawford good morning lieutenant graham i managed to say how is your family my family yes well enough whatbrings you back to tonbridge a personal matter i replied i wanted very much to ask him the same we stood there confronting each other neither willing to give the other satisfaction finally jonathan said will you be returning to owlhurst ive considered it i said slowly perhaps to call on dr philips the words lingered in the air like the morning mists going nowhere jonathan graham frowned i realized too late that it sounded as if i were pursuing the good doctor a very bold thing for a single woman to do my mother would have been appalled i could feel my face flush as it was trying to recover i said we had a professional connection in regard to ted booker and cases like his the frown deepened i took the plunge you werent called at the inquest and i cant help but wonder why you visited mr booker didnt you the night before he was found i managed to make it sound like a documented fact all right yes i did i felta fellow invalids compassion hed hardly shown compassion when hed called ted booker a coward ive wondered why you didnt speak up at the inquest it could have given all of us a clearer picture of his state of mind later in the evening i spoke to the police i told them he was asleep when i got there that id turned around and left straightaway i couldnt have said why but i didnt believe him and why had ted booker killed himself if he could sleep im sorry i said i truly believed hed turned the corner its heart wrenching to lose a patient as you lost arthur touché do you know when youll return to france i asked him they remove the bandages tomorrow he said it should have been sooner but there was concern about infection thank god their worry was misplaced another week and ill be declared fit i wish you well goodbye lieutenant graham i held out my hand and he shook it goodbye miss crawford i went upstairs and knocked on peregrines door he was dressed and shaved preparing to meet me in the dining room for breakfast jonathan is here in this same hotel i told him in a low voice it would be best if we left for london as soon as we can find a train jonathan yes hes here to see his doctors they expect to remove his bandages tomorrow that means hell be in and out and were likely to run into him i didnt know hed been wounded across the face its going to leave a terrible scar id have liked to join the army be glad you were spared i said shortly ill go and see about tickets but it might be best if you stayed here in your room until were ready to leave jonathan wont recognize me not after all these years i wouldnt wager your freedom on it no he closed his door and i went to the station found that there were tickets for the morning train and before tonbridge was stirring we were on our way back to london once on the train i drew a sigh of relief it wouldnt have done for jonathan graham to find me with peregrine it was dawning on me that the cost of helping this man could well be my reputation was there a law forbidding aiding a desperate fugitive from an asylum i shuddered to think as we were nearing london peregrine opened his eyes and turned to me will your friend be at the flat diana i felt a chill idont know why shes very pretty oh dear he was saying the only women ive seen for nearly fifteen years are other inmates and matrons ive noticed too how the world has left me behind the women are dressed very differently there are more men in uniform than in civilian clothesonly the very old and the very young arent in fact there are more automobiles and very different ones at that and this morning while i was waiting for you there was a flight of aeroplanes i could see from my window i feel like a stranger in my own country its daunting frightening and fascinating all in one i could imagine peregrine had managed remarkably well i was beginning to realize the tragedy of his childhood mrs graham had done a cruel thing whether out of maliciousness or out of an honest belief that he was different i couldnt tell mr appleby had aided and abetted her treatment of peregrine the fault was surely not entirely hers we were arriving in london back in the crowded anonymous world of people who had things on their minds other than spotting my companion and taking him back to his jailers how do you make up for a lost life i couldnt think of a way diana was delighted to see us demanding to borrow peregrine for an hour that evening to escort her to a dinner party he flatly refused and she was hurt saying to me later hes the most attractive male ive seen in weeks and the only whole one as well ive promised to see that he doesnt overdo next visit hell be well on his way to recovery i think you merely want to keep him for yourself i laughed little did she know but i didnt want a blossoming romance on dianas side or any temptation on peregrines after all by his own admission hed killed one young woman whether it was true or not there was a knock at the door and i went to open it thinking that elayne must be back and had forgot her key again shed find a man in her bed but knowing elayne shed be amused and not angry it was my father standing there on the threshold concern on his face i came to see you yesterday your mother was worried your friend told me that youd gone to kent back to owlhurst my mouth had dropped open at the sight of him i shut it over my shoulder diana said ah i forgot to tell you that your father was in town my father smiled i can see that you did eram i to wait on the threshold or am i allowed into your flat come in of course i said but one part of my mind was praying that peregrine hearing a male voice would stay where he was in elaynes room all my father had to see was that uniform and peregrine would be finished is mama with you the colonel sahib stepped in his frame filling the room in a way i hadnt remembered before guilty conscience a voice in my head pointed out shes at home i needed to be in london for a few hours and wanted to ask if youd decided to come home again we could travel together i said in a distracted way im thinking of staying on a few more days do you feel your social calendar might accommodate an elderly relative desirous of your company at lunch i smiled in relief if the elderly relative is my fatherof course for an instant i thought he was about to ask diana to join us but she said ive things to do to get myself ready go and leave me to see to them and then i was instantly suspicious had she and the colonel planned this between them i said let me fetch my coat and all but ran to my room i found paper and pen jotted a brief message for peregrine telling him that id be back as quickly as i could and was ushering my father out the door in short order chapter fourteen my father had his motorcar waiting with a familiar driver id grown up knowing simon brandon hed been in and out of the house so often that my mother said that she felt he must be related from lowly soldierservant to my officer father he had risen to the heights of his profession regimental sergeant major there were not many people who argued with him my father was one and i was the other simon greeted me warmly as if he hadnt seen me in many months though id had lunch with him in his cottage a few days before id left for kent he helped me into the rear seat and my father followed me simon closed the door resumed his place behind the wheel and my father asked where would you like to dine my dear your choice most of the restaurants are struggling to survive these days he gave simon instructions and we drove off the streets were crowded and the weather was fair for a change though cold in your haste my father was saying you forgot your gloves i grimaced so i had depend on the colonel sahib to notice tell me about the visit to kent it went very well i honed my nursing skills on a man with pneumoniawho livedand another with shell shock who didnt he raised his eyebrows at that and how did you find the grahams did they take your message in the spirit arthur had intended i dont think they did i said honestly i was disappointed in that perhaps they disagreed with young arthur it appeared they did bess i knew what was coming you dont look well i think kent was perhaps too much too soon how is the arm healing i can do a little more each day then if it isnt your arm thats worrying you what is oh yes i could hear myself now telling my father of all people that i was harboring an escaped lunatic in my flat and that wed had a brief journey back to kent in each others company to find out what had possessed him to do bloody murder when he was only fourteen instead i said im learning that you cant save everyone in this world i thought that my shellshocked patient was convinced that he could heal and i was wrong yes well sometimes there are miracles and sometimes there are not peregrine surviving had been a miracle and i was paying for it even now i said lets not talk about guessing wrong he said nothing more until wed reached the small restaurant not far from st pauls id been to the regents table only once and the food had been good that was before the war women had been warned that they must do their part against the hun that they must sacrifice their men their comfort their necessities and anything that brought them pleasure that included most foodstuffs god knew what even the chef at such a restaurant could do with the only cuts of meat available in wartime simon joined us as soon as hed seen to the motorcar and we enjoyed a table set in one of the windows with a view down to the street below my father ordered for me and simon made his own choices id been right the mutton was as old as the kaiser and nearly as difficult but the wine sauce was exquisite my father waited until we were nearly finished with our meal and then said to me i want to take you back to somerset with me will you come i find it hard to know what could be keeping you in london i can understand that after such a difficult time in owlhurst you might need a day or two to settle yourself your mother wants your opinion on cuffs and collars and god knows what i cant leave just at the moment i told him please dont ask me why why not bess you can talk to me simon will leave if you wish and you can tell me whats put those circles under your eyes and the strain in them im not imagining thingsand if youre fair youll understand my concern i went rapidly through all the problems facing me at the moment and chose the one least likely to worry either the colonel sahib or simon brandon i want to find someone the family of a girl who died in service nearly fifteen years ago and i dont know how to begin my fathers eyes met simons across the table and if i help you find this family youll come home with me yes no i dont know it will depend on many things does this have to do with arthur and his message arthur must have been all of eleven at the time lily died i replied evading his question i see i dont think he did but one could never be sure with my father finally he added all right simon knows people give me the name of the family and well see what he can discover i think its hopeless but i have to try the girls name was lily lily mercer and she was murdered in a house on carroll square number i want to know what became of her family simon had finished his flan ill leave the motor with you then shall i he said to my father and then to me ill bring whatever i can learn to the flat tomorrow morning will that do how are you going about this i asked more than a little alarmed he grinned one of the lads in the regiment is now a sergeant in the metropolitan police before i could ask him to be circumspect he was gonea tall slender man striding through the restaurant as if he were about to lead the regiment into battle who is lily mercer i turned quickly to face my father let me do what needs to be done and afterward ill tell you what i can i dont care to find you involved in a murder even an old one im not involved i just want to know what became of this girls family afterward whether they were satisfied that justice had been done why is it so important to you tell me that youll learn soon enough if simon speaks to the police it had to do with the graham family you told me it had nothing to do with the message you carried no i told you that arthur was only eleven at the time he smiled you are no better at lying to me now than you were at seven i dont want you taking charge and doing it all your way i want to satisfy myself in my own fashion i cant do anything about the past i cant bring back the dead but i think arthur waschanged by what happened in carroll square and perhaps hell rest a little easier at the bottom of the sea if i finish what he never could all right thats fair enough he signaled to the waiter and we left the subject of lily mercer until we reached the street as we walked to where simon had left the motorcar my father said well say nothing of this to your mother is that agreed yes oh yes and if you should find yourself in over your head in this business youll remember to call in the cavalry wont you i promise he handed me into the motorcar and as he walked around to the drivers side i thought this is my chance i could tell him about peregrine and let him see to finishing what id inadvertently begun in owlhurst but i couldnt it wasnt clever to deal with a murderer let alone a man who has spent years in an asylum it wasnt clever to hide an armed man with a history of murder in his background it wasnt at all clever to think i could do what id set out to do alone and in the dark yet if i sounded the alarm now peregrine would be returned to the asylum to live out his life there and the truth would be locked away with him if arthur had had any part in what had happened to lily mercer i wanted to know he was only eleven the little voice in my head reminded me who was i to say that a child of eleven could or couldnt kill i didnt even know if a child that age really understood the significance of killing i remember one summer morning in india when the box wallah came to tell the cook that his favorite grandson was dead the boy had been bitten by a cobra that had been called out of its hole in the roots of a tree near the river by the boys own cousin with a flute he had made for himself from a reed it was called an accident a tragic accident but other children told me later what the adults hadnt known that the cousin had been eaten up by jealousy and wanted the boy out of the way they were both nine i had told my ayah my indian nanny what id learned but she said to me it was the boys time to die dont you see if it hadnt been the cobra would never have come no matter how much the cousin had played his flute her fatalism had frightened me far more than the death of the boy it claimed that the universe i knew wasnt run by a benevolent god as id been taught but by chance a system where ones turn was dictated by forces over which one had no control my father was saying you must get this altruistic nature from your mother not me i laughed in spite of myself that indicates a choice in the matter i told him this wasnt so much choice as it was thrust in my face when i wasnt looking the colonel dropped me at my flat as i watched him drive away i wished id had the forethought to ask him to stay in london within reach and not return to somerset just yet then i turned and hurried into the flat where peregrine and diana were comfortably discussing a visit shed made to rochester shortly before the war but his eyes as i came through the door flicked to my face on the instant searching for any sign of betrayal diana went out that night to dine with friends and i made dinner for peregrine and myself what did you tell your father that i was in london to discover what had become of lily mercers family he started up sensing betrayal sit down i cant track them alone nor can you the best chance we have is to use my fathers connections you dont know the army peregrinethe regular army its as tightly knit a group as the knights templaror the masons or the catholic church if theres a way to find them my father will i had left out simon brandon dont muddy the waters too far my girl besides no military plan should be without a line of retreat but peregrine was nothing if not astute who was the man with your father the one waiting with the car i would have sworn if id been my fathers son instead of my fathers daughter as it was i was sorely tempted the windows of elaynes room looked down on the street i had forgot his batman my father retired as a colonel simon had risen to sergeant major but they served together when my father was a lowly lieutenant and the bond has lasted all these years simon drives my father he always has but he didnt drive you back here did he the temptation to swear was overwhelming now he had other business to attend to he left us while we were still in the restaurant peregrine wasnt convinced though he said nothing more but i could feel him watching me for the rest of the evening speculation in his eyes diana left the next day and i was grateful not to have to consider her in my dealings with peregrine she gave him a goodbye kiss on his cheek though a dancing dervish in her eyes and blew me one then was gone back to france leaving silence behind her i saw that peregrine was staring at the door with an unreadable expression on his face at teatime mrs hennessey brought up a folded note from your father dear she said i thanked her and read it quickly lucy mercers family had emigrated to new zealand soon after she was killed their passage had been paid for them by the graham solicitors they had traded their daughters death for a better life for themselves i turned to peregrine as he came up from elaynes room not the best of news i said and gave him the message he read it and swore a dead end he said finally but its odd isnt it that they should take the money offered them and leave england on the heels of their daughters murder desperate people she wasnt coming back and something goodfor them at any ratehad come of it i expect so but i couldnt rid myself of doubts still i had no children and i couldnt judge whether a grieving mother might well take the chance to better the lives of her remaining children while she could even at the hands of the murderers family or whether she had been willing to sacrifice one for the good of the others making the best of what life had brought her had that been the bribe had the family accepted a new life in lieu of demanding that peregrine be sent to prison the police of course had decided peregrines fate but without the mercers demanding an eye for an eye they might have been more easily persuaded to be lenient with a disturbed boy im going back to carroll square i said on my way to my room to fetch my coat and hat ill see if anyone there still remembers lily he was at the door before me his own coat over his arm as i came out of my room no peregrine yes they arent going to know me for gods sake why shouldnt i accompany you reluctantly i let him come with me we found a cab and arrived at number as a few early flakes of snow began to fall an elderly maid answered our knock and i asked her if there was anyone still employed in this house who remembered a maid here some fourteen years ago by the name of lily mercer she stared at me for a moment and said you must ask mrs talbot miss and so it was that we were admitted to the presence of mrs talbot a formidably fat woman in her later years swathed in shawls and seated like a toad in the largest chair in a very fashionable drawing room her trim feet rested on a stool she had an eye for peregrine and asked him where hed been wounded on the somme he said but didnt elaborate she nodded indeed i lost a son at mons and another at ypres i didnt want to live myself at first but its not in my nature to die which of my many committees and sponsorships brings you to my door tonight im afraid its none of them mrs talbot were trying to find anyone who might have known a young woman by the name of lily mercer she worked here in this house as an upstairs maid for a time some fourteen years ago and why do you wish to find this young person mrs talbot asked her eyes narrowing is it in her interest or yours this search mine i admitted i never knew lily mercer but her family moved to new zealand and so im unable to contact them i was hoping one of your present staff might remember her lieutenant philips is as interested as i am to learn more about the girl one of his friends was accused of harming her you see and id like to know if it is true or if he was falsely accused we had discussed in the cab coming here what to admit to and what not mrs talbot considered us a moment then picked up the silver bell at her elbow the maid who had admitted us answered the summons mrs talbot sent the maid belowstairs to question the staff mrs talbot meanwhile turned her attention to me you are doing nothing to help with the war miss crawford i could see myself leaving here as part of any number of committees or dispatched to hampshire to grow vegetables on the lawns of some great estate i was serving on britannic mrs talbot when she went down and my arm was broken when she was struck i cant return to duty until its fully healed she nodded approvingly at that moment there was a tap at the door and the maid was back theres the laundress mrs talbot she remembers the young person in question then bring her here if youll forgive me she might be more comfortable speaking to us in the servants hall i suggested quickly but mrs talbot wouldnt hear of it nonsense bring her here mattie and in due course mattie returned with the laundress she might have been young and pretty fourteen years ago but hard work had toughened her skin and reddened her hands and taken away her youth her name mattie informed us was daisy hallo daisy i said its kind of you to speak to us were concerned about lily mercer did you know her shes dead daisy answered bluntly she was clearly ill at ease yes i know that but as her family has left england im hoping to find someone who can tell me a little about her we was employed here when this house was let to visitors to london that was when mr horner owned it and didnt want to live here anymore he said it was haunted by his wifes ghost which is absurd o course but he believed it and so we stayed on as staff those that chose to stay and went with the house so to speak when mr horner died of his grief the house was sold to mrs talbots brother and then she inherited it from him what happened to the rest of the staff some stayed others gave in their notice tell me about lily theres nothing to tell she died here her eyes slid toward mrs talbots face and soon after her family went away like you said i tried another approach but daisy remained tightlipped i was surprised that shed even admitted she knew lily i thought it likely that curiosity had got the better of her and she was here to satisfy it or see if there was anything in it for herself speak up daisy the lady and the gentleman want to hear what you have to say but daisy stuck to her story and that was that we thanked mrs talbot after she was dismissed and mattie came to see us to the door damn peregrine said as it shut behind us the snow was a little thicker but not intending to last i thought the temperature had eased up a very little we were about to walk toward the corner in search of a cab when the tradesmans door opened and closed quietly and there was daisy a shawl thrown over her head coming quickly toward us miss i stopped my hand on peregrines arm daisy yes miss im sorry but we were all sworn to secrecy when lily died mr horner didnt want the story getting about scaring off people wanting to let the house for the season i couldnt tell mrs talbot could i no of course not i looked around searching for somewhere we could stand and talk without freezing to death but there was no place except the square and we didnt have a key did you like lily i asked trying to learn as much as possible while daisy was in the mood to talk to us but she hesitated and i said theres five pounds for you as a reward for helping us her eyes lit with avarice thank you miss i could use the money i took a fivepound note from my purse but held on to it daisy said her words coming quickly she didnt just die here did she she was murdered the staff had the evening off except for lily who was set to looking after the little boys but she was to meet the young man she was walking out with and she wasnt happy about missing him still she went upstairs to see the lads to bed it was the last time i saw her she hadnt come back down again by the time i was leaving later we heard that one of the lads had killed her that hed used his pocketknife on her mutilating her something fierce but i dont see how that can be do you a pocketknife he must have come down to the kitchen for something larger at any rate the family left london suddenlike and mr horner paid off any of us that wanted to leave but swore us all to secrecy bad for business he said thats what murder was she finished eyeing the fivepound note what was lily like she was always out for herself always looking to better herself shed study the photographs in the london gazette and carry herself like them head up back straight and copy their style of clothes for her day off silk purse out o a sows ear thats what it was and her telling me that my hands were too big and my fingers too thick and how was i to help that i ask you when i was the laundress her grievance might have been old but it was fresh she had a temper too was lily good to the children in her care daisy shrugged i cant say but i remember one of the lads leaned over the upstairs railing one day and called her a nasty name and she told him he was a monster and god would see to him one day i could feel peregrine stirring beside me which one do you remember lord if i know she said i was never abovestairs we come home at eleven that night as we was told to do to be ready for church service the next morning and there was police everywhere and mrs graham crying as if shed never stop and mr graham was pacing his face black as satan and i dont know where the lads were but i heard theyd been clapped up in their rooms i came to the servants door to bring hot water to the housekeeper and i could hear mrs graham begging them not to take her son from her mr grahamperegrines fatherwas long dead by that time it must have been robert who was pacing do you remember anything else i asked they said someone had cleaned away most of the blood before the police got there that was strange wasnt it but mrs graham claimed she couldnt have the poor girl seen like that it was indecent and horrid all i know is there was three sheets missing the next time i counted the wash and i got the blame for ruining them and hiding it did you go to the services for lily did you see her family there how did they take their daughters death there wasnt no one but her mother her sister and her brother there was no church service that i heard of and i asked she was stamping her feet against the cold now and casting anxious glances at the door behind her as if half afraid someone would see her talking with us it was the talk of the servants hall everyone felt she didnt deserve to be abandoned like she was by her own family i heard they went out to new zealand before she was hardly cold if it had been my daughter now id have had her ashes and taken her with me perhaps they did i said part of the agreement with the graham solicitor to remove all traces of the girl even a gravestone i couldnt imagine such thoroughness to protect peregrine already in the asylum it would make more sense if the murderer had been arthur i gave the woman the fivepound note and she bobbed her head thanking me and quietly opened the door with a glance into the passage behind her she said i said i didnt know one boy from the other and its true but the one that killed her he was the apple of his mothers eye it like to have killed her too waiting for a cab daisys voice echoed in my ears he was the apple of his mothers eye even under great stress i couldnt envision mrs graham referring to her stepson in that fashion but she had called arthur her favorite stop now i told myself arthurs dead and what good will it do to bring down his reputation now he cant be punished and if theres judgment beyond the grave hes long since been judged but what about the man beside me he would never have his freedom or his reputation restored jonathan i could accept as a murderer wasnt that odd his callousness was only too evident and for all i knew about murderers that must count as one of the indications that a man could kill but he was a soldier now and bitter and disillusioned he might have been very different before the war peregrine spoke startling me i was never the apple of her eye what was she to tell the police then that she welcomed her stepson as a murderer my voice was harsher than i had expected he looked down at me you dont want it to be anyone else you told me you didnt doubt that youd killed that poor girl so i did i still dont doubt it but it would be comforting in the dark of the night to think that someone believed in me i felt the blow of that comment almost physically im sorry but you arent are you youre afraid that it might have been arthur and you were half in love with my brother werent you no but i was fond enough of him to want to believe he couldnt have killed anyone even as i spoke the words i was ashamed he reached into the pocket of his coat and brought out something that caught the light from the nearest streetlamp it was the pistol it had been there all along and i had almost stopped believing in it it wasnt jonathans i lied to you there it was in the pocket of the good doctors coat i think he was afraid of us his patients and so he went armed in case but thats disgusting a doctor would never you havent spent a great deal of time in a madhouse have you bartons asylum has a locked ward where the most dangerous patients are kept i was there in the beginning until dr sinclair ordered me to be moved to another floor where i was kept in a locked room by myself do you have any idea what it was like for a fourteenyearold boy to be at the mercy of what must surely have been the most depraved men i fought one off one night screaming for help and help never came thats when i gave up all hope if that was true i thought then peregrine graham had been lucky to come out of that place sane he was holding out the weapon to me take it i was going to use it on myself if they tried to return me to bartons i dont want it put it away peregrine before someone sees it i could tell he was smiling a flash of white teeth under the shadow of his cap but not in amusement the pistol disappeared yes of course i might still need to shoot mrs hennessey there was such bitterness in his voice that i said im not about to carry a weapon in my pocketbesides the pocket isnt big enough when we are back at the flat what are we to do now will you call your father or the police no this isnt finished im going back to owlhurst and im going to see the rectors journals not alone im going with you what have i to lose chapter fifteen getting there was easier said than done once more we hired mr owens and his motorcar to drive us from tonbridge to owlhurst as we passed bartons asylum i could see peregrines shoulders tense he was in the seat beside mr owens and it was another five miles before he relaxed again i directed mr owens to the hotel in owlhurst a part of the little village i hadnt seen before the rose and thorn was a small georgian hotel with a handsome reception and lounge where two or three other travelers were enjoying their tea no one took note of the young soldier with me and we were given two rooms overlooking the street my intention was to visit the rector and ask him to let me borrow the journals to read in my room which i could then share with peregrine and so i walked down the high street toward the church my mind on what to say to him to explain this sudden reappearance and the first person i encountered was the doctor dr philips stopped in his tracks am i dreaming he asked with a smile i never expected to see you again we used you terribly didnt we i was only doing my duty i said lightly how is sally booker her mother took her to visit a cousin in oxford probably for the best what brings you back again the grahams ive come on my own account actually did you hear about peregrine grahams escape my god yes the village was in turmoil the general thinking was he would come here to wreak havoc on his family jonathan was as grim as id ever seen him and owlhurst was combed by the police it was thought peregrine might try to live in the wood where the owls are that proved to be a false lead a watch was kept on the house and then word came that hed gone to dover they lost track of him there one young soldier went missing and it was thought that hed been killed for his uniform and that peregrine had reached france posing as the missing man but then that soldier turned upapparently hed had second thoughts at the last minute and gone to canterbury to wed his sweetheart there before embarking later a body washed ashore rather decomposed but jonathan went to identify it anyway he couldnt be sure it was peregrine or so i was told but the hunt was called off the police had other matters demanding their attention and the feeling was the poor man couldnt have survived very long in this weather out in the open in his shoes i wouldnt have gone back to the asylum once out of it and the sea is merciful thats a very compassionate opinion is it thats the way ted booker chose did they actually declare peregrine dead i asked thinking what that might mean to the living peregrine with reservations until new information comes along oh you said peregrine brought you here for an instant i was so stunned i couldnt speak then i realized that dr philips had drawn conclusions from the direction the conversation had taken actually i wanted to ask the rector a question nothing to do with the grahams at least not directlyit wasnt a complete fabrication i promise i wont drag you to my surgery every other day at least not this visit weve got a new nurse an older woman who seems to be steady as a rock and thank god for that he had turned to walk with me toward the rectory and after a moment he said speaking of reservations i must admit ive got my own about ted bookers death ive kept that to myself id appreciate it if you did the same i stopped in the middle of the street right in front of a woman pushing twins in a pram reservations thats a strong word look come and have tea with me will you theres no one i can speak to here without stirring up the devil of a fuss and i cant afford to do that but youll leave owlhurst and carry my secrets safely away with you the last he said with a quirk of an eyebrow and laughed back to war you mean we went into the little tea shop within sight of the hotel and ordered tea and small sandwiches ive not had my breakfast dr philips said ruefully another lyingin i can almost count on a baby arriving nine months after the soldier husband came home on leave and this one was an eight months wonder still it had his fathers nose according to the fond grandmother and who am i to tell the world otherwise when the tea had come and we were alone in the corner of the shop watching the cold wind bowl down the street in gusts that had men clamping a hand on their hats and womens skirts blowing about their ankles dr philips began in a low voice do you remember the smudged footprint i saw in the passage the morning i found ted booker dead yes i do ive given a great deal of thought to that footprint and it worries me i told him about the conversation id had with jonathan but he shrugged it off all the more reason if booker was asleep to wonder about this print i have come to the conclusion that mrs denton sallys mother must have come to see him and she distressed him to the point that he finished the botched job oh dear god i remembered my conversation with mrs denton and i thought she might well have come and undone all the good id felt id accomplished or had i simply been congratulating myself over my skills and not seen the fact that ted booker was trying to put my mind at ease not the other way around i cant believei mean thats tantamount to murder i whispered dr philips looked around then said softly i doubt she knew what the outcome could have been but shed watched him for weeksshed seen how fragile his state of mind wasshe did know she told me that both her daughter and her grandson would be better off if ted had blown his head off with that shotgun yes but what am i to do about this dr philips asked leaning back in his chair lines of worry etching his face in the pale light from the windows do i go to the police what if im wrong ive caused trouble for her for nothing and it wouldnt do my own reputation here any good a good many people sympathized with sally and her mother they knew booker could be violent and they forgot he was a soldier who had been wounded in spirit rather than flesh did you speak to the rector no hes notworldlyand would feel obliged to go to mrs denton and pray over the state of her soul what good would that do either of them i take your point i answered slowly and you cant go to the police i sighed and watched a small boy racing down the street spirits high as he and his dog chased a goose that had escaped from the farmers wife lumbering in their wake ted booker is dead nothing is going to bring him back again and hed probably refuse to come even if by some miracle he could be offered the chance and sally is probably better off shed never learn to cope with his moodiness even if he tried to heal are you saying i should just keep my mouth shut and try to forget this whole business no of course you cant do either but since the only proof is a footprint that was there then and now isnt theres nothing concrete to support your suspicion and you did give testimony at the inquest that ted booker was not in his right mind youd be changing that in a sense i dont see that you can accomplish anything by raising the issue in time mrs dentons conscience might get the best of her a deathbed confession i was hoping you might have a brilliant idea i could use he said ive exhausted even my own patience if mrs denton meant no harm i said then while it was foolish to visit ted so soon after his attempt at suicide she might have wanted assurances i added however glad she might be now to have him dead it will come to haunt her but dr philips was more realistic i doubt it well ive burdened you and neither of us has come up with a solution still im relieved in a way it helps to talk through ones troubles i wished i could talk through my own but i dared not tell this man that the missing peregrine graham was alive and probably standing at a window not fifty yards from where we sat he paid for our tea and he saw me as far as the rectory before returning to his surgery the rector was quite surprised to find me at his door he offered me tea but i refused as politely as i could what brings you here my dear i know a troubled spirit when i see it if i can help ive been thinking i said careful how i began about the journals your predecessor kept do you thinkwould you mind if i read them i attended peregrine graham when he was ill and now they tell me hes dead it would do no harm if i learned more about the crime that put him where he was they reported that hed stolen a pistol from the asylum the rector said and they feel he must have used it on himself how sad i asked mrs graham if perhaps she would consider a memorial of some sorta private service a marker in the churchyard whatever might suit the family but she felt that it would be rathera reminder of something the family preferred to leave as a closed subject you mean the family didnt wish to inter theerremains jonathan graham couldnt be sure you see i expect mrs graham felt that a memorial would be ratherpremature and the family of lily mercer had been paid to emigrate to new zealand i wondered suddenly if they had prospered there or if the change had made them wretched i can appreciate the graham familys feelings though i dont share in them i replied but for the sake of my own conscience id like to know why i felt that the man i treated haderpaid for his sins and deserved credit for that i see he hesitated the journals were solely for the purpose of guidance im reluctant to take a broader view of my charge to keep them private and private they should remain ill be taking up my new assignment shortly and theres no harm i could do surelyeven inadvertently after a moment he went up the stairs and i sat there looking across the churchyard to what i could see of the graham house timothy limped through the gate at the far end of the churchyard and paused for a moment at a fresh grave the earth still raw waiting for spring to give it new life and then he went back the way hed come ted bookers grave or a friend whod died in the war at this distance it was hard to tell the rector returned with several bound books in his hands and said these cover a longer period before and after the time youre interested in but short of tearing out the pages there is little i can do but to trust to your good faith it wont be misplaced i promise you after a few more minutes of conversation he gave me a small case to carry the books and i took my leave he saw me to the door and i could feel him gazing after me as i walked back the way id come peregrine must have seen me walking in his direction and as i waited to cross the high street he must have come to meet me because i found him waiting at the top of the hotel stairs his gaze going directly to the box under my arm i shook my head and he followed me in silence to my room where we pulled the tea table to the window and i opened the box the bound books were a little musty as if theyd been stored on a study shelf for years i opened the first after asking peregrine if he knew the date of the murder and of course he did it was seared in his memory forever but the volume i opened was a later date and so i tried the second in the stack it covered the right period i skimmed over comments about the births and deaths and marriages of various owlhurst inhabitants about the business of the parish and a brief record of whatever had happened on a particular date that was notable i saw that the owner of the rose and thorn had died and his son had taken over management of the hotel that the man who cleaned the stained glass in the church had fallen to his death one morning as his ladder tipped over many rectors were amateur historians more passionate than trained and their privately published works were often very readable moving on i came to the comment mrs graham departed for london this morning and i shall have my choice of the offertory hymn while she is away very kind of her i thought that last was a dry commentary rather than an expression of real gratitude i was already learning that the rector mr craig had a tendency toward tongueincheek remarks and so i was prepared to see an additional remark on the first sunday of her absence where he wrote the service went smoothly and there were several people who spoke kindly about the anthem if i were a betting man i interpreted that to mean that the people who spoke kindly would also say something to mrs graham on her return there were more entries and then a lapse of a day and when the writer took up his pen again it was with shock and disbelief the most ghastly thing has happened mrs graham returned from london bringing her sons with her and she asked me if i would keep peregrine at the rectory under lock and key while she spoke to inspector gadd and lady parsons i could see that the entire family was in great distress and i was grateful when robert douglas offered to take the other boys home and see them put to bed he came back after that was accomplished expecting to find mrs graham here but she hadnt returned i asked him what in the name of god had brought them back to kent in such a state for i had also seen the bloody clothing peregrine wore and no one had thought to bring the child a change douglas told me that he and mrs graham had returned from a dinner party to find no servants in the house they went in search of the housemaid and finally came upon her in her own quarters and peregrine was there as well striving to remove a knife from the poor girls throat it was his pocketknife a handsome large one that had belonged to his father the girl was quite dead the only conclusion considering his condition was that he must have killed the girl in some fit or other hed never been well but no one had ever expected such a turn of events and the police asked peregrine what he was about he said he wanted his knife back and that the girl wouldnt give it to him after much discussion and consideration the london police agreed that the boy should be admitted to an asylum as soon as feasible and that trying him with his limited range of understanding and emotional response would be difficult i have never seen a child so ill and shocked as he washe hardly knew where he was or why and though lady parsons had questioned him most forcefully he was in no state to answer her inspector gadd took peregrine into my study and questioned him privately but had no more success than lady parsons the doctor had come in the meantime and he was in agreement that this boy was both exhausted and in a state bordering on catatonic it was nearing morning and douglas took mrs graham and the doctor to bartons to speak with the staff there before noon douglas returned with the doctor who had prescribed a sedative for mrs graham and left her at her house to rest the two men then took the dazed lad into the carriage and i never saw him again and then in an addendum dated some weeks later on several occasions i went to the asylum to offer pastoral care to peregrine graham and i was told that the doctors had determined that it was best if he continued the regimen of care they had devised and that the chaplain at the asylum would see to the lads spiritual needs i have no such faith in mr newcome and although i spoke to mrs graham about this she told me that the london police had told her that peregrine shouldnt have visitors of any sort i left it there though i was very distressed the other graham boys have seemed to come through this nightmare with few scars but arthur was very subdued when first he came home from london some time afterward he was sent away to school and i saw him only on holidays i thumbed through some twenty ensuing pages but there was nothing more about peregrine graham i was disappointed that the rector had only been able to describe events as he was told them by the grahams but his remark about arthur cut me to the quick subdued peregrine read the sections again i dont recall much about any of this i was half sick and too dazed to take in what was happening to me had you been sedatedgiven anything to calm you i dont know i hardly remember my conversations with the police my stepmother brought me a cup of sweet tea that made me drowsy still i can recall that inspector gadd was very kind he asked me why i had done such a thing and then again what lily had done to me that made me want to harm her i could only stare at him but he didnt shout as the london police did he put his hand on my knee and told me not to worry that i would be all right but i wasnt was i i was nearly sure that peregrine had been drugged to keep him quiet on the journey to london and while he was there so he wouldnt trouble anyone but then why take him there had been the excuse of seeing a doctor but nothing had come of it i was left with the only logical answer if he was left at home alone with only the servants someone might have discovered that the public view of peregrine graham was not the real truth whatever my feelings about mrs graham this was a horrible supposition that she would have treated her stepson so cruelly but then i remembered something elsesomething peregrine had told me he had found his stepmother in bed with her cousin robert douglas i sat back in my chair my good god i whispered peregrine looked at me what is it iits nothing justlook i need to be by myself for a while do you mind id like to take these to my room and read the passage again is that all right yes of course im tired peregrine thats all i thought he saw through me but he turned and went to his room and i sat there staring out the window not seeing the traffic in and out of the shops not seeing the sun fade behind gray clouds looking inward at something rather terrible peregrine believed that jonathan or timothyor bothwere the sons of the liaison between mrs graham and her cousin robert douglas was timothys clubfoot the mark of that liaison i had no idea if a clubfoot was a result of inbreeding but it might be for all i knew it might also run in families i tried to picture each of the sons in turn that got me nowhere i hadnt been looking for indications of their ancestry when i was speaking to them facetoface but even if they werent roberts offspring mrs graham might have been so frightened that peregrine would tell his father what hed seen shed done her best to destroy his credibility and what better way to do that than by indicating he wasnt really right in the head however cruel that was it would be nothing to what she might have done years later to protect her own child and blame peregrine for a crime he hadnt committed everyone agreed she had been terribly distressed by the death of lily mercerand shed paid the girls family handsomely to leave england would she have felt so strongly about protecting peregrine or gone to such lengths to hide what had been done she had kept him out of prison not from kindness but because his brothers would have suffered the shame of being related to a murderer and i hardly thought mrs graham was the first person to send an unwanted family member to an asylum little better than a prison in some ways it could at least provoke a measure of sympathy for the family of the afflicted i thought about the young prince john who had had seizures and how hed been removed from the public eye very quietly until hed been nearly forgotten mrs graham had succeeded in doing much the same with peregrine i was still trying to understand the full impact of my thinking when there was a knock at the door it was peregrine and he held one of the rectors journals in his hand i think you ought to read this he said and walked into my room i took the book and carried it to the window reluctant to turn up the lamp peregrine followed me and pointed to an entry some years after the murder of lily mercer i read it quickly and then again inspector gadd died this morning in spite of everything the doctor could do to save him he had gone very early to one of the outlying farms to investigate a rash of small fires and other destruction that had been plaguing herbert meadowes for several weeks the inspector had hoped to catch the culprit in the act and was lying in wait for him he must have seen the culprit and given chase but as he tried to climb the stile a blood vessel in his brain burst from the effort he was making and he died where he fell meadowes found him there some hours later god be with him he was a good man i turned to peregrine i dont understand what does this have to do with your situation none except that i know jonathan boasted that hed raided herbert meadowess henhouse for eggs and not been caught he thought it was a fox he told me im as sly as a fox and arthur had said thats not brave you must give him a fair chance to catch you you must do it three times this was in london and how did jonathan answer him he didnt i think he was put out timothy taunted him too saying no it must be six times to be fair and arthur said six it is then timothy asked him when will you try when we go back to owlhurst but arthur answered him not then when im ready but thats not proof of anything boys boast striving not to be outdone even the young subalterns under my fathers command took foolish risks and accepted dares to prove they were brave more than one was given a dressingdown for imprudent conduct come to that id heard my father and simon brandon wager on the outcome of a fight between a mongoose and a cobra but no one came forward to admit to being there and no one got help for the inspector when he went down for fear of being punished for trespassing youre telling me that arthur did this no now read this he held out another diary and i saw that it was some six months after inspector gadd had died doctor hadley coming home from the bedside of daniel furston died when a startled horse ran away with his carriage overturned it and threw him out on the roadside where he broke his neck he was a good man we shall miss him god rest his soul i dont know peregrine youre leaping to conclusions accidents happen read this he had marked another passage in that same diary lady parsons had had a close call she had been out riding in the woods where the owls lived when her horse stumbled and rolled on her she broke her collarbone her right arm and her right leg in the fall and the wonder was she wasnt killed outright so ran the rectors account no peregrine youre trying to make connections that arent there indeed he retrieved the book from my hand and left the room with a final comment i lost track of events here in owlhurst these journals make for interesting reading i thought hes playing mind games he offered me that pistol knowing i wouldnt take it then or later hes trying to show me other deaths that he couldnt possibly have been responsible for he knows i suspect arthur though and that will be his salvation i returned the journals to the rector just after dusk had fallen he thanked me formally and then asked have these set your mind at rest they were very informative while i was a guest in her house i could hardly ask mrs graham to relive what must have been a very painful past and peregrine graham was too ill to tell me anything even if id asked i dont much care for mysteries i just used whatever skill i possessed to see him well again and the same for ted booker i think only he was beyond human help sadly i agreed im glad you came to see me my dear miss crawford its why i am here tell me i asked how did the man who wrote these die his eyebrows went up are you suggesting he wasnt in his right mind when he made his entries here no no i justi felt i came to know him a little through his words i was told that he had nearly worn himself out caring for his flock thats true he was in the church one morning and went up into the pulpit to find something hed left there he tripped over his own feet and went down the stairs headfirst he lived for several months afterward but hardly knew where he was or what had happened to him it was a blessing for him when he died he wouldnt have wanted to linger hed put a note with these journals years earlier that they should go to his successor for guidance a very thoughtful gesture i said an unfortunate mishap like the burst blood vessel that killed inspector gadd like the carriage overturning and killing the doctor the fall that injured lady parsons so badly have there been other incidents of this nature since the war began he pursed his lips thinking in fact no unless you count young peter mason but thats ridiculous what happened to him he was swimming in the pond on his fathers farm when he apparently got a cramp he drowned arthur was at home just before being sent to france and he and his brothers swam in that murky water looking for the body jonathan found it but it was hours too late he was a promising lad peter was and my first service for one so young i thanked him and said goodbye but i couldnt go back to the hotel straightaway there was too much on my mind peregrines doing i walked in the wood where the owls nested the trees were tall and sturdy the last of the ancient forest that had once covered this part of kent the forest that had stood at harolds back in the battle of hastings on the main track that led from the sea to london i counted inspector gadd lady parsons the doctor the rector but surely not the boy peter without him lily mercer made five six timothy had suggested and arthur agreed but that was six times taunting the farmer meadowes to give him the chance to catch the culprit not six murders or near murders if we counted lady parsons among them but to look at it another way six opportunities for the police to catch their man and peregrine locked away in his room at the asylum could only have been blamed for one of them it was dark under the trees but peaceful a little wind rustled the dry bare branches and once i thought i heard an owl glide past me after other prey they are silent owls are as they fly but theres something a disturbance in the air a sixth sense that catches ones attention sometimes it was time to turn back i was nearly out of the wood when someone stepped from the shadow of a tree trunk and confronted me i drew in a breath i was so startled and he could hear that he laughed and then my eyes adjusted to the barest glimmer of ambient light and i saw that it was timothy graham it is you he said then i thought i saw you walking toward the wood but i told myself it was impossible what brings you back to owlhurst you gave me such a fright i declared guilty conscience ill be bound that was too close to the mark for comfort i laughed more an admission than a denial i was certain ia personal matter brought me back and so i stayed the night but im leaving tomorrow he fell in step beside me i saw you coming from the rectory if i were to guess id say it was ted booker who has been on your mind id rather not discuss lieutenant booker you tried to help him i think it was unfinished business on teds account i answered sometimes when you try to save a patient and you faileven if it isnt your fault you still take it more personally than you should as you did in arthurs case surprised i answered in a way yes he sent me here with a message and i felt honor bound to bring it however it might be received i can understand that he hesitated then asked what did you make of arthur i dont mean what you told my mother but what you really felt he was a good patient we often talkedid be coming off my shift and id stop by his cot and hed tell me what hed been reading or i would tell him about some part of my day he was restless his foot hurting him like the very devil and i knew that any distraction was welcomed did he talk to you about owlhurst or his family only in the most general terms you see the wounded often live in the present because theyve been very badly frightened even if they refuse to admit it and so they hold on to the present the past is still tooi dont knowprecious did he tell you about his brothers i knew he had three and no sisters that was all not that i was lame or that jonathan has a cold streak in him that ive never fathomed and i doubt if arthur did either or that peregrine had been clapped up for murder in a hospital ward with other ears hearing every word men seldom bring up such personal things i knew jonathan was also in the armyi heard arthur telling someone that yet you came all this way i made a promise mr graham i have told you and so youd have traveled to yorkshire if a patient asked you to kent was much easier but yes id have tried he nodded yes thats honorable im angry that im not allowed to join the army i resent the bonds that soldiers share arthur and jonathan wrote often to each other but less often to me or to my mother it was as if we didnt exist because we werent there i could sympathize with what he was saying my father during his years as a commanding officer cared for his men like a stern but loving father i doubt they saw it that way especially those who felt the sharp edge of his tongue but my mother and i did we sometimes felt pangs of jealousy and my mother would say i married a regiment my dear if you are looking for singleminded love find yourself someone in civilian life a nice banker perhaps i said to timothy graham i think it isnt so much the bond between soldiers as the fear that to tell the truth to those one loves would be too painful and so letters must be brief before other things spill over ive written to wives and sweethearts and mothers putting down what im told to write and even knowing it for kind lies i add nothing of what i know there was the young welshman who assured his mother that the trenches were quite comfortable despite what she read in the newspapers and that he had clean sheets and a good pillow for his bed did jonathan tell you about peregrine no your mother did when i was asked to care for him you were there im surprised you could bear to be in the same room with him a nurse is only concerned with the health of a patient i wasnt there to judge peregrine graham only to heal him what did he tell you he was so ill i think once he asked me why i was therehe thought i must be arthurs wifeand again he asked where he was and i told him he had to fight for every breath even to tell me whether he felt like drinking more broth or if he needed another pillow to help ease the coughing and i was far too busy to worry about what he might have done years before it was such a narrow line between truth and falsehood timothy nodded i didnt want to see him none of us did he was the painful past come creeping back i wouldnt recognize him if he spoke to me on the street he must have changed beyond recognition it explains why he killed himself i wouldnt have wanted to be shut away as he was no we had reached the churchyard wall and he opened the gate for me im glad arthur had someone with him at the end it must be rather frightening to die alone i cant imagine it to tell you the truth i went through the gate and after closing it he turned toward his home then he came back to me i wont mention the fact that i saw you i can do that much for booker and his death did me no good mrs denton took sally away with her and it may be months before shes home again just as well i said she has a great deal of healing to do before she thinks about any future youre a wise woman elizabeth crawford did anyone ever tell you that i smiled but didnt answer and he was gone limping across the uneven winterdead grass in the churchyard chapter sixteen peregrine was waiting for me and i said as i reached the head of the stairs i walked in the wood for a time and timothy saw me there i came back as soon as i could he was silent we went down the passage to the door of my room and paused by common consent i hadnt told him what id learned about his disappearance and possible death i couldnt have said why except that it had erased peregrines identity and i wasnt sure it was for the best to tell him that he could take passage now to half a dozen countries that wouldnt ask too many questions he could create his own past and walk away from peregrine graham would he be as eager to learn about lily mercer if he knew all that i knew he waited i said peregrine we should go back to london weve learned all we can learn here you know how the rector died dont you yes he tripped and fell down the pulpit stairs do you remember its very high and the steps turn and narrow as they descend frowning he looked for the memory then nodded yes i do remember i had opened my door and was about to cross the threshold when he said you still think arthur may have killed lily mercer dont you ive seen your face when youre afraid the evidence points in that direction tell me how would you choose between arthur and me if it came to thatif the only way you could protect him would be to sacrifice me i said arthur is dead nothing can harm him now you are alive fair enough then ill be honest with you as well if i didnt kill lily mercer why do i dream so vividly about her death he turned and walked away going into his room without looking back i had dinner sent up to both of us for fear that someone might recognize peregrine in the dining room or ask questions about the man who accompanied me and so i ate alone and peregrine did the same we left owlhurst behind and went back to tonbridge to take the train to london we hadnt been in the flat for five minutes before mrs hennessey came puffing up the stairs i made certain peregrine was safely out of sight before opening my door theres someone to see you miss crawford i declare mr hennessey might have something to worry about if i were thirty years younger but after those stairs i daresay im thirty years older she had brought up the post as well and was fanning herself with it as she caught her breath is it my father what if peregrine and id encountered him as we arrived it was such a close call i felt weak no my dear i know your father very well its the other one hes very anxious to speak to you though he was inordinately polite when he asked if id mind going up to fetch you for him simon brandon and that would have been just as bad yes ill be there in a moment let me collect my coat she turned to descend the stairs again smiling at me over her shoulder i stepped back into the flat promised peregrine that id return in a few minutes and went down to meet the sergeant major he greeted me and held the door for me lets sit in the motorcarits warmer the hall was cold i went out and got into the motorcar wondering what was afoot as he got behind the wheel he said how are you faring with your search for lily mercer umwell i know her parents went to new zealand shortly after she died then you may not know that one peregrine graham was charged with her murder he stabbed her in the throat with his fathers pocketknife and it was agreed by all parties that he should be remanded to an asylum for the rest of his natural life indeed it was all i could think of to say indeed and said peregrine graham is now missing from said asylum and the authorities have every reason to believe he shot himself on the coast of kent somewhere south of dover winchelsea dymchurch and his body is still missing though they did find someone near his size and age something hed just said struck me she was what stabbed in the throat you say my friend at scotland yard tells me thats what the report says buti thoughti mean someone told me shed been disemboweled now thats a nasty thing to be telling a lady he said turning to look at me his dark eyes unreadable in the dimness of the motorcars interior oh dear simon was frighteningly astute had i given myself away still i had to ask are you very certain simon its important to know this as certain as the report filed at the time of death i dont know how your mrs graham managed to protect her stepson the way she did but the police were in agreement that in his present state taking him into custody would only aggravate his condition a number of other cases of a similar nature had been sent to bartons they knew the doctors there and respected their expertise the upshot of it was the boy was given into the care of his stepmother to be transported to the asylum where doctors evaluated the facts examined him and reported to the police the inquest was held the documents were placed in evidence and that was the end of the matter does the colonel sahib know any of this i asked after a moment not yet thats why i came to see you first want to tell me whats going on my heart sank simon would never accept my assurance that i was as safe with peregrine graham as i was with him i learned something when i was in owlhurst i dont know that peregrine did what hes accused of if my information is reliable its possible that his half brother let peregrine take the blame for what happened to lily mercer if thats true peregrine may have spent nearly fifteen years in an asylum for something he didnt do simon whistled my god bess you do manage to get yourself into a tangle dont tell me you found a way to spirit graham out of that asylum yourself it would be just like you i sighed he escaped the day i left owlhurst i didnt knowi thought the family had been told he was dead of pneumonia there was the death of lieutenant booker you see and i was so distressed by that who is booker simon asked suspiciously while i was in owlhurst i was asked by the local doctor to help him watch a patient suffering from severe shell shock he was threatening to kill himself you see and in fact he did i thought nursing would keep you safe how wrong i was britannic sank under you and now owlhurst involved you in murder and suicide im taking you back to somerset with me no you cant i began to say then stopped short pray why cant i ii want to do something first are you sure lily mercer was stabbedthat there was nothing else youve already asked me that he pointed out who are you really trying to protect bess arthur peregrine this man booker are you in love with any of them his voice was exasperated ted booker iswasmarried and he has a son arthur is dead and you just told me that peregrine was dead i told you the authorities believe he could be for all i know you have him hidden in your flat while you sort all of this out if it werent for mrs hennessey and her rules id march up there and see for myself i was glad i was looking away from him watching a large man walking a little dog with pretty brown ears simon would surely have read the alarm in my eyes as i scrambled to think of a response ill ask her to do my marketing and then smuggle you into the flat what a story that would make for the colonel just promise not to tell her what you find or shell never allow me to live here again god knew how much trouble id had smuggling peregrine in and out it was a miracle we hadnt been caught long before this simon laughed and i could breathe again all right bess stay in london if you must but your fathers no fool and hell soon be on your doorstep again with no allowance for your wishes ill give you twentyfour hours before i tell him what the yard told me butthats not enough time you dont have time bess your father was notified that your orders will be cut within the week youll be sailing for france in a fortnight oh damn i thanked simon and went back to the flat my mind racing peregrine was behind the door when i walked in and i could see that he was on edge that wasnt your father he told me flatly nothat was simon brandon he might as well be my father sometimes hes worse hes not old enough to be your father he wasnt i hadnt given it a thought before peregrine that doesnt matter listen to me i was taking off my coat reaching for the kettle making tea the english panacea for stressful moments somehow simon got a look at the official report on lilys murder it saysit says that there was a pocketknife in her throatbut no other wounds are listed if youdwell if youd butchered her there would have been something in the file my stepmother i know whatever she told you she didnt have the power to change the official record are you sure you rememberthat you see in your dreamssomething so horrible he stared at me i dont know he said slowly no yes i dream im touching her entrails dear god peregrine it could be that you dream about it but that it didnt happen in life the police cant be wrong he put his hands to his face covering it you cant make up a dream not like that not unless im mad as a hatter i used to wake up screaming i tell you it was that real i turned around are you alone is someone else in the dream who is there in the dream with you i hear my stepmothers voice shes speaking to me telling me i should be ashamed making me face what ive done i am nearly sick from the smell but she wont let me go shes there the kettle was beginning to boil i could hear the soft rumble of bubbles forming in the bottom she found you by the body trying to retrieve your knife from the woundis that when you see the entrails i dont remember he crossed the room to sit down heavily in the nearest chair i was pouring the hot water into the teapot now splashing a little on my hands unaware of the pain remember ted bookera little voice in my head reminded me shock can do terrible things to the mind and a fourteenyearold boy with limited experience of life might easily be made to remember something that wasnt real but how with words i couldnt quite grasp what had been done or how mrs graham could have allowed it to happen but a mother will do anything to protect her own child and destroying peregrine graham was the surest solution to the thorny problem of presenting arthur or jonathan or even timothy to the police as the murderer i cudgeled my wits but no brilliant solution offered itself handing peregrine his cup i sat down across from him with my own the hot sweet tea was reviving peregrine you asked me if id sacrifice you to save arthurs good name but the facts point to arthur as the killerhe was mrs grahams favorite he was next to you in age you were already damaged and so it was a short step to substituting you for him but i need to know why arthur would kill to protect one of his brothers but he was unconvinced i on the other hand leapt for that explanation it could happen if lily in the house alone with you and resenting that she couldnt have the evening off with the other staff taunted the four of you for being in her way he shook his head dont peregrine im being ordered back to active duty within the week time is slipping through our fingers it doesnt matter i can go somewhere else and start another life the mercers must have done that in new zealand and it would have been harder for them than for me after all these years in bartons i dont need much i could survive peregrine was already thought to be dead there were ways it could be made to happen this new life there were people in india i could send him to but it solved nothing there was lily deserted by her family however desperate theyd been to accept the offer of passage away from england if i had thought it was my duty to arthur to bring his message home what duty was still owed to lily mercer talk to me peregrine pleaseif you didnt kill her someone else did do you remember what you told me about that conversation where arthur and jonathan discussed doing something six times to give the victimor perhaps the policea fair chance to catch you ive already considered that lily the policeman gadd the doctor the rector lady parsons you cant count her she survived the boy who drowned then thats five and about as farfetched as a fairy tale add ted booker six arthur couldnt have killed booker to my knowledge jonathan was the last person to see him alive unless i was wrong and mrs denton went to the surgery jonathan unless jonathan had completed arthurs six it would have to be jonathan but he was never mrs grahams favorite he was her son all the same and she would be rabid to protect him could he kill at that age he must have been what ten a little younger perhaps if hed caught lily off guard he could have struck her with the knife just happening to find the right place to kill her or lashed out and was unlucky enough to cut an artery i hadnt liked jonathan very much but that didnt matter the truth did but what if it was not the boys what if it was mrs graham or robert if hed tried to seduce lily and shed told him shed complain to mrs graham he might have been in a panic or to twist it another way if lily had seen mrs graham and robert togetheror perhaps guessed that one of the graham children was hisshe might have been killed if she threatened blackmail what were the laws on inheritance if it could be shown that a child might not be the legal fathers son the trouble was i hadnt known lily mercer and i hadnt been able to speak to her family i was blind when it came to her nature her way of seeing life and what she wanted from it daisy had claimed she was ambitious and that fit nicely with the theory of blackmail but lily might well have been innocent of any wrongdoing i mustnt make her the villain without evidence im going back to owlhurst ill speak to lady parsons and see if she had any doubts about what happened to you if mrs graham had already received permission from the london police to take you directly to bartons why did she call in so many people after she reached owlhurst the doctorthe policethe magistratethe rector to erase any doubt in the minds of people whose opinion mattered in owlhurst or to make certain that you peregrine graham were seen with blood all over your hands and shirt so that she and not her stepson would be the object of their sympathy id rather go away now and not look back but youre a witness peregrine you cant disappear if theres to be any justice at all this time i found simon at his club and asked him to drive me back to kent peregrine was determined to go but i didnt want him taking the risk or to have to explain to simon curious simon agreed and he took me to the flat long enough to fetch my bag peregrine in elaynes room didnt come out though i was nearly certain hed call my bluff and find a way to accompany us i expect if hed had any uniform but that of my fathers old regiment he might have tried to do just that i half expected to find him gone from london by the time i got back i wasnt sure how i felt about that what if it was all taken out of my hands and i didnt have to face what arthur might have done simon was silent for most of the journey and i was grateful lost in thought as i was we found lady parsons just outside cranbrook in a very lovely old jacobean house with a pedimented porch and graceful stonework around the windows the estate was called peacocks and on the gates were two magnificent stone peacocks the hen demure and the male with raised head above the spread of that glorious tail i remembered lady parsons from the inquest but i had forgotten how formidable she was she received me in her drawing room austere in mourning black with jet beads and only a touch of white at her collar and at her cuffs a pincenez on a silver chain was pinned at her shoulder youre the young woman who worked with dr philips trying to save lieutenant booker what brings you here second thoughts about your testimony as i recall it was an impassioned plea for understanding remarkable i thought we have no room for compassion in a war such as this one a shame im afraid that its another matter that i wish to discuss lady parsons the fate of peregrine graham the door opened and a little dog trotted into the room taking his place at lady parsonss feet peregrine graham is it you do have a taste for lost causes my girl the odds are hes dead so ive been told but i happened on information that confused meid heard that the body of lily mercer had beener butchered for want of a better word we did not ask for such unpleasant details miss crawford mrs graham was nearly incoherent with shock by the time she reached owlhurst i was summoned along with inspector gadd because she was unable to continue at that hour to the asylum and attend to all the details of admitting her son inspector gadd and i decided the boy was safest at the rectory until he could be moved again and the doctor determined that he was stable enough to wait a few more hours according to the information that scotland yard has in hand lily mercer died of a single stab wound to her throat and how did you come by such information miss crawford her voice had taken on a chilly note and the dog stirred at her feet my father colonel crawford was able to discover it for me and is he aware of the use you are now making of this information heis aware of my interest in the fate of lily mercer i see i believe there might have been a miscarriage of justice lady parsons and i am seeking advice from you on how to proceed in this matter my advice if you will take it is to leave police business to the police as i did inspector gadd handled a most difficult matter with admirable skill and discretion thats all there is to say it does you credit to want to set the world to rights my dear but as peregrine is dead i see no point in investigating a tragedy that lies in the past where it belongs fifteen years is a long time witnesses die attitudes change and it is almost impossible to make a judgment on new facts when the old ones cant be reconstructed im not asking you to make a judgment id simply like to know if you were aware of a discrepancy in important details the nightmare here miss crawford was that of a child committing murder we were appalled and we did what we could to make mrs grahams hideous duty as simple as humanly possible you cannot know her state of mind at the time i witnessed it i saw the young man myself and his own state was pitiable it was i who suggested that mrs grahams cousin acting in loco parentis remove the child the next morning to bartons while the doctor treated mrs graham for exhaustion she had done more than any woman might be expected to do in such circumstances and i admired her courage in seeing the matter through but she had three other sons who were in desperate need of her care and her place was naturally with them a mans steadying hand was what peregrine graham most needed and that is what we were able to provide for him what did peregrine have to say for himself i asked very little he was quite naturally dazed by the turn of events and on that score it isnt surprising i asked him how he had come to kill and his answer was that he wanted his fathers knife returned to him he was quite upset that it had been taken away i asked him how he felt about what hed done and he said that he didnt care for the smell i asked him if hed liked the unfortunate victim and he replied that she was spiteful when no adult was present and that he had disliked her for it all very consistent according to the doctor with the boys inability to tell right from wrong he couldnt seem to grasp the severity of his actions there was no malice no cunning no viciousness there was no doubt in my mind as there was no doubt in the minds of the london authorities that prison was inappropriate and that bartons asylum was the proper choice where he could be evaluated why not a london hospital i believe that the doctor a man called hepple who was a specialist in mental derangement in children had recently removed to bartons mrs graham was very persuasive she felt that her stepson had no prior history of violence no indications of a violent nature and that it had most likely been a disagreement over a pocketknife about which he was obsessive that might have triggered this event in supervised circumstances it was likely he would never kill again i could see that i was speaking to a wall lady parsons had made up her mind that night and she was not accustomed to changing it i could also see that mrs graham had been terribly distressed but had somehow kept her wits about her as well and that would be indicative of a shocked and horrified mother who had to fight for a child she loved with every tool at her disposal nothing else mattered not even her own near collapse i thanked lady parsons for her time and prepared to take my leave she said my dear when one is young one sees dragons everywhere and one is prepared to fight them thats an admirable trait but as one ages one often sees that injustice is rare and that what had appeared to be dragons are merely the shadows the mind creates when it wishes to avoid a bitter truth i stood there for a moment then asked did you feel i was fighting dragons when i made the plea for lieutenant booker in a way i did shell shock is little understood although i believe that in young bookers case it was clear that both dr philips and you had fought hard against his dragons but the dragons won and that was neither justice nor injustice but the simple fact that in the end he didnt have the strength to endure she hadnt used the word courage but it hung in the air between us the little dog accompanied us to the door of the drawing room either ready to defend his mistress or hoping for a walk it was hard to say which brought me to another matter i hadnt intended to broach i understand you had a terrible fall from your horse some years ago lady parsons oh my dear i was frightened to death that i wouldnt walk again i dont know why the horse fellmy groom found cuts on the mares knees and he very rightly called in constable abbot but i could swear that there was nothing on the path that might have tripped up henny we had ridden through high grass before we reached the wood and she might well have encountered something there that i couldnt see i dont wear my spectacles when i ride and that was lady parsonss dragonthat no one would dare touch her or her horse she was sacrosanct simon said as i walked out to the waiting motorcar you dont appear to be happy with the outcome of your visit ive been fighting dragons or so im told simon put the motorcar into gear and drove several miles until he came to a place wide enough for us to pull to the side of the road the view across the downs was wonderful in the cold light of a winters day he said simply what can i do dear simon i thank you but it isnt a position the army can take with full cavalry charge in support of the infantry try i shook my head bess do you remember some twenty years ago there was a scandal about a steeplechase where a favorite lost to a horse with no record of winningand suddenly in this one race he was a phenomenon ahead of the field by some ten lengths and much later it was discovered that the horse who won had actually taken the place of the one legally entered in that race my father was angry when the truth came out hed had a wager on the favorite as i remember the substitution wasnt discovered for five years exactly i think this must have happened when lily mercer was found dead the wrong boy was blamed because it served everyones purpose for him to be sent to an asylum thats a rather strong accusation the police dont often get things wrong and they didnt it was a child in that house only the real killer was protected and the scapegoat was not missed by anyone simon was silent for some time and then he asked has this boythe real murdererkilled again i dont know i answered honestly circumstantial evidence says he may have im not a policeman i cant prove what i believe youre too close to the people involvedtoo close to be objective and if im sent to france in a fortnight it will all be swept under the carpet again and an innocent man will continue to be blamed for something he didnt do simon turned to look at me are you in love with this innocent man i laughed hardly the laugh faded but i see the injustice here and im helpless to change it and what about the dead girl what does she deserve even her family abandoned her in a way she wasnt the victim she was the problem to be swept under the carpet as quickly as possible you were ever taking pity on the halt and the lame and the lost i know ive seen so much death simon im glad i took up nursingive been able to do something about the war by saving the lives of wounded menbut there are things ill remember until i die and memories that come in the dark when im trying to sleep he got out to crank the motor you should have been a son bess crawford it would have made life much easier for the rest of us no it wouldnt have done any such thing youd have been following me into battle to keep me safe chapter seventeen i told peregrine that shifting lady parsonss belief in her own judgment was going to be an uphill struggle and one i dont think were likely to win he got up and began to pace i dont even know what i believe logic tells me i could have done it honesty says i probably killed her the problem comes back to what i remember and memories are difficult to refute thats probably because you were drugged to keep you out of the way and manageable while in london and it turned out to be a godsend that you were acquiescent to whatever was asked of you stopping at the window he lifted the edge of the white lace curtains that my flatmates and i had hung there idly glancing out and then his interest sharpened and he stood there watching something or someone in the street below after a moment he said come here will you i went to stand beside him reaching to pull the curtain wider so that i could see the street but he caught my hand pulled me in front of him and said no through this crack dont disturb the curtain i could feel him behind me tense as a steel rod and the hand on my shoulder was gripping it hard i dont see anything i said uneasily the street the houses opposite the carriages and motorcars and people there at the house across the way theres a man loitering there see the one with the cane the house he spoke of was closed up the children had been taken to the country for safety from the zeppelin raids staying with their grandparents for the duration of the war mrs venton was nursing burn victims at her sisters country house near winchester her husband was serving in the navy the gunnery officer on a cruiser i looked again at the man he was moderately well dressed but the cane he was carrying caught my eye thats not a cane i said intrigued well it is if you like but i recognize it my grandfather had oneits a sword stick a twist of the handle and the blade slides out your father has set someone to watch over you what have you told him nothingtruly i havent betrayed you i wouldnt besides the general view is that you must be dead just at that moment mrs hennessey came out of our house and crossed the street her market basket on her arm the man stepped out of the shelter of the venton porch and tipped his hat to her i could see then that he was older than he looked his head bald save for a ring of graying hair like a laurel wreath worn rather long he looked more like a hopeful poet than he did a menace and perhaps that was by design mrs hennessey listened to him for a moment then shook her head he asked other questions and she again told him no after that he let her go walked in the other direction from the one she tookand just as he was about to pass out of sight he turned and came back again to the porch across from us i moved away from peregrine and the window ill collect my coat and walk out see what he does whether he follows me or stays where he is we need buns for our tea and the bakery is just in the next street youve been there what if he stops you as he stopped mrs hennessey i smiled as i pulled on my gloves and reached for the market basket we kept in the flat im forewarned arent i peregrine was uneasy with my going i still dont like this idea no i want you to see that i had no part of this watcher and that were both beginning to imagine things before he could argue i was out the door and down the stairs this house had four floors three of them let to people like my flatmates and mein need of a base in london but seldom there to enjoy it i went down the stairs and out the door without looking in the direction of the watcherif that is what he was instead i walked briskly to the corner of our street turning toward the small shops huddled together on the main road when i got to the corner i risked a glance behind me and to my surprise no one was following meand the watcher had vanished tsk ive come out into the cold for nothing i said to myself but i had come this far and i went to the bakery to see what was available we were all doing without the niceties by this time and it depended entirely on what the baker had been able to find in the way of sugar and flour and eggs as to what was for sale he put all his resources into bread which everyone needed and what was left over went into the tea cakes and buns and an occasional surprise like the sally lunns on sale last week we werent as fortunate today i bought bread and looked at the pathetically thin arrangement of sweets on trays that now dwarfed the selections and that used to be filled to overflowing with good things there was a little white gingerbread left and i bought two cakes of that for our tea mr johnson serving me said you arent at the front yet miss crawford nursing our lads they must be heartsick without your sunny presence he was a string bean of a man with thick white hair black brows and a pleasant disposition i didnt think id ever seen him in a foul mood alas they must wait another week mr johnson ive no word yet on where ill be sent if you see my grandson god forbid he should be hurt but if you do tell him i send him my love it was his greatest fear that his grandson would die in the war a fear that too many people shared i promise i told him as he handed me my tidy little square of cakes and then someone else was holding his attention and i went out the door the man when i approached the flat was walking back up the street toward me but he stopped to watch a small boy trying to make a toy horse set on wheels crest the uneven cobbles of the street i went on to our flat and opened the door peregrine was standing there his face a thundercloud he came into the house peregrine said before id even crossed the threshold i watched him cross the street heard him climb the stairs and he went to each door listening and then trying the latch id locked your door but i could hear him fumbling with it then he wasnt sent by my father my father knows which flat i occupy he must be looking for someone else you saw jonathan in tonbridge you saw timothy in owlhurst you called on lady parsons the rector and the doctor someone set a watch on you no i was circumspect except with the rector and lady parsons i dont see either of them running to mrs graham telling tales i gave your brothersand dr philipsthe impression that i was still concerned about ted bookers unhappy death and then it occurred to me that we had counted ted booker among the six dead because lady parsons had survived dear god peregrine what if we were right about the killing continuing and i let it be known i was concerned about the booker suicide he said nothing but behind his dark eyes his mind was racing i could see it in his face then im still in the clear he said finally that is if they still consider me dead as you said but you are most definitely in danger he tried to persuade me to go home where my parents could protect me until i left for france here alone in london i was vulnerable if that is the man watching the flat was indeed here because of me and before long through me someone would surely discover that peregrine wasnt dead in winchelsea but alive and in london that would never do dont you see i said to peregrine the first order of business is to get you safely out of london and i dont know where to put you not at homei wont involve my father or simon in this business theyll do something rash i wouldnt put it past either of them to kidnap our watcher and make him tell who had hired him and why they had served on the khyber passkidnapping there was something of a local pastime not among the british but the wild tribesmen who lived on either side of the pass had no compunction about treating their foes as they were accustomed to being treated in their turn i can protect myself with the doctors pistol and this time you will hang be sensible he rubbed his face i wanted nothing so much as to leave that asylum and get at the truth about that night in london afterwardwell if i didnt like what i learned there was a way out and then when i was free of the gates trudging through the cold night i was tempted to turn back much as i hated the asylum i was afraid of the night of myself of what lay ahead i told myself i might never have another chance and so i kept walking it took more courage than i ever knew i had and i dont know much more now than i did when i started this search youve done all you canall anyone can do but there are more questions than answers still i asked if you could prove you were not the murderer and you were set free what would you do he dropped his hands i dont think id ever considered the future but then i met diana im not in love with her but i saw in her what id missed you know that if you were cleared and you could return to owlhurst the army would be on your doorstep tomorrow and youd be sent to france or somewhere to fight he considered what i was saying im not afraid of dying war isnt about dying so much as it is about horror he shrugged living in an asylum i knew what horror was we came back then to the man standing patiently in the cold waiting for what for me for peregrine for answers i came to believe it was arthur who had killed lily i didnt want to but the facts pointed almost as strongly to him as to you now i have to ask myself if he could also have killed the othersif its true they were murdered but if we count ted booker among the six it couldnt have been arthur could it if it wasnt one of your brothers who then robert douglas but he was with your mother the night lily died im not a policeman peregrine im not trained to sort out the sheep from the goats robert douglas peregrines voice was bitter hes no murderer hes just made a habit of looking the other way thats his failing if you like he swallowed his pride and his selfrespect when he followed my stepmother to kent and he knows the price hes paid to stay near her hes willing to live with that he was kind when he knew she wouldnt care he sat with me at my fathers funeral and held my hand when i cried he brought me cake on my birthday when he took me to the asylum in her stead he told them that if i was mistreated she would see that they answered for it he persuaded inspector gadd to insist on a warm meal a bath and fresh clothes straightaway little things but he wouldnt take my part to her face it had been robert who had insisted that the dying peregrine be cared for at home then we cant expect him to be an ally all right well set any other suspicions aside and concentrate on lily why was her family given money to leave england so quickly so they wouldnt make a fuss and bring you to trial and why was mrs graham so persuasive convincing london that you should be committed to the asylum for observation as soon as possible because she feared that once the shock wore off youd remember too much and why bring in lady parsons and the others unless it was for the same reasonto see you in such a state that they were convinced beyond any doubt that you were the killer whats more i begin to wonder why you were drugged to keep you quiet in london you could have been shut up in your room there just as you had been in owlhurst the only explanation is that your stepmother really did want you to see a specialist with an eye to having you committed even before the murder and you wouldnt have been in your right mind another thingher own state just after the murder if youd really been guilty shed have jumped at the chance to be rid of you she was beside herself because it was one of her sons and in the midst of her horror and grief she saw the only way out of her nightmare was to put the blame on you and if youre right about robert he stood there and let her do it he had listened carefully but at the end he said she told me that if i caused any trouble then or in the asylum that id be taken away and hanged i believed her i didnt know any better in prison they wouldnt have kept you drugged and at the asylum if you tried to tell anyone that shed slept with robert douglas or that one of your brothers was not your fathers son they would put it down to your madness and if you remembered too much about london they wouldnt listen after all the police had what amounted to your own confession that you wanted your knife back after using it to kill the girl you said yourself that little effort was made to help you get well you were in that place for a lifetime and even if they had restored you to sanity the only option was a prison cell peregrine shook his head you make it sound logical but how do you explain the dreams i dont know i told him truthfully but tomorrow were leaving london in the dark before dawn if we have to theres one person i can think of who would keep you safe i dont know why it hadnt occurred to me before and i promise you as soon as i have leave again in france ill find a way to prove what i just told you and the watcher will have nothing to tell whoever hired him hell be called off i dragged you into this at the point of a gun thats water over the dam let it go do you still brace your door with a chair at night i opened my mouth to deny i ever had done and then said no not now peregrine smiled and this time it reached his eyes but he said nothing we ate what id brought from the bakery and i cleared away the dishes peregrine watched me and as i dried the cup that id used for my tea he reached out and took it from my hands it was the cup with brighton pavilion on it that exotic palace that the prince regent had built for himself not so very far from here his cottage at the seaside id like to see that he said wistfully its very unenglish if we can clear your name i answered him ill take you there myself when mrs hennessey returned later in the day i went down to ask her what the man who had accosted her earlier had wanted with her he was looking for a flat to rent for his daughter he thought i looked to be the sort of person who would keep her from getting herself in trouble when you were away he came into the house and went up the stairs to try every door did he indeed she was quite angry is he looking to murder us in our beds or to rob us blind i thought perhaps you ought to know especially since ill be leaving quite early in the morning she was quite exercised at the thought of someone coming into her castle and threatening it it made me feel guilty for frightening her but it was true is he still out there she went to her window and peered through a slit between the curtains by judas so he is just you waitwhen constable brewster comes by on his rounds ill have a word with him see if i dont and well see then who is the clever one she let the curtains come together again did you say you were leaving oh my dear girl you will be careful wont you those huns are cruel they shot that poor edith cavell just for staying at her post with the wounded and look how they sank britannic a hospital ship you must stay as far away from them as you can ill keep myself as safe as possible were behind the lines it will be all right i didnt tell her that sometimes when the shelling began we were too close she embraced me saying of all my girls you are the closest to my heart i left her with tears in her eyes and went back up the stairs feeling a certain elation the constable would see to our watcher just long enough for peregrine and me to slip out of london there was no one watching when peregrine and i quietly let ourselves out the door an hour before dawn i had spent most of the evening removing any trace of peregrines presence from the flat the sheets were set out for the woman who did mrs hennesseys wash and ours all the cups and dishes wed used were in their accustomed places and elaynes bed had fresh linens from our cupboard id borrowed a valise from another of my flatmates for peregrines belongings and repacked my own when we crept down the stairs i could hear mrs hennessey snoring gently from her rooms the house was so quiet there was a misting rain this morning cold and wet on the face as we walked several streets over in search of a cab to take us to the station i had thought of everything and i was rather pleased as we stepped into the train at victoria station on our way to rochester i had even fashioned a bandage for peregrines head so that he wouldnt be required to speak and id told him he was my brother going home from hospital to complete his recovery he had looked in the mirror and said its more believable than the bandage i contrived well of course what did you expect i demanded we left the train at rochester walking up the hill to the old heart of the city the squat powerful romanesque cathedral and the keep of the castle across from it were floating in disembodied splendor above the fog that had swept up from the medways estuary i needed transportation to my final destination the home of a woman my parents had known for some years the best place to find a driver was at an hotel the long winding high street was still nearly empty though it was close on nine oclock in the morning but the shops had opened and a chimney sweep walked by whistling we were just by a butchers shop when i saw coming toward me an officer i knew now a captain in my fathers old regiment i clutched peregrines arm and steered him into the shop wait here i said in a low voice whatever you do dont come out to the astonished butcher i said were elopingcan my fiancé wait in a back room someone who knows my parents is coming up the street the butcher a burly man with thick graying hair nodded and beckoned to peregrine as i stepped out of the shop and walked on captain raynor recognized me waved and we met in front of a milliners well beyond the butchers shop bess is that you of course what on earth are you doing in rochester i asked i thought you were the terror of the hun i could ask you the same your father isnt here with you by any chance i thought i saw you with an officer someone who was my patient on britannic he walked a little way with me catching up on news but tell me how is margaret he grinned from ear to ear weve a son i was here for the birthnasty shoulder wound and they sent me home i never thought id ever be glad of german marksmanship his name is william and hes beautiful im so happy for you i embraced him lightly thats for margaret tell her shes wonderful his eyes were bright with pride so she is she could ask for the moon tomorrow and id do my best to reach it for her how long is your leave the brightness faded ten days and im off again i dont know how i can bear to go i never hated the germans until william came and now im not very happy with the french either and what about you he asked quickly changing the subject i heard what happened are you all right are you returning to duty the colonel must have been beside himself i survived with nothing more than a broken arm i said and i expect my orders will be here next week im sure this break from blood and death has been good for you but i must say you still look a little tired if only he knew the arm was slow to heal dont tell me they worked on this shoulder of mine until i wished it had been blown off but see i can almost reach above my head and he demonstrated how far hed come i made congratulatory noises all the while praying that hed be spared and come home safe to william and margaret he asked after my father and simon and sent his dearest love to the colonels lady and then we parted he embraced me warmly saying keep safe bess ill do the same trust in that and he was gone i walked on as far as a small bookshop stopping there to look in the window while surreptitiously watching captain raynor turn a corner and disappear weak with relief i hurried back the way id come and opened the door to the butcher shop still smiling at our close call the butcher was nowhere to be seen nor was peregrine but at the sound of the bell above the door tinkling its warning the butcher appeared from the back his ruddy face nearly as white as his shirt youd better come he said and gestured toward the back i had no idea what was wrong but i almost ran through the shop to follow him in the room behind the shop where the butcher worked out of sight there was a long wooden table a block for a top and beside it an assortment of knives and other tools peregrine was on the far side of the tablerigid with shock his face a mask of horror i dont know whats wrongi was cleaning a brace of geesewhat happened to him in the war then i had nearly forgot that peregrine was in uniform ia head wound i managed to say and then my training asserted itself and i put my hand on the butchers arm could you leave us please for a little while im a nurse the butcher all but fled the workroom i looked at the blood on the worktable the entrails of the geese lying in an ugly heap that hint of rusty iron that was the smell of blood caught in my throat i went around the table without speaking i was afraid to touch peregrine and the shared knowledge of war that had helped me deal with ted booker was no use to me here peregrine i spoke softly its bess crawford whats wrong he started back as i spoke no i wont put my hands thereyou cant force i looked from his staring eyes to the bloody entrails and my heart turned over i hadnt been there when mrs graham found lily mercer but i was seeing the scene now as peregrine must have seen it peregrine i reached out for his arm to turn him away but he flung his arm out at me knocking me halfway across the room where i ended up next to a large basket of live chickens their startled cackling adding to the nightmarish scene this wasnt a slim dazed and frightened fourteenyearold he was a fully grown man and i was winded from the blow he was screaming no dont touch me i wont i tell you i wont i had helped ted booker by taking part in his nightmare i tried it now but this is what you did peregrine do you hear me i said in a voice as near to that of mrs graham as i could make it i didnt touch her i only wanted my knife you cant have it the police must take it look at what you did put your hands in her body peregrine and touch what you have done your father would despise you if hed lived to see this here hold out your hands and ill show you how it feels to be ripped apart he screamed and went on screaming and then began beating at the front of his uniform as if frantically trying to rub something off his eyes wide with horror and revulsion and he kept on beating at his chest before turning with such loathing in his face that i nearly fell back again into the basket of chickens i hate you he said no longer screaming his voice cold and hard and young i have always hated you he broke off as if hed been slapped his head jerking and then to my astonishment he began crying silent tears of anguish rolling down his cheeks and with a bravado i hadnt thought possible he reached out and buried his hands in the bloody mass there he said im my fathers son which is more than my brothers can say i hurried to him caught his hands and with a cloth that hung from a hook by the table i cleaned them as best i could then i made him dip them in a bucket of water standing beside a sheeps carcass i was crying myself now tears of pity for a child who hadnt been able to defend himself tormented beyond bearing he seemed to shudder and after a moment he said bess as if he couldnt see me there beside him it was the first time hed used my given name i dropped the cloth to the floor and took his arm im here peregrine its all right come with me he moved like a sleepwalker and i led him like a little child back out into the shop the butcher was standing there hands to his sides his expression one of pity mixed with horror i think he believed peregrine was reliving some war experience for he said to me in a low voice id not marry him miss not if i was you not in this state he belongs in hospital where they can see to him i thanked him telling him i would reconsider and i led peregrine out of the shop the damp air clung to our faces as i guided him to the nearby side street and we climbed the hill to the cathedral it was the only quiet empty place i could think of we walked to the side door that i could see was open on the south side crossing the lawn wet with dew inside it was cold and quite dark the massive pillars almost ghostly sentinels against the windows i found a bench in the back and we sat down peregrine was calmer now as if the nightmare had receded and left him drained i think i could have ordered him to jump from the squat tower and hed have done it his will destroyed we sat there for some time i didnt touch him but i was close beside him where he could sense my presence gradually he seemed to recover i could almost watch the progression of emotions in the distance someone came in from another door a woman lifting the holly branches and fir boughs out of the vases by the altar and going off with them i doubted she could see us here beneath the west doors but i said nothing until she had come back for the vases and carried them away as well peregrine where are we he whispered looking at the cavernous nave and the long row of columns the only light that small one in the altar and the rainwet windows reflecting the dark day i dont know this church rochester cathedral i replied did you ever come here he frowned once with my father we saw beckets tomb thats canterbury he didnt answer i thought perhaps he must have been very young at the time his father hadnt lived very long after timothys birth i could see them walking along together man and child arthur would have been too young to accompany them peregrine would have still had his father to himself do you remember what happened in theerthe shop where you waited for me there was someone who knew your family yes hed have been curious about this uniform hes in my fathers regiment and i couldnt pass you off as a brother or a suitor or hed have known it was a lie he turned to me the first spark of the man id seen yet you dont have suitors i felt like laughing out loud not at the moment at least id forgot you were in love with arthur hardly love yet i could hear his laughter remember the warmth in those blue blue eyes and still feel sometimes the touch of his hand how it had seemed to open a world of happiness no shadows no secrets just a good man what people often called a natural leader who had put aside his own pain to make the others in the ward believe they would all survive together well then you felt something there was a softness in your voice when you spoke his name he paused its not there any longer no which was the real arthur the dying man who gave others the gift of his spirit or the devious man who had concealed the ugly crime of murder were they one and the same how could they be how could i care for oneand not the other i shook off that train of thought and went back to my probing i wasnt sure how far to press then i remembered something that daisy the laundress in london had said someone had tried to clean away most of the blood that hadnt been what i needed to learn at the time and so i had ignored the words but now i began to see a picture of such hideous behavior that i felt ill mrs graham had so terrified peregrine that he had never really recovered from itas much a victim of shock as ted booker cradling his dying brother in his arms the dreams how could a woman commit such an act of betrayal but there had been a choice peregrineor her own son and so she had destroyed her husbands child with a cold and malicious trick and then she had displayed him to the london police and after that to everyone who mattered in owlhurstinspector gadd the rector mr craig dr hadley and lady parsonsto leave them in no doubt that peregrine was a monstrous boy whom she had saved from prison but lost to the asylum and all the while the child who had really killed was safe at home with robert douglas he must have loved mrs graham very much to allow himself to be used as he wasor perhaps it was his own child he was protecting at any price id guessed what she must have done that nightbut i couldnt have imagined the cruelty of the scheme she had used to make the changeling work i said to peregrine what were you served at the noon meal the day of the murder he gazed at me as if id lost my mind then he said i dont remember he sat there for several minutes his thoughts elsewhere and then he said yes yes i do it must have been a goose because there was a fricassee of goose for dinner it made my stomach queasy i couldnt finish it and later i lost it and lily told me i ought to be made to clear the vomit up myself timothy told her to smear it on my face the way one shows a dog he mustnt soil the carpet she was angry with all of us because she had so badly wanted the night off she felt that mr appleby ought to have been forced to give up his evening instead his eyebrows rose i hadnt thought about that i heard her call arthur a spoiled mamas boy and later she told timothy that a cripple ought not be so prideful that he had only to look at his ugly misshapen foot to know that he had an ugly misshapen nature i dont know what she said to jonathan but he slammed his door and wouldnt unlock it again however much lily wheedled until she threatened to send for robert a girl disappointed because she couldnt have an anticipated free evening four boys teased and called namesand then some final exchange that must have triggered fury and finally murder but if it wasnt peregrine someone had had the forethought to use his pocketknife someone perhaps who was jealous that it had been given to the eldest son and wanted to punish peregrine for being his fathers firstborn i said breaking the stillness my voice almost overloud in the quiet cathedral peregrine you were very young at the time do you know how your father died my father hed gone to cranbrook on the way home his horse bolted and the carriage overturned he was dead when he was brought to the house and laid on his bed all i knew at the time was that he lay there with his eyes open and i couldnt understand why when someone tried to close them they wouldnt stay closed who found him i dont remember that if ever i was told later i overheard my stepmother talking about gypsies but it was a child who ran under his horses hooves peregrine remembered his fathers corpse with sadness but without terrors hed have remembered lily mercers in that same way if he hadnt been made to put his hands in what hed thought was her bloody body it had never occurred to him in those few minutes with mrs graham that the offal was not a human beings and shed counted on thatcounted on his state of mind warping all he saw lets find the hotel i said getting to my feet it was cold as a tomb in here with the stone walls and stone flooring locking in the frigid january air we could use a cup of tea while the hotel finds someone to drive us chapter eighteen a mr freeman agreed to conduct us to the home of melinda crawford she was a connection on my fathers side her ancestors army officers whod fought at yorktown with cornwallis followed old duro through spain and danced with my own greatgrandmotherso the story wenton that fateful eve of waterloo as a child in india she had lived through the siege of lucknow where the british were nearly wiped out during the great indian mutiny she had seen death and disease closeup and survived to marry her own cousin against all adviceand been extraordinarily happy with him when he died she returned to england by a roundabout route that would have made the hardiest explorer blanch to contemplate at least those were the stories id been brought up on and id believed them when one knew melinda one did with that past i was hoping shed accept an escaped lunatic with equanimity if not precisely with enthusiasm id omitted the polite telegram signaling my imminent arrival she just might take it into her head to telephone the colonel sahib and ask him if he knew what his errant daughter was up to she still might but it was worth the risk no one would think to look for peregrine graham in melinda crawfords lair and if they tried she was more than capable of dealing with them her house was closer to tonbridge than to rochester but i was wary now of tonbridge after our encounter with jonathan graham there better a long drive across kent than the worry of a confrontation at the train station or the hotel a cold rain had started again as we set out and the countryside winter bleak was colorless and dreary muddy roads leading through brown fallow fields apple trees raising twisted limbs to the gray sky sheep huddled wherever they could find shelter and any people out in the weather were hurrying about their business with heads down not far from marling we found the turning that led to the crawford house and shortly after that the stone gates with their elephant lanterns loomed through the mists as the drive wound up the knoll the views were shrouded in rain i had heard many british exiles in india describe the cottage they would have when at last they could go home roses and daffodils and wisteria and all the beauty that the brown and tan and cream shades of indian dust made impossible out there melindas gardens were beautiful in season and she indulged herself with arrays of color not for her single beds of pinks and red beds of yellow and gold beds of blues and lavenders here flowers mingled in rampant glory a rainbow of blues nodding to cream and yellow lavenders touching rose and pink and dark blue golds indulgently shoulder to shoulder with white and purple and red all striking to the eye and visible from every window now of course the beds were dormant but a bank of holly trees and a dramatic cedar and the leathery green of rhododendron softened the scene to a child coming home on leave from india this was heaven all the way here id debated with myself what i should tell melinda crawford and how to explain peregrine nothing believable came to mind we rang the doorbell huddling close under the small porch i had paid off the driver but asked him to wait until we were certain someone was at home the door opened and in it stood shanta the indian woman who had served melinda for so long she could speak her mind without reprimand now she took one look at the orphans of the storm on her doorstep and raised her eyebrows i do hope i said mustering a smile that had more of cheshire cat in it than id have liked that melinda is at home its been a wretched drive miss elizabeth she said severely if you are eloping you can go home now and be sensible thank god id warned peregrine that the household was a little eccentric but still i felt myself flushing im not eloping the lieutenant here is a patient and he has nowhere to go erthe zeppelins destroyed his flat in london he did look every inch the wounded herohis eyes darkcircled and tired his shoulders thin from fever and his skin without much color i found myself thinking that as my choice for eloping hero he was off the mark if that is the case come inside and be warm i turned to wave goodbye to mr freeman and followed shanta inside taking peregrines arm and ushering him ahead of me i could feel his silent resistancethe muscles in his arm were corded bands we were taken to the study where a fire blazed on the hearth and the room was suffocatingly hot melinda crawfords blood still yearned for the heat of india and i could remember as a child thinking that all old people must be on the verge of freezing to death two other widows my father had visited over the years wives of officers who had died out there lived in the same tropical environment they were the only people i knew who kept roaring fires in high summer one had suffered from malaria on and off and was always feverish melinda was seated in a chair draped in lovely silk paisley shawls and she registered no surprise at seeing me in her doorway i wondered why ive had a letter from your mother she said rising to kiss me she was worried about you she said you havent been the same since you went to visit the grahams i kissed her cheek and smelled the scent of sandalwood and roses in her hair she was tall and straight with the bearing of a soldier and this is she turned to peregrine and held out her hand like an empress greeting a new and interesting courtier before i could stop him peregrine gave her his real name she turned to me again i thought the graham boy you were so fond of died aboard britannic i could feel my heart fluttering into my throat this is his eldest brother i said trying to appear nonchalant melinda nodded welcome to my house lieutenant graham come and sit by me i see youre in the colonels old regiment my husbands as well wounded in france were you we sat down as far from the fire as was polite the room hadnt changed much crowded as it was with melindas indian souvenirs as well as objects shed discovered on her travels there was a tall porcelain russian stove in the left corner of the room a gigantic ceramic affair in blue and cream that shed seen in leningrad and shipped home a samovar from moscowoften used to brew her teastood on a table between the windows and above it were two great african elephant tusks that curved around a garuda mask from bali i couldnt help but wonder what peregrine made of it all if hed thought the prince regents pavilion intriguing this must seem exotic in the extreme melinda was asking him how much action hed seen and he was answering more than i care to recall and she nodded satisfied what brings you here my dear girl she asked me next your mother says your orders have been cut and should arrive at any moment and ive yet to thank you for the letter you sent from athens most reassuring let me tell you i said almost bluntly peregrine needs somewhere to stay would you mind he doesnt wish to go home and there are no beds to be had in london hes good company and as soon as hes well enough to manage on his own hell be rejoining his regiment of course he may stay were a quiet house if he doesnt heal here he never shall i felt distinctly uneasy had she heard about peregrines escape surely not truth was id expected more resistance on her part damn peregrine for not remaining lieutenant philips it was much later after a light luncheon that peregrine was shown to his room by shanta leaving melinda to crossexamine me at her leisure child what are you playing at the truth if you please theres nothing balderdash im not senile yet bess crawford and ill thank you to give me credit for knowing you well enough to see through your happy little charade i do read the papers you know that mans an escaped lunatic and here you are roaming the countryside in his company hes escaped from the asylum but hes not madyou have talked with him for two hours or more melinda tell me you believe hes crazy much less a murderer what i believe is beside the point theres his family to consider the world believes he must be dead you cant leave them to grieve its unconscionable no it isnt not when everyone is glad to be rid of him at last i dont think he killed anyone did you know his father ambrose graham he was twice married and peregrine is his son by his first wife i found myself telling her everything trying my best to make what id done seem reasonable and logical under the circumstances and all the while her dark eyes seemed to bore into my head to look beyond my words and find the truth so you now think it must have been arthur who did these terrible things except for the fact that someone else died after arthur himself was dead i dont know it must be one of the sons everyone else was away that evening robert douglas had accompanied mrs graham to a dinner party lily mercer was still alive then as she was when the tutor left the house peregrine feels he was persecuted by his stepmother after he found her in bed with her cousin robert i think she took peregrine to london because she was afraid to leave him at home not because he was dangerous but because someone might discover that he wasnt what everyone thought he was and perhaps believe what he had to say he was angry and violent sometimes im sure but not in that waymore frustrated and unhappy than mad or murderous and i strongly suspect he was drugged part of the time he was in london to keep him quiet especially between the time of lilys death and his arrival at the asylum so you would like very much to believe what else is there to believe she sat there thinking it over did it occur to you my dear that peregrine was taken to london to die i opened my mouth and closed it again yes i know but consider he was desperately unhappy his brothers were being treated to the sights and he was left alone with a staff no one knew well what was to prevent him from walking out the door and disappearing but in london without money or friends where would he go and what would become of him his chances of surviving were not good how long would they have waited before calling in the police do you think this robert douglas could be counted on to see that peregrines disappearance was permanent i shook my head no robert is easily led but he isnt cruel he lets things happen without demur but he doesnt initiate such things then he must love mrs graham very much indeed or know which of her children he fathered another point why was the maid lily left in charge that fatal night she was young for such responsibilityshe couldnt have been much older than peregrine add to that she was angry rude to the young gentlemen and she retired to her room rather than remain belowstairs on duty as she should have done peregrine could have been gone for hours before anyone noticed its the only explanation you see but lily went too far in her rage at being left in charge and she was murdered what a shock for mrs graham to come home and find peregrine still there you must ask peregrine indirectly what his thoughts are about this view it could be enlightening i was still trying to digest her comments i wanted to go straightaway and speak to him but she put her hand on my arm and said no let him rest is there no one else you could ask about events in london the tutor mr appleby he was in london with the family he must know more than he was willing to tell me earlier well of course you must visit him again melinda said i let mr freeman go i have my own motorcar my dear and ram desikhan to drive it leave mr freeman and his like out of this she looked at the little watch she wore on a diamond brooch pinned to the left shoulder of her gown too late today to make the journeyit will be dark soon but tomorrow you shall go to chilham and ask him but carefully remember that but who killed lily if it wasnt peregrine i told her about events this morning in the butcher shop expecting her to be as horrified as i was she said its an old trick carried to extremes here of course i remember once on the northwest frontier that a pathan rebel was led to believe hed killed one of his own family by mistake it saved a feud you see the eye that offended was his not ours my husband was very pleased with the outcome he was rid of two birds with only one bullet as it were what became of the pathan rebel i asked intrigued he went home and kept to his tent like achilles at troy they said his first child after that incident was born deformed and lived only a few hours and he believed it was his curse for killing his own blood he put away his wives went into the hills and died many years later as a hermit but surely there was someone to take his place sadly there always is but the point remains my dear that the brain can be fooled im not saying it was in peregrine grahams case but if you introduce a horror that the mind cant cope with it runs away shell shock i said thinking of ted booker precisely there were women at lucknow who werent right in their heads afterward we all thought we were going to die but what was far worse we knew it would be a ghastly death an insupportable horror like watching the lifeboats being sucked into the screws of britannic and knowing that it could be ones own fate as well i shivered i will keep your peregrine graham here but this situation must be resolved tomorrow morning go and see this tutor if he cant help you then you must go home and leave your black sheep with me for the duration you cant take him to somerset and you cant avoid your duty when your orders come you owe your parents a little time with you with no worries it was early when i set out for chilham ram melinda crawfords majordomo and chauffeur was tall graying and very protective of his mistress he said over his shoulder as we turned into the main road this man you have brought he is no danger to the memsahib i wouldnt have brought him if he was but peregrine still possessed his pistol its as well to ask there is something in his eyes we drove in silence after that and as i watched the countryside pass by i thought about the fact that peregrine graham was the heir to his fathers estate but he didnt have the wherewithal to buy a loaf of bread or a pair of shoes id leave money with him if i had to go whether he wished it or not we drove into chilham late in the morning i couldnt send ram into the white horse for tea he wouldnt be welcomed there but i brought him a cup and asked him to wait while i went to speak to mr appleby i shall be here in the car if anything untoward happens you have only to call ram reminded me i thanked him and went down the lane between the pub and churchyard trying to decide how best to approach the grahams tutor and met him coming out his door as i started up the walk he wasnt best pleased to see me i said mr appleby if you would walk with me for a little in the churchyard perhaps we wont distress your wife i have told you i have nothing more to say to you miss crawford ive learned a great deal more about the events that put peregrine graham into bartons asylum i think it might be wise to hear me out he had no choice but to fall in step with me as he turned the way id just come at the head of the lane he saw melindas rolls and the indian driver who is that and what is he doing here he stopped short staring waiting for me i see we continued into the square and paced toward the jacobean manor house at the opposite end what is it you want to know miss crawford and why im just trying to understand the sequence of events that led to lily mercers death mrs graham and her cousin were attending a dinner party you were given the evening off i was given no such thing it was my usual day and evening free i see and the servants were also given the evening off since there was no one to dine at home except the four boys is that true yes yes whats your point it seems rather odd to leave four active boys in the house with only a young housemaid to supervise them she had merely to serve their dinner which was already prepared and draw their baths they werent small children miss crawford in need of tucking in and a bedtime story they could see to their own needs they were the sons of a gentleman after all not barrow boys but one of them peregrine was known to bedifficult he was fourteen not ten and lily couldnt have been more than eighteen we had reached the gates of the manor house and turned to walk the other way even in the dreary light the lovely tudor houses gleamed white and black it was mrs grahams decision to make not mine it was my usual free day peregrine could have walked out rather than attacking lily he could have gone anywhere anything might have happened to him he wasnt used to being on his own appleby stopped short you are pressing your luck miss crawford we cant change the past why rake through it i should think that you would find the subject unpleasant enough to leave it you didnt like peregrine very much you punished him at every opportunity who told you that oh dearhow to answer it was rumored in owlhurst he turned away from me peregrine was the most difficult pupil ive ever encountered it took all of my skill and most of my patience to teach him you have no way to measure what i endured you could have quit you could have walked away he turned to face me i liked the three younger sons why should i refuse to teach them why should i punish them for their brothers deficiencies thats rather arrogant dont you think not at all im a good teacher what if i told you that its very likely that it wasnt peregrine who killed lily mercer although he was judged and punished for it if you were such a good teacher why didnt you question his guilt why didnt you see through the tangle of evidence and realize that it was not peregrine that it couldnt have been him couldnt you tell that he was drugged while he was in london surely there were signs some indication in the character of one of the other boys that warned you to look in his direction and what about that visit to a specialist who could help peregrine there had been excursions to the zoo and the tower why hadnt there been time to take peregrine for examination i was well paid to educate four youths he retorted angrily i wasnt paid to tell my employer that one of her sons was deficient in character then you did doubt peregrines guilt not for an instant i walked in the door found the police in the house and peregrine graham spattered with the girls blood it was the most shocking experience of my life let me tell you the atmosphere was highly charged mrs graham was very emotional on the verge of breaking down the police were as shocked as i was and peregrine stood there with a dazed expression not a word of regret not a word in his own defense robert douglas was a rock i stood in admiration of his quiet ability to keep the household calm i wasted no time on doubt i saw the proof with my own eyes perhaps not then but later later you wondered if you were a good judge of young people as a teacher should be you began to question what youd seen and been told other things happened to cast doubt on peregrines guilt why didnt you do something a flicker of acknowledgment crossed his face for the first time i saw the truth exposedhe couldnt hide it however much he tried it was gone in a flash and then rage took over i thought for an instant he would strike me he was so furious i wondered how much of that fury was shame because he hadnt liked peregrine and at first had been glad to be rid of him and later he still said nothing because he enjoyed his comfortable position with the graham family too much to jeopardize it i wanted to ask him which of his charges was a murderer but i didnt dare he walked away from me his shoulders so stiff with his anger that he seemed to strut but i thought it was more the desire to lash out at me held in check because i was a woman and this was a very public place i waited in the expectation that he might turn that he might get himself under control and protest that id got it wrong but mr appleby knew hed already betrayed too much he wasnt going to risk betraying more i went back to the motorcar drawing in a deep breath as i took my seat ram said that man was very angry indeed he turned his eyes anxious is all well i dont know i said slowly take me home if you please we drove sedately out of chilham down the hill and toward the road west i had stirred up a hornets nest pray god i wasnt the one who was stung as a result we stopped on the way back to the crawford house i wanted to make sure that peregrine had all he needed for a visit there it took me three quarters of an hour to find everything on my mental list and i was rather pleased with the result id had no luck in finding evening dress but then melinda had never been a stickler for dressing for dinner she would accept peregrines uniform ram was waiting for me near rochester castle and i paid the boy from the haberdashers a shilling for carrying my bundles and packages for me he had struggled up the hill under his burden and was breathing hard by the time wed stowed them safely in the motorcar he stared at ram and said whos that then my driver hes from india does he have an elephant once upon a time he may have satisfied the boy ran off ram chuckled but i was struck by something else melinda crawfords driver must be unique in kent i should have insisted on hiring someone else someone who attracted no attention i settled back for the drive to melindas house it was too late to worry about today but tomorrow id do things differently as we turned up the drive i realized that id missed my lunch and was looking forward to tea shanta greeted me and took my coat and gloves ram has packages that belong in lieutenant grahams room i told her memsahib is in her sitting room will you have your tea now or later now i said and walked on to the sitting room i discovered our tea had already been brought in peregrine will be down shortly he was asleep when shanta went to his room are you sure hes well that he doesnt need to see a doctor i think hes surviving on his will alone but hes not coughing as much and i dont think hes feverish sleep is the best medicine and good food what did you accomplish today i made mr appleby very angry i said when i suggested that after peregrine had been dealt with and the household had returned to nearly normal he had doubts about what had been done so quickly and without fuss but he gave you no feeling for which boy he suspected sadly no hes an arrogant man he takes great pride in being a good teacher but i agree with what someone else saidhes really secondrate i dont think mrs graham wanted a sharp mind seeing through i could hear the rasp of the door knocker who can be calling at this hour melinda demanded testily no dont get up my dear shanta will send them away my father is in somerset i should think but the sitting room door burst open and brushing shanta aside there stood jonathan graham backed by two burly police constables the raw puckered scar across his face accentuated his determined expression he knew what he wanted and he was set on getting it ive come to fetch my brother jonathan said melinda drew herself up to her full height and said i beg your pardon constable mason what is the meaning of this abrupt and very rude intrusion i stood there astonished unable to believe my eyes and then i collected my wits hes guessinghes not sure the colonel sahib firmly believed in a sharp counterattack when the enemy began a tentative probe and so i did just that your brother is dead so ive been told if you wish to know why ive been asking questions about what happened in london fourteen years ago its because im not convinced that the real murderer was ever caught then theres ted bookers suicidei have a strong feeling that he was murdered its not remotely possible that peregrine killed him is it and what about all those other deaths in owlhurstinspector gadd dr hadley the rector peregrine was in the asylum during that time was he not this begins to shed new light on lily mercers murder wouldnt you agree lieutenant graham that rocked him back on his heels constable mason the older of the two uniformed policemen ignored me and said to melinda it was reported maam that there was a dangerous murderer in this house and weve come to fetch him before any harm comes to you or your staff and why should i entertain a murderer under my roof pray i dont know this officer constable and ill thank you to escort him out of my presence before i make a formal complaint to the chief constable he dined here on saturday last and i can assure you he wouldnt have done so if i consorted with murderers dangerous or otherwise i thought wed carried it off i thought we had between us put the fear of god into the constables and rattled jonathan graham jonathan had looked from melinda to me as she spoke of the chief constable and there was a flicker of uncertainty in his eyes i said into the silence constable if you wish to search the house of course you may lieutenant graham has been misled maliciously at a guess just at that moment peregrine graham came unwittingly down the stairs and turned toward the sitting room chapter nineteen at the sound of footsteps jonathan graham whirled stepped back into the passage and stared into the face of the half brother he hadnt seen since they were both children there was still a chance may i present lieutenant philips i said quickly hes an officer in my fathers regimenthe escorted me to kent but jonathan saw something in his brothers face that triggered a memory a profound recognition on both sides that was our undoing thats him jonathan exclaimed i told you he was here peregrine spun on his heel and ran for the stairs the two constables lumbered after him shouting for him to stop i caught jonathan grahams sleeve and prevented him from following which of you killed lily mercer do you know tell me he stared at me as if id struck him across the face if it wasnt arthurand arthur couldnt have killed ted bookerthen it must be you or timothy you were the last person to see ted booker alive you are as mad as peregrine is tell jonathan that i lied i did it for mothers sake but it has to be set right i quoted what had to be set right what had arthur lied about for his mothers sake had he lied about who had possession of ambrose grahams pocketknife at the time lily mercer was killed did arthur know and cover it up for your sake or for timothys and what about those other deathsinspector gadd the rector the doctor all the people who had acquiesced to sending peregrine to the asylum which one of you decided to right that balance rather than confess to the truth or was it done just to see that no one ever changed his mind about peregrines guilt he shook me off so forcibly that i fell back against the doorjamb and then he was gone up the stairs in the wake of the constables peregrine he shouted his voice reverberating through the house where was the pistol what had peregrine done with it was that what he was after i couldnt stand there listening for the shots i was at jonathans heels trying to stop a tragedy that was about to happen but peregrine never used his pistol he simply ran out of breath and they caught him as he leaned coughing harshly in the doorway of his room it was too late to persuade the constables that they had got the wrong man they would believe jonathan not me there was nothing i could do i watched them bring peregrine down the stairs without a coat without a hat and i could see that someonejonathanhad struck him across the face how did they know how could they have possibly known he was hereunless mr appleby had recognized melinda crawfords chauffeur and maliciously set jonathan graham on my heels he stood there in the hall triumphant cold i was on my way out the door my orders have arrived i would have been gone in another hour and then the message came where are you taking him jonathan didnt answer but one of the constables said hes to be returned to the asylum miss he wont remain there for very long i warned the constable theres some doubt now that he killed anyone hes lied to you miss the other constable said the police dont make such mistakes he looked at peregrine standing there helpless between them no color in his face and something in his eyes that i didnt want to see handsome fellow easy to get around a young lady and here wed all thought he was dead how dare you i began but melinda stopped me you arent taking him from here without his hat and coat she said her voice stern if hes to be taken back to that place its a long drive will you fetch mr grahams things shanta and shanta moved out of the shadows and went quietly up the stairs peregrines gaze followed her and i knew what he was thinking that the pistol was in his greatcoat pocket i held my breath when shanta returned with the coat and then i realized what was in peregrine grahams mind he had no intention of using the weapon on his captors but somewhere between here and his destination he would find a way to use it on himself i said urgently peregrine this isnt the end of the matter do you understand me i have connections ill see to it that this business is settled he gave me an odd smile tell diana im sorry i wont be there to see her on her next leave and then they were dragging him out of the house and into the motorcar that had brought them here jonathan was the last to go i turned on him as he stood on the top step watching peregrine being shoved into the backseat jammed between the two constables mr appleby knows the truth i said he didnt want to admit to it but he knows and i know the truth and my father and melinda crawford and too many people to be dealt with its only a matter of time jonathan graham before your brothers last wishes are finally carried out knowing and proving he said are two entirely different matters who is diana i didnt answer him not that it signifies he said into my silence and with that he cranked the motorcar got behind the wheel and drove off down the drive i was so helplessly angry that i burst into tears melinda behind me said i think we should call simon not your father not in this case simon will know what to do i shut the door on the cold evening air and turned to her it will be too late i said by the time simon can get here peregrine graham will be dead by his own hand i put in the call to simon brandon anyway but there was no answer at the other end hed gone to dine with my parents i thought he did at least once a fortnight that was that the cavalry wouldnt come in time i went back into the sitting room shanta was taking away the now cold pot of tea and i stood before the fire on the hearth trying to warm myself it was appleby i said again it couldnt have been anyone else he saw your motorcar and ram i was careful so very careful to keep peregrine out of sight except on our first visit to the tutor and he told jonathan how to find me out of spite the penny must finally have dropped it wasnt very clever of me to offer you my car melinda sat down one arm on the table in front of her a frown between her eyes i dont think it was jonathan who killed that girl your tutor this mr appleby wouldnt have called him if he was dont you see he would have been afraid to let anyone know he had guessed the truth that is if you are right and the tutor had seen more than he was willing to tell and arthur sent his message to jonathan that completes the circle doesnt it as for the other killingsthey didnt include appleby because he was out of reach in chilham that leaves timothy i should think the only other choice is mrs graham herself and i find that hard to believe she answered musing she was devastated you said when the murder was discovered i hadnt really wanted it to be timothy i had disliked jonathan from the start and could have comfortably concluded that he was the killer i said suddenly realizing the full impact of what we were saying it wasnt arthur it wasnt arthur yes i should think that would be quite a relief but how to prove any of this it wont be easy the police had convinced themselves that their case was strong enough to send peregrine graham to bartons they wont wish to reopen the case but it was jonathan the rector saw leaving the doctors surgery the night that i stopped id believed all along that it was unlikely that jonathan had visited ted booker and of course he hadnt that was why he hadnt spoken up at the inquest it must have been timothy in jonathans borrowed greatcoatand jonathan had lied for his brother again shanta came in with a fresh pot of tea and a fresh pitcher of milk she poured two cups passed them to us and then said you are looking very glum drink your tea and have something to eat it will do you both a great deal of good i said shanta what did you think of peregrine graham she considered the question and then answered me there is a darkness that follows him like a shadow im very glad that you werent eloping i couldnt touch my tea the feeling that peregrine would die before he could be taken back to the asylum grew stronger with every passing minute every wasted minute melinda i was on my feet and heading for the door i must borrow your motorcar im sorry i cant wait for ram i must go ram drove sedately not the way i intended to drive before she could say anything i went up the stairs nearly as fast as peregrine had done caught up my hat and coat and gloves and was on my way down the back steps to the barn where the motorcar was kept i heard melinda calling to me from a doorway but i didnt stop to hear what she had to say the motor was still warm and turned over with only one revolution of the crank i drove out of the barn leaving the doors wide behind me and went down the drive at a clip that was reckless in this light i kept my attention on the headlamps as they swept the road while i went through the map of kent in my head there were two ways to reach owlhurst or the road leading to it where bartons stood jonathan would have taken the more direct and so would i i cleared my head of every thought concentrating on the road if i could catch them up before they reached bartonssurely peregrine would wait until they were almost there hed be searched at the door and then it would be too late somewhere before the asylum i could picture that lonely stretch of road just before one saw the walls around the property there sooner the roads were winter poor and in daylight it would have been mad enough to drive at this speed but i kept it up they had a head start of what twenty minutes thirty thirty was too long id never make that up i narrowly missed a ewe wandering across the road and again someone on a bicycle who yelled imprecations in my wake i prayed i wouldnt meet anything larger at this speed i couldnt stop in time is it worth taking your life in your hands i had no answer to that would i have agreed to carry a message to arthurs brother if id been able to look ahead into the future i had no answer to that either i was within five miles of bartons cursing under my breath knowing i was too late far too late and then over the soft murmur of the rolls motor i heard shots echoing across the fields id been close to the fighting id fired side arms myself i could recognize their sharp reports gripping the wheel hard to hold back my fears i tried to determine where the sounds had come from to my rightand surely just ahead but to my right was only a tangle of briars and dead stalks of last summers wildflowers and on the far side of that out of range of my headlamps the flat blackness of what appeared to be a fallow hop field i lifted my foot from the accelerator prepared to find the graham motorcar stopped in the middle of the road and i put out my hand for the brake to keep myself from plowing into it but the road ahead was empty i was about to pick up speed again when peering through the windscreen i noticed that beside me the tall winterdry brush along the verge had been flatted by something heavy passing over them and crushing them i hadnt even had time to react to that when from the same direction i caught the sound of raised voices angry and rough barely a minute had passed since id heard those first shots and now there were two more in rapid succession hardly distinguishable and someone cried out in anguish chapter twenty i was already braking hard with all my strength weaving across the road and slewing sideways as the motorcar came to a halt that felt as if it had jarred my very teeth peregrine had walked away from the asylumhe could have remembered this stretch pausing only to pick up the torch that had been sliding wildly about beneath my feet i was out of the motorcar and running toward the hop field but the torchs beam was weak and i had to concentrate on the broken stalks which caught at my ankles and threatened to pitch me headlong then i reached the plowed ground stiff with frost and at last could cast my light toward the dark quiet shape that was a motorcar barely silhouetted against the sky in the silence i could hear my own labored breathing and the muffled sound of my boots as i ran and from somewhere what i thought was someone weeping at last my torch illuminated the shining metalwork of the graham rolls the motor still ticking over but there was no sign of jonathan or peregrine or the policemen something was glittering in the rear seat and i lifted the light for a better look it caught the buttons of a constables uniform the man didnt stir and i could see as i came closer that he was slumped to one side as if he were badly hurt oh peregrinewhy didnt you trust me but he had never been taught trust i shone my light full in the constables face and realized that he was unconscious his jaw slack i could hardly see his features for the spreading mask of blood almost black in this light that ran down from a long furrow at his temple and dripped onto his tunic his helmet was askew knocked to one side strap dangling it was constable mason i pulled off my driving gloves and probed the wound touching bone i could even see it briefly whiteand not splintered four bullets thats what peregrine had said he had four shots and he could kill three other people before he turned the pistol on himself the poor unsuspecting constable mason must have been the first victim but peregrine had missed his shot thank god and the man would live where were the others i reached into the motorcar for the headlamp switch and suddenly there was a brightness that opened up the night the other constable was just ahead of the motorcar perhaps ten feet from the bonnet as if hed been trying to follow his attacker he lay on his face not moving i bent over him he was dead there was nothing more to be done for him i moved on that made two where was jonathan where was peregrine i turned to scan the fan of light my own shadow cast like a black monster far ahead of me something moved then rose from the ground hunched over as if in pain and then the figure dashed out of the glow of the motorcars headlamps into darkness peregrine i cried no please wait but he was gone vanished into the night i ran forward to where id first seen him and there was jonathan lying on his side on the ground his military greatcoat almost blending into the trampled earth around him one arm was flung across his face concealing it falling to my knees beside him i gently lifted it and he rolled over onto his back with a grunt that told me he was still alive more than anything at that moment i wished i could bring mr appleby here and make him look at the consequences of his spiteful telephone call i wanted him to see what men do to each other when goaded beyond what they could bear i ran my hands over jonathans chest looking for a wound and i found it bleeding freely but not heavily pulling off my scarf i wadded it in a ball unbuttoned his coat and then his tunic i shoved the scarf against his shirt jamming it as best i could against the place where the bleeding was heaviest then buttoned the tunic over it to hold it in place as i worked i realized that something was hurting my knee and looked down there was jonathans service revolverit had been drawn and was lying under him he must have tried to defend himself and the two unarmed constables i had to get these men to a doctor as quickly as possible and there was no one to help me i sprang to my feet trying to judge whether i could bring the motorcar this far without bogging down and how best to loop back to the road and only then did i notice that someone else was lying in the field outside the perimeter of the headlamps reach i could only make out the shape of a mans boot and a lump beyond it that was his body i blinked peregrine hadnt made it to safety after all as i hurried toward where he lay in a crumpled heap wounded or dead i knew that jonathan wouldnt have missed his own shot he was too good a soldier for that then i was beside him kneeling in the hard earth again calling his name his face was in deep shadow but as i shone my torch into it his eyelids fluttered and he said quite clearly diana its bess crawford peregrine so it is he winced and lay still i could smell burnt wool sharp and strong setting down the torch to search for a wound i felt blood warm on my hands on both sides of his shoulder high up the bullet must have gone through to get to his coat buttons i had to turn him over he cried out and said something i couldnt catch his breathing was fast but steady and there was no froth of blood on his lips that i could see i didnt know whether to be relieved or dismayed that he would live i rocked back on my heels thinking i could do nothing more here in the dark without bandages or good light but where to find help peregrine had told me once that there was only a skeleton medical staff at the asylum in the evening would anyone come back with me it would take too long to drive to owlhurst and bring dr philips here the best i could do was try to ease the motorcar forward and somehow manage to get everyone in it beside me peregrine stirred watch i took his hand its bess crawford peregrine can you stand if i help you can you get to your feet wheres my brother his voice was terse angry just there hes badly hurt please peregrine you must help me he frowned dark lines across his forehead giving him a sinister look in the torchs light id seen the same shadows once in his sickroom no i turned and hurried back to the motorcar it was my only hope now when i got there i looked at constable mason he was awake his eyes wide and frightened in the light of my torch i didnt think he knew where he was and proof of that came quickly as he lost consciousness again no help there i got behind the wheel and just barely touching the accelerator i felt the tires bite and the motorcar move forward thank god a month or so earlier and the earth would have been soft enough that i wouldnt have made it id have to leave the other constable it would be nearly impossible to get the two living men into the motorcar much less a dead man but i guided the car toward him and examined him again to be certain as i knelt there beside him the torch in my hand died i thought oh god what next a mans voice broke the silence from some distance away and i nearly leapt out of my skin whats happened i heard shots it sounded a little like roberts voice the baritone of a big man i couldnt see him but he could see me quite clearly i crouched by the constable a frisson of uncertainty running through me what was he doing here robert is that you to my left peregrine tried to shout something and i was momentarily distracted i sayyou therewhats going on the man called again closer this time and then something was hurtling toward me from outside the rim of light i could hear it coming breathing hard and as i got to my feet braced to meet it a large dog rushed up tongue lolling barking as if to say look what ive discovered its owner stepped into the edge of the motorcars headlamps and stopped staring he carried a shotgun broken over his arm whats going on here is that a policeman id never seen the man before relief washed over me and i could almost feel my heart slowing to its normal rhythm i was driving by when i heard the shots i said my own motorcar is on the road im a nursethese men are badly hurt can you help me get them to a doctor a nurse from bartons he sounded skeptical of coursei wasnt in uniform no owlhurst please we mustnt waste time he walked nearer and i could see he was a farmer broad shouldered and strong enough to help me lift a wounded man is that one dead he asked sadly yes we must leave him for now but there are two others i gestured in the direction of jonathan and peregrine the dog disturbed by the scent of so much blood was frisking around whining now the farmer called him off and waited while i got back behind the wheel as he glimpsed constable mason in the rear he said in a shocked voice theres another policeman i didnt answer him driving the vehicle gingerly forward again i came to where jonathan was lying peregrine just beyond him the farmer followed on foot peregrine was conscious though in great pain trying to raise himself and look the stranger over its all right i said getting out once more can you stand between us we ought to be able to help you he managed it after a fashion with support i thought the shot had struck his collarbone or his shoulder for there was no touching him on that side he wasnt coughing which was a good sign still his face was a ghostly white in the light of the headlamps as we got him to his feet and he walked the short distance to the motorcar clinging to my good arm the pain must have been excruciating each step jarring the wound putting him into the rear seat beside constable mason was difficult but peregrine accepted the situation in grim silence his jaw set for the first time i could see a resemblance to arthur in his last hours that same will reflected in his brothers taut face paring all emotion down to one intense resolve mason was awake again trying to make sense of what was happening and who we were i told him i would explain when there was time jonathan was another matter there would be no help from him i quickly shoved his revolver into his greatcoat pocket out of sight and explained to the farmer what he must do i heard something behind me and whirled in time to see constable mason nearly tumble out of the motorcar catch himself and while he was still doubled over vomit violently before shambling unsteadily toward us his sense of duty stronger than his dizziness with his help we settled jonathans limp body into the front seat and shut the door constable mason leaned heavily against the wing breathing hard from the exertion i felt like joining him there every muscle in my body complaining from the effort id made thank god my arm had healed sufficiently as i got in beside jonathan i studied his face i didnt like the look of him but all i could do was to make certain the scarf was still pressed in place i thought the bleeding had stabilized but that could be bad news not good constable mason roused himself and joined peregrine in the rear seat inadvertently jarring him as he tried clumsily to climb inside i heard peregrine swear fiercely under his breath hed said very little since id found him i think he knew there would be no escape now and was resigning himself to his fate turning to the farmer i said please you must follow me in my motorcarout there on the road we must go to owlhurst for an instant i thought he was about to refuse me then he said who shot these men i told him truthfully i dont know he nodded whistling up the dog and went striding across the trampled field toward the road it was a bumpy ride making a looping circle across the field and back to the verge where this motorcar had run off into the underbrush i could hear constable mason breathing hard and peregrine grunting through clenched teeth on the road the farmer was straightening up melindas vehicle and making room for me to pass the dogs head was turned toward us ears pricked as if making certain we were coming sorry i said im so sorry as we bounced hard back onto the road and then i was gunning the motor overtaking melinda crawfords motorcar heading to owlhurst in a matter of minutes we were flying past the brightly lit asylum almost blindingly bright in the moonless night and then it was gone and i was gritting my teeth as i tried to avoid the worst of the dips and ridges of the unmade surface i couldnt help remembering how close id come to tumbling out of the dogcart when the wheels went off the road wondering if any of my passengers would make it back alive if i overturned us but time was critical and casting a glance whenever i dared at jonathans gray face i made the best time i could twice behind me i heard constable mason retching as he leaned out his window peregrine asked at one point about jonathan is he still alive and all i could do was nod my head behind us the crawford motorcar kept pace with the farmer at the wheel its headlamps lighting up our interior sending shadows dancing around us jonathans breathing was suspiciously quieter i sent up a silent prayer that we wouldnt encounter anything out herea wandering dog a man walking home from a pub someone on a horse a lorry it was a narrow road with little space to overtake constable mason said ive the devil of a headache and then to me i dont remember you driving us i said nothing concentrating as we came flying into owlhurst it was a quiet time of night the road blessedly empty and i kept up my speed as we reached the cricket pitch and then we were coming up on the bells by the garden gate was the graham dogcart and two men were just coming out of the pub door staring at us as we passed i almost didnt make the turning at the church slowing in the nick of time and then there was the doctors surgery just ahead and i felt like crying with relief i came to as gentle a stop as possible and was out my door running toward the house calling for dr philips he must have been just finishing his dinner a serviette still in his hand surprise on his face as he recognized me and then he saw the crawford motorcar pulling in just behind the grahams what in the name of godhas there been an accident i have three badly wounded people with megunshots i listed their symptoms quickly striving to leave nothing out the worst case is jonathan graham im so afraid hes bleeding internally even as i was describing the situation we were walking quickly toward the vehicle the farmer seemed to know dr philips for i saw him nod as he and his dog approached we took jonathan in first and dr philips was already at work on him as the farmerid finally asked him his name and hed told me it was batemanhelped first constable mason and then peregrine into the surgery mr bateman said as we settled mason with a pillow and a basin for the nausea will someone please tell me whats happening two army officers two policemen lets make certain they survive i said cutting him off then well worry about what happened we dealt with peregrine next and as i closed his room door i could see that mr bateman was going to cling to me like a leech until he got his answers something had to be done about that i looked at him really saw him for the first time a worried man blood on his hands and the sleeves of his coat and in a smear across his face i was suddenly reminded of peregrines hands in the offal at the butchers shop in rochester we wouldnt have made it to owlhurst without mr bateman but i didnt want to begin explanations until i was certain myself what had happened on the road still there was one more service he could provide if he was willing by that time i hoped id be able to question peregrine or jonathan would you mind terribly going to fetch lieutenant grahams mother dont frighten her but his condition israther critical and it might be as well to summon the rector in the event i let my voice trail off from his expression i got the feeling that mr bateman knew the rector and he most certainly recognized the graham name but i gave him the necessary directions anyway and for a mercy he took himself off the dog dancing around his legs as if eager to be out of the surgery and into the night air again when i looked in on him next constable mason was beginning to feel a little better and he insisted that he should be given a chair so that he could sit in peregrines room on duty but then he retched again rather spoiling the effect of his claim to be quite recovered and he lay back shutting his eyes against the lightheadedness sweeping him mr graham isnt going anywhere i assured him as i closed his door well be giving him a sedative shortly it will be more effective than a dozen constables dr philips and i worked feverishly for a quarter of an hour i was right about constable masons concussion he could remember his name but he was clearly seeing double when i held up two fingers and he had no idea what had happened on the road he asked to speak to constable whiting but before i could answer that he had drowsed off and i had trouble waking him again peregrine had a fractured clavicle close to where it met the shoulder and he lay there against his pillows his eyes closed to avoid being questioned as dr philips gave him something for pain and strapped the shoulder and the left arm to peregrines chest it was a clean wound and barring infection he would be all right jonathan was far more seriously injured with the likelihood that the bullet had nicked a vein causing internal bleeding it was still lodged somewhere in his chest and the broken ribs made breathing difficult he was awake stoically following our movements but saying nothing until dr philips left the room are mason and whiting dead he didnt wait for me to answer him i shot them all he managed to add ive been recalled to join my regiment i wont survive france this time it was best to rid us of peregrine once and for all forfor mothers sake his voice faltered at the end realizing that he had used arthurs own words id seen the revolver where he must have dropped it as he fell id shoved it in his greatcoat pocket before we attempted to lift him but peregrine too had been armed peregrine is alive hell live i responded dr philips is with him now jonathan swore with feeling i want to confess i want you to write my confession down word for word let the doctor witness it youre in no condition i want to confess to keep him quiet i said yes all right ill fetch pen and paper for you i left the room and ran into dr philips in the passage outside i wish you would tell me what this is about and did i hear you call that other officer peregrine peregrine graham whats he doing in uniform i thought i took a deep breath the two constables were taking him back to the asylum something happened only a few miles from therethat field at the bend do you know it im not sure if peregrineor jonathansuffice it to say before they reached bartons they went off the road and somehow someone began shooting it was all over when i got there and what in hells name were you doing i followed the graham motorcar from a friends house where peregrine was taken into custody but hed been falsely accused they had no business taking him back there hes a dangerous man bess everyone said so when he escaped that he shouldnt be approached i must send for inspector howard dr philipshes been sedated hes not likely to harm anyone there was a pistol in his greatcoat pocket and a hole there where it had been fired right through the cloth ive taken the pistol and locked it in my desk oh dear god let me see it i want to see how many shots are left three ive already looked but i broke off frowning did youdid you think to look at jonathans revolver he handed it to me he said four shots had been fired he was right but that made five and id only heard four dr philips was saying we should bring mrs graham here as soon as possible and find the rector im transferring jonathan graham to hospital in cranbrook shell want to go with him i cant probe for that bullet here if he can survive the journey they just might save him it will be touch and go ive sent for them well done i went on to dr philipss office where i quickly found pen and paper and then i looked in on peregrine the sedative was already working his eyes were closed his mouth a tight line of pain and despair touching his hand i said urgently peregrine what happened out there on the road tonight you must tell mewho did you shoot was it jonathan he opened his eyes as i spoke then he turned his face to the wall and wouldnt meet my gaze listen to me jonathan has confessed to trying to kill the two constables and you is it true he may be dying i need to know there was no answer you fired your pistol while it was still in your pocket i reached for his greatcoat lying across a chairs back and showed the blackened hole to him look heres proof i wont go back to the asylum he said finally i cant face it id rather be hanged constable mason will be all right in a daytwo hell be able to speak to inspector howard you might as well tell me the truth its the only way i can help you mason was the first to go down he wont know what happened after that i shot jonathan he said and something in the timbre of his voice rang true but that doesnt make sense he wasnt shot in the back while he was drivingand he couldnt have walked that far from the motorcar hurt as he was he wouldnt answer peregrine i promise you you wont go back there i could read the bleakness in his eyes as he replied bess you nearly worked a miracle im grateful truly but i cant walk out of here i stood up just now and tried and it was hopeless someone has taken my pistol and so i cant use it on myself ill have to stay and face them theres nothing more we can do i didnt try to argue but i was far from giving up my father had always said i was as stubborn as a camel ive sent for mrs graham shell be here shortly i thought youd prefer to know that and then i went back to jonathan hoping for a little time before his mother arrived jonathan was waiting for me as i opened the door to his room when he saw the paper and pen in my hands he said hurry and so i sat there beside another graham son this time instead of writing a letter home i was taking down a confession of murder it was brief no details just the stark facts when id finished he held out his hand for the pen to sign i said did you kill lily mercer jonathan i know it wasnt peregrine arthur knew that too its what he meant by his message to you surelysurely if youre confessing to these deaths you will want to tell me the truth of that one as well peregrine doesnt deserve to return to bartons hes suffered enough set him free while you can but he lay there in stony silence his hand shaking a little as he reached a second time for the pen what was it about these graham men stubbornly silent when they might set the record straight first arthur and now jonathan and even peregrine i watched him sign the confession his signature was a scrawl but legible enough to suffice take it to inspector howard dont let my mother see it it would be a cruelty i agreed and was about to leave when he said let it be finished it cant be finished if peregrine graham is sent back to that place you never went there did you but arthur did and still he said nothing did nothing what did he mean when he said hed lied for his mothers sake did you lie as well was she the one who killed lily mercer and blamed peregrine goaded he said god no damn you dont even suggest such a thing then why did you have to lie for her sake i lied because the police were there and they frightened her shed been crying when they asked me about the pocketknife i told them that it was peregrines that none of us ever touched it because it was left to him by his father i didnt knowi was ten i didnt understand what it was i was doing but that must have meant he knew who had had possession of that knife take the papergo he was insistent the urgency reflected in his eyes i looked at the man lying on the cot he hadnt confessed until hed realized peregrine was still alive with peregrine dead the police would easily have come to the conclusion that the dangerous lunatic had run amok they might still feel that way and peregrine was claiming hed shot jonathanbut not the policemen if he wanted to hang why not admit to three people then where was the need for jonathan to take the blame it was dark out there in the field when hed run off the road why hadnt jonathan left the motorcars headlamps burning so that the other occupants of the motorcar couldnt see what hed seenthat someone else had been there and the graham dogcart was standing in the yard of the bells it had been used tonight i said this confession is a lie who did you meet on the road tonight he shut his eyes not answering me i saw him running awayi thought at first it was peregrine but peregrine was already down wasnt he he fired at someone and missed while you were struggling for control of your own revolver thats why i thought id only heard four shots it wasnt peregrine who wounded you it was timothy wasnt it and youre still protecting him how many people must he kill before hes stopped my brotherhes my brother so is peregrine and you left him to the horrors of an asylum i took a deep breath feeling a wave of exhaustion sweep over me there was only one other thing i wanted to know but jonathan was having difficulty breathing and i moved his pillows to make him more comfortable dr philips was at the door saying the ambulance is on its way i turned to jonathan will you at least tell me what arthur had done that distressed him so i brought his message someone spoke from just behind dr philips it was mrs graham her face starkly pale her gaze on jonathan he didnt confide in you after all i was so sure he had the police asked him if peregrine had ever been violent before and arthur answered that we were all afraid of him arthur had been standing outside the parlor where the police were questioning me he knew what had been said he knew id claimed that id found that same knife deep in my pillow one night it was a large pocketknife a mans the police were appalled i knew they would be arthur saw that i was close to breaking down and he lied to make them leave me alone two boys barely understanding what was happening around them telling lies because they were afraid confused and trying to please the adults who were interrogating them and with their words damning their half brother to a lifetime in a madhouse but theyd never been taught to think of him as their brother had they mrs graham had purposely kept them apart what did timothy tell the police she took a deep breath he told the police that peregrine had once threatened to carve him like a christmas goose with that same knife i wanted to bury my face in my hands and cry on the lies of these three children their mother had been able to protect her own son and keep him safe all these years even knowing him for what he was and no one had given a thought to peregrine he was the outcast he was the eldest and this woman had convinced herself that in the end his life would not have amounted to much anyway she couldnt have loved robert that much but she had loved timothy and timothy was only nine at the time why would timothy wish to kill lily apparently that night she saw his foot after his bath jonathan was there later when she told timothya child mind youthat it was ugly and hairy and useless he never showed that foot to anyone she told him it was the devils club and he was the devils spawn when i heard that i felt nothing for her i owed her nothing her voice was harsh cold did he understanddid he realize he was killing her ive never asked him she came into the room and took her sons hand she simply held it and told him she loved him that nothing else mattered to her but that i slipped away and in the passage came facetoface with robert douglas he stood there stark anguish in his eyes you can go in i said gently he shook his head no i loved him as my own arthur too but they were ambroses sons it was an admission in his own fashion that hed protected timothy because the last graham son was his and that explained so much the love child the deformed child the child of guilt no wonder mrs graham had guarded him so fiercely i turned away to allow him the privacy to grieve and went to stand beside peregrines bed i could hear them working with jonathan preparing him for the journey to cranbrook my training told me he wouldnt make it mr bateman the man from the hop fields came to the doorway i wish someone would explain whats happened he said beginning to show signs of angry frustration i turned to ask him to be patient a little longer just as a voice beyond him said let me try it was simon brandon youre the devil to keep up with he went on plaintively to me ive searched half of kent for you why did you have my poor watcher arrested he was there to keep an eye on you and make certain you were safe youre covered in blood and theres a dead policeman in a field not far from owlhurst and three men here in the surgery whove been shot and then he asked in a lighter tone did you do it bess no dont answer that i dont want to know he gave me a weary smile rattled i said focusing on one word your watcher buti thought someone else had hired him why dont you ever tell me these things he swore under his breath and took away the man and his patient dog as i was shutting the door again i saw mr montgomery hurrying by on his way to jonathans room robert realizing what that must mean followed him but so far no one had fetched inspector howard i said fiercely to peregrine you must listen to me if you go on saying you shot jonathan theyll believe you theyll want to wait until theyve retrieved that bullet and know if it was from your weapon or jonathans revolver he gave me a twisted smile why should i lie because you dont want to go back to bartons but i thinkim nearly sureyou were aiming at someone else we must clear that up dont you see youve trusted me this far but it was a measure of what hed suffered there that peregrine would rather hang than go back to bartons i could feel his resistance like a stone wall i still had jonathans confession in my hands i couldnt rip it up until i was sure it couldnt have been an hour since id found the graham car in that field but once jonathan was in an ambulance on his way to cranbrook dr philips would have time to remember inspector howard and then it would be too late clutching at straws i said peregrine what am i to tell diana he lay there drowsy from the sedative thinking it over i wanted to hurry him but all i could do was wait and then he said in a dead voice that concealed whatever it was he was feelinglove hate disillusion grief i couldnt telltimothy timothy came out of nowhere he was suddenly therein the middle of the roadand when jonathan stopped he walked up to the window he said something to his brotheri think it was you cant do this jonathanand jonathan got out to talk to him all at once there was a scuffle and timothy had jonathans revolver without a word he just turned and shot mason after that it was chaos jonathan threw himself back behind the wheel and rammed the motorcar into the field when he should have run his brother down timothy followed us and the other policeman got out trying to reason with him and timothy shot him as well jonathan said to me run and i ran for the shadows just as jonathan switched off the headlamps timothy came after me and jonathan after him they fought and i fired at timothy as soon as i had a clear shot jonathans revolver went off at the same time i thought id hit timothy but it was jonathan who went down timothy cried out dropped to his knees beside his brother before i could move he stood up again and deliberately shot me i struck my shoulder as i fell and thats the last thing i remember until i saw you there i couldnt understand why youd come i was afraid timothy might shoot you as well i shivered remembering how hed tried to shout a warning and id misunderstood it id believed he was running away but it was timothy id seen the brothers were nearly the same height the same build carefully folding jonathans confession i thrust it into my pocket dr philips came in he said to me quietly i dont suppose peregrine graham can understand whats happening but he ought to go with jonathan to hospital in cranbrook do i need a police escort theyll want to know an escort i went on briskly before peregrine could speak mr graham will be represented by his solicitors in london and theyll be assuming all responsibility for his welfare and if his solicitors refused i knew a firm that would take him on as for comprehending his circumstances you can tell him yourself whats expected of him dr philips stared at me and then said slowly to peregrine are you aware of what im saying mr graham peregrine responded his voice thick with sleep his eyes closed i wouldnt argue with her if i were you it does no good dr philips gestured for me to follow him into his office where we couldnt be heard madmen can sound perfectly sane some of the time he warned he isnt mad any more than ted booker was mad i just looked in on constable mason he told me that someone by the name of timothy shot him does he think peregrine is timothy of course not timothy graham stopped the motorcar tonight before it could reach bartons he didnt mean to shoot jonathan but he did intend to kill the others before he could say anything more down the passage we heard the door to jonathans room open and mrs graham came out leaning heavily on the rectors arm she was in tears such grief in her face that i pitied her and i knew that jonathan wouldnt travel to cranbrook after all robert followed her and i thought about what was to come the next blow to fall when inspector howard had been summoned as soon as theyd passed the office on their way out the far door into the cold night dr philips went quickly to jonathan to do what needed to be done i leaned against a chair too tired to think i had a decision to make and i wasnt sure i was clearheaded enough to do it jonathans confession would only muddy the waters it wasnt true for one thing and for another it was imperative now to speak to inspector howard before mrs graham could find another way to subvert justice but i would keep it i owed jonathan that simon came looking for me just then saying mr bateman has gone home i took him in mrs crawfords motorcar what do we do about that poor constable lying in a field i was just coming to that ill have to speak to inspector howard he should have been here before jonathan died butbut i took a deep breath but it was just as well constable mason and peregrine graham will live they can tell him what happened do you want a cup of tea first you look out on your feet i shook my head ill just find my coat i cant remember now where i left it but it was on the rack in the passage where i must have flung it as we arrived in such a rush there was blood on it as well crusted over now simon helped me into it then said it was never peregrine was it why are you so sure i asked as we walked out of the surgery and i looked up at the stars wishing that i were back on britannic and none of this had ever happened but no i couldnt wish that for peregrine would still be shut up in a madhouse youre a damned good judge of human nature he said we had started toward the police station just as the ambulance arrived to carry the wounded and the dead to cranbrook i helped to settle peregrine on the stretcher although he regarded the attendants with suspicion and small wonder at the last he put out a hand and i took it knowing it was a promise between us that all would be well he didnt say anything he didnt need to we were watching the ambulance make the turning at the church in the direction of cranbrook when we heard someone calling for dr philips it was the rector running toward us with coattails flapping and his hat gone he was ashen in the ambulance headlamps as they swept over him and we hurried to meet him dr philips simon and i its mrs graham i began shed been on the verge of collapse and i was fairly certain the rector would be hopeless in the face of that but id misjudged him i was on my way back to the rectory he said disjointedly susan had taken mrs graham to her roommr douglas is with her timothyi went to comfort him and couldnt find himand just nowhestimothy is hanging from a tree in the churchyard one of those ancient trees that stood by the wall where id seen robert douglas bring mrs graham the news that peregrine had escaped from the asylum we rushed to follow the rector and then simon was there with his knife and we could cut timothy down it was too late he must have gone out as soon as he saw his mother return home with the news about jonathan my first thought was for mrs graham and robert and then for peregrine dr philips said my god as if echoing my thought we took timothy to the doctors surgery and then the rector and the doctor went together to hand a grieving mother the final blow and robert douglas how would he face the death of his own child as he had always done in a crisiswith silence i couldnt go with them i didnt think mrs graham would want to see me now any more than i wished to see her instead i stood there in the room where jonathan had died looking down into the face of his brother a murderer yet it was unmarked by anything hed done as if his conscience had always been clear hed worn a coatrather like an officers greatcoatto the tree to throw the rope over a heavy bough and tie the end to the bole of the tree hed even brought a stool with him to stand on and then hed folded his coat and set it aside before putting the noose around his neck id brought the coat back to the surgery with us and reached for it now to cover his face it was then that i saw the tear in the sleeve near the shoulder i touched it gently a bullet had passed through the thick fabric just there i opened timothys shirt and looked at his arm here was a bloody crease where the shot had grazed the skin as well it had hurt but it would have healed on its own without anyone else the wiser now it was proof that hed been on the road near bartons tonight simon had come in and was saying theres something in his hand i looked down praying it was a note a message somethingbut it was too small only a square clenched in his palm hardly noticeable when i took it out to unfold it i saw with shock that it was nothing more than a list of names and at the top was lily mercer at the bottom just below ted booker was scrawled in anguish my brother i refolded the note and put it back where id found it simon nodded best that way he said the police theres something i must do first i said its important will you wait yes i walked alone toward the church as i came to the west door in the distance carrying on the quiet night air i heard one of the owls call from the wood that had given this place its name it was cold as the grave inside and dark as death i could just see my way i remembered mr montgomery in the organ loft repairing his precious church he would be on a ladder tomorrow looking for new tasks to keep his mind off the suffering hed witnessed i came to a halt in front of the memorial to arthur this time i put my fingers out to touch the brass plaque running them along the words engraved there feeling the sharp edges of letters that spelled out the dates of a mans life and death but not the sum of the man himself he had tried once to visit peregrine in the asylum and been turned away it was more than anyone else had done hed told the staff to allow peregrine to have books because as the oldest of his three brothers he remembered a time when peregrine was normal and bright he had lied for his mothers sake but at the end of his life he couldnt go on lying and yet hed trusted to jonathan to see matters right he hadnt put his plea on paper to be shown to lady parsons or the police he hadnt had the courage to stand up for peregrine in the face of family loyalty but hed hoped that jonathan mightjonathan the unfeeling brother who might find it easier to step forward on his behalf it could be argued that small boys couldnt have changed what was happening to peregrine that night in london or here in owlhurst even with the best will in the world and none of them had witnessed what their mother had done to sear peregrines guilt into his mind they had lied for her sake that was all they knew and yet when they were older when they could understand what their mother had done to peregrine they had never questioned her actions or their role in what had happened theyd simply turned their backs on the truth they had been well taught to shield timothy what if arthur had survived the war and asked me again to marry him even with one leg if id said yes id have believed like everyone else that peregrine was a murderer and arthur would have let me believe that that was what hurt the most that i would have been drawn into the conspiracy of silence unwittingly and therefore willingly hed had feet of clay after all i had been fond of the man i thought arthur graham was i had mourned him with my whole heart visiting kent had brought him closer for a short time and id been grateful for that now being here made saying farewell easier i dropped my hand from the memorial brass standing there for a moment longer goodbye arthur i said softly and turned away simon brandon was waiting for me at the church door he didnt say anything until we had reached the police station tucked away on a side street he must have had some good in him bess or you couldnt have cared for him the way you did he said offering what comfort he could for a time i wanted to believe that i answered you couldnt help but like him but matron was right we know them for such a brief space and so they are ours to heal but not ours to love chapter twentyone somewhere in france march i had come to the conclusion that french rain was worse than any otherbarring of course the monsoons of indiaand i was feeling a little down at the end of another long day at a forward dressing station we had had rather severe cases three possible amputations and one of pneumonia sandwiched between more trench foot than i ever hope to see again in my lifetime i had been sent back to france and in some ways i was very glad id been a little uneasy on the crossing remembering too much and when my feet touched the solid stone of the quay i drew a long breath of relief too soon to find the sea friendly again i told myself the memories of britannic were still too fresh slipping and sliding through the mud as i made my way to my quarters i waved to stretcher bearers huddling under a tent flap trying to smoke they must be i thought as tired as i am during the day someone had brought up the mailletters were lying on my cot blanket still damp from the weather and i pounced on them like a hungry cat on a handy mouse letters from home letters from the front letters from egypt and india i hadnt had anything for so long that id been wondering if anyone knew where i waswed been moved four times in the six weeks id been here and the post was never dependable as it was excited i completely forgot how id been longing for a cup of tea to warm me and i sat there devouring each letter in its turn between a letter from the colonel sahib and one from dr philips in owlhurst i discovered a small postcard on the front was a penandink sketch of the pavilion at brighton i turned it over quickly and saw dianas bold penmanship racing across the card just as she raced through life i hugged it for a moment glad to know she was well then read the message dear heart this is brighton as if you didnt know i am seeing it through new eyes the young man with me sends his very best love and i am green with jealousy the doctors werent certain he was ready for france and so he is being sent to dover castle after his training how clever of them how convenient for me hes taking over the dower house in owlhurst and you can write him there with much love diana the dower house where the eldest son lived when he married it was his way of telling me just how much hed healed already a nursing sister had written to me for him as soon as peregrines name was cleared adding that he wasnt sure where he would go on leaving hospitalhe couldnt bear to set foot in the graham house even though his stepmother had been sent back to her family in disgrace i picked up the card again beneath dianas signature was a handwriting i didnt know but a name i did god keep you safe out there dear girl ever peregrine i looked out at the cold dismal rain my heart sang for both of them and suddenly i wasnt tired any longer i was crying with joy about the author charles todd is the author of eleven ian rutledge mysteriesa matter of justice a pale horse a false
