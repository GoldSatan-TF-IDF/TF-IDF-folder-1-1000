marion lennox bachelor cure the third book in the prescription love series prologue mike llewellyn pushed the dark curls out of his eyes and looked wildly around him the mountains where he lived had always seemed his friends and heaven knew he stood in need of friends now his bony shoulders trembled and his hands clenched into fists of helplessness sixteen years old was too young an age to face this the doctor was here now but mike knew in his heart that it was too late over and over the doctors words played in his mind you should have called me sooner you stupid boy dont you realize your mothers dying yes he did know and the accusation was unfair hed phoned over and over again but the doctors wife hadnt helped a bit hes out thats all i know dont ask me where he is hes just out after scores of frantic phone calls the whole district had started searching but the locals knew what the doctor would be doing hed be somewhere with a woman who wasnt his wife and hed probably be drunk the valleys only doctor would have no intention of being found in the end the doctor had arrived back at the surgery full of drunken bluster saying hed had his radio on all the time and no one had called him liar the mans a liar mike said to the mountains and tears of frustration and rage welled behind his eyes he blinked them back but others came fast to replace them and at that moment he made himself a silent vow it was a promise he made to nothing but the mountains but it was a vow he intended to keep for the rest of his life ill be a doctor myself he swore ill be the best doctor i can make myself and ill come back here and work and thats all im going to do no womans ever going to interfere with my work theres no way anyone else in this place will die like thisnot if i can help it no matter what happens now and then he turned to face what was happening inside he turned to face the emptiness of his future chapter one there was a girl in red stilettos lying in henry westcotts barn or rather she was lying under henry westcotts pig mike had met the police car at the gate theres someone mucking around at henrys place the sergeant had told him curtly jacob saw the light from his place want to back us upgive us a bit more manpower he didnt jacob jeffries was a rifletoting bonehead and the thought of making a posse with him was enough to make mike queasy still sergeant morris was the only policeman in the district and hed helped mike out of tight spots in the past checking deserted farmhouses for thieves was risky and jacob might look tough but given any real danger hed run a mile so hed come leaving strop guarding his precious aston martin but now mike stopped dead as the police sergeant threw open the barn door and flooded the place with light theyd been expecting petty thieves or maybe even henry himself but they certainly hadnt been expecting this the girl was lying flat in the straw her arm immersed to the elbow in pig she was youngin her twenties from the look of herslightly built and fiery fiery yes definitely fiery she was practically all scarlet the girl was wearing a tiny tightfitting crimson skirt the slim legs stretched out behind her on the straw were clad in clear stockings with a crimson seam and her feet were clad in red stilettos she was wearing a white blouse but her flaming curls were tumbling about her shoulders and hiding most of it so he could mostly see just legs and redness mike couldnt see her face her face was pressed into the straw and the rest of her was hidden by pig what on earth ok youre covered stand up slow then raise your hands over your shoulders unlike mike and sergeant morris jacob knew exactly what to do hed seen it on the telly hed been expecting criminals and jacob didnt change his mind fast be careful the sergeant had told him before hed flung open the door whoevers inside could be armed so jacob was in threat mode dont even think about producing a gun he barked waving his rifle in the direction of the pig and the wonderful red stilettos throw down any weapons jacob mike said faintly shut up he was the first to move the girl had been using a kerosene lamp to see by but sergeant morris had a heavy searchlight which was now flooding the barn with light the sergeant stood shocked into stillness jacob waved his gun while he tried to figure things out and mike walked forward to see what was happening the girls face was turned away from him on the straw he stepped over her and crouched so he could see more she had a great face she had gorgeous clear skin and big green eyes and a slash of crimson lipstick the exact shade of those ridiculous shoes her face was contorted in agony the girl had a bucket of soapy water beside her which told its own story he winced in sympathy ouch he knew what that was for mike had come out here tonight because henry westcott was missing believed dead he knew how fond henry westcott was of his pig and checking on doris was something he could do for an old man he was fond of hed visited doris the day before and he knew her time was near so the piglets were on their waysort of he winced again lifting the bucket he poured soapy water gently over the girls elbow as she penetrated the birth canal the girl gave a grunt of what might have been called gratitude her arm came out an inch or so to get some more lubrication and she went straight back in the pigs body heaved and the girl gave a sob of pain hell he didnt need to be told what was happening here the pigs belly was so swollen there had to be more than half a dozen piglets trying to get out but now something was clearly obstructing the birth canal the girl was trying to clear it and it was no wonder she looked like she was in pain every time the sow had a contraction massive muscles would be squeezing this girls arm with power beyond endurance i said stand up jacob barked behind them but he was ignored the police sergeant sighed and lifted jacobs rifle so it wasnt pointing downwards but the girl didnt care she was only intent on one thing the pig mike could only admire her singlemindedness once when hed been a junior resident in a large teaching hospital hed been watching open heart surgery when the fire alarm had sounded and the smell of smoke had wafted through theatre the hospital staff had reacted in wellordered panic but the surgeon had kept right on operating forget the alarm hed growled you can have any fire you like but not until i have this closed that determination was what he saw again in this girls face she was in pain and jacobs threats must have got through to her but she was concentrating on one thing and one thing onlyclearing the birth canal there was nothing he could do to help there certainly wasnt room in the birth canal for two of them talk me through it he said urgently his face almost touching the girls whats going wrong theres a piglet stuck she had a voice to match her face it was exhausted and painfilled but it was soft and lilting andgorgeous you can feel it a contraction hit doriss body strained in a massive movement of muscle and the girls body jerked sideways you cant do this he said savagely and he put his hands on her shoulders to try and draw her out hell shed break every bone in her arm no no i can feel a hoof leave me she shoved herself further forward more water she gasped he splashed a bit more water over her arm and then took the bar of soap and ran it around the vaginal entrance if he had time he had lubricants in the car i have it she whispered one two three dont muck me up now i have four hooves please doris hold the contractions i have to push what the therere four hooves coming down at once and the heads right back she muttered into the pig and he didnt know if she was talking to him or to herself its stuck like a cork i need to get it up i need to push another contraction it jerked tessas arm hauling her body with it she was so slight she had to be slight to succeed no man could get his arm into that canal cows maybe but not pigs bring the light over mike ordered his eyes not leaving the girls face there was agony written there but also sheer bloodyminded determination jacob go and get my bag from the car but whats happening it was taking jacob a long time to work out he was in on a birth rather than taking part in a criminal raid he sounded totally bewildered were having piglets mike said into the stillness at least i hope we are his hands came down and held the girls shoulders gripping hard letting her move as she willed but giving her support when she needed it so the pigs contractions stopped jerking her sideways he was trying to let her feel she wasnt alone it was all he could do and it wasnt enough he felt utterly helpless in the face of her pain who on earth was she he could feel the effort she was making once each contraction had passed she put everything she had into shoving the piglet forward upward and higher during the contraction she concentrated on holding it back and not letting her efforts be wasted he could feel her whole body straining she must know some obstetrics the only way to get the piglet out if it was firmly wedged was to push it back and turn it was she a vetin those stilettos and then he felt the piglet givea minuscule amount but he felt the girls body jerk forward and she gave a gasp of sheer relief turn damn you turn she muttered as her own body changed position please her shoulder twisted and her face screwed up the crimson lipstick looked almost surrealistic and then her shoulder twisted still more she gave a grunt of surprise and pain the sows body contracted in one huge mass of muscle and the girls arm came sliding out her hand was grasping one dead piglet the piglet slid limply onto the straw the girl shoved it away as if it was of no importanceas indeed it wasntand then she shoved her hand into the soapy water and moved again to reinsert it it wasnt needed the contraction didnt ease it became a rolling crescendo of muscle power and another piglet slid out onto the straw this one was alive it was followed by another it was as if a cork had been pulled from a champagne bottle doriss exhausted body heaved with every ounce of energy she had left and minutes later the girl was in the middle of a squirming bloody mass of living piglets five six seven eight live piglets mike was so stunned he could hardly count but doris knew as the last of the piglets was expelled from her body the massive sow moved her head around to see what shed finally produced the girl looked up into the sows face and grinnedheavens what a grin she tried to lift one of the piglets around to its mother her arm didnt work she gave a whimper of pain and the piglet fell back onto the straw mike gave her a long searching look and then he took over at least he could help with this he lifted each of the piglets in turn to lie under its mothers eye after three piglets the police sergeant finally came to his senses hed been watching in stunned silence playing the floodlight over the birth now he set his searchlight down on a bale of hay and started ferrying piglets which left mike to concentrate on the girl she was exhausted no longer needed she wilted she lay back on the hay and clutched her arm as if it might fall off her face was dead white her lipstick was smeared and there was the glimmer of tears in those gorgeous eyes jacob came pelting back into the barn with mikes bag and the crazy gun still waving ive got it ive got it he told them and skidded to a halt inches from mike mike put a hand up and took the gunfollowed by the bag thats great jacob he said calmly he lifted the dead piglet and put it into the big farmers hands now go and bury this before doris figures its alive and starts protecting it why the hell jacob stared down at the battered little body lying in his hands we still dont know what shes doing here and you want me to bury this why because its dead jacob oh yeah jacob stared down at the body in his hands right he looked over at the policeman you dont need me any more for her i mean i think we can handle this the sergeant told him dryly then as jacob moved to take his rifle back from mike the policeman shook his head no jacob leave the gun here its not needed but jacob was clearly uneasy about giving up his crookchasing role he cast an uncertain glance at the girl we dont know who she is she could be anyone we dunno no the sergeant said but i think we can assume shes not here to steal anything and if she runs he grinned i reckon we can catch her in those heels the sergeant was right the girl wasnt going anywhere as jacob carted the unfortunate piglet towards the door the girl pushed herself up to a sitting position and gazed about her she put a bloodied hand up to push back her curls and left a gory streak down the side of her face she looked young and crazily vulnerable she looked hurt shed only used one arm to push herself up now she brought her good arm over and cradled the other arm against her breast let me see mike said gently crouching before her and putting a tentative hand on her arm she winced and pulled back and the look of pain in her face deepened no i need i need she must be on drugs jacob interrupted knowledgeably pausing before he walked out the door with the dead piglet he still wanted the criminal element here hed come expecting crooks and he was determined to find some ill bet thats what shes up to here sarge you cant tell me normal women wear shoes like this shell be on drugs drugs the pain from her shoulder jabbed again like a hot poker mike could see it in her face the girl was bloodied filthy and hurting and she was so exhausted she could hardly speak she looked exposed and humiliated and now now suddenly her overwhelming emotion was anger mike watched it running through her supplanting the pain she hauled herself to her feet with her good arm she shoved her skirt down in a futile attempt at dignity and she glared at mike and the policeman for all she was worth five feet six of flaming virago facing two unknown males she wasnt scared though mike saw she was too plain angry to be scared andshe really was beautiful who are you he asked mildly and that was the last straw who am i who are you she demanded who the hell are you youre on my grandfathers property what gives you the right to demand to know who i am to talk about drugs what gives you the right to come here with guns and then suddenly it was all too much the girls shoulder had jerked as shed pulled herself upright he could see in her eyes that the pain was indescribably fierce so fierce she couldnt bear it she gasped and staggered and she would have fallen but mike was right there holding her tightly by her good arm stopping her from falling and propelling her down onto one of the tumbled bales of hay its ok his voice when he spoke was as gentle as the laughter lines around his eyes it was deep resonant and sure and as always it was inexplicably reassuring the locals said his forte was small children and dogs and they had reason mikes was a voice that imbued trust dont fight it he said softly its ok the girl didnt lack courage she did resistshe pulled back for all of two secondsbut if she didnt sit shed fall and there was no choice she sat and looked helplessly up again at him as she tried to clear the mists of pain you could see what she was thinking who the hell was this its ok he repeated again and there was such gentleness in his tone that it made the girl catch her breath were not here to hurt you wherewheres my grandfather weve been searching for him he knelt before her and his fingers gripped hers blood and all his hands were big and strong and warm and they clasped hers as if he knew how scared she was underneath the bravado it was a gesture of warmth and strength and reassurance hed used many times before and the girls body relaxed just a smidgen nothing more but he could feel it and he smiled his reassuring smilea smile that could charm a rattlesnake im the local doctor he told her let me see your arm let me help its nothing he ignored her protest the girl was in no condition to talk coherently much less think he watched her facehis eyes asked permission and his hands moved to the top button of her blouse can i see then as she didnt object he undid her soft cotton collar and pulled the cloth away from her shoulder he whistled soundlessly no wonder she looked as if she was in pain youve dislocated your shoulder just leave it the girls words were a painfilled whisper courage was oozing out of her as reaction set in youre not to be frightened he told her taking her hands again but so gently he didnt jar her injured arm were here to help and theres nothing to be frightened of im mike llewellyn bellanors only doctor behind me is sergeant ted morris and jacobthe chap whos burying the pigis your grandfathers neighbour he owns the farm next door weve been searching for your grandfather since he went missing four days ago but the girl looked as if she was desperately trying to make some sense of what he was saying she wasnt succeeding all she could think of was the pain explanations can wait mike said firmly he took the wrist of her injured arm and carefully lifted it so her arm was in a sling position i can take you back to the surgery and manipulate this with anaesthetic but if you trust me then i can probably get your shoulder back into position now it will hurt but so will travelling over rough roads to get you to town i can give you some morphine but i think the best thing to do is just manipulate it back in fast will you try to relax and see what i can do youyou really are a doctor i really am a doctor he smiled down at her his blue eyes gentle and reassuring he was hauling on his best bedside manner and then some the sergeant here will tell you i even have a certificate somewhere to prove it andyou know how to get this back ive put back dislocated shoulders before the girl looked up her eyes doubtful this wasnt the normal persons idea of a doctor he wasnt wearing white coat and stethoscope he wore blue jeans and a rough wool sweater he had deep black hair that curled in an unruly tangle and needed a cut and his face was tanned and his eyes were crinkled as if he spent a lot of time outdoors he wasnt the least bit doctorlike but he had piercing blue eyes and a smile on his broad tanned face that told her she could put herself safely in his hands it was his very best bedside manner turned on in force and it usually worked a treat now was no exception the girl sighed and nodded closed her eyes and forced herself to go limp she waited waited for the pain he looked down at her in surprise had this happened to her before then she looked like she knew what to expect there was no point dragging it out he lifted her wrist bent her elbow to slightly higher than ninety degrees then slowly firmly rotated her arm down and backso firmly that the girl gave a sob of agony and then miraculously it was over the shoulder clicked right back into place silence the girl took two deep breaths three four and then she opened her eyes to a painfree world her green eyes crinkled into a smile of absolute relief thank you the girls words said it all there was no need for him to check his handiwork the girls breathed words of gratitude and the easing of the agony behind her eyes told him all he needed to know he smiled down at her and she smiled right backand it was some smile well done he put a hand on her good shoulder tessas courage was amazing brave girl dont move yet take your time theres no rush no rush her smile faded and the girl looked about her in bewilderment as if seeing where she was for the first time doris lay exhausted on the straw around the sow the piglets were starting their first tentative movements toward her teats someone had to break the silence and it was finally the police sergeant who did now young lady suppose you tell us just who the policemans voice was gruff but mike put a hand on his arm shook his head at him and silenced him with a hard look nope questions can wait ted shes done in shes henrys granddaughter thats all we need to know youre the girl who phoned from the us earlier this week the policeman asked yes iim tessa westcott i flew in this afternoon hired a car and came straight here we dont need to know any more mike said firmly and tessas eyes flew to his face what she saw there seemed to reassure her mikes was a face of strengthstrongly boned with wide mouth firm chin and lean sculpted lines there were traces of fatigue around his deep blue eyes but his eyes sent strong messages of kindness and caring he ran a hand up through his dark tousled hair his eyes smiled at her and the impression of reassurance deepened if henry westcotts your grandfather how come weve never heard of you the barking demand came from behind and mike wheeled in sudden anger it was jacob whod come back into the barn to find a shovel jacob lay off cant you see weve scared the girl stupid shes hurt and shes frightened and nows not the time to start a fullscale interrogation the radio on the police sergeants belt crackled into life the sergeant lifted it and talked briefly and then he sighed i have to go he told them as he replaced it the murchisons cows have got out again and theyre all over the road near the river bend if i dont get down there soon someones going to hit one he looked closely at tess i knew that henry had a grandkid in the us though and you sure have his hair we need to talk but maybe not now mike told him tessa youre past talking he stared down at the girl before him his quick mind figuring out what to do for the best here sergeant could you use the radio to ask the vet to come out here and see doris shell need antibiotics straight away and i dont have a clue as to dosage if jacob stays here to help he should be able to treat her if tessa doesnt mind sharing my passenger seat with strop ill take her into town strop tess shook her head confused im staying here she said i dont blame you the policeman grinned you wait till you meet strop sharing a passenger seat indeed theres nothing wrong with strop that a good vacuum cleaner cant fix mike said with dignity strop is my dog tess and hell be very pleased to meet you he hesitated as her look of confusion increased this girl was in no fit state to be making decisions she could barely hear him and she certainly wasnt fit to spend the night alone in a deserted farmhouse youll spend tonight in hospital and let me have a good look at that arm he said firmly you can come back tomorrow if youre up to it doc are you saying i have to stay here jacob demanded incredulously are you saying you expect me to stay with the pig and wait for the vet after scaring miss westcott stupid its the least you can do he said blandly and i know you jacob you always do the least you can do besides in the last year ive made five house calls to your place in the middle of the night for your sick kids and every one of them could have waited until morning call this payment of a debt jacob shook his head confused and to her amazement tess felt herself start to smile shed blinked at mikes curt orders but she neednt have worried jacob wasnt the least bit offended he thought mikes words through and then nodded acknowledging their fairness we need to go now mike told tess only the faintest trace of humour behind his deep eyes telling tess that he was also laughing gently i have a patient in labour myself she was in the early stages when i left and she isnt likely to deliver until morning but she needs me all the same ok tess she looked as if she was operating in a daze nothing seemed to make sense i she was forcing herself to focus i guess thats fine then he smiled down at her im sure jacob and the vet will take the greatest care of doris bill rodick the vet is very competent and jacobs a fine farmer so you can visit doris tomorrow if shes up to receiving callers now though strop makes a great chaperon thats his principal mission in lifeto obstruct as many things as possible so do you trust strop and me enough to let us drive you to town trust him tess looked up and she gave mike a shaky smileand then before she could realise what he intended she was swept up into a pair of strong muscled arms and held close against his rough sweater she gasped no please i can walk i dare say you can he told her firmly this girl had enough courage for anything but its dark outside i know where my car is im surefooted as a cat and i dont want you stumbling with that arm especially if strops abandoned his leather armchair and is back at his old trick of obstructing things hes the type of dog burglars fear most because theyre at risk of tripping over him in the dark so shut up and be carried miss westcott shut up and be carried it seemed there was nothing else to be doneso tess shut up and was carried mike carried the girl out to his car and tried to figure just what it was about her that made him feel strange like he was on the edge of a precipice chapter two the girl was quite lovely the clock on the wall said three oclock and tessas hospital bed was bathed in afternoon sunlight mike had stuck his head around the door three or four times during the morning but each time tess was still sleeping soundly now she opened her eyes as he entered blinked twice and tried to smile tess was in a single hospital ward small and comfortably furnished with windows looking out over a garden to rolling pasture beyond it was cattle country if she had the energy to look she didnt she stared across at mike as if she was trying to work out just who he was this was a different mike to the one shed seen the night before hed told her he was a doctor and after his treatment of her shoulder tess had had no grounds for disbelief but now in clean clothes his black curls brushed until they were almost ordered a white coat over his tailored trousers and a stethoscope swinging from his pocket he was every inch the medico he still had the bedside manner she remembered from the night before he stood at the door and smiled and tess was forced to smile back and then her gaze dropped in astonishment a vast liver and white bassethound was sauntering into her room beside him awake at last mikes lazy smile deepened as he strolled over to her bed trying not to appreciate her loveliness too much as he did the fact that the look of her almost took his breath away didnt make for a placid doctorpatient relationship at all welcome to the land of the living miss westcott his eyes were warm and twinkling hows the shoulder it seems fine she kept on staring at strop so there really was a dog she said i thought he was part of my nightmare what strop mike grinned hes no nightmare hes solidly grounded in reality so well grounded in fact that if he gets any closer to the ground well have to fit him with wheels you keep a dog in the hospital hes a hospital dog he has qualifications in toilet training symptom sharing and sympathy just try him strop looked up toward the bed his vast mournful eyes met tessas limpid in their melancholy he gave a faint wag of his tail but went straight back to being mournful oh i can see that tess chuckled hed make any patient feel better immediately like theyre not the only ones feeling awful and they couldnt possibly be feeling as awful as that strop flopped himself wearily down on the bedside mat mike shoved him gently aside with his footthe dog slid under the bed without a protest as if this was what happened all the timeand then mike turned his attention back to his patient that wasnt hard to do enough he said strop steals my limelight all the time your arm miss westcott how is it tess wriggled it experimentally and winced i wouldnt worry about it its bruised but its fine you must have put the humerus right back in or itd hurt a lot more than this the humerus mikes face stilled last night hed suspected she had obstetric knowledge and now youre a nurse then nope she smiled and it was like a blaze of sunshine guess again a physio an osteopath try doctor a doctor he stared females can be she said still smiling her voice was gently teasing in the states medicines about fiftyfifty dont tell me you still keep women in their place down under no but mike thought back to the crazy red stilettos he stared down and there they were parked neatly side by side under the bed beside strop crimson stilettos and a doctor and doctors are allowed to wear whatever they like she told him following his gaze and knowing what he was thinking in a flash theres no need for us to put on black laceups when we graduateso you can take that slappedbyawetfish look off your face dr llewellyn right now no right he took a deep breath and managed a smile youre a practising doctor then thats right i work in emergency in la yeah yeah well thats put me on my mettle he had himself back in hand now almost doctors are the worst patients he said and tried a grin theyre almost as scary to treat as lawyers he sat on the bed beside her and tried to ignore the weird feel of intimacy his action created hell he sat on all his patients beds your shoulders really ok tess moved it cautiously against the pillows and winced again its sore she admitted but its definitely back in position its just bruised can i see sure there was no reason why he shouldnt there was no reason why she should blush either as he loosened her hospital gown and gently examined the shoulder and the bruising of her arm he was just a doctor after all his fingers were gentle and sure and his eyes watched her face as he carefully tested the injured arm do you have full movement i can wiggle everything she told him but i dont want to he smiled i dont blame you in a day or two itll look really spectacular he ran his hands over the bruised arm trying to block out his thoughts of tessa the woman and turn them back to tessa the patient usually he had no problem with differentiating work from personalities but tessa was something else and her blush didnt help at all you may not want to wiggle but youll live he pronounced finally he pulled the sheet back to cover her and tucked her in it was a caring gesture that he made every day of his working life but suddenly the gesture was far far different intimate he stood looking down at the girl in the bed struggling to maintain his lazy smile you might even feel like living after your sleep he said finally shoving away the strange sensations he was feeling and striving hard to sound normal his smile deepened fifteen hours straight sleep isnt bad i dont think ive slept since i knew grandpa was missing she admitted she grimaced and to sleep fifteen hours now when i should be out searching for grandpa theres no need for you to be out searching tess the police and the locals are all looking as hard as they can and theyre being thorough i know the farm though i know the places he loved to go but but what she glared up at him what why do you sound like that like what like youre trying to scotch any ideas i might have of where he might be he sighed this was hard bloody hard but then telling families the worst was something hed had to face many times tess your grandfather has mitral valve disease and atrial fibrillation he said softly hes been missing for over four days now its my guess well that farm of his is as rugged as any around here therere plenty of places a body could lie for months and not be found your grandfather is eightythree years old if he went out and had a heart attackwell my guess is thats exactly whats happened his trucks still at the house he had his goats tethered and doris due to deliver if he was going away hed have organised people to care for them i know that tess said she stared up and any trace of her gorgeous smile had completely disappeared her distress was obvious but i didnt know he had heart disease have you been in contact with him recently he asked i was under the impression he had no contact with his family he and my dad didnt get along she said bleakly she was obviously still taking the heart disease bit on board and was thinking it through as she talked she turned and stared out the window fighting to get her face back in order and it was as if she was talking to herself dad and grandpa fought dad went to the states when he was twenty he met my mom there and he stayed he died when i was sixteen without ever coming back here im sorry no dont be my family history has nothing to do with you she sighed again and shrugged turning back to face him dad was always against me coming back but he was pigheaded andwell he was stubborn enough to make me wonder whether the disagreement had all been one way so when dad diedmom said i should know my background so she sent me out to stay i spent a summer vacation here with grandpa i stayed here for three months just after high school three months when tess was sixteen he must have been away at medical school then he thought otherwise hed surely remember this girl since then weve kept in touch tess said i write often so does he and now i ring him every saturday we seem to be getting closer the older hes getting its like hes finally acknowledging he needs family anyway when i didnt get an answer this week no matter how many times i rang i contacted the police and was told he was missing so i came so she came she came halfway across the world to check on her grandfather that was some commitment buti didnt know he had heart disease she said slowly you would have thought hed tell me how bad is it i guess he hasnt wanted to worry you hes been taking digoxin and is fairly much under control but if he was overexerting himself with no tablets and if he got too far away from the house he hesitated but there was no way to gloss over the truth or make it any easier his pulse rates been up around a hundred and twenty or so and without digoxin or even aspirin he didnt continue he didnt need to tessas heart wrenched within her and he saw the pain his hand came up to touch her lightly on her cheek dont tess he said softly im hoping that your grandfathers heart just quietly gave out and the end was fast thats what he would have wanted to die in the bush he loved yes but but but they didnt know they didnt know he had died quickly the alternative was unspoken between themthe thought of the old man lying helpless in the bush and dying a slow and lingering death sergeant morris and a heap of the locals have scoured the farm he told her ive been out there too weve been everywhere we can think of and weve found nothing weve called tess if your grandfather was alive then he could have called back he could be somewhere weve overlooked but surely hed be within earshot not if hes had a stroke not if he cant make his voice work her voice broke off and she choked in distress mike i need to look i need to search myself there are places one special place yeah is this somewhere the police would have found she shook her head i thought of it all the way here grandpa showed it to me when i was here as a teenager and he talked as if it was a really special privilege for me to know about it it was his secret its a cave in the hills yes i remember it as being just past the boundary of the farm where the hills start turning rugged i cant remember much more in fact i cant even remember which direction it was there was no way i could tell the police about it on the phone and when i got to the farm last night i thought how stupid it was to come all this way on a hunch things have changed and my memorys playing tricks on me maybemaybe i can never find it or maybe its accessible now and someones already looked but thats why i came i want to check just as my own contribution to the search she sighed and turned to stare sadly out the window i know my dad and grandpa disagreed but grandpa sort of saw things in the same way i do then she managed a fleeting grin as she turned back to face him me and my dad fought too dont tell me your dad had red hair as well and a temper to match my dad could say some pretty unforgivable things and grandpa wasisa redhead too i see but he didnt see at all he stared down at this amazing woman in confusion shed come from the other side of the world to search for a grandfather who was probably dead she had a good job in the states had it been okjust to walk away hey my moms behind me in this tess said quickly she always felt bad about my dad never coming home shes paid half my airfare bully for your mom he hesitated thinking things through and he raked his fingers thought his thick hair in thought tess had come so far and she needed to conduct her own personal search but he hated the thought of her scouring that bushland alone the locals reckoned theyd searched every inch of the farm tess would be on her own now for her to be alone was unthinkable and even if she found her grandfather alonewell that was more unthinkable finally he nodded flicking through his mental diary at speed ok he and strop could do it tess i need to do a couple of hours work right now he told her have a meal and rest for a bit teds brought your car in its parked in the hospital car park and your gears being brought inside as soon as the orderly has a spare minute so get yourself into some sensible clothes he eyed the stilettoes with caution and some sensible shoes ill be back in two hours and after that ill come out to the farm with you you dont have to come with me she started but he stopped her with an upraised hand he had work piled a mountain high in front of him and he was dead tiredthe labour hed looked after last night had been long and difficult and hed managed all of two hours sleepbut the thought of tess searching by herself for what he feared shed find was unbearable i want to tess he told her so let me he clicked his fingers strop heaved one end up after the other and lumbered to his side and they left which was just as well if hed stayed in that room for one minute longer with that look on her facehalf scared half forlorn and as courageous as hellhe would have gathered her in his arms and hugged her and where was the professional detachment in that i should have refused his offer of help tess told bill fetson two minutes later the hospitals charge nurse had come to check on her and had found her pacing in front of the window mike was up half the night with me and doris and didnt he say he had a baby to deliver after he brought me in whats he doing offering to spend hours tonight searching for someone hes sure is dead he cares about your grandfather i guess her voice sounded totally confused bill thought as though there was something about mike she didnt understand in the least well maybe that was understandable mike was a fabulouslooking doctor with a smile that could turn any girls head a dog that was just plain crazy and a presence that played havoc with bills nursing staff but this girl was different bill watched the emotion playing over her face and strange ideas started forming in the back of his mind well well well would you like a tour of the hospital he asked mildlyinnocently he was busy but something told him it might be important to get to know this girl tess showered and dressed then explored the little hospital it had fifteen beds eight of them nursing beds and seven acute it was a tiny bush nursing hospital efficient scrupulously clean and obviously beautifully run it was almost new and the man who introduced himself as charge nurse showed tess around with pleasure its all thanks to dr mike bill fetson said with obvious pride as he showed tess though a tiny operating theatre with facilities that her made blink these facilities would be more in place in a big city teaching hospital mike fought the politicians every legal wayand a few illegal too ill betto get this place and he practically bullied the community into fundraising now we have this hospital though well theres no way were losing it the valleys never had a medical service like this how longs he been here tess asked three years but in a sense hes been here much longer mikes a valley kid and he started fighting for this before he even finished his medical training and there were so many things she didnt understand here hes always had strop bill grinned strop was an accident mike drives an aston martinthe sleekest car in the valley the salesman brought it up here for a test drive and drove it too fast putting it through its paces strop was lumbering across a road on a blind bend and the salesman couldnt stop mike felt dreadful and then the woman who owned him said he was a stupid dog anyway and seeing mike had hit him then mike could put him down as you know the aston martin only has two seats the salesman drove to the vets with mike carrying strop and by the time they reached the vets there was no way he was being put down so in one afternoon mike got the sleekest car and the dopiest dog in christendom youre kidding no way and believe it or not he is a great dog bills grin deepened the patients love him and all the valley knows now that if mike pays a house call then so does strop he paused and his smile faded but what about you i gather youre practically a valley girl yourself im not local myself but mike says youre henry westcotts granddaughter and he also says youre a doctor his eyes asked all sorts of questions but he didnt voice them not yet finally his tour at an end bill showed her into a gleaming little kitchen introduced her to mrs thompson the hospital cook and left her to be fed a meal was no trouble tess was assured no trouble at all she certainly needed it tess ate mrs thompsons meat pie with potato chips and lashings of salad she washed everything down with two huge tumblers of milk and she hardly felt the meal touch sides thinking back she couldnt remember when shed last had a meal maybe shed fiddled with something on the plane but how long ago was that too long her stomach said replete for the moment tess tentatively broached the idea of she and mike taking food out to the farm with them with the size of this hospital a sole doctor must be run off his legs and she was starting to feel really guilty about dragging him away she neednt have worried about the reaction of the cook mrs thompson practically beamed thats a really good idea the middleaged lady told her hauling a picnic basket out of a top cupboard doc llewellyn hardly stops to eat and hell miss dinner entirely if you dont bully him into it either that or hell eat six pieces of toast and three eggs at midnight which is his usual way no dear ill pack you a meal fit to feed six of you including dog food for that misbegotten hound of his if you promise to see he eats it he works too hard tess asked cautiously and the woman nodded with vigour driventhats what our dr mike is she said theres demons driving him that one hell end up in an early grave mark my words then her look softened but youve more to be worrying over than our dr mike oh child im so sorry about your grandfather i just hope she sniffed vigorously i just hope the end was quick thank you tess said weakly she didnt know what else to say while her picnic was being prepared she retreated to her bedroom she needed the privacy the hospital was abuzz with who she was and every nurse and patient in the place was burning with the need to know more likedid she have any ideas where her grandpa was and there was so little she could tell them mike collected her an hour later he walked into her room and stopped in stunned amazement at the transformation hed seen tessa bloody and exhausted and in pain he hadnt see her like this tess was certainly a beauty in anyones book hed thought so last night and hed thought it when hed seen her asleep in her hospital gown in fact he thought it every time he looked at her she wasnt a classical beauty but she was a beauty none the less she was slim and neat and her legs stretched on for ever in her figurehugging jeans she seemed all legs or all eyes depending on which end you looked at he thought tessas face had the pale creamy complexion of a redhead and shed come straight from the end of a united states winter there was a faint spread of faded freckles over her noseechoes of last summer tessas mouth was rosebudshaped her nose pertly snub and her face almost all eyes the greenness framed by her redgold hair she was thin well maybe not too thin he thought to himself she was justjust well packaged she was thin where it counted and not thin where it counted more in her figurehugging jeans and closecut tshirt her figure was revealed to perfection she had an old windcheater draped around her waist and the trainers on her feet were nearly as old as the clothes hed changed into but the age and the casualness of her clothes didnt detract from her beauty one bit it was all he could do not to whistle he didnt though he paused for one millisecondand then caught himself smiled and picked up the picnic basket provisions dr westcott hasnt the hospital fed you mrs thompson has personally insisted i eat enough to feed a small army she assured him but i wouldnt be the least surprised if i feel the need to eat again quite soon even my toes seem hollow he grinned no anorexia then excellent i like a girl with a healthy appetite do you want a cure for anorexia she demanded ive just invented it put a girl on a plane for thirtysix hours with airline food for company and fear in her stomach and then toss her among pregnant pigs and dislocate her shoulder then put her to sleep for fifteen hours andhey prestoyouve a girl with a healthy appetite magic dr llewellyn i think ill write it up as a new wonder treatment for one of our prestigious medical journals youll make your name as a medical whizkid he told her i know she agreed and fluttered her eyelids in assumed modesty whew good grief he smiled at her and tess chuckledand when tess westcott smiled his body started to heat from his trainers up ok then tess he told her finally and only a faint hesitation under his words hinted at what he was feeling youre fed and rested are you ready to face the farm tess nodded im ready ok strops waiting in the car lets go she set her face and mike saw grimness replace the laughter behind her eyes hell she had courage she knew what could lie ahead of them this was some woman and suddenly he wasnt the least sure he was ready to spend any time with her there was something deep inside that was telling him he should run a mile but there was something else that was telling him to stay the farm was dreadful even strop having made the first half of the trip straddling the gearstick and the second half where he really wanted to besitting high on tessas lap with his ears flapping out the windowseemed depressed by the place his mournful ears flopped lower and his eyes welled with moisture good grief you just had to look at the dog and youd burst into tears he lumbered off to sniff in the bracken and tess was pleased to see him go she was depressed enough without him they made a courtesy call on doris first she was too preoccupied with her eight babies to notice human visitors jacob had done his job well mike had rung him early this morning and asked him to make sure the sow was fed and watered and there was nothing more she needed now she had everything she could want except maybe a spare set of teats after paying their social call on doris they tackled the house there was nothing here to help themno clues as to where henry could be the place was deserted but it still held the signs of an occupant who hadnt intended to leave there was milk curdling in the refrigerator someone had taken a heap of sausages from the freezer and left them by the stove to defrost that had been four or five days ago and they were starting to stink they cleared up in silence and mike thought he was glad he hadnt let tess face this alone it was only bad sausages but there were so many dreadful thoughts crowding in and the smell of rotting meat didnt help one bit where do we search he asked as they came outside again and she shook her head i dont know i cant think im trying to remember it was ten years ago i its like going back in time ive lost my bearings lets eat then he told her gently watching her distress with concern it was early for dinner but they needed to get some fresh air into their lungs after the dreary house and tess needed time to get her emotions under control before they tackled the walk even if she remembered where to go afterwardsafter theyd searchedthey might not feel like eating at all they spread their picnic under a massive gum tree beside the shed tess was so depressed she was close to tears even mikes comforting presence and the way strop cheered up at the sight of sandwiches couldnt help this deadening misery the sun was sinking lower in the sky and she didnt know where to start what to do she was aware that mike was letting her decide carefully holding back from what he saw as her domain and she was grateful that at least she didnt have to concentrate on small talk it made for a cheerless silence though but it also made for thinking she was hardly hungry after her meal two hours before she lay on the picnic rug and watched mike demolish the picnicand thought back to when she was sixteen years old and she and her grandpa had roamed this farm together and then he was watching her and mike saw the instant when remembrance hit the feeling that this place was familiar i remember we walked down by the creek she said softly i know so thats east if i can start she pushed herself up to stand and gaze out to the distant hills mike this is probably useless she said slowly but i think i might remember the way its a long hike a hike he poured coffee from a thermos and handed her a mug thats fine by me this picnic idea was great but we need a hike now to walk it off and strop definitely needs exercise thats four sandwiches you fed him do you remember the way entirely no she shook her head and took a couple of sips of coffee while her eyes still roamed the hills her mind was working at a thousand miles an hour dredging up memories of the past i shouldnt ask you ask anything i want to helpremember he told her i dont like not knowing your grandfathers fate almost as much as you dont he placed his coffeemug aside and stood up beside her ive just been hoping if i shut up long enough you might think of something useful to do i dont know whether i have but she finished her coffee before she replied mike didnt push theres all the time in the world he told her thats not true this is important tess he said softly there might be things that need doing but its your grandpas life at stake here take all the time you need i dont understand you she said softly of all the doctors i know youre not like she shook her head confused but mike didnt say more he knelt and stroked strop and waitedand finally remembrance came its coming back she whispered she stared out at the surrounding countryside it had always been a tussle to keep this land cleared the little farm had been neglected for the last few years and the bushland was reclaiming its own there were only henrys six goats to keep it down it was definitely east of here she said surely im sure i remember but the countrys rough ive bought a backpack he told her bending to throw the picnic things back in the basket its in the car but we dont need provisions it should only take an hour im taking medical equipment he said curtly just in case butyou still think hes dead if he was somewhere safe and dry and then collapsed he shook his head who knows but if there is such a place then i guess there might be a chance i just wish to hell id been able to contact you when this whole mess happened if id known tess looked curiously up at him you really care she said softlywondering mike grandpas your patient but hes an old man with nothing whatever to do with you except in a professional capacity you must have two or three thousand patients on your books yet you care enough to come out and untether grandpas goats and check on his pig at midnight you care enough to rescue a weird and ridiculous dog from deathand you care enough to come with me now yeah well he gave a shrug feeling embarrassed and tess stared some more thank you she said simply no if id contacted you you might have been able to tell me i couldnt have described where the cave was even if id thought of it she told him i dont know for sure that i can find it now but i hope she paused and he stood and took her hand strongly in his pulling her over to stand beside him his arm came around her waist in a gesture of reassurance and comfort then lets do that tess he said gravely lets hope the cave was further away than she remembered and by the time they found it the last of the light was fading behind the hills the sunset had been spectacular and there was still a fading glow around the sky it was instinct rather than knowledge that led her to the cave she couldnt have described the route if shed tried instead mike watched as she simply let her mind drift back to her last summers afternoon with her grandfather set her eyes on the hills and let her feet rewalk the route theyd taken he didnt say a word sensing her need to let her instincts take over and her instincts didnt fail her resting high in the hills in dense bushland where a small creek trickled down over vast boulders two massive rocks stood sentinel to a third the rear rock looked as if it had been almost blasted into the cliff facea part of a rock wall which was sheer and impregnable it was only when you slipped behind the front two rocks then walked around a small outcrop to the side that a small opening behind the rear rock could be seen it was just big enough for a man to fit tess found it wordlessly her face reflecting hope and dread what if her grandfather wasnt here and what if he was strop was sniffing the entrance his floppy ears pricked as much as it was possible for basset ears ever to prick mike looked down at his dog and his face tightened he placed a hand on tessas shoulder and gently propelled her forward it wont get better for the waiting he told her softly come on tess i think your grandfather might be hereand im right beside you and thank god he was there was no way he wanted tess to face this on her own he badly wanted to tell her to stay back nowlet him find whatever was insidebut he knew shed have none of that so he took her hand and tess let hers lie in his as he led her forward she had brought mike here but now she was clearly grateful to let him be in charge she squeezed through the gap as his hand pulled her on and he could feel the tension in her fingers inside the cave was so big it might almost have been the vaulting roof of a cathedral there was a crevice above that open to the evening sky and the rosy hue of sunset shimmered around the smooth rock walls and lit the cavern in a dim and misty haze tess didnt waste time admiring the beauty at the rear of the cave there was a chamber dry and filled with sand closed to the weather but just open enough to the light so as not to be frightening it was a comfortable place for a wounded thing to lie and tend its wounds courage was no longer an issue she dropped mikes hand and stumbled quickly across the rough cave floor to reach the inner entrance with strop and mike left to follow and inside she found her grandfather chapter three for a moment tess and mike thought henry was dead for one long moment she stood in the small doorway while her eyes adjusted to the dark her grandfather was huddled in a far corner and he wasnt moving she gave a gasp of dismay but then mike pushed her aside striding across the sand to stoop over the huddled figure he lifted a limp wrist and turned to stare at tess in the gloom hes alive tess help me alive somehow tess made her legs carry her over to where mike was kneeling in the sand oh mike alive strop fell back hed been trained to do this he wasnt all stupid when mikes voice hit a certain tense pitch strop knew enough to shove his butt down and wait how how tess stared down hes unconscious tess but theres a heartbeat hes so dry hell feel his skin his mouth is parched and his tongue is swollen youll find a torch in my pack and a saline pack his hands were running over the old man as he spoke moving with care and concern for him to have been here he must have been here all this time tess was hauling mikes backpack from his shoulders and fumbling inside for a torch the flashlight rested right on the top she flicked it on and directed it down at her grandfathers face the sight before her must be a dreadful shock mike thought grimly tess hadnt seen her grandfather for ten years and henry then would have been a vigorous seventythreeyearoldhealthy and strong and full of life now the eightythreeyearold man lying on the sand seemed drained of everything his skin was as white as alabaster under his tan and it stretched across his old bones as if it were parchment henrys eyes had sunk into their sockets and were staring sightlessly at the opposite wall his cheeks were gaunt hollows and his lips were so dry theyd cracked bled half healed and cracked over and over again find me a swab dr westcott mike cast a glance up at tess hoping like hell she wouldnt faint on him his voice sliced across tessas distress like a knife tessa youre wasting time i need a swab and then i need help to set up a saline drip fast we havent found him to let him die now oh mike he looks so dreadful he looked like death but tess didnt intend fainting she took a deep steadying breath and somewhere in that breath she turned from a frightened grandchild into a competent doctor the fact that this was her beloved grandpa was thrust aside henry was an emergency patient dying under their hands what do you think hes dehydrated mike snapped you just have to see his lips if hes lain here for days with no water everything else can wait tess but we have to get fluids in ok she was already moving sorting out swabs and syringes and tubing from mikes bag and handing them across in the dim torchlight mike knew there were two people inside her head now one was tessa westcott scaredstiff granddaughter and the other was dr westcott efficient medical practicioner for now though she was efficient and she was professional the first lady had been sent outside for the duration to wring her hands in private henry needed dr westcott now and so did mike two minutes later they had saline flowing mike had everything they needed in his backpack and tess found it prepared it and handed it across at need as if she were in a properly equipped casualty cubicle rather than squatting in an illlit cave mike adjusted the saline to full flow he took the stethoscope that tess offered and held it to henrys chestand then finally he sank back on his heels and looked across at her we have a massive chest infection here and its no wonder after this long without attention he told her theres a mobile phone in my bag tess hand it to me and well call in help the ambulance boys will bring a stretcher in and carry him out if its not too late with everything they could do having now been done it was time now for dr westcott to revert again to being just plain tessaand just plain scared the theatre door had been opened and the relatives ushered in tess was now tessa the relative she looked down at the man lying on the sand and her face twisted oh grandpa dont you dare die not when were so close dont give up tess mike said roughly putting a hand out and taking hers in a strong hard grip hes alive and thats more than we hoped for weve had a miracle lets see if we can score another one he gave her a tight strained smile and then turned to his phone he watched her sit and listen while he barked orders to unknown people at the end of the telephone link and her hand stroked her grandfathers face as she waited that hed been here for so longalone her hand went down and gripped the fingers of her grandfathers hand willing life into his veins by her side strop nosed forward and gave her spare hand a lick and tessas strained look eased as though that one lick had been immeasurablystupidlycomforting grandpa im here grandpa she faltered its tessa ive come home mikes eyes never left her face as he spoke into the phone homeit sounded right that was a crazy thought this wasnt tessas home she had no life here and why such a thought had the power to jolt him he didnt know tessa had nothing to do with this valleynothing to do with him he opened his mouth to speak but as he did he saw tessas eyes widen as she stared down at henry he glanced down and a muscle moved almost imperceptibly at the corner of henrys right eye grandpa she leaned closer and mike stared unable to believe hed seen the movement he let the phone drop to his side he wasnt imagining ittess had seen the movement too he took henrys other hand henry its mike llewellyn here he flashed an uncertain look at tessa unsure how she was reacting and then he fixed all his concentration on henry its doc llewellyn youre quite safe henry and your granddaughters here too tessas come all the way from the states to find you weve been searching for days but no one but tessa knew where the cave was now well stay with you until we can stretcher you out to hospital youre quite safe henrys right eye fluttered open and he saw them his gaze wandered from tess to mikeand then back to tess it was clear that focussing was an enormous effort there was confusion in his look his left eye stayed closed but the hand tess was holding tightened convulsively henrys lips moved ever so faintly and tess bent to hear tess the word was blurred to the point of being unintelligible spoken through one side of his mouth and with a chest that rattled and wheezed and barely functioned but they knew it for what it was tessas eyes filled with tears its really me grandpa she murmured were here mike and i are here mike and i it sounded good it sounded reassuring even to mikes ears dont worry grandpa she said well have you in hospital in no time sstay i will it was a vow and suddenly as she made it mike knew the vow she was making wasnt a light one shed stay ill see that she stays mr westcott he said softly dont you worry about that now why on earth had he said that shes gorgeous yes there was no doubt in his mind just who they were talking about it was six in the morning mike had snatched a few short hours sleep interrupted at two am by a child with croup and at five by a drip which had packed up and at six he hit the hospital kitchen for strong black coffee bill had arrived a few minutes earlier and the charge nurse was wrapping himself around a plate of porridge will she stay bill asked what do you mean will she stay i guess shell stay until henry decides whether to live but will he live the news of henrys discovery had hit bill the minute hed entered the hospital predawn or not bill guessed itd be all over the valley by now maybe but maybe not i cant tell how bad the stroke was mike said not until we get him rehydrated get the intravenous antibiotics working on his chest and get him over his shock hes had a hell of an ordeal and he has a massive chest infection he looks dreadful youve seen him i poked my head around the door when i got in are his obs ok they were settling when i left him at midnight and no ones rung to say theres a problem theres been no change tessas happy with them tessa mike stared tessas asleep i set hannah to special him tessas sitting by his bedside bill said blandly hannahs down in the nursery with billy and his croup billys a real handfulhes been giving the night staff helland tessa told her she wasnt needed shed look after her grandpa herself but i told tessa to go to bed shes not the sort of girl to follow orders bill said a faint grin playing over his face at least not unless she agrees with them shes exhausted mike said grimly thats stupid is she as tired as you then im not tired oh no bill leaned back and folded his arms across his large chest youve had on average oflet me guessabout four hours sleep a night for the last two weeks and youre telling me youre not tired i can cope but tessa westcotts another doctor bill said thoughtfully his calm intelligent eyes thoughtful you know if theres one thing we need around here its another doctor we dont need tessa mike wed accept doris the pig if only she had a medical degree bill told him bluntly and your tessa has a medical degree mike boy you have a duty here what do you mean i mean you have enough address to charm a whole harem of tessas bill held up a hand to silence mikes involuntary protest now dont deny it ive seen you woo old ladies till their pulse rates shoot through the roof they come in droves to get their flu injections and ill tell you whatits not fear of flu that does it and the old ladies have nothing on the young ones you create havoc with my nursing staffand all they get for their pains is a hopeless case of unrequited love or lust he grinned or maybe both bill hey we could make this a proper partnership here bill continued thinking this through now look mike be serious here you know if you snap your fingers you could date any single lady in this valley even my barbara says you make her pulse rate wobbleand shes the mother of my four kids yet you never go out with anyone more than twice so he held up his hand again to silence mikes interruption no shut up and let me speak so thereforeit stands to reason that youve been saving yourself and i reckon the lady youve been saving yourself for has just entered your orbit you have to be kidding would i joke about anything as serious as matchmaking bill demanded he grinned and lifted one finger on his raised hand you listen to uncle bill my boy one the lady is seriously desirable even i can see that despite my commitment to my barbara if barbara can look sideways at mike llewellyn i can look sideways at henry westcotts granddaughter then another finger went up bill was on a roll here and he wasnt to be stopped two the lady is a qualified medical practitioner a third finger three the lady has a need to stay in the valley all you have to do is keep henry alive and needful of family and four he said this as mike rose and stalked to the door four you need to be married mike llewellyn you need a wife and a few kids and a mortgage just like the rest of us and as mike walked out and slammed the door behind him bills face split into a huge grin because mike llewellyn didnt look angry he just looked confused bloody hell could they really have something going here i just might have another plate of porridge mrs thompson bill said to the hospital cook id drink champagne if i could but porridge will have to do believe it or not we might have dr mike seriously interested in something other than work dr mike wasnt seriously interested orwas he he did his ward rounds with a strange feeling hanging over his head normally his mind was totally on his job apart from his devotion to one crazy dogand the small matter of his love affair with his carhe gave one hundred per cent concentration to his patients now though his patients sensed that there was something different about mike this morning he was just as attentive but there was an air of bewilderment about him are you worried about henry westcott sandra lessing asked shed been the cause of his lack of sleep the night before last now she was sitting up in bed feeding her dayold son and like every patient in the hospital she was agog with the news of henry being found i guess mike shrugged and smiled down at the downy little head nestled against his mothers breast i dont know sandra theres no way of telling just how bad the damage is yet he was so lucky to be found sandras family farmed a property on the other side of the ridge to henrys and she knew at first hand just how hard the country around here was to search if it wasnt for his granddaughter coming back she looked at mike her eyes twinkling shes really something isnt she bill introduced me to tessa yesterday when he was showing her over the hospital shes just lovely yes mike said shortly but he didnt want to think of how lovely tessa was he needed to concentrate on work sandra can we pop your son back into his crib so i can give his mum the onceover sure hes not feeding any more he just likes cuddling she planted a kiss on her sons head give me two minutes and ill cuddle you again she promised she lay back and eyed mike again her eyes speculative i know what she said how about when i get home i organise a dinner it can be a thankyou dinner for you for delivering toby and a welcome dinner for tessa all in one how would that be if all goes well henry will be on the mend and tess will be back in the states by the time you get home mike said shortly not if this valley has anything to do with it sandra grinned hugely the whole valleys talking about tessa westcott and the whole valley thinks she might be a really good thing sandra well work on it she said placidly give us time like about a day or so by the time mike reached the little room he used as intensive care he was starting to feel as if he didnt want to enter the whole hospital staff and patients alike had started to have really strange ideas about tessa westcott and he wasnt enjoying them his normal cheerful smile had faded and he approached icu with misgivings hell what was happening here sure tessa was one different woman and sure the valley needed another doctor but tessa lived in the states for heavens sake she had nothing to do with him she was here for maybe a week which was all very sensible he thought but logic didnt account for the way his heart lurched when he opened henrys door tess was dozing with her head on henrys counterpane her wonderful hair was spread out in a flaming halo on the white bedlinen she was wearing exactly the same clothes shed had on when theyd brought henry in it had been a really major job to get henry out of there the ambulance boys had had to traipse over rough country to reach them and then there were only two of them they hadnt waited for backup because mike had wanted oxygen and equipment fast henrys lungs were barely functioning then to get a stretcher over rough ground with only two stretcherbearers had been risky but tess hadnt waited for backup even then no way in the end mike and tess had taken a stretcher corner each to give them four bearers and make the stretcher stable i can do it shed told them when theyd said theyd wait for help hes my grandpa im as strong as a horse and i dont have to use my bad arm just shut up and lets get him somewhere safe so shed done it but heaven knew how even if shed been fit it would have been harder for tess than for the men because she was inches shorter and try as they might they hadnt been able to compensate entirelybut even though shed carried with her good arm she was still so badly bruised it must have hurt it must have hurt like crazy but she wouldnt listen to their protests and it was the two ambulance men whod decreed they stop and rest every two hundred yards or sonot tessa she had an iron will if things needed doing tess westcott just went ahead and did them she was such a kid he thought from where he was standing with her head resting on her grandfathers bed and in her grimy jeans and tshirt she looked all of fourteen years old hell hell get a hold on yourself mike llewellyn he told himself harshly shes only a woman and you know your vow so keep your thoughts to yourself hands off easier said than done he had work to do here he reminded himself so do it he stepped forward and put a hand on her shoulder tessas eyes flew wide in panic and shed half risen from the bed before she realised he was smiling and shaking his head its ok tess theres no need to hit the panic button he lifted the observation chart from the end of the bed and studied it while she regained her composure this looks great he told her i wouldnt have disturbed you but i wanted to talk to you before i started work for the day she blinked rubbed her eyes and checked the clock it was seven am sowheres your dog hes fast asleep where you should be youre here to do your ward rounds she said cautiously and he grinned he lifted henrys wrist and nodded in satisfaction when henry didnt stir like strop henry was soundly asleep it looked like itd take a bomb to wake him he had fluids aboard he had a comfortable bed and he had his granddaughter beside him there was nothing he needed now but sleep ive done my ward rounds he smiled down at her and the feeling of weird intimacy grew stronger it was almost as if hed known her in another life in fact it was just plain crazy the patients in this hospital are used to early morning calls he said trying to keep his voice steady i left you until last until last she grimaced gee thanks dr llewellyn if this is a late call remind me never to get sick in this hospital i like my sleep i thought youd be grateful his lazy smile deepened you can now do what most of my patients do he told her kindly enjoy the dawn chorus have breakfast and then go back to getting some beauty sleep that means go back to bed you shouldnt be here tess you know well take care of henry hes sound asleep the salines working hes rehydrating nicely and the antibiotic should kick in within twelve hours with the fluid on board hes getting better by the minute theres no fluid output yet you wouldnt expect that he said and he had his voice under control again im hoping we got to him before theres any longterm kidney damage even if theres no kidney damage its obvious hes had a stroke tess said grimly and we dont know how badly hell be affected no we dont know that and hes far too weak to do any testing yet but there are some good signs tess the fact that hes still alive now is a very good sign yeah terrific i mean it he said seriously you realise henry must have had the stroke five days ago its obvious he has a hemiplegia at the moment the left side of his body seems almost totally paralysed hes slurring his speech and he appears confused but hes survived for five days tess and the only way he can have done that is if hes had water also theres a pressure wound on his hip but its not a major one it doesnt look like hes lain in the one position for five days therefore he must have been able to drag himself out of the cave and down to the creek and back again if hed been totally paralysed for five days hed be dead by now so what are you saying im saying that once hes got his fluid balance back to normalonce hes recovered from shock and exhaustion and we get on top of his chest infectionhe may well make a full recovery from his stroke he told her the fact that he was able to say your name last night was amazing and even though he hasnt spoken since the muscles must be still operating thats all i wanted to tell you dr westcott im sure youll figure it out for yourself but it might take time and i dont want a gloomy face scaring henry into another stroke my face is not gloomy she said before she could stop herself and he grinned well maybe youre right he agreed in fact its not gloomy at all he smiled down at her and tess found herself flushing under his careful scrutiny but fearful though he amended gently fearful of your grandfathers future her momentary lightness faded hes at risk of another stroke mike isnt he she didnt need to ask she knew the odds he is he said bluntly there was no use giving false reassurance but you know weve started him on heparin as well as digoxin im sure much of his weakness now is due to being left so long without attention rather than the stroke itself id say with good rehabilitation weve a very strong chance of getting henry back to his beloved farm between us i think weve done an excellent nights work i guess he looked down at tess and his smile died he could see what she was thinking henry had been so near death to have pulled him backwell there were no guarantees now that henry would be gratefulespecially if he was left with a body that wouldnt do as he commanded to be left with partial paralysis im telling you tess there cant be major paralysis he said gently and his hand came down on the bed to cover hers it was an unconscious action which he did with many patients but he was suddenly acutely aware of the contact he was acutely aware of the linking of their two hands but he didnt pull away no but but he wont be out of trouble in a week she said sadly or even a month he cant be so what happens now she stared down at her grandfathers gaunt face and a muscle worked at the side of her mouth i wont be able to return to the states now she said at last ill have to stay mike frowned but he was aware of a tiny jerk inside him it was like something deep within was really pleased with the words hed just heard go for practicalities where does that leave you he asked are you on leave from your job i quit to come here you quit she looked up at him then and her mouth twisted into a wry smile she hadnt moved her hand it was still under his and for the life of her she couldnt find the energy to move it this man was her only comfort in all this it sounds dramatic doesnt it she shrugged and managed a grin its not ive been working in emergency medicine for the last two years its been exciting but now ive had enough excitement im moving into family medicine you have a job to go to ive applied for a heap of positions in the states she told him i was really just waiting to hear ifor whereive been accepted when i had to leave to come here her gorgeous grin flashed out again if you must know im expecting a pile of job offerswith salary commensurate with my expected lifestyle of courseto be waiting when i get home so it seemed only fair to tell the hospital i wouldnt be back so youre a free agent i guess until i have to start working to pay for food she smiled again that blindingly attractive smile that almost shook his socks off it seems to me that if grandpas farming one sow eight piglets and six goats and not a lot else then i might be in trouble if i expect the farm to pay for my keepand i dont much fancy living on piglet no mike gave tess a smile in return but his mind was racing bills words were echoing strongly in his mind you have a duty here and wed accept doris the pig if only she had a medical degree hell the room was suddenly way too small the door opened it was bill with a junior nurse in tow just as well his blood pressure was climbing through the roof as he tried to think this through weve come to do the real work around here bill said cheerfully the charge nurse looked from tess to mike with amused speculation and then watched as they selfconsciously disengaged hands hmm things were moving along nicely here doctors arent wanted he added kindly forbearing to comment on the handholding unless you have anything urgent to do here im just going mike said curtly in a voice that made bill frown let me know when he wakes bill im staying tess said no mike shook his head no way you need to sleep i can sleep here she told him i want to be here when grandpa wakes tess butt out dr llewellyn she said firmly this is my grandpa go find a grandpa of your own he has ten or so grandpasgrandmas toobooked into surgery this morning bill said grinning again he can choose there you are then she said kindly byebye dr llewellyn off you go and care for the medical needs of the valley grandpas and grandmas en masse well cope with this one ourselves and he was left with nothing to do but leave itd be evening before he had an excuse to make another trip to henrys room he thought as he closed the door reluctantly behind him unless henry woke he hoped to hell that henry woke and it wasnt just for henrys sake either mike worked flat out for the whole day but tess hardly left her grandfathers side bill persuaded her to shower and change while he took over her watch but apart from that she hardly left his side its just so hard she told bill her voice strained im just trying to figure what to do for the best here maybe mikes right and hell make a full recovery but meanwhile he cant go back to the farm to live alone wheres the nearest rehabilitation unit melbourne so unless he has someone at home to care for himsomeone to help him do his exercises and make sure hes safethen hell have to go to the city a few months of institutionalised living will make him unlikely to be able to care for himself again and meanwhile someone has to care for the farm the farm could be sold no thats unthinkable why tess thought that one through i dont know she said slowly or maybe maybe i do from the time i was little my dad talked of this place as home he was homesick but too pigheaded and proud to ever think about returning instead he passed on his love to me by the time i saw the farm and met grandpa i was sixteen and felt like the place was where i belonged and the three months i spent here as a teenager cemented that impression i love it youre a farm girl there were things that needed doing but still bill lingered tessa was desperate to talk to someone and he let her talk no way i was raised in the city but maybe im a farm girl at heart that was why i decided to go into family medicineso i could move to the country he quirked an eyebrow eat a lot of peaches tess grinned ok so im an idealistic twit he smiled dont knock it idealistic twits are valued in this hospital you mean thats what mike is hey i didnt say that no but tess hesitated maybe you dont have to mike has a medical practice which must take all his time and more but somehow he organised his work so he could spend a night searching for grandpa when we arrived back here last night there were two more patients to be seen before he went to bed and i dont have to ask why he was up so early this morning he was paying now for his time off last night hes some doctor he has the most wonderful car and the craziest dog sounds like hes won a heart bill said with a chuckle then as a buzzer sounded down the hall he grimaced and waved a hand in farewell duty calls ill leave you to your plans then dr westcott and ill be very interested to know what they are and so will i tess muttered as the door closed behind him because if youre making plans around mike then youre an airdreamer tess westcott and then she swerved to look down at the bed henry was stirringand he was watching her an airdreamer henrys voice was a slurred whisper but it was enough tessas face burst into joy and she buried her face into his shoulder oh grandpa i thought you were a dream he whispered into her mass of hair my tess an airdream is that the same thing nope she lifted her head and looked at him long and lovingly im real im a hundred per cent accounted for i was just making plans plans plans for me plans for you and she took a deep breath plans for mike llewellyn i see the ghost of a twisted smile played on henrys face i bet you dont see at all she lifted her grandfathers gnarled old hand and rubbed it against her cheek i dont see things very clearly myself i only see that youre alive i have you back again and youre here girl if you knew how much id wanted you oh grandpa her voice broke with emotion then she caught herself and managed a glare hey havent i always told you to be careful what do you mean by taking yourself off to that cave to have a stroke is that what ive had the left side of henrys mouth wasnt working properly each word was a twisted effort a stroke looks like it tessas voice softened and her hand gripped her grandfathers with love its a mild one but definitely a stroke yeah yeah so why the cave grandpa i was feeling lousy he told her his mouth forming each word with care i had a kingsized headache i couldnt shake i knew you were ringing saturday night so i took the afternoon to visit the cave just in case he grimaced it was likeif it was something serious i could say goodbye so if it was something serious you could lie for five days without medical help do you have to be bossy henrys voice was a frail thread and she chuckled yeah you know me grandpa the original miss bossyboots he fell silent exhausted and it was ten minutes before he spoke again mike had told her to ring him when henry woke but tess resisted there was time enough in the future to let the world break in for now she was content to be alone with henry so what plans are you making for mike llewellyn he whispered at last and she started oh nothing tell me well its just that mike is overworked overgenerous and overendowed with nicenessplus he has more than his fair share of good looks she twinkled and i need to stay here and look after you but i also need an income so so so i might just have chosen myself a partner she said simply if hell have me and if he wont then well just have to think of a way to make him change his mind chapter four by two that afternoon mike was starting to get anxious that henry hadnt woken when he finished surgery he intended to go back to the hospital but just as he was leaving the clinic there was an urgent call from eileen fraser reg fraser was close to death reg had terminal lung cancer hed been dying for months cared for by three sisters of whom eileen at ninety was the oldest the misses fraser had taken care of reg around the clock every since hed become ill and he couldnt have had better care anywhere now it sounded as if the end was very very close eileen was distraught no they didnt want reg to be admitted to hospital not now but yes they needed help for the first time since hed become ill reg seemed distressed mike had no choice he packed his bag and headed for the fraser farm and this time he left strop behind reg wasnt distressed hed lapsed into a coma and started cheynestokes breathing mike reassured the elderly ladies that all this meant was that reg was so deeply unconscious his breathing was almost a muscle spasm rather than the effect of a conscious message to the brain he died half an hour after mike arriveda peaceful settled death that was just how mike had hoped it would be oh reg miss eileen fluttered forward as her brothers breathing finally ceased the sisters kissed their brother in turn and then fetched the coverlet that mike gathered theyd spent the last six months embroidering for just this occasion he couldnt leave he spent the next two hours drinking tea and eating homemade biscuits while the sisters went through every aspect of regs illness with him step by step it was an important time for them if they were to come to terms with what had happened and mike couldnt begrudge it to them the undertaker was booked to call later that evening there was no hurry no hurry at all mike ended up looking through faded family photographs with the sisters commentating this is reg on his first pony and this is reg on his first day at school and see how much taller reg was than our father by the time he could charitably leave it was five oclock and evening surgery patients were already queuing still he couldnt return to visit henry he made a fast phone call to bill back at the hospital henrys awake and doing fine bill told him tessas finally agreed to have some sleep im going off duty now if you like ill feed strop for you before i go so theres no urgent reason why you should race back to the hospital no mike had to agreeespecially since tessa was now asleep that was stupid he told himself but even so it made the hours spent seeing his evening surgery patients pass faster than if hed thought tess was sitting by henrys side waiting was it his imagination or were there more patients than normal at eight oclock mike finally finished he came out to find his receptionist replacing the telephone she sighed as she saw him for heavens sake mike therere rumours flying all over the valley that theres a new doctor starting work ive had more than ten patients ring to ask if they can have an appointment with the new doctor when i say shes not working here theyre disappointed but then they cant admit they dont really need to see a doctor so they make a time to see you she gave an apologetic smile im sorry mike but youll have sore throats and pap smears all tomorrow morning great mike groaned just what i need and then he frowned why the hell does everyone think were getting a new doctor well because of tess of course tess dont act daft maureen his receptionist was fifty years old and up to every trick in the book there was no way patients could pull the wool over her eyes and neither could mike if youre not thinking of tessa westcott then theres something wrong with you every male nurse in the placeevery orderlythe ambulance boystheyre all talking about her and if any valley male hasnt seen her yet then theyre busy trying to are you thinking of offering her a job no why not maureen tess works in the states shes a us citizen for heavens sake she wont even have australian registration well i could fix that in a flash maureen told him just say the word you know we qualify as a remote district if anyones stupid enough to want to work here and their medical diploma isnt paid for in timbuctoo petrodollars the medical board says thank you very much and welcome and if tess hasnt australian citizenship i could fix that too her dads australian this is ridiculous mike said flatly she doesnt want to come here to work shes here to visit her grandfather thats all were fine on our own no were not fine maureen said frankly not now when you first started here you could handle the work but that was because most patients took themselves to the city for treatment now they know they can get hospital care and superb medical treatment right here so theyre staying more and more theyre staying which leaves you mike llewellyn working your socks off hard work doesnt hurt me not for the short term maybe but for the long term you need some social life i have a social life oh yeah maureen jeered gently and her motherly face creased into lecture mode you know you havent had time to have one serious girlfriend since you returned to the valley and at your age maureen i dont need a girlfriend of course you do she smiled and of course you need another doctor and here is this tessa i havent met her yet but if bills report is anything to go on well you may be able to kill two birds with one stone girlfriend and workmate all in one maureen yes she dimpled up at him butt out yes sir she put her hand up in a mock salute so i cant ring the medical board then no rats and its the weekend now too still her smile deepened i guess it can wait until monday it wont be happening on monday well see her twinkle refused to be suppressed bill says this tessas a very determined young lady like a bulldozer he says oh and by the way with difficulty she forced herself back to business yes speaking of love life there was a call for you from liz hayes shes been trying to ring you all week liz he frowned trying to concentrate on something other than tessa liz was the local shire engineer what does liz want she wants you to take her to the shire ball tomorrow night the ball you need to go barbara said patiently everyone does i put it in your diary a month ago yeah right liz knows youll be there in name only barbara told her she says shell meet you there and your name will be beside hers on the supper table its the same table as the shire president oh and she says if you can squeeze in time for a couple of dances shed be grateful maureen sighed as she watched him think this through the valley girls knew what to expect from mike now it gave them a certain amount of social cachet to be his date for the evening but if a girl expected him to pick her up shed be two hours late every timeif he came at all there was always a medical imperative and even if he came there was a risk of one lumbering bassethound in the passenger seat but still they tried he was a great dancing partner and if they were lucky enough for the phone to stay silent and for him to be dogless there was the ride home in his gorgeous aston martin and maybe a kiss but nothing more yeah youre right he said abstractedly the council supports the hospital so i need to go to the ball tell liz its fine ill meet her there you wouldnt like to ring her and tell her yourself maureen asked but she asked as if it was a forlorn hope why he frowned lifting his list of house calls and leafing through the pile because one of these days you wont want your secretary organising your love life she retorted why would i change now he grinned and pocketed his list you do a fantastic job my love life is entirely satisfactory thanks to you maureen he leaned over and gave her a kiss on the top of the head then took himself out to his aston martin whichapart from stropwas the love of his life and the only love of his life he had house calls to do it was ten that night before he returned to the hospital and he was starting to feel the strain in fact he was dead beat strop was already asleep and not the least bit interested in asking how his day had gone half your luck he told the dog but strop didnt stir he did a cursory ward round in the darkened hospital checking obs and organising changes of treatment with night staff he left henry till last as he wasnt worried hed been assured at each of his phone checks that henry was going well he opened the ward door softly and found louise one of the night nurses sitting beside the bed until henrys pulse settled to a strong beatuntil the chest infection was under control and the fluids were completely restoredmike had requested he be specialled but hed sort of hoped tessa might be here she wasnt and he had to swallow a lurch of disappointment louise looked up in query as he entered she smiled and handed him the obs chart things are looking good here doctor she said primly louise was that sort of nurse primness was her forte mr westcotts awake are you then henry mike smiled and walked over to the bed henrys old face was gaunt and shrunken on the whiteness of the pillows but in the dim night light mike could see his old eyes looking up with sharp intelligence mike mike gripped his hand and held on welcome back to the land of the living sir he said softly it was thanks to you henrys voice was amazingly strong considering mike gave an inward sigh of relief hell after all hed gone through the man must be as tough as old boots your rescue was thanks to your granddaughter he told him tessas one determined lady she is that my tess the old man closed his eyes for a long moment and mike thought he was drifting back to sleep but the hand gripping his was still strong tomorrow theyd run a few tests theyd see then what the damage was he wasnt moving his left arm mike noticed still if the speech was only slightly affected tess says she intends staying henry said and mike shook himself god he was tired if he didnt watch himself hed be asleep before henry does she she cant stay long term henry whispered fretfully i guess shell stay until youre back on your feet yeah butive only got one foot henry managed a twisted smile cant feel the other thatll come back i promise you henry youll need physiotherapy but well get movement back if henry was speaking already it was a safe enough promise but not tomorrow no sir mike agreed gravely not tomorrow tess says shes quit her job in the states she told me that will you take her on here silence mike henry prodded this is all a bit sudden mike said at last i think we need to talk about it but not yet theres time sir to be making decisions about the future when youre on the road to recovery but i want to know now henry fretted and under mikes hand his pulse rate went up ive been lying here thinking i should have died in that damned cave theres nothing left for me and my bodys failing but if tess came back tess has her own life in the states she says she wants to stay henry told him and louise cast an urgent look at mike the old man was getting agitated and agitation was the last thing he needed he knew that but to make such a promise just to calm him youll check the old mans voice was failing him now each word was getting more and more slurred youll check her training i wouldnt ask you to have her if she wasnt any good butshes a good girl my tess i ought to know will you check her credentials ill check he said heavily and this time louises glance was curious his reluctance must be obvious and if shes any good youll employ her im making no promises mike told him im not sure we need another doctor oh dr llewellyn louise could no longer keep silent the nurse was practically agog not need oh of course we need another doctor if dr westcott would agree to work here just say youll try henry begged mike what do you say he gripped mikes hand hard pleadingand there was nowhere left for mike to go very well then he said at last if thats what tessa wantsand she hasnt told me it is by the way but if thats what tessa wants then well try mike was starving he walked out of henrys room with all sorts of emotions tumbling disjointedly around in his head but hunger won out the misses frasers biscuits had been his only meal since breakfast it was eleven at night now and he really needed to go to sleep he also really needed time to get his mind in order over tess but even more he needed a feed first the kitchen was dark and deserted he flicked on the lights and headed for the fridge in ten minutes he had a vast mound of eggs and bacon and fried bread in front of him this was standard fare bother cholesterol without eggs and bacon hed starve he sank down at the table and ate two mouthfulsand then the door swung open to admit tessa once again this was a different tess she was dressed all in crimson but this time it was a bathrobe the thick red towelling wrapped her from neck to toes her hair swung free in a riotous flaming mass and her toes were bare her toenails peeped out from under her robe and mike blinked as his gaze reached them her nails were painted blue and each toenail had a tiny gold star painted over the blue lacquer she followed his astounded gaze and she grinned she flopped down in a chair beside him put a toe up on the table for inspection and wriggled it do you like my toes i dont think he stopped for the life of him he couldnt think of a single sensible thing to say you dont like she said sadly she put both feet up before her and wiggled all ten bare toes i do they cheer me up it took me ages to do them i can imagine he said faintly she grinned and shook her head her magnificent hair flying you know id almost be willing to bet my bootlaces that you cant imagine she chuckled one of my patients taught me how to do it her face clouded a little she was a sixteenyearold with cancer this is my legacy from a brave kid star toes then she brightened again want to let me paint yours then youll really see how long it takes he shoved his safely booted feet further under the table and managed a smile hell this girl took his breath away no thank you very much but no politely said cowardly but polite wheres your dog asleep where you should be she said wisely grandpa says youre offering me a job he sucked in his breath if his breathing got any harder here itd stop entirely keep eating your eggs she told him dont let me interrupt i just woke so i popped in to see grandpa hes nearly asleep but he told me you were joboffering louise says its true and she told me to find you here and take you up on it before you have the chance to change your mind that was big of louise he took a mouthful of bacon and glowered shes a lovely girl repressed though tess said thoughtfully did you know shes an only child and her mother has an asthma attack every time any boy asks louise out its ruining her love life louise is thirtytwo and if her mom doesnt shuffle off this mortal coil soon shell dwindle into reluctant spinsterhood how the hell do you know that she told me why i asked tess said kindly i can see im needed around here dr llewellyn if only to do something about mrs havelocks asthma mrs havelocks asthma is fine its all in her head no but she uses it as a tool i guessed that but what have you done about it nothing he said more sharply than hed intended its none of my business yes it is louise is depressed and ill bet louise is your patient too yes but you dont have time to look after the psychological wellbeing of all your patients tess nodded sympathetically and studied her toes you know i think louise could do with gold stars i think ill suggest it and tomorrow tomorrow he was listening in trepidation what next harvey begg has asked louise to go to the shire ball with him tomorrow night is harvey an eligible young man mike blinked harvey conversation with tessa was like holding onto an octopus he thought confused you never knew which hand would grab you next or where youd be led harvey begg i guess you could say harvey beggs eligible he managed a smile harveys our local accountant hes very solid in every sense of the word balding midthirties drives a volvo and plays cribbage ugh tessas nose wrinkled not my cup of tea still she smiled louise seems smitten each to his own i say and maybe theres passion in cribbage that i havent seen before and the back seats of volvos are huge tess she chuckled oh well maybe not but louise is getting her chance to find out tomorrow ive arranged to momsit you grandpa will be still in hospital her face grew serious for a moment i cant keep staying here taking up a hospital room i know that so tomorrow night ill stay at louises placelouises mom can think its because louise is doing me a favour offering me accommodationbut itll let louise go to her ball and after that after that mike was eating but he was eating on automatic pilot he felt as if he were being pushed along by a tidal wave after that ill go back out to the farm and stay there until grandpa comes home you really are serious about staying i really am mike hesitated not sure where to take it from here andyou seriously would like a job he asked slowly her face brightened absolutely her eyes met his and there was determination behind her gaze mike i do want to stay but grandpas going to feel too guilty if i stay just to look after him it would be much better if i could combine my medicine with his care for how long for however long it takes tess we could be talking years here theres no guarantees henry will be fit enough to look after the farm on his own again ever i know that so what will you do then if youre agreeable ill take him back to his farm and keep him as happy as i can for the rest of his life she said simply if i can practise medicine here then everything falls into place if grandpa needs extra help ill be able to afford it she hesitated and her tongue flicked out to moisten her lips it was a gesture of uncertaintyher first ifif youll have me if hed have her he stared across the table at this extraordinary woman while he tried to figure out what to say shed burst into his life like a flash of flame and hed felt breathless ever since as if his world were being turned upside down he didnt want this girl he didnt in less than two days shed destroyed the even tempo of his existence for mike llewellyn life was work life was medicine and dedication and caring life had nothing to do with painting gold stars on your toenails but but the valley was grossly medically understaffed maureen had been right when shed said he was overworked there had been times of late when mike had been forced to cut cornersto not question as closely as he should during an examination or to make do with changing a dressing three times a week rather than daily and a vaccination programme should be started in earnest and a health programme for the elderly and and the town needed another doctor but not thisflibbertigibbet why dont you want me she asked curiously watching his face louise tells me you need a doctor every nurse in this hospital every person ive met says the valley needs an extra doctor is it because im ustrained no is it because im a woman then no look im serious about working here she said firmly her smile fading she put her hands flat on the table and met his look mike im a good doctor she told him i know im trained in city medicine and theres a heap here i need to learn but im willing and i want to try butwhy do you want to leave the states i dont she said flatly but well mom and i have always felt dreadful about grandpa we felt bad that dad wouldnt come home moms always brought me up to think i was halfaustralian and this way she sighed her voice now serious mike ive told you im interested in family medicine she said thats not a lie but in the states well more and more medicines being taken over by the specialists as an internist i wont get to see kids or trauma or heart attacks or surgery family doctors cant do anything handson without getting sued herehere i can deliver babies and help with road trauma and counsel louise about her love life and help old men with prostate problems i wont just be sitting behind a desk handing out pills and referrals but and moms behind me on this she said solidly a hundred per cent she was an only child and her parents are dead shes always felt like grandpa was our family and we shouldnt be so far apart its my guess that if i stay then shell be over here in a flash and thats a worry because shes bossier than me but i do want to stay i do so employ me tess nowtomorrow morning she said softly brooking no interruption louise says you have saturday morning clinic how about if i run itwith you watching then as he opened his mouth to protest she held up her hands to silence him no dont refuse i know i wont be able to do heaps of things i havent a clue as to australian rules and regulations but im a fast learner and if we give each patient the choice when they come in as to whether i can practise on them well tell them my registration isnt through yet so anything i say has to be backed up by you you have it all worked out then yes she tilted her chin a trace of defiance colouring her voice i do anything wrong with that what could be wrong if someone had asked him a month agoor even a week agowhether hed like a partner hed have jumped at the chance like a shot he was tired past the point of exhaustion but a partner had always seemed an impossibility no doctor in their right mind would practise here the doctor whod been here when mikes mother died had been an alcoholic and thats why hed ended up in such a remote place nowhere decent would have him to work here meant practising medicine at its most basic there was no specialist backup available at worst a helicopter could come in and evacuate but there was no landing strip for a light plane and in rough weather even a helicopter had trouble doctors today wanted backup and nights off and private schools for their kids there were few opportunities in the valley for the things most doctors and their families had come to expect and mike knew that to attract anyone here would take a miracle and here was a miracle a slim fiery bossy determined miraclewith blue toes and golden stars so grab her and hold that was just what he wanted to do he thought suddenly that was the problem she was sitting beside him at the big kitchen table made to seat a staff of twelve or more her feet were propped up before her her bathrobe was vast and warm and she looked like a gift package in crimson she was sitting so that her gown just brushed his shoulder he pulled back suddenly acutely aware of the touch and she grinned hey im not proposing to seduce you here dr llewellyn she said mildly only work with you and then she furrowed her brow anyway why so touchy youre not gay are you no hmm hmm what she was watching him as if she were looking at a frog on a dissecting table and mike found the sensation unnerving theres a problem here but i dont know what she brightened ill bet you have a past a past a deep and mysterious love life of which we know not she grinned again a skeleton in the closet am i right dr westcott oh i am right her smile widened how about i do a bit of matchmaking if the volvo and cribbage doesnt do the trick how about louise tessa his voice was an explosion but for the life of him he couldnt stop a chuckle this girl was incorrigible and now she was smiling straight back at him thats better she said approvingly you look ever so nice when you smile she swung her crazy feet off the table and stood up how about it doctor as of tomorrow can i be on probation please sir if you think ill make a good doctor can i stay tessa just say yes she begged then you can go to bed which is just where you look like you ought to be he stared at her baffled she stared right back ill be a good little doctor she said meekly i wont cause any trouble please sir and ill even take your most difficult patients tess just say yes there was no choice he stared at her for a long long moment but he was too tiredtoo confusedtoo just plain baffledto make his mind think of anything but how gorgeous she looked how hed like to touch that magnificent flaming hair how hed like to yes he said quickly before his traitorous mind took him one step further fine starting tomorrow morning dr westcott youre on probation chapter five tessas probation started fifteen minutes later mike had barely put his head on his pillow when the phone rang it was louise ringing from reception doctor theres a fire at the hotel rachel from the fire brigade just rang she needs you how bad mike was suddenly wide awake all trace of weariness gone at the sound of his voice strop lifted his head from his basket cast him a reproachful glare and went straight back to sleep rachel says there are people trapped louise said her normally placid voice unsteady ill call in all staff if you go ahead with the ambulance ill organise things here hell it took mike all of ten seconds to haul on pants sweater and shoes leaving strop to his beauty sleep he emerged from his apartment at the rear of the hospital in time to see the valleys second fire engine screaming past the ambulance officers were already backing the ambulance up to the casualty entrance whatll we take doc one of them called as they saw his shadowy figure running toward them any extras shove in as much saline as we have in the emergency room and soak some blankets before we go leave them on the floor of the van sopping wet mike was barely awake but his mind was working lightning fast this was his nightmarean accident with multiple casualties where there was no medical backup do we know whats happening he demanded i dont think they know down there yet owen the senior ambulance officer told him but rachel sounded sick and you know rachel if shes worried then its bad right lets get down there and see im coming too it was tessa slipping out of the casualty entrance to join them shed replaced her crimson bathrobe with black jogging pants and a crimson sweater her hair had been hauled back in a knot and she was shoving her feet into sneakers as she ran i was talking to louise when the call came louise told me whats happening and you might need me before mike could say a word she heaved herself up into the rear of the ambulance she took the bags of saline from owen and shoved them behind her as if shed been working with the man for years then she looked down into mikes astonished face well what are we waiting for she demanded there was no way mike could argue argument took time and if there were multiple casualtieswell hed be grateful to have tessa hed be grateful to have any medical body he thought bills words about doris the pig echoing once more in his mind but suddenly especially he was grateful for tess why did the thought of her alongside him make the thought of what lay ahead less fearful tess moved aside to make room for him and he climbed in to join her without a word it seemed his medical partnership was about to start mike was silent on the threeminute ride down to the town the boys had the siren screaming and lights flashing so to speak would have been impossible anyway but mentally mike was gearing himself for what lay ahead it was midnight by this time of night the pub should be closed for casual drinkers so there shouldnt be scores of trapped victims thered only be the guests the valleys hotel had seen better times as an accommodation house trendy bedandbreakfast accommodation had taken over the once lucrative tourist trade the hotels guest rooms had become rundown and little used there were always one or two people using them though the guests now were usually men who had little choicemen who paid a few dollars for minimal accommodation and didnt expect much mike was aware of tessas eyes on him watching it was as if she were reading his mind he thought she just watched no it was as if she could see into his mind and didnt need to read it was as if she just knew she sat calmly on the stretcher opposite him her hands clasped loosely in her lap as she waited for the ambulance to reach its destination for a fireball she was a restful woman mike thought suddenly she was making no demands on him now and mike sensed that shed support him all the way here she was acting like a true professional and mike felt an overwhelming surge of gratitude that shed come and then the ambulance screamed around the last corner and every other consideration but immediate need was washed away the hotel was well alight the old twostoried building hadnt been painted for years this years summer had been long and hot the cooler weather of approaching winter was here now but thered been little rain the building was therefore tinderdry whatever had happened herewhether it had been a small spark or a larger explosive force setting things offthe flames had caught and held and one look was enough to tell mike that there was no way the local firefighters could save this and who was inside could anyone help them may there be nobody please god the whole top floor was alight and as the ambulance screamed around the corner of the main street and the occupants of the ambulance stared in horror the top lefthand side of the hotel roof started caving in on itself dear god then the ambulance was pulling in behind the fire units careful to leave space for men and hoses between and mike was striding down into the noise and heat to see what he could do in all this he got two feet from the ambulance doors before he was caught by rachel briny head of the fire team rachel was tiny and tough and as capable as ten men wherever there was trouble in the town there was racheland thank god for it ive got les crannond over here for you doc he needs seeing first mike nodded les was the local publican and if rachel said he needed to be seen first then mike believed her burns yeah hes down behind the firetruck ive got boys dousing him with water dont think hell conk out on us but his legs pants caught alight just as we got him out what else rach nothing yet she said abruptly worse luck cant get upstairs and upstairs is starting to come downstairs all by itself let you know if we find anything but dont hold your breath les says therere two left up there but god help them if hes right and she turned and started barking orders as she ran again to face the fire mike turned to find tess beside him her arms full of sodden blankets and clutching mikes bag under her load tell me where to go he didnt answer but swerved behind the truck where rachel had said hed find les leaving tess to follow les was in a mess the publican lay flat on the bitumen his face grey with shock and pain he looked as if he was about to pass out one of the firemen was running water over his legs and mike saw that the cloth of his pants had burned almost away keep going robby he told the young firefighter keep that water going the cooler you can get those legs the less chance well have of having fulldegree burns few people realised that even after the source of the burn was removed flesh could keep burning twenty minutes continuous cooling was the rule in emergency medicine and mike wasnt about to break it now he knelt down before les and tess knelt beside him as mike lifted less wrist to find his pulsethe man looked deeply shocked and cardiac arrest was a real possibility heretess hauled open mikes bag he has a heart condition mike said brusquely he had a heart attack two years ago and bypass surgery the burns were bad but a heart attack was what he was most afraid of here you want morphine tess asked nodding as her eyes rested on less face if he had a heart condition on top of shock and these burns tessas expression said she knew what they were dealing with saline then morphine you got it they worked silently and at speed and mike was once more overwhelmingly grateful for tessas presence the two ambulance men had disappeared no doubt leaving the major casualty to mike and doing their own reconnaissance of what else needed doing that was the way they usually worked in emergencies with only one doctor in bellanor it was impossible for mike to perform triagethe careful sorting out of prioritiesin an emergency the ambulance boys did it for him there was no doubt when mike stepped back from les theyd have more work for him and if they thought someone needed him urgently then theyd find him soon enough mike was accustomed to working alonebut to have tess beside him was a godsend the heat here was indescribable no firefighter would get off unscathed and yet they had to try there was no way they could simply allow the hotel to burn to ash with the hotel so close to other buildings they had to try and contain it and contain it fast and there was still the possibility of more people inside mike couldnt think of that tess was handing him a syringe he took it and she set up a makeshift stand for the saline while he found a vein by the time he had the saline running the bag was selfsupporting he didnt have to ask tess for what he needed next the minute the saline was in she had morphine ready les muttered and his eyes rolled back in his head mike was inserting the syringe of morphine so it was tess who lifted less wrist and found the pulse she bent her face close to his so he could hear her over the roar of the flames and the shouts around them its ok les she said softlyurgently its ok youre out of danger the fires being contained just relax dont fight it were in charge now not you the painkiller will take effect in just a moment but i dont want you to fight it just relax mike glanced up at her in swift surprise she sounded so much in control what had he expected he didnt know but he now knew what he had here tessa sounded competent and sure and totally reassuring she almost had mike believing there was nothing to worry about sam les moaned it was sam is sam fisher inside mike demanded and les managed a weak nod stupid bastard i told him no radiators i told him but he keeps sneaking them in then he drinks in bedgets himself blind drunkgets hot and throws the covers off its happened before last week he burned a bloody great hole in the floor before he woke up i nearly chucked him out then but he swore he wouldnt do it again sam fishers an alcoholic mike explained grimly to tess he often stays in the hotel its almost his permanent home he finished administering the morphine and took less hand still the young firefighter was playing water gently over less legs and mikes eyes silently ordered robby to continue youre ok now les he told the publican we have you safe it looks like sam might have burned himself to death but you know as well as me that by the time sam goes to sleep hes so far drunk hes almost paralytic the smoke will have taken hold before he felt a thing but hugh les moaned hugh hugh wades in there you know him doc young fella my nephew getting married next saturday to doreen hirrup lives on a farm ten miles out come down for the wedding rehearsal and i gave him a room free oh no there was no time to take this in there was a sudden warning shout from closer to the fire and then a crash so loud it hurt mikes ears the flames reached a roaring crescendo and there were sparks flying two hundred feet into the air mike looked up as the whole top storey of the place crumpled oh god les groaned beneath their hands and his face turned even more grey mike tess said warningly if les went into cardiac arrest here mike glanced up at her face and he could guess what she was thinking she wanted her er facilities she was used to back home in the states she wanted a crash cartelectronic defibrillatora cardiac specialist or six at the ready they had themselves plus one whitefaced firemanno more than a boywho was trying to keep his hand steady as he sprayed the water across less legs and that was all they had and then there was another shout behind them different from the barked orders and shouts from the firefighters this was a male voice strong and full of fear and he sounded as if hed been running les les oh god les has anyone seen my uncle hugh mike stood searching the weird flamelit night for the source of the voice hugh a long lanky youth came stumbling toward them his face ashen doc its my uncle have you seen him les oh god is he in there hes here hugh mike said roughly hauling the lad down so les could see his nephew as well as hugh see his uncle hes burned his legs but hes safe oh hell les and the boy burst into tears ok mike got wearily to his feet hed done all he could do here for the moment can you look after this tess he motioned to les and the boy ill see what else needs doing and he slipped away into the night to seek further casualties it was twenty minutes before they finally loaded les into the ambulance in that time theyd treated six firefighters for smoke inhalation and scorched eyes finally though the great burning heap became manageable there were no more tragedies waiting to happen here so mike and tess could be spared to take les back to the hospital one of the ambulance men stayed back with firstaid gear but any more casualties would surely just be minor and could either make their own way back to casualty or be driven in a normal vehicle there was only one more major casualty expectedand no one was expecting miracles for sam fisher hugh came to the hospital with his uncle i should a been there he said over and over again in a voice that trembled my room was just next to the old codgers i should a the boy stared down at less legs they knew now that les had been burned trying to get up the stairs to reach his nephew i didnt tell him i was going out hugh muttered i meanour families are so bloody righteous doreen uses a sleepout at the back of her folks place they thought i was staying at the hotel but after they went to bed id sneak back like i mean his voice grew defensive we are getting married next week but then we heard the shouting and the bangs and sirens and everything and doreen looked out and said the pubs on fire and i couldnt believe it i came so fast he stared down at his trousers his fly was halfundone and with a selfconscious shrug he hauled up the zipper bloody fool he muttered and it was unclear who he was referring to but his hand came down onto his uncles shoulder to try and get me out i woulda still tried to get sam out les groaned and grabbed his nephews hand and held it would a been burned anyway werent your fault hugh and ill still make your wedding you see if i dont he wouldnt tess looked down at those charred legs and winced les had months of skin grafts ahead of him there were three solid hours of work before they could think of bed firstly they stabilised les as well as they could but there was little they could do for his legs in bellanor mike organised helicopter evacuation he needs a specialist burns unit he told a stricken hugh we dont have the facilities here to cope with burns like this hes burned about thirty per cent of his total skin area id guess about twentyfive per cent is fullthickness burns i cant guarantee his survival if he stays here there was no more to be said but it was a subdued hugh who an hour later climbed into the helicopter with his uncle and the evacuation medical team because i cant get it outa my mind that he did it for me he explained and he dont have a wife or kids to look after him hes only got me ill look after the old bugger its probably true mike said wearily as he turned back to the queue of firefighters needing treatmentmostly for minor eye injuries dear god he was tired but there was also overwhelming sadness running through his fatigue and les knows it i doubt if les would have crashed through a barrier of flames just to save sam hey mike dont think about it tess said steadily and her hand came out to touch his arm whats dones done our job is to make the best of whats ahead it was true he gave himself a fierce mental joltand her hand was still on his arm thank god for tessa she made his weariness and his sadness just a little bit easier bad but bearable there was little time for any more thought after that there was too much work they worked side by side washing out eyes and treating one firefighter after another for minor burns the fire had been an inferno and the men had taken crazy risks to get les out by three in the morning mike was so exhausted he could barely stand and if tess hadnt been there she was that was all that mattered her presence seemed to be all that was holding him up you can go to bed now he told her as the last of their patients disappeared back out into the night the hotel was now nothing but a vast pile of smouldering ash somewhere inside was what remained of sam fisher but sam had built his own funeral pyre there was little hope of finding anything recognisable but tess was watching him closely and she shook her head no no youre exhausted she said softly but me i slept most of the afternoon im still brighteyed and bushytailed and ready to go then her voice softened and i havent just lost someone i was fond of in a fire mikes eyes flew to hers how how do i know i can tell the signs she said gently youre quiet youre too quiet for someone who isnt feeling pain i want to tell me about sam he didnt ordid he sam wasjust a patient he said and hes old and fragile and he feelshe felt the cold mikes gaze turned inwards remembering sure hes a drunk but hes a likeable old drunk i had him down for a nursinghome bed but we never have any spare when hes in the mood for coming and when i do have a spare bed then hes feeling independent and obstinate and tells me im fussing maybe i should have fussed more you cant force people to do what they dont want to no he stared bleakly into the middle distance and then shook his head anyway if sam hasnt drunk all his pension cheque he stays in the pub and les is lousy with the bedding the hotel hashad southfacing windows and its an old old building its april now and the nights are turning frosty i organised sam more blankets but its my guess he sold them a decent blanket will fetch you fifty dollars fifty dollars equals ten bottles of cheap plonk a cheap radiator costs you ten oh mike i should have gone to see les before this happened he said harshly hell i should have seen it coming last time he was in to see meonly three days agosam was complaining of chilblains hes so damned thin he has no body fat to keep him warm he had no body fat mike she took two steps forward and lifted his hand in hers she cupped it between her fingers and her gaze met his and held mike dont do this to yourself dont do what the feel of her hand was making things even more surrealistic it was as if he were in a bad dream floating youre exhausted she said softly go to bed bed ha how could he go to bed the ambulance boys are still working therell be more people to see before morning i can see them she told him youre not not registered to work here she drew herself up to her full five feet six inches and glared no im not but ill tell you what dr llewellyn id rather be treated by me an unregistered doctor than by you a doctor whos past his sleepby date you should be stamped this doctor has not slept the requisite number of hours in the past twentyfour truck drivers in the states have a system like that so im introducing it here now consider yourself stamped dr llewellyn go to bed i cant go she put her hands on his shoulders and shoved a crimson powerhouse propelling him out into the corridor before he knew what she was about he was on the other side of the door go on go ill bet your dogs asleep you go and join him unless you think im incapablewhich im not if i want to do anything really hard like the odd spot of neurosurgery ill call you i promise tess she softened then and smiled up at him and her smile made his insides feel really strange weird ok ill call you for things a bit less complicated than neurosurgery for anything i can be sued over if i muck up ill call you i promise but go to bed please mike her hands were still on his shoulders he stared down at her and the twisting sensation in his gut got stronger and stronger what was happening here he didnt have a clue what mattered though hell she was right if he didnt sleep now hed fall right over it must be sleeplessness that was making him feel so strange what else ok he said finallyflatlyand his voice came out not as hed expected his voice sounded devoid of any emotionand that was the opposite of what he was feeling but he knew he couldnt stay standing here one minute longer ok dr westcott ill go to bed and somehow he managed to haul himself away from her hands somehow he made himself turn around and face the other way and take the few long steps to the bend in the corridor when all he wanted to do all he wanted to do was to gather her into his arms and kiss her chapter six mike slept until eleven the next morning he opened his eyes and stared at his clockand then sat bolt upright what the hell he swung out of bed and then paused as a knock resounded on the outer door of his apartment that must have been what had woken him he dived under the sheet again and two seconds later his bedroom door swung wide and tessas face peeped around when she saw he was awake she beamed well good morning he could only stare a rejoinder just wouldnt come out tess was dressed all in white like a superefficient little medico she had on a white lab coat over white pants and tshirt white sneakers and a big white ribbon was hauling back that riot of red hair you like my bridal outfit she whirled a tray in hand for him to inspect he did he did very much she looked just great she also smelled great she stopped whirling and walked across the room to deposit her tray on his bedside table the tray held fried eggs and bacon toast and strong black coffee it seemed an age since supper last night and the smell was just wonderful heres your breakfast she said cheerfully i left it as long as i could but any later and itd have to be lunch and thats the last egg youre allowed this week dr llewellyn if youre not worried about your cholesterol then you should be and as your new medical partner i feel i have to make a stand but he stared up at the girl above him and then he stared at his alarm clock it must have stopped working hed set it for six i turned it off tess said seeing where he was looking she smiled benignly for all the world as if shed done him a favour you i sneaked in to check you were asleep about five am she told him blithely didnt see me huh im a born sneak and as for strop what a watchdog he snored and rolled over and thats the only peep i heard out of him when i opened the door just now he took one whiff of the bacon and headed for the kitchen at what i can only suppose is what he thinks is a run good grief but the clock mike reached to lift the plate of eggs and baconand then thought better of it he made a selfconscious grab at the sheet hell why on earth didnt he wear pyjamas but tess either didnt notice or wasnt fussed at him presenting his nakedness from the hips up yeah the clock i saw what time youd set it for she told him six am what sort of a crazy time is that i turned it off her smile widened arent you glad i did no he said tersely hauling his scattered wits together and the sheet higher im not i have surgery saturday mornings always frantic i disagree what do you meanyou disagree i just did your surgery she said thats why im dressed like thisas opposed to you being dressed like you are very informal i must say then as colour started mounting under his tan she kept right on going i figured i had to make a nice efficient impression first offbefore everyone gets to know the real me and it wasnt frantic at all it was great fun ive met the nicest bunch of people she grinned down at his confusion mind you i may have prescribed wart medicine for angina or vice versa youre kidding he said faintly and she took pity on him and chuckled yep im kidding im pretty sure i got everything right maureenyour nursereceptionistis just the greatest she sat in with me and we had a copy of mims which told us the brand names for the generic medicines so i dont think weve messed anything up maureen rang ralph the pharmacist and youre to pop in this afternoon and countersign everything thatll cover the legalities but we did just fine what he shook his head trying to wake up this felt just like a dream what have you seen who lots of things tess hauled a chair from by the door and sat down beside him lots of people eat your breakfast its getting cold she lifted the coffeejug and poured two cups one for mike and one for her then settled back like a visitor in a longterm hospital here for the duration mikes sense of unreality grew even stronger i saw mrs dingles arthritic knee she told himas though shed really enjoyed the sensation i took out susie hearns stitches i listened to bert shareys wheezy chest and his problems with his best heifer and i gave him antibiotics and a lecture about smoking too much i told caroline robertson she was pregnant and then i had to tell her husband because theyve been trying so long they didnt believe me caroline robertsons pregnant shes about three months id say she said serenely it made me feel good to tell them theyre very happy youre kidding mike shook his head tess do you know how important this is if youve made a mistake i dont mistake pregnancy at three months tess appeared miffed i agree that some things might be different between australians and americanslike their nasal twang and the things they do to peanut butterbut pregnancy shouldnt be included i did a full examination and everythings fine but mike shook his head again in sheer disbelief the robertsons have tried every treatment known to man and then some in january they finally stopped trying and applied for adoption they cant have stopped trying entirely she grinned again and then appeared once more to concentrate who else i cant think there were heaps of patients booked in ive left all their cards out so you can see who ive seen and what ive done andthe patients in hospital they need mike was practically flabbergasted ive seen them too she said blithely i let mrs pritchard go home because she told me youd promised she could today and i couldnt see any reason to keep her longer i decided to keep hal connors drip in it packed up about five amthat was when i checked on youbut i still think he needs the fluids she paused oh and grandpa hes ok yes his electrolytes are almost back to normal and theres nerve function all along the affected side and hes loving me working here she smiled her pleasure which makes two of us me and him so how about you dr llewellyn are you happy to have me working here i dont seem to have a choice he said slowly munching into toast without thinking god this felt good weird but good to have a long sleep followed by breakfast the grey weight of exhaustion hed been carrying had slipped from him and he felt ten years younger he was confused but at least now he wasnt boneweary is there anything you havent done i dont think so what about whats happening at the hotel tessas smile faded yeah well everything cant be good but theres news from melbourne les is settled at the burns unit at the alfred he has a long road ahead of him but his condition didnt deteriorate through the trip but mike could tell here was something else tessas bright face had clouded i went down to whats left of the hotel at about seven this morning they were pulling well they were pulling what may be the remains of sams body from the ashes ive identified it as human remains and it was hard enough to do that ive organised for him to be brought into the mortuary but the formal identification she shrugged im afraid that might have to be up to you mike youll need dental records medical records i dont know i would have spared you that but hell youve done enough no tess shook her head i havent done nearly enough she clasped her hands with the same restfulness hed seen the night before on the ambulance trip to the fire and her face grew earnest mike the more i see the more i know this is my sort of medicine she said seriously in the states medicines so specialised even if i choose to do family medicine i wont get to see anything like i saw this morning i wont get to see surgery or gynaecology or trauma but here i see so much in one short morning ive seen it all it can be pretty minddeadening he told her flatly and it can be frightening and sometimes it can be both youre coping with coughs and colds and peoples personal problems and lifethreatening trauma all in the same day she bit her lip and thought this through and when she nodded he knew she was sure i know i know it can be dreadful and i know it can be dreary she said finally but this is what i want probation or not i want to work here mike regardless of grandpa this is where i want to be tessa he stared at her troubled he didnt know the first thing about this woman she seemed so sure but he wasnt sure at all all he did know of this woman scared him stupid im rushing you she said softly standing up again finish your breakfast have another cup of coffee and think about it youre on call for the hospital for the next couple of hours thats another reason im waking you now ive been invited to a football match this afternoon and before that im off to do an obstetricians house call an obstetricians to doris the pig she said cheerfully doris should be up to receiving visitors by now im taking the polaroid to get baby snaps for grandpa ill pass on your regards shall i tess of course i shall she said warmly after your help in delivering all those babies itd surprise me if doris hasnt named one of her sons mike she left him to his breakfast and she left him feeling as stunned as hed ever felt in his life before the day passed in a dream for the first time in mike couldnt remember how long he had little to do he checked tessas medical records and found nothing to complain of shed been thorough and competent and careful and there was nothing that he wouldnt have done himself baffled he took strop for a stroll down to the pharmacy to countersign tessas prescriptions your new partners a damned fine girl ralph the towns pharmacist told him our wendy went in this morning all stirred up because her periods are irregular shes getting em every two months and she jumped at the chance of seeing a lady doctor well shes come home happy as a lark dr westcott told her shed have to be the luckiest fourteenyearold girl in the district to get a period only every two months its what her mothers been telling her over and over but do you think wendyd listen but your dr westcott did the trick the pharmacist sighed and dug his hands deep into the pockets of his white coat a woman doctor he said in satisfaction thats what this place needs plus he grinned i can read her handwriting a woman doctor with legible handwriting make her sign on the dotted line this minute yeah right mike came out of the pharmacy still troubled by a sense of unreality this wasnt happening there were the sound of car hooters from down by the river and he glanced at his watch it was midafternoon the local football game would be in full swing football ive been invited to a football match tess had said he paused in indecision he had his mobile phone on his belt the locals played rough and there were always one or two minor injuries so any minute now the phone would buzz into life he didnt want to go back to the surgery ive been invited to a football match what do you reckon strop do you feel like a football match so mike strolled the two blocks to the football field telling himself all the time it was just to save the players the trouble of coming to the surgery not that he believed it for a minute the football competition here was a lowkey australian rules game the ground had been marked out on the river flat which meant whenever the river rose the games had to be cancelled four white posts were stuck in at each end of a roughly painted oval and a players tent had been erected for each team there was also a beer and pie tent that was it as a stadium it left a bit to be desired but what the locals lacked in facilities they made up for in enthusiasm there were cars parked all around the playing field saturday afternoon football here was a town ritual the women watched from the cars with thermos flasks and picnic baskets wedged between them on the front seats many had travelled in from outlying farms and this was their social contact for the week the only way anyone knew they were watching football was when a goal was scored then the hooters blared out from every second car in the place the men were made of sterner stuff though than to stay in the cars they didnt need the warmththey left that to the women bellanors male population spent the game clustered around the beer tenta hundred or so males spread no further than carting distance for the next round the rest of the boundary was left to the kids and the teenagers first off mike released strop from his lead from past experience strop would either spend the match hauling mikes arm off trying to reach the pie tent or hed spend the match staring soulfully at pie tent customers so as far as mike could figure there was no choice dont eat too much he told strop any more than one pie and youre out of the car for a week strop gave his tail a majestic wave and departed at a waddle stropless mike made his way slowly around the ground toward the training tents this was where hed be needed he told himself trying hard not to keep a weather eye out for tess but somehow he found her tess was right in the middle of a huddle of teenagers and what she was wearing it was just plain extraordinary or maybe it wasnt plain at all tess wore bright purple leggings a brilliant yellow jacket and a purple cap with a yellow pompom oh and purple doc martens on her feet for good measure he blinked the colours of the teams on the ground were red and black stripes and black and white stripes respectively so in this sea of red and black and white tess stood out like a sore thumb she was sublimely oblivious tessa was perched on the bonnet of alf sarrets fj holden alf was a nineteenyearold car fanatic who polished his car twice a day and wouldnt let anyone look sideways at it much less sit on it but tessa was definitely sitting on it and she was talking and laughing as if she was nineteen years old and had known these kids all her life she saw him from ten yards away and a brilliant purple arm shot upwards in a wave mike come over here isnt this the craziest game the kids have been teaching me the rulesor rather trying to teach me the rules i think you need to be a thirdgeneration australian to understand them why arent you wearing team colours and who are we barracking for who are we the kids say i need to choose and i need to choose now she said apparently i cant stay in this town without swearing allegiance to a bellanor football club the only trouble isdo i swear allegiance to bellanor south football club or bellanor north football club she looked around at her crowd of bemused teenagers the camp here appears to be evenly divided she said and i know grandpa hates football so i figureif you and i intend to be partners then id better barrack for who you barrack for she grinned the kids say otherwise well fight if you and i intend to be partners he thought fleetingly of what hed always imagined a partner might be hed thought of a sober conscientious middleaged doctor with whom he could share the load not thisthisthis pompommed purple and yellow apparition jancourt he said faintly it was all he could think of to say and the word was met by a howl of derision from the teenagers yeah tessa wasnt put off by the teenagers reaction her eyes rested on mikes face and she twinkled down at him she dug her hands deep into the pockets of her extraordinary yellow jacket and nodded ok if you say so mike then ill barrack for jancourt tell me about our team but jancourts hopeless alf interrupted he had nobly allowed tess to sit on his car and was now acting as if he was in charge of her dont do it doc jancourts the lousiest team they lose every week jancourts more a name than a place mike agreed its all they can do to scratch eighteen men in fact sometimes they play with up to half a dozen men short and their back line has an average age of about sixty it sounds just my sort of team tessa said with aplomb and mike grinned it is he told her if you barrack for north or south bellanor then every monday morning youll be looked at by half the population as if its all your fault that theyre feeling ill if you barrack for jancourtwell every monday morning all youll get is sympathy very wise tess seemed perfectly satisfied with the logic and what are our colours sorry tessa not purple and yellow rats these are the colours of my very favourite football team at home the vikings theyre a bit loud mike said faintly and tessas smile widened loud you want loud the true vikings uniform has a hat with horns or i could be a fan of the green bay packers my mom follows the green bay packers and she gets to wear cheese on her head this is sedate in comparison cheese tess had the whole bunch of teenagers riveted to their conversation and tessa was revelling in it i kid you not she chuckled i swear green bay packer fans wear vast slabs of cheese on their headsdont ask me why the vikings are a sensible sane football team that a sensible sane girl like me can follow with pride ill follow them to the deathill even wear hornsbut when football clubs expect their fans to wear cheeses and a girls mother says shes being undutiful by changing to the vikings well its enough to make a girl migrate all the way to australia i expect it is mike managed faintly so what are the jancourt team colours she demanded cream and brown ugh tessas pert nose wrinkled in distaste then she shrugged never mind i love purple and yellow but i cant have everything her smile returned in full and mike could only stare tess looked totally perfectly happy she looked as if shed lived here all her life and as if there was nothing more she could ask of life than to sit in a cold wind on a teenage boys ancient jalopy and cheer a football game where she didnt even understand the rules shed fit into this valley as if shed been born here mike thought wondering in one half of one football game tess had managed to woo and win the towns teenage population the group tess was in made up the most popular kids in town and there were more teenagers sidling up to the edges of the group every minute by tomorrow the word would be around town that there was a new lady doctor in town and she was great oh hell there was a sudden howl from the crowd a tackle had brought one of the forwards down and the injured player was clutching his knee in agony out on the field mike sighed and dragged his attention from tess well there goes my quiet time he said with resignation ill leave you to your friends dr westcott hey im coming too she slid off the car and tucked her arm into his im your partner ok her smile widened ive always dreamed of running onto the field as team doctor its one of my career goals like at the movies when they interrupt with is there a doctor in the house they did it all the time before i graduated but never since well im sorry to disappoint you but im not running onto any ground he told her firmly watching as the trainers raced over to the injured player with a stretcher at the ready ill only go if they yell that hes stopped breathing even then ill wait until he turns blue the players here have a nasty habit of getting on with the game regardless the only thing they ever stop for is strop and thats because he eats the ball it took me months to teach him the pie tent was a better place to hang out than the centre of the playing field youre kidding tessas face creased in laughter its not a good doctor imageto have a balleating dog no mike said darkly if i had my time again youd have him put down well tess chuckled and tucked her arm tighter in his yeah i know tough heman dr llewellynwith the squishy edges so were not running out on the ground last time i went onto the ground i got hit in the face with the ball mike was incredibly aware of her proprietary arm it made him feel as if every nerve in his body were alightbut then itd seem churlish to haul it away the player only had a bruised knee but i copped a bloody nose and a black eye he managed they had to help me off its not a good professional look tessa chuckled she walked easily beside him her arm still tucked in his so where do we do our doctoring she asked the red tent the player whos coming off is wearing red for bellanor north oh right ill remember that she would too he thought tessas quick intelligent mind was busy tucking in item after item of what shed term useful information you wouldnt need to tell her anything twice i dont think youre supposed to come into the training tent he said faintly the rules are rigid women arent allowed oh pooh she said blithely im not a woman here dr llewellyn im a doctor and she glanced up at him sideways and twinkled do you reckon thats something you can remember it seems to me that its really important and what the hell was he to make of that jason keeling was clutching his leg in agony by the time they reached him the trainers had deposited him on the bench and were looking down helplessly jason wasnt letting them near his leg he was curled almost into a foetal position hanging onto his leg for dear life and swearing as if his life depended on it ok jason lets have a look mike said bending over him and trying to see jason didnt look up he was whimpering in pain and the swearing didnt ease one bit hey i dont know half those words it was tess of course it was tess she stood back from jason and regarded him with frank admiration and jason was so stunned to hear a woman in the training room that momentarily he forgot to swear he looked up from his leg and uncurled a bit who the hell are you he demanded im one half of the bellanor medical team she said blithely the better half show us your leg jason and jason was so flabbergasted that his hands fell away from his leg mike was in there before he could put them back holding his leg and gently easing it to an extended position fancy this happening just as you were winning tess said sympathetically she perched on the end of the bench and put a sympathetic hand on his cheek mike could only bless her for all jason keeling was six feet six inches of pure beef he was a real wimp when it came to pain now though tess had his full attention and mike could run his hands carefully over the injured limb he couldnt feel a break what do you meanone half of the bellanor medical team jason demanded the team trainers were staring at tess as if shed just flown in from mars and so was jason mike might just as well not have been present im a doctor she chuckled as she glanced around at the mens astounded expressions believe it or not thats what i am mike said i might have to prove my qualifications or youll throw me out of the training tent you can stay in any training tent you want miss one of the trainers breathed and ill personally chuck out anyone who says different thats really nice of you tessas eyes danced as she twisted to look down at the injured leg still her hand rested on jasons face she was sitting so close to him that her crazy yellow jacket was brushing his body and jason was clearly completely thrown by the sensation whats the damage dr llewellyn she asked do you think we need to amputate do i get to hold him down while you chop it off i reckon we might manage without amputation mike grinned in return to examine jason when he was in pain was usually a nightmare but she had jason absolutely silenced now she shifted from the bench to support jasons leg as mike carefully ran his hands from the knee down he watched jasons face as he did but jason didnt utter a whimper what happened jason i was running jason muttered i just felt somethinglike a bang like something snapped jasons eyes were still on tessa fascinated mike nodded moving to feel above the ankle his suspicions were being confirmed here there was a definite notching can you move your ankle jason will your toes lift jason stared wildly from tessa to mike trying to collect his wits it was as if he was having trouble remembering he had a leg at all tessas pompoms and her gorgeous red hair had him in thrall finally he shook his head nah then his face creased again as he remembered his wimpishness and he remembered his pain i reckon we might get some morphine on board mike told him hastily thatll ease the pain but whats wrong whats wrong i think youve torn your achilles tendon its hard to say whether its a complete tear or not without a fuller examination but thats what it feels like aw hell hey it beats a compound fracture tessa told him mike was settling the leg back on the bench tessa turned to touch jason lightly again on the face and jason stared up at her in stupefaction its not much better i guess she said sympathetically but a little but itll mean i miss the rest of the season jason wailed ill have to stay on the sidelines and watch like me tessa said cheerfully i know nothing about this game back home in the states i love football here though it sure looks different i need someone who knows it inside out to teach me whats happening you look like just the manthat is if you dont mind me barracking for jancourt jancourt jason lay back on the bench and stared up at her in stupefaction jancourt why the hell are you barracking for jancourt dr llewellyn said i should tessa said blithely and hes my boss now its always wise to do what your boss saysdont you think yeah right jason couldnt think of a single thing more to say and neither could mike there was only one more medical case for the afternoona bruised hamstring muscle that could be left safely in the hands of the trainersso they got to watch most of the game jason was sent to the hospital hed need to be checked later and the leg properly xrayed and examined but before that the nurses could clean away the worst of the mud and his family could fuss and generally settle him down there wasnt much more to be done in the short term what if its a complete tear tessa asked as they sat on the trainers seats and watched the bellanor north players storm their way to victory well send him to melbourne theres no one closer to do orthopaedic surgery if the achilles tendon was completely separated then it would have to be surgically joined a partial tear would heal itself given several weeks immobilisation in plaster but a full tear wasnt quite as easy i could do it mike said heavily he was feeling really odd sitting beside this girl she was acting as if theyd known each other for everas if they were partners in every sense of the word and yet hell he felt strange youve done surgical training she asked i trained for this job he told her i knew id be isolated when i came to work here so i got myself training in everything i could get my hands on theres not a lot of emergency medicine i cant do but ive found its not a lot of use if i dont have an anaesthetist i can give an anaesthetic you now dont say it like im a porriwiggle she begged the fact that im american doesnt mean im lowlife im not even wearing a cheese hat she swung her head to prove it and her crazy purple pompoms bounced she wouldnt need to give an anaesthetic mike thought she only had to wiggle her pompoms and she had a man mesmerised she could do anything she wanted look it doesnt matter whether you can give an anaesthetic or not he managed youre not registered you cant but maureen says shell swing my registration within twentyfour hours from the medical board opening for business on monday jasons surgerys not urgent we could do it tuesday what sort of anaesthetic work have you done he asked hell he was fascinated he was trying to listennot watch general once more the pompom waggled i told you ive always fancied the idea of moving to the country i was thinking i might do er in a smaller country hospital so i figured anaestheticsyou know intubation and pain relief and the restmight give me an edge then i sort of changed my mind i wanted kids and dogs and prostates instead of car smashes and drug overdoses but ive done a solid basic training in anaesthetics im not volunteering to give the anaesthetic for open heart surgery here but i can certainly give a healthy hunk of beef like jason a guaranteed sleep mike fell silent he stared out over the football ground his mind racing what on earth an anaesthetist right on his patch look im not asking you to take me on trust here tessa said mistaking his expression ring my exboss on monday and run through my credentials with him dont take me at face value i wouldnt myself then she grimaced as the phone on mikes belt rang ugh that was what mike felt he didnt want more work now or did he maybe he did need an excuse to leave and think things through the game was just coming to an end the siren blared and the field erupted into red and black madness a hundred car horns hooted mike turned away and covered his exposed ear while he talked into the phone by the time hed finished tessa was clapping the jubilant players off the field for all the world as if it was grand final day she totally understood the game shed been watching and shed been supporting these players for years to mikes bemusement when the losing side ran off the field she greeted them with just the same enthusiasm as mike came up behind her she turned and grinned at him ok ive clapped till my hands are sore was that another call do we need to go i need to go it wasnt that he didnt want tessa beside him he thought he figured it was just that he needed to get away for a while he badly needed time to think stan harpers a sixtyyearold farmer who lives out the other side of jancourt he told her he rang to say hes having chest pain yeah her smile faded heart in a way he smiled a trifle bleakly and shook his head stans wife died six months ago since then he gets chest pain every few weeks or so and he panics ive run the gamut of tests on him and theres nothing wrong but youll go anyway tessas face softened yeah well he could get stan to drive himself in to the hospital itd be safe enough but he knew what stan really wanted stan wanted mike to care about him a bitto fuss like his cathy had and to tell him he wasnt alone in the world he wanted someone to share a beer and stare at a few cows and talk about the outcome of a football match that stan wasnt ready to face without cathy yeah ill go but i do need to go by myself sorry he bit his lip at the sound of the words he sounded surly how else was he supposed to sound he didnt know he needed to figure out some way to get things on a solid sensible footing here he decided maybe he needed to talk to this girl for a while yeah that was it he needed to know all about her medical training and he needed to know soon before he made a decision about sending jason away for surgery tess i should be back in town by about seven he said slowly thinking his mental diary through he wasnt expected at the shire ball until nine there was time to talk first especially if they did it over a meal theres some steak in my refrigerator im going out to the shire ball later but well we could eat first talk about things id love that she beamed and the thing was settled before he had a chance to say another wordor before he had a chance to decide whether he was totally stupid or not ill meet you in your apartment at seven she said unless you need me beforehand meanwhile ill stay here and celebrate or commiserate and then ill go and sit with grandpa a while but ill be there at seven mike steak sounds fantastic hell he felt like he was being steamrollered here but there was little he could do about it and maybemaybe it was what he wanted i justneed to collect strop he said weakly hes over at the pie tent of course hes over at the pie tent tess grinned i should have known strop would be here and where strop would be while he was here dont worry about him ill take him home are you sure absolutely it would be my very great pleasure to take care of your dog dr llewellyn and as he moved away mike swore he heard a faint echo and it would be my very great pleasure to take care of you surely he must have been mistaken as hed thought there was nothing the matter with stan harper mike gave him a thorough onceover but his vital signs were all just as a healthy sixtyyearolds should be stan accepted the verdict with resignationhell it was almost as if the man wanted a heart attackand poured him a beer they went out to sit on the back verandah to drink it in what was almost becoming a ritual i missed you at the game mike told him staring out over the mountains at the setting sun your team lost they dont play the same without you holding up the bar and cheering for them or cathy hooting for all shes worth in the car stan said morosely i know we never stayed together at the footy but she was always there i dont know doc it doesnt seem the same without her nothings the same there was nothing to say to that mike took a swig of beer and stared some more out over the paddocks this was all he could do for this man to be here to be a mate why the hell dont you get married stan demanded suddenly he filled his glass again and turned his attention full on mike a mans a fool if he doesnt get married everyones different yeah but youre not a natural loner you could do with a good woman stan eyed mike with speculation in his eyes your mum was a bonzer woman maybe thats why i dont get married mike said uneasily no one measures up theres good women around your mum my cathy you just gotta look stan frowned into his glass deep in thought at one level mike welcomed this conversation it made him uncomfortable but at least stan was thinking about something other than his misery what about this new lady doctor stan said and all of a sudden the conversation was totally unwelcome what about her they say shes a knockout mike thought of the purple pompoms and could only agree how about it doc stan demanded are you interested no why not im too busy to be thinking about a love life then think about this girl instead stan said warmly not a love life a future a lady doctor as a wife thatd mean half the workload and someone warm beside you in bed at night a mand be a fool to look a gift horse like that in the mouth yeah a mand be a fool a man was a fool anyway chapter seven mike was late for dinner but tess didnt wait for him he arrived back at the hospital to find tess had taken dinner into her own hands he opened his apartment door and there she was what are you doing here he stopped dead at the door his nose wrinkling in automatic appreciation of the smells wafting toward him you asked me to dinnerremember she glanced at her wrist half an hour ago strop and i had the choice of sitting on the doorstep and looking bereft or taking some action and looking bereft isnt our style i can see that he said faintly bereft she looked anything but bereft thats a great outfit she looked down and grinned she was wearing a soft white frock but had covered it with a green theatre gown from the hospital linen supply on someone else it might have looked ridiculous it didnt look the least bit ridiculous on tess you dont have an apron she said accusingly she looked around the flat in fact you dont seem to have a lot dr llewellyn do you believe in a nice spartan existence its what i like holy heck he was out of his depth here but you like your dog someoneit must have been tessmust have fed strop or maybe hed eaten one pie too many to appreciate the smells tess was conjuring up he was lying full length under the table gently snoring now tess motioned out the window towards one truly magnificent handbuilt doghouse it was about four feet in length painted in gold and red with magnificent greek lettering across the front stropacropolis you built that tess asked awed he had a broken hip when i got him mike said weakly it was the least i could do and like jacob you always do the least you can do i can see that about you tessas eyes were warm you know dr llewellyn i think im beginning to like you very very much good i meangreat mike clipped his words desperately precluding further discussion domesticity was threatening to swamp him here the feeling that this was right that this was how it could be that he was beginning to like this woman right back he walked over and scooped up a fingerload of fried onions trying to shake off the feeling of unreality tess hauled the pan away with the firmness of a matriarch no you dont go and wash while i cook the steak ill bet youre all covered with patient or antiseptic or something disgusting and i wont have my steak compromised do you like it medium or rare i dont do well done its a crime to burn meat like this she motioned to mikes steakstwo enormous tbones we believe in steak in the us but i havent seen steak like this for years welcome to australia then dr westcott mike smiled faintly and went obediently towards the bathroom as ordered he walked slowly though and looked back over his shoulder at the slim girl presiding over his stove in her theatre gown and vivid curls good grief mike did more than just wash he changed from his tailored work trousers to casual jeans and opennecked shirt taking the time to try and calm his thoughts he emerged to his kitchenette to find tess minus her theatre gown now attractively demure in her lovely white dress she looked every inch the hostess as she served up two laden plates with mike her invited guest and mikes pleasant calm thoughts which hed taken such pains to achieve got all stirred up again he didnt speak even if he could have thought of something to say he wasnt given the chance sit down his own personal matriarch ordered i hope you dont mind me opening your wine hannah gave me the key to your apartment from the nurses station she looked at me every which way when i said we were eating together sort of with a you too look in her eye and she wasnt very nice have you two had a relationship mikes eyebrows hit his hairline no i mean i dont see what business it is so theres never been anything between you dont let your steak get cold tess added kindly as mike sank down at the table its fabulous no mike chopped into his steak and took a large mouthful of meat his eyebrows rose even further the wine marinade tess had used on the steak was magnificent tessa this is great it is isnt it she said warmly we do steak in the states but you aussies do steak not like this we dont mike said warmly the sensation of coming home to this was almost taking his breath away so tell me why hannah hester looked at me like shed enjoy taking me out at dawn with a pistol apiecewith hers loaded and mine jinxed so itd blow up in my hand i have no idea you havent gone out with her tessa i dont know what business of yours my relationships are what have you put on this steak its marvellous red wine garlic lemon juice and a few herbs nothing special tessas face was serious as she spoke and he could see her mind wasnt on the meat mike hannah says i should make arrangements for grandpa to move into the nursing home she says its impossible for him to stay on the farm and she says ill go around the twist here in a matter of months she thinks i wont stay yeah mike sliced another piece of steak and it followed its predecessor his smile faded to match tessas look of seriousness hannah hester was an interfering busybody whose chief skill was upsetting relatives if it wasnt so hard to find good nurses hed sack her on the spot and shed upset tessa the silence continued but it wasnt uncomfortable he watched tessas face as they ate and finally he probed hannahs really upset you worse than that tess said she finished the last of her steak and pushed her plate away she upset grandpa by talking right in front of him she treated him as if he wasnt there and any nurse worth her salt knows better than to think stroke victims cant hear no matter how paralysed they are he frowned tess hannahs a fine nurse she might be fine with her clinical skills but shes not good with people in fact shes awful mike sighed he could only agree tess this place well its a closed community i know hannahs not great its as if she has a permanent chip on her shoulder and try as i may i can never seem to get her onside ill speak to her but i cant afford to sack her and she knows it welltrained nurses are like hens teeth around here theyre so scarce they hardly exist i know that tess said tightly thats the reasonthe only reasoni didnt slug her she cheered up then and smiled heavens the girl was a real chameleon changing in front of his eyes that and the fact that shes bigger than me i see he grinned i can just see the pair of you slugging it out in the hospital corridor very professional his smile faded again seriously tess you need to get along with the only professional staff the valley has you value their skills and in time you learn to undo the damage an uncaring person can do yeah her smile was back again now in force i know and i think i did i told grandpa he had to get better now just to prove hannah wrong its given him another motivationas if he didnt have enough already see youre learning yeah well as long as shes just not being hurtful to grandpa to get at me because shes jealous well thats just plain ridiculous he said firmly attacking his steak again why is it she asked slowly why is it ridiculous for hannah to be jealous she has a boyfriend did she have one when you first came back here no but then maybe she fell for you women dont fall for me tess raised her eyebrows and said nothing she finished her steak carried her plate and wineglass to the sink set her plate down and then stood and eyed mike thoughtfully as he finished he could sense there was something coming here something really important she had that major impertinence look in her eye he was beginning to know this woman didnt understand the meaning of the word personal and finally she said it youre sure youre not gay dr llewellyn she frowned into her wineglass and then fixed him with a speculative look i know youve told me youre not gay but youre kind and youre sensitive and youre goodlooking you make good money and you drive a smashing car so how that combination hasnt been grabbed and held onto she brought her eyebrows together and her eyes probed hisas though sticking an insect on a pin for examination are you sure he might have known he grinned no dr westcott i am not gay he said firmly he rose and carried his plate towards her instinctively tess took a step back putting distance between herself and mike until she had the information she wanted are you married then divorced widowed separated who wants to know me she shot back at him and what business is it of yours none at all she said calmly but youre intending to be a working partner of mine and at least one nurse has now insinuated im setting my cap at you i just want to know whether to tell her such a thing is ridiculous and id really like to know that its not that was pretty blatant he blinked what was happening here mike stared down at tess and she stared straight back up at himand he could read her mind like a book it was almost as if she was propositioning him if shed been a man shed be buying roses and chocolates and laying siege grabbing whoa it is ridiculous he said curtly he gave her a strained look and put his plate on the sink how the hell was he expected to handle this tessa looked just lovely her soft white dress was lowcut and clinging her eyes were huge in her elfin face and the few freckles scattered across the bridge of her nose were immenselyincrediblyappealing they needed to be kissed whoa no dr westcott he managed weakly im not married engaged widowed involved or even gay but neither do i intend to be why ever not im married to my work he said shortly ive just taken a heap of your work off you does that mean ill be hauled up before the divorce courts as corespondent her voice was gently teasing but he hardly heard he stood by the sink and stared at her fighting for control theres more than enough work to keep us both frantic he told her heavily but i dont intend to be frantic she lifted her chin my medicines important to me but its not everything i still intend to look after my grandfather i still intend to have a life my life is my medicine i can see that she moistened her lips she felt strange as if someone else was inside her body and that someone was a woman she hardly knew that someone was so strongly drawn to mike that she had hardly any control at all it seems such a waste she murmured a waste he looked sardonically at her waste for who a waste for me silence the words echoed round and round the room astounding in their simplicity what on earth do you mean by that he said at lastand then his face closed as if he regretted the question tess also should have regretted her statement his question was a question tess shouldnt be able to answer she should just mumble an apologygive a silly giggle and get the hell out of here before she made a real fool of herself instead she took a long deep breath and met his eyes with a look of pure defiance the womans role was to stay demure and shy mike thought wildly that was how he could cope but how could he cope with a woman who was coming on like tessa was coming on like she found him wildly attractive and didnt care who knew it especially she didnt mind if mike knew it she wanted him to know exactly how she felt and how she felt was written right across her face i mean that youre the most attractive male ive ever met she said softly i mean that youre gentle and kind and caring and i just have to look at you and my knees sort of wobble underneath me i mean that hannah got it right when she said that one of the reasons i want to stay here is that id like to get to know you better she said that she said that and its true oh its not the only reason she added hastily as his face closed of course im staying for my grandfather she took a deep breath fighting for words but if you want a partner with knees that dont wobble youd better tell me now that you find red hair a real turnoff or that youre into stamp collecting instead of women she gave a twisted smile and i dont believe im saying this i dont believe you are either mike said faintly women dont say these sort of things i just did well no one has before he said bluntly tess dont tell me women dont find you attractive she shot at him she took a deep breath and managed a smile damn there was a glimmer behind her eyes that told mike that a part of tess was enjoying herself here she was enjoying knocking his socks off and the rest tess put her hands on the kitchen bench behind her and hitched herself up so she was sitting her lovely stockinged legs swinging free as she watched the man before her and he stared back at her as if shed just crawled out of a spaceship maybe women have he admitted finally but no ones told me aw gee poor little you hasnt anyone told you they find you very sexy and mike couldnt help himself he burst out laughing tessa westcott you are incorrigible i thought lady doctorsespecially lady doctors trained in emergency medicine and whove seen everything the seamier side of life can throw at themare supposed to be as sensible and hardheaded and as romantic as a brick they are she told him and she grinned right back she was crazy but there was a very strong part of her that was enjoying being crazy shed just burned her bridges back to the states in fact shed just abandoned a very sensible career plan and a very sensible boyfriend albeit a very lukewarm one if she wasnt a little crazy tonight then she never would be they say the only thing a sensible committed female doctor with career ambition should love is a goldfish she said blithely but ive thought it through and i think youre much better than a goldfish gee thanks mike looked at her for a long moment and then walked two steps forward and took her hands in his he had to make her see tess this is crazy it wasnt crazy at all taking her hands was a mistake a huge mistake the craziness disappeared right then and there as their hands touched crazy or not its the way i feel she said heaven knew how she kept her voice light but somehow tess managed it well stop feeling like it he released her but he didnt move they were only inches apart but tessas eyes were just above his from her perch on the bench hell how to make her see that this linkwhat she said she could feel and what he could definitely feelwas totally absolutely out of the question tessa what im saying about work is true he managed thats all i want i have room for nothing else im very small tess murmured couldnt you squash me in around the edges no he stopped smiling completely and took a step back his face said the joke had gone far enough youre not a priest tess said gently id love to know why you have room in your life for nothing but medicine ive seen what can happen when people forget their responsibilities im not asking you to forget your responsibilities tess too had stopped smiling now she jumped down from her bench and stepped forwardstepped forward so she was almost touching him her face said she had gone this far so she might as well try the whole bit mike im not asking you to marry me she said and somehow she forced her voice to stay light what im saying is that theres something between us something she shrugged i dont know what its a feeling i cant define its a feeling ive never felt in my life before and i want more than anything to explore it that sounds wanton doesnt it as if im a loose woman im not mike im just i just feel and then her voice firmed as if she was suddenly sure of her ground i feel as if youre a part of me thats crazy isnt it but thats the way it is so tell me mike she demanded tell me that im a fool tell me that you feel nothing i dont want im not asking what you want im asking what you feel and then before he could answer she took one more step forward put her arms up around his neck stood on tiptoeand she kissed him for all she was worth and it was done so suddenly that there was nothing he could do to stop it it was some kiss it was a kiss of pure bravado but it was more than that it was a kiss that was full of questions and it was a kiss full of wonder tess had never done such a thing in her life before her act might have seemed wantonforwardbut there was nothing of that in her kiss her lips were gentle sweet and unsure as if she really wanted to touch him it was as if her body was drawn to him like a bee to honey and she was half expecting to be drawn so far into the sweetness that shed drown and he the last thing he wanted to do was to kiss this woman he didnt and yet her lips were touching his and her body was soft and yielding andand so lovely when her mouth touched his the kiss slammed home the knowledge that this was something outside his ken she was so desirable sure hed kissed other women hell hed made a vow but that vow hadnt been one of chastity his vow had been one of emotional detachment hed made love to women before but theyd always known the rules no involvement there had never been any promises of tomorrow there was only passion on his terms but thisthis wasnt on his terms this was on no ones terms because as their lips met it was like two pieces of a shattered whole being joined more it was like tinder to fuel apart they were nothingcold and useless together they were fire mikes body stilled in shock but tessas arms came around him again soft and yet urgent pulling him against her and suddenly nothing in his life had ever felt so right so complete there were forces working here that were beyond his control he thought wildly this was beyond anything hed ever known before the desire to respond to this lovely thingthis woman who was so unknownwas almost overwhelming her lips were soft and warm and urgent she smelt of flowers of sunshine and of warmth and he could no more resist her loveliness than he could stop himself breathing he wasnt breathing he wasnt sure what he was doing he couldnt help himself he must respond his hands fell to hold tessa against him glorying in the way her breasts pressed against his chest his mouth responded to her kiss tasting herwanting her and wanting more dear god what could he do with this hed never known he could feel this way his vow had been made without knowing this wonder and if hed known if hed known he had this needthat somewhere in the world was a woman like thiscould he have made his vow but hed made the vow and the vow still stood somehow he managed to pull back somehow he managed to put her away from him and hold her at arms length and he stared down at her with eyes that were confused and desperate tess no well now i know tess managed in a voice that was barely above a whisper and held an obvious tremor know what youre certainly not gay she tried to smile but it didnt quite come off wow wow was right and where to go from here the phone glory be the phone its shrill ring sounded from the living room and mike headed there like a drowning man headed for a liferaft hello dr llewellyn it was mavis at reception is that you it obviously didnt sound like him yes mike cleared his throat and with a superhuman effort managed not to look back to where tess was standing watching from the doorway of course mavis what is it ive just had a call from kylie wisen mavis told him and her voice was apologetic it was as though she knew she was interrupting something and shed just love to know what you know kylie mikes head clicked into medical mode with a visible effort and he gave his mental case file a quick search kylie thats bill and claire wisens kid seventeen years old peroxided hair and half a dozen earrings thats the one mavis sighed shes looking after her sisters twoyearold while her sister and her husband go out to dinner and then go on to the shire ball but but but the little onesally mcphersonhas stuck her big toe in the bath outlet mavis sighed again im really sorry doctor but theyve tried everything to get it out and i think youll have to go go of course he had to go thanks be ill be there in five minutes mike said strongly still not looking at tess mavis ring kylie back and tell her im coming tell her the most important thing is not to let sally pull if the toe gets swollen from tugging then well be in all sorts of trouble he replaced the receiver and finally turned to face tess again i need to go he said i know her eyes didnt leave his face i heard can i come tess the sooner i get to know the people of this town the better itll be for both of us she glanced at her watch i have an hour before i promised louise id momsit and you have an hour before you need to go your ball strops not much companyso lets go unstick toes i dont you want me she let her face fall like a child deprived of a lolly hell he couldnt work with her he thought desperately watching her face and trying to figure out whether to laugh or to groan he couldnt but he sure as hell couldnt tell her he didnt want her fine then he said in a voice that indicated hed been goaded beyond belief fine lets go do some medicine it might get your mind off sex hey my minds not on sex she teased gently her eyes laughing up at him and then the smile died a little my mind doesnt get past your face then she gave an honest little shrug and her smile came back in full wellfor the moment sally was still attached to her bath they arrived to find neighbours two members of the fire brigade a mechanic and a hefty plumber complete with dangerouslooking tool set all trying to wedge into one small farmhouse bathroom mike had obviously been the last of a long line of people appealed to sally mcpherson was two years old and in deep distress she was huddled naked and sobbing in the empty bath and her sobs were those of a child whod gone past expecting help the noise in the little room was overwhelming lets clear this room tess suggested firmly as mike went straight to the little girl he saw her need the child was sitting alone in the empty bathtub and why the hell wasnt anyone in there holding her right mike reached in and held the little girls shoulders gripping her tight ok sally well get you out of here soon but first lets get you warm we need sallys parents and the plumber tessa said brusquely and mike gave her a wondering glance shed snapped straight back into medical mode what had taken place between them belonged somewhere else she was now crisp decisive and every inch a doctor trained to cope with trauma the rest of you id like you to stay outside until youre needed now whos sallys mom shes not here a girl with peroxided blonde hair and too much makeup told her im kylie the kids aunty my sister and her husband have gone out to dinner and i dont know where theyve gone it was supposed to be the pub but its burned down so they went somewhere else she glared aggressively as though expecting tess to turn on her and say it was all her fault one of the neighbours is doing a ringround of their friends to try and find them the plumber volunteered he turned to mike who was lifting the child forward to take the strain from the toe doc ive been thinking he said the hassle with the outlet on old baths is that the outlets dont screw usually its a cinch if a kid gets stuck because you just turn the whole outlet around while someone turns the kid at the same timeso they both come out together and at least you can work on getting the thing off when theyre out of the bath this is an old type though its a permanent fixtureglued fast then well have to chip it out mike said he was practically in the bath now gathering the child to him shes freezing i want blankets and hotwater bottles fast i figured youd say chip it the plumber said in satisfaction ive got the tools here ready i would have done it before but i didnt like to when the kiddy was so distressed and thrashing about like i reckon though whats bestd be if i get underneath the house and cut through the pipe then if i chip it from underneath i wont upset the kid as much with luck the whole thing will lift up itll just be a matter of supporting the kid while we do it do it mike said his eyes on the little girls face they needed to get her out of there fast she was showing signs of going into shock could you hop in the bath and cuddle her tess asked kylie she cast a quick glance at mike and mike nodded his agreement warmth and reassurance were what this child needed more than anything whathop in the teenage babysitter was clearly horrified do as she says kylie mike ordered and tess almost grinned as the teenager gazed at mike in dismay but then did what she was told mike had some authority in this town there werent many people who could tell a teenager to sit in a bath in front of witnesses and be obeyed in two minutes they had the sulky teenager sitting right in the bath with the child lying back on her lap without her mum to comfort the child it was the best they could hope for while mike examined the toe tess sent a couple of the women to find hotwater bottles and she replaced the single towel around the childs body with a big fluffy blanket shes been pulling mike said softly looking from the swollen toe to the white drained face of the little girl the fact that the child was now silent was ominous the old medical adage was never worry too much about a child whos screaming if a childs quiet then worry i think we might administer some pethidine dr westcott mike said and tess nodded she retrieved what he needed from his bag and prepared it theres no way well get the toe out by pulling mikes fingers were carefully probing the little foot the whole foots swollen now our best chance is to manoeuvre it free once we have both sides exposed there was a thumping under the house and the sound of mens voices the plumber obviously had backup the child started whimpering again and kylie put her face in the childs hair hey hush sally sally kylie said softly weve got two doctors on top and a big plumber underneath cutting your toe out well be able to take the pipe to playschool for show and tell and if were lucky the fireman might give you a ride in the fire engine good girl tess said warmly underneath the makeup and the earrings and the bravado there was a good kid kylie must have been almost as scared as sally facing this on her own the change in kylie seemed to affect sallyor maybe it was the pethidine kicking in the little girl lay slumped on kylies lap and let them do as they willed and five minutes later the whole bath outlet and three inches of outlet pipe lifted upwards and the little foot was free free from the bath but not from the pipe now what kylie said uneasily gathering the little girl closer pipe and all we get her to the hospital mike said he could see the tip of the toe now and he wasnt happy it had no colour at all there wasnt time to immobilise it and wait for the swelling to settle before they tried to free it i want my mummy the child whimpered and buried her head in kylies breast yeah well i ought to have found out where they were going kylie muttered close to tears herself and mike put his hand on her shoulder they should have told you lets not blame yourself here kylie youre doing a great job then he looked at tess his mind working over options how do you feel about giving an anaesthetic dr westcott under supervision of course tess met his look and bit her lip she knew what he was asking here mike llewellyn was asking an unregistered doctor to give a general anaesthetic to a child without her parents consent if she didnt the child would lose her big toe and if she didthe legal ramifications were vast tess theres no choice mike said heavily i know its a lot to ask but ill take all legal responsibility ill put it in writing if you like you trust me yes he said and he did he met her look and he nodded yes he was sure tess might be flirtatious and frivolous but he had the gut feeling that whatever else she was she was a damned fine doctor ok lets do it tess said softly she smiled at kylie a big cheery smile that was meant to totally reassure her isnt it lucky that i came all the way from the states she said i must have just known that dr llewellyn couldnt manage even a stuck toe without me much to mikes relief they got the toe out without sawing the bath pipe right back to the skin tessas anaesthetic procedure was extremely competent as mike had guessed it would be and once hed reassured himself that she knew exactly what she was doing he was free to deal with the toe their friendly plumber looking like a big green bear with his overalls covered by a theatre gown cut the pipe again this time half an inch from the toe that meant mike could work on the toe from both sides he applied cold compresses to the toe the nursethe horrible hannah who was so nice in mikes presenceapplied warm cloths to the metal to get maximum expansion while mike carefully applied lubricant to the toe then with gentle pressure from the front of the toe he was able to finally push from one side and pull from the other the toe came free with a pop and tess looked up from her dials to see colour seeping back into it almost instantaneously oh well done she said and she started reversal straight away there was no point keeping sally asleep a moment longer than needed and there was now no drama well done to you tess mike said softly looking along the table to where she was carefully monitoring sallys breathing he hadnt been in the least concerned about the anaesthetic he realised as he gently massaged the little toe one look at tessas confident preparation had put his mind at ease the lady knew her job so now what he thought now what it was almost unbelievable out of the blue hed been granted one fine doctora doctor with skills in anaesthetics and trauma medicine if hed hunted australia for a new partner he couldnt have found anyone better once she was registered there was nothing they couldnt do he thought suddenlyjubilantly all the minor surgery that he currently sent awaythe road accidents that he couldnt cope with on his ownthe urgent stuff hed lost patients in the past because thered been only one of him when hed needed two if she really was willing to stay she was he knew she was but there were strings or rather there was a string one stringand that string was emotional involvement hell he could have this girl as a partner and keep his distance he must he couldnt think clearly when she was near his mind felt weird nowfuzzed at the edges it was the way hed always known hed feel if ever he let go theres no need for you to stay now he told tess brusquely and even hannah threw him a curious glance he sounded strained and angrynot as if hed just performed a successful operation if youre supposed to be looking after louises mum mmm tess glanced at her watch and then back to mike her face expressionless the ball starts at nine thats twenty minutes ago arent you due to be there im meeting liz inside liz my date oh right of course your date tessas eyes twinkled a little not your lover tess ok ok she held up her hands in mock defeat and looked down at the pathetic little bundle coming into life on the table im off you take care good of sally there had been no need to say thatshe knew he would ill tell kylie that she can come in now shall i and her parents are they here yet if theyre not ill stay here until they come he said heavily and until sallys fully out of the anaesthetic liz wont mind if im late ill bet she will tess said softly thoughtfully ill just bet she will mind mike llewellyn but she wont say so it seems to me that you have the ladies in the valley too well trained for their own good id drink to that hannah retorted before she could stop herself and tess grinned so did hannah which left mike feeling stupid chapter eight as balls went it was a fizzer maybe it was the tragedy of the fire the night before that was casting a pall over the night or maybe it was just that mike wasnt in the mood for dancing it wasnt his partners fault liz was at her vivacious best svelte and lovely in shimmering black and silver usually he enjoyed her company liz was a hardheaded career woman with no aspirations for emotional entanglements and with her he could dance knowing there was no hidden agenda or could he tessas words still stung liz do you think im a bastard he asked as the evening drew to a close the music was slowing and couples were dancing cheek to cheek liz was dancing easily in his arms matching his steps superbly but there was no desire on either part for them to dance any closer what do you mean ive had it implied that im a heartless bastard for not taking out any girl more than twice youve taken me out more than twice thats different liz grinned yeah but thats because im also a heartless bastard love em and leave emthats my motto my dad was like that and i am too theres no way any mans going to tie me down you and i suit very well dr llewellyn her grin deepened but dont get any ideas about us suiting too well or ill run a mile he smiled back right it was fine it was fine with liz but what about the other women women like hannah whom hed dated twice and when shed clung hed put away fast maybe tess was right it wasnt fair so where did that leave him then should he only be dating women like liz yes a vow was a vow just on midnight he got another call mavis rang from the hospital to say myrtle jefferson had suffered a fall and needed an urgent house call it seemed myrtle had taken an hour to crawl to the phone to call for help but when mavis had offered to send the ambulance the old lady had become almost hysterical shed told mavis she only needed the doctor she needed mike shed wept but she needed no one else it was almost a relief to leave he left liz to the attentions of the remaining bellanor bachelors and liz didnt mind him going in the least so that was the way he wanted itwasnt it yes it had to be so concentrate on medicine he told himself fiercely concentrate on myrtle his medicine had to be the only thing that mattered myrtle certainly needed him it took him ten minutes to get into the house because she wasnt capable of reaching the front door to unlock it in the end he broke a bathroom window to find her lying on the hall floor by the phone shed broken her hip but what was of even more concern to the old lady was that shed lost control of her bladder myrtle was rigid with mortification and it took him a while to figure out just how much of her distress could be put down to embarrassment and how much was due to pain its ok myrtle he told her no ones going to judge you by this it often happens after an accidenteven to young fit teenagers but myrtle would have none of it she sobbed weakly in distress so despite his reluctance to move her more than necessary he administered morphine and then set himself to fix things by the time the ambulance arrived myrtle had been sponged with warm water and was dressed in a clean soft nightgown her soiled night things were soaking in the laundry now no one will ever know except you and me he told her smiling and you and i go back a long way myrtle i reckon you might even have changed a nappy or two of mine so that must make us about quits i reckon thats right she said weakly clutching his hand in gratitude you were the sweetest little boy and youve turned out well your mother would be proud of you this new lady doctors a lucky young woman this new lady doctor mrs abbot saw her at surgery this morning and she told henrietta smiggins and henrietta told me shes just what you need the morphine was kicking in her dignity was restored and myrtle was bouncing back to her old impertinent self as a medical partner no dear myrtle patted his arm and fixed him with a knowing look as a proper partner thats what you need dear you need a wife and i wont let you tell me any different myrtle i think i need to go to sleep now dear myrtle said weakly closing her eyes on his protest i just thought you ought to knowthe whole valleys very happy for you and so am i you and henrys granddaughter well well he couldnt stand it tessa had been in the town for a whole three days and the entire district was matchmaking he travelled back to the hospital behind the ambulance with his mouth set in a grim angry line this was nonsense stupid crazy stuff fluff it seemed like the whole town was going nuts everyone except me is crazy here he said into the night im not going nuts im the one thats levelheaded here for heavens sake if she thinks she can bulldoze me his voice died away if tess thought she could bulldoze him how on earth was he to stop himself being bulldozed it took a while to settle myrtle he xrayed her hip and at myrtles insistence decided on a conservative approach the bone wasnt displaced with care and bed rest she could recover without internal splinting splinting required a trip to an orthopaedic surgeon in melbourne and a general anaesthetic and myrtle wasnt having a bar of it myrtle itll mean up to ten weeks of bed rest if we dont send you to melbourne he told her itll take you much longer to recover i dont care if you get it splinted you could be up and about much sooner im not leaving here if you stay you risk pneumonia he told her gently theres also the problem of pressure sores and increased difficulty of getting you mobile again afterwards myrtle at your age i dont care what i risk she told him ill lie here and wiggle my toes and keep my circulation going so i wont have a problem and at my age im well old enough to decide for myself im staying here maybe she was right myrtle was nearly ninety so there were risks whatever course of action mike decided on with immobilisation she risked complications but by giving her a general anaesthetic and putting her through the trauma of travelling to the city maybe she risked worse and she was absolutely definite ive lived my whole life here and this is where ill die she told him so if theres a chance thisll kill me id rather take the chance that itll kill me here i doubt itll kill you he told her adjusting the lines on gentle traction youre tough as old boots well even old boots crack in the end she said wearily and now i pulled you away from the ball you go back and enjoy yourself she was wonderful mike looked down at her with affection and suddenly thought this was how tess would end up a feisty old lady loving to the end tess he didnt do as myrtle had ordered he didnt return to the ball the ball would be over by now and liz wouldnt have waited for him she knew better than that he wouldnt mind betting shed have latched onto another eligible bachelor for a ride home and he didnt mind at all now if it had been tess it hadnt been tess stop thinking like that he paused in the corridor strangely unsettled it was one am it was time he was in bed but he didnt feel in the least tired strop would still be snoring after such an exciting event as a football match hed likely sleep for a week so there was nothing calling him home hed just check on sally he decided they were keeping the little girl in overnight to make sure the anaesthetic wore off with no ill effects her mother and father had been in earlier abandoning their intention to go on to the ball but he imagined theyd have gone home now so hed just check he opened the door of the childrens ward and tess was there she was sitting in a chair beside the cot and she had sally cuddled in her arms in the halfdark with her back to him tess was totally oblivious to anything but the toddler in her arms she was humming the little one to sleep he stopped short for a long moment he stared tess didnt see him her face was in the babys hair and she was crooning silly halfremembered lullabies she rocked and sang and sally whimpered and snuggled in halfsleep dear god she was beautiful mike couldnt turn his head away he couldnt back out he stood like hed been struck tess still didnt see him she was wholly concerned with what she was doing and she had no thoughts for anything but the little one in her arms he swallowed and closed his eyes hell tess had spent the first part of tonight babysitting louises mum so louise could have a chance at a love life and then shed made the effort to come back into the hospital to check on a toddler she cared about she had a heart so bigso warm somehow he managed to get himself out into the corridor but he didnt know how this then was what hed vowed never to have he thought bitterly hed never understood the consequences of his vow so clearly until now up to this moment his vow had been easy to keep thered been no one like this to tempt him the thought of his mother swept across his mind dead when a decent doctora doctor whod had his mind on his jobcould have saved her life this womantessadid have the power to distract him he knew she had the power to make him think of something other than medicine and he dared not risk it there was no way he was getting personally involved with this woman his mother deserved better than this his mother deserved that he keep his vow he kept the vision of his mother in his head and he held it as if hed drown if he let it go no he couldnt let himself be swayed damn her shed have to go but he couldnt make her go the valley needed tess almost as much as it needed him swearing softly to himself he made his way back along the darkened corridor a nurse came out of henry westcotts roomit was the horrible hannahand she lifted surprised eyebrows at the sight of mike i thought youd gone to bed myrtles resting peacefully theres no need is henry awake he is hannah told him obviously even more surprised by his curtness ive just given him a rub hes been complaining that the pressure sores are hurting mike frowned he really didnt like hannah on night duty she meant well and she would have given henry an efficient and effective rub but her words were often capable of inflicting more hurt than her hands could heal and at night and alone in a hospital bed everything seemed so much more bleak ill go in and see him suit yourself hannah shrugged and moved off down the corridor toward the lights of the nurses station if you dont think youre better off sleeping her inference was obvious talking to old men in the middle of the night just for the sake of talking that was a waste of time hannah would never do it shed do what had to be done medically and no more she wasnt like tess mike thought bleakly tess sitting up half the night to keep a grumpy old lady happy and free her daughter to enjoy herself and then returning to the hospital to give a twoyearold a cuddle no wonder hed never been tempted to break his vow when he dated the likes of hannah he thought there was no comparison at all goodnight hannah he said firmly and he pushed open henrys door hed check on henry no matter how much a waste of time hannah thought it maybe he needed a topup of painkillers henry was wide awake the old man was watching the opening door with hopeful eyes and mike smiled in sympathy as he saw the old mans face fall that the old man was hoping the visitor would be tessa was painfully obvious tessas in the childrens ward mike said softly do you want me to fetch her no henry gave a wheezy cough he fought to get his breath as the door swung closed no i dont need her i dont need anyone you should all be asleep not wasting time on me mike looked at him more closely hearing the rough emotion in the tired old voice whats wrong henry pain no the rub helped has hannah been upsetting you no no she has i can hear it in your voice mike walked across to the bed and dragged up a chair hannahs technically one of my best nurses he told henry gently she never puts a foot wrong but as for her mouth medically she might never put her foot wrong but when her foots not in use she stores it in her mouth tell me what shes been saying just just shes just been telling me how good the nursing home here is yeah its not a bad place to end up i suppose henry said wearily good as anywhere as good as your farm no but but nothing mike said solidly damn hannah hed have to give her a few solid orders about what she could and couldnt talk to patients about tessa has you all sorted out he told the old man like it or not shes dragging you back out to your farm as soon as youre on your feet and she has every intention of you and her and doris the pig living happily ever after thats no life for a girl says who says hannah itd be all right if she was right if who was right tessa tess says henry paused for a moment to cough he was still as weak as be damned it took him two minutes before he collected himself enough to continue but mike waited as if he had all the time in the world this was important and finally it came tess says its not just she and me and doris henry managed its its henry hesitated and then his face creased into a shamefaced grin its you boy he confessed tess told me she intends to marry you then as mikes face stilled he hurried into an explanation oh she was just kidding mind i told her i wouldnt have her wasting her life here and she said nonsense her intended husband lived here and she had no intention of leaving ever so i thought he smiled maybe its nonsense but i thoughtjust for a bit until i felt more myselfid let myself believe it onlyi told hannah just as a joke like and hannah says thats crazy because theres no way youll ever marry anyone even someone like hannah or liz hayes much less tessa good grief what was he to say to this but henry ive only known your granddaughter for three days mike said helplessly he was totally at sea here it was as if he were being washed by waves he couldnt even see thats crazy yeah henry grimaced but tess said three minutes was enough for her she knew he sighed heavily and tried to twist in bed his paralysed side held him back he gave a grunt of frustration and mike moved to ease him over her grandma was the same henry said finally when he was comfortable again tessas grandma took one look at me and told me that was it forget bachelorhood she told me i was the one it took ellen a year to talk me round but i might have saved myself the effort of fighting marrying ellen was the best thing i ever did but you but ill not be talked around mike said heavily this is nonsense he took a deep breath so is the thought of a nursing home for you theres a job and a life for your granddaughter in this valley without me in the equation so lets just make you comfortable and get you back onto your feet and back to doris dorisnow theres a nice uncomplicated female aint no such thing henry said morosely uncomplicated female hah mike spent most of what little remained of the night staring sleeplessly at the ceiling about dawn he fell into an uneasy slumber but at seven strop heaved himself up on the bed and took over the pillowand by eight mike was up and ready for work in work lay his salvation sunday morning was his easiest time and it was often his only rest for the week there was no surgery he ran an evening clinic for urgent casesmostly just to lighten his load on mondaysbut apart from emergencies he was free there was nothing urgent happening in the hospital this morning and after tessas intervention there was nothing hanging over from the day before he let sally go home with her relieved parentsproudly carrying her toe ring he talked jason through accepting a full tear of his achilles tendon and the possibility of fixing it in the valley if tessas registration came through he made sure myrtle was comfortable and settled and still determined to stay where she was and then he turned his attention to the rest of the day tess was nowhere to be seen hed visited henry but henry was visitorfree and sleeping soundly no doubt tired after his busy social life the night before louise was acting charge nurse cheerful and still slightly flushed after her night at the ball tess went out to the farm early she told him shes moving there today great that meant he had the hospital to himself the day suddenly seemed drab and totally uninteresting there was one really nasty task that had to be done sam fishers dental records had been dropped off at the surgery the night before mike mentally squared his shoulders and headed down to the morgue by the time hed finished making absolutely certain that what lay there was definitely what remained of sam the day seemed more than just drab he was depressed past belief hell so now what he collected strop and emerged from the hospital to brilliant autumn sunshine the day was gorgeous he stood in the car park breathing in huge lungfuls of fresh air trying to drive away the smell and remembrance of what hed just done whod be a doctor it did have advantages one of them lay just before him his aston martin was the pride of his life it was a bit doghaired but it was still gorgeous it needed a woman in the passenger seat he decided looking at it with affection not a dopey basset to really set it off it needed a woman with red hair flying free oh terrific he was going nuts here what the hell was he thinking of hed known tess for three days and he was going nuts strop cast him a reproachful look and he laughed and climbed into the drivers seat ok im not thinking of replacing you or maybe i could get you a cushion so the gearshift doesnt bruise your butt more dirty looks and mike grinned strop knew the priorities he needed no one else in this car no one maybe he should go and collect liz shed always come for a drive with him butshe didnt like strop so hed go for a drive with just strop he didnt instead he nosed his beloved car northwards up toward the mountains he had his phone on his belt he could be contacted if needed hed just see and the sleek sports car purred its way straight to henry westcotts farm and it turned into henrys gate as if it were magnetised it was just to see that tess didnt need help he told himself firmly but he didnt believe it for a minute it was just because he wanted to see tess hell he had the selfcontrol of a mating newt tess was in the shed with doris today she was dressed for farm business with stained jeans that were just a tad too tightgloriously too tighta workstained tshirt and a gorgeous blue scarf tying back her red curls as mike entered the shed strop at his heels he found her squatting beside the piglets deep in conversation with doris i dont know how you can tell them apart because i cant she was telling the sow you need hospital wristbands trotter bands though this little onehes fatter than the rest lets call this one mike shall we why because im fatter than the rest oh tess swung around to face him and her face flushed scarlet whoops i didnt know she scrambled to her feet and then she smiled and there was no disguising her pure unmitigated pleasure that hed come mike felt himself warm from the toes up at her welcome i didnt dare hope youd come she told him so this is a private namecalling ceremony its a family affair she agreed just me and doris and the kids are we intruding no not at all she said cordially unless strop is interested in piglet only roasted that old idea of catching and killing your own meal was bred out of strops remaining brain cell generations ago tess grinned as strop wandered outside to see if roast pork was somewhere else then doris and i are really pleased to see you she said the warmth grew warmerand mike struggled to keep his face straight sowhy are we calling the fat pig mike well tess had her equilibrium back now she picked up the proposed mike piglet and surveyed him nose to nose unbothered doris suckled on some sows took umbrage to having their family handled but as far as doris was concerned tess it seemed could do anything she liked is it just because hes fat mike enquired again inspecting the piglet closely well there is that tess agreed she grinned and checked mike out it was all mike could do not to blush as her assessing gaze raked him from the toes up but youre not really fat she added kindly youre justwell just sort of muscled and then tessas grin deepened and she swung the little piglet around so his tail was in the air but theres another resemblance look at this he does look like you mike llewellyn he has the cutest butt gee thanks the girl was incorrigible hell he was blushing she chuckled unabashed and gently laid mike piglet down on the straw with his brothers and sisters mike piglet headed teatward seemingly at the speed of light and tess chuckled again before turning back to mike person you know you look really appealing when youre embarrassed she told him kindly youre almost as cute as little mike and his brothers and sistersoinks one to seven and then she really looked at him her smile died and her eyes became searching mike whats wrong theres nothing she took a step forward oh god is it grandpa the colour drained from tessas face and he spoke quickly to reassure her henrys fine then why do your eyes look like that and then tessas face cleared as she figured it out oh mike i forgot i know what it is the dental records arrived last night youve been identifying sam she could read him like a book he took a step back as though putting distance between himself and tess but tess wasnt having it she walked over and gave him a kingsized hug and it was all he could do not to hug her back i should have come with you she said softly i could have helped it must have been awful no oh no she jeered not awful dont forget i saw him mike it was awful and you were his friend tess he stopped unable to go on for the life of him he didnt know what to say or how on earth to respond since his mother had died all those years ago nothing and no one had been allowed close to have this girl know intuitively what was wrongand to hug him like thisand to care the sensation was insidious in its sweetness its ok you can admit it was awful but at least now its done and the end for sam must have been fast she gave him another hug and stepped back so she could see him again while he was still figuring out how to respond but he didnt need to respond come in and see what ive done to the house she begged and she took his hand and dragged him out of the barn before he could protest her hand held his in a grip which warmed him from the fingers up and which wouldnt be denied there was nothing for mike to do but be propelled forward she didnt stop until she reached the kitchen and he stopped stunned as he walked in the door what shed done here the place had been transformed it was clean for a start the house in henry westcotts care had been left to deteriorate henrys wife had been houseproud but after shed died henry had simply not cared hed kept it clean enough basically but that had been all the last time mike had been in herethe night theyd found henrythe place had been dark and smokestained and dreary but now how long have you been here mike asked faintly staring around at the transformation since about seven i couldnt sleep louises mum snores and louise was due on duty early so we had breakfast together and talked about how wonderful harvey begg is she even loves his volvo tessas voice sounded awed she smiled and kept on i left her stargazing and hiked in to the hospital said hi to grandpa who was snoring as loudly as louises mum and then borrowed a pile of cleaning stuff from the store i needed more but mr harcourt the man who owns the hardware shop was picking up his newspaper from his front lawn as i drove past i know him from yesterday when i treated his cough i was very kind about his smoking habitsapart from telling him hed be dead in two years if he didnt cut down i wasnt threatening or anything tess paused to catch her breath and then she kept right on going anyway mr harcourt was embarrassed about being caught in his pyjamas they have yellow ducks all over them they were a gift from his wife he says though i dont know whether i believe him i think he likes them and he was smoking again this morning honestly i think the man smokes in his sleep so i gave him another lecture and asked if i could get some whitewash and some stove black and he was so nicehe gave me the key to the shop she meant he was so flummoxed mike thought blankly anyone would be and william harcourt it couldnt have happened to a nicer man yellow ducks eh mikes lips gave an involuntary twitch so then i scrubbed and scrubbed this place looked dingy but in fact its just the smoke stains all over the stone walls from the fire stove im sure grandpa doesnt keep the vents open like he should and its so bad for his health i cleared everything out and whitewashed the walls and i blacked the stove and then i hauled everything back in herehasnt it made a difference it certainly had mike could only stare i need help to hang the curtains again she told him not giving him time to comment i washed them early and i was just going out to see if they were dry when i got sidetracked with doris and the kids ill go and get them now isnt it lucky you came and she flew out of the kitchen leaving mike staring after her she was like a whirlwind a crazy wonderful tornado that picked everything up and whirled it around and set it downdifferent and he didnt know how to stop himself whirling they worked steadily on he wasnt allowed to protest he simply obeyed orders and the experience was totally novel mike was an undomesticated animal but tess didnt seem to notice she had him hauling down the upstairs curtains beating rugs over the clothesline hauling sheets off beds and making them up with clean linen and sweeping out rooms that hadnt been used for years strop followed behind interested and nosing his way into everything you and henry are only going to use two bedrooms he protested the place has five why do we have to clean them all out his protest was met by scorn if a jobs worth doing its worth doing well she said piously didnt your mother teach you anything and then she looked sideways at him as his face closedand he knew she was busy adding two and two together and making heaven only knew what out of her thoughts he didnt have the faintest idea what she was thinking hed never met anyone like this woman in his life she called a halt at two miraculously the phone at mikes hip hadnt sounded once he almost wished it had tess laid out fresh bread and cheese and hauled a bottle of wine from her grandfathers cellar she produced a hambone for strophow the hell had she guessed strop might be here then she spread a rug out under the gums settled herself down in the sunshine and she smiled up at him then again maybe he didnt want his phone to ring at all come on youve earned this she ordered patting the blanket where did you get all this from i begged the cheese from louises mom the hambone came from the hospital kitchen and the baker was baking early this morning i was his first customer i told him i really hoped you might be sharing my lunch and he said he hoped so too and he said rye bread was your favourite theyd be the talk of the town mike thought faintly if tess was breezing down the main street at dawn chatting to solid citizens in their duckcovered pyjamas and discussing mikes likes and dislikes in the bread department how had she known he would think of coming miraculously tess was silent the whole time she ate she lay stretched out like a lazy cat soaking up the warmth and the fresh bread and cheese and the smell of the eucalyptus above them he was left alone with his thoughts not for long never for long with tess around the bread and cheese finished tess disappeared inside the house and came back with two steaming mugs of coffee she handed him one settled down with hers and then hit him with both barrels tell me about your mother what louise says your dad lit out when you were tiny she says your mother raised you alone and then when you were sixteen your mom died how did she die tess i know she said softly its none of my business but tell me anyway why mike i really want to know he sighed and stirred and stretched out lying on his back with his hands behind his head as he gazed up through the canopy of gum leaves why tell this girl why be here at all it seemed there was no choice my mother died of a diabetic coma he said heavily his voice sounding as if hed been goaded her diabetes was unstable she got an infection which ran out of control one saturday afternoon she just collapsed in retrospect she needed intravenous antibiotics and she needed insulin but shed never let me touch her diabetic medical kit she hated me even thinking she was ill so i didnt know what to give her or how mucheven if id known how to give an injection his voice grew incredibly weary as he thought it through how many times had he gone over and over what had happened he was tired of it in his mind infinitely tired but he couldnt let it go so somehow he made himself continue so there was no hospital here then and no nurses there was just a doctor just a doctor who didnt come mum was in a coma when i found her otherwise maybe she could have told me what to do but there was no one you blame the doctor he should have come so youre going to be on call twentyfour hours a day seven days a week for the rest of your life something like that he grimaced then shrugged and gave a rueful smile no im not that stupid i know im not god i pay locums once a year so i get a break locums two locums two locums to provide the same service you provide thats right because no other single doctor would be stupid enough to take on what you take on tessas voice was gentle but insistent thats your point of view well shed been sitting on the rug staring down at him now she flopped backwards so she was lying full length beside him and she put her hands behind her head as well she stared up into mikes gum tree as if she was trying to see what he was seeing by their side strop gnawed peacefully on supremely content with his lot its just as well ive come then she said decisively you need me mike llewellyn i admit it she said still staring upwards you need another doctor if you stay itll mean i dont need to have so many holidays itll mean you dont run yourself into the ground so much tessa nodded decisively shed kicked her shoes off now she raised one bare foot and examined her toes with the gumtree canopy acting as a background for her painted toenails it was as if she was admiring a work of art which in fact they were so you admit it mike you need me ok he stirred uneasily she was too damned close for comforttoo damned close by farand the sight of her bare toes hell hed never realised bare toes could be so sexy i do need another doctor he said grudgingly if you stay then ill be grateful oh ill stay she hauled herself up so she was supporting herself on her arms and staring straight down at him her face was now right in his line of sightbetween him and his canopy she was about four inches from his nose and what about the rest of you dr llewellyn she demanded the rest the doctor part of you needs me as a doctor does the personal side of you need me as a woman tess youre not saying theres no personal side of course theres a personal side but not one that lets anything interfere with your medicine is that right she demanded because of what happened to your mother in the past youve blocked off your personal needs and her green eyes grew thoughtful you think if you let yourself fall for me ill distract you and then as he stared up at her in baffled silence tessas mouth creased into a smile hey you might be right at that distraction sounds fun she put a teasing finger on his nose and her touch was electric but i wouldnt distract you all that much dr llewellyn if duty calls ill be right there beside you beavering away like mad and being just as devoted a doctor as you to suggest anything else is insulting he stared up at her and she smiled straight back hell her curls tumbled down around her shoulders just brushing his face her green eyes smiled down at him her face was so near women werent supposed to do this he thought dazedly women werent supposed to throw themselves at men this wasnt just a woman this was tessa i wouldnt want to insult you he said faintly and her smile grew now thats really wise why is it wise because i have friends in high places or low places insult me and ill set doris onto you perish the thought shed squash you to death in two seconds flat shed do that on command shes a very amenable pig tessas voice softened and her nose lowered a notch or two so there was about two inches clearance almost as well trained as your strop so mike could hardly breathe his lungs were hurting the sheer effort of not taking this girl in his arms was almost killing him but he didnt need to tessa had no need of assistance she had things in hand here and she knew very clearly what she intended so just shut up lie back and let me introduce you to a lady who intends to be the love of your life mike llewellyn she whispered and in case you hadnt guessedthats me her nose descended a further two inches and mike found himself being solidly kissedand for the life of him he couldnt put up one skerrick of resistance somewhere inside him a weight was being lifted which had been almost too heavy to bear and he hadnt known he was carrying it he had sworn hed never love but he hadnt known what love was he had sworn off commitment but he hadnt known that commitment could be as sweet as this that a woman could feel like this in his arms she felt as if she belonged right where she wasas if she were part of him as if she were the completeness of his whole the last of his resistance crumbled he held tess to him and her body moulded itself to his in the soft autumn sunlight at the touch of her body against his mike felt his vows slip away as if theyd never been vows what vows they must have been unimportant things made on the mistaken premise that he couldnt be committed to his medicine if he loved a woman he could be this woman was his partner he still could be committed he told himself fiercely because he had to be because like it or not he was wholly and wonderfully committed to the woman in his arms his tessa chapter nine the next weeks passed like a dream with mike feeling as if a whole new world had opened up for him life was brighter clearerfantastic everywhere he moved there was tessa tessas registration came through incredibly speedily her medical credentials it seemed were impeccable the medical registration board thought so and on reflection so did mike the town was lucky to have her mike was lucky to have herhe just couldnt believe that it was happening he felt like pinching himself to ensure its reality but tess was real enough mike watched her as she assisted him in rejoining jasons torn achilles tendon and he couldnt fault her anaesthetic skill he listened to her counsel doreen fiancée of les wades nephew hugh doreen had drifted to tess rather than mike wanting a female shoulder to cry on hugh was still in melbourne where his uncle had started the long process of rehabilitation for his burns doreen and hugh had postponed their wedding and doreen was wavering between support of hugh and fear that hughs guilt might prevent the marriage altogether mike could only marvel at the way tess stayed silent and let doreen spill out her guilt and her anguish the walls between the room tess used as a surgery and the room mike used as a file room needed to be soundproofedlong term there were all sorts of arrangements to be made if tess was to stayand doreens anguish was loud mike sitting alone as he wrote up patient notes could hear every word there were only gentle murmurs from tess though tess knew when to stay silent as well as when to bounce with enthusiasm why dont you go to melbourne and stay with hugh she suggested softly when doreen had sobbed herself dry hugh will be feeling dreadful and thats where you should be at his side doreen finally left still sniffing into her handkerchief but comforted all the same are you sure itd be ok she asked as tess saw her to the door i meanour relatives all blame us for sleeping together in the first place they think thats one reason why les is in the mess hes in if i go to hugh now you follow your heart tess suggested gently if you think its right dont let anyone else stand in your way follow your heart then mike watched the way tess helped her grandfather find his feet again she spent hours assisting him to make his unsteady way along the hospital corridors as if she had all the time in the world and as if spending hour after hour watching an old man learn the skills of using a walkingframe was the most important thing she could possible be doing henry thrived under her care and mike couldnt believe the speed of his recovery tess got to know the locals she introduced herself to every player of the jancourt football club and took the job of learning the rules of her newfound passion deadly seriously to mikes astonishment she even started knitting a scarf in team colours i think ill do two matching ones she told him clacking away at her knitting needles with the seriousness of a grandmother or maybe just one long one so we can wear an end each and at night at night the farm lay empty tessa had cleaned it so she could stay there and she still visited doris and her babies each night and checked on the place but late each night she returned to town and she took mike into her armsand she slept exactly where she wanted to be with her mike even strop seemed to approve when tess was there the dog left the bed to them and in tessas body mike found a peace hed never thought to have life had never been this good mike thought blissfully as he loved his woman mike had never knownnever dreamedit could be so good he held his love in his arms and he loved herbut only half of him believed in his good fortune the other half of him knew he was living in a soap bubble hey im not about to disappear tess teased gently on the anniversary of their first two weeks together im here for good mike didnt believe it but he held her just the same in a town like bellanor it was impossible to keep such a relationship a secret after that first nightwhen mike had emerged to monday morning after a night spent with tessahe had been met with knowing looks and laughter bloody good thing too doc that was the general consensus what took you so long so long a whole three days by the end of the two weeks the general approval was becoming laced with a stronger message so when are you going to make an honest woman of her doc get a mother for that crazy mutt of yours marriage mike had never thought of such a thing but once suggested the idea stayed in his mind and wouldnt leave he looked at it from all sides and knew his vow had definitely been broken already he could hardly make it worse that night tess came with him when he did his weekly house call to stan harper stan was still suffering his chest pains and mike was increasingly worried about him his heart seemed strong and healthy and yet stan himself seemed to be almost fading im just feeling bloody lousy doc stan told him with an apologetic look at tess pardon my french miss tess had been sitting at ease at stans kitchen table while mike listened to stans chest and her face was sympathetic i dont understand australian swear words tess lied im trying to get mike to teach them to me but he likes me unspoiled i know damn means more than just a big puddle of water but do you think hell explain no way stan chuckled and his misery lifted for a little whilebut only for a little while id like you to come into hospital for a few days mike suggested as stan hauled down his sweater stan there doesnt seem anything wrong with your heart and the last three electrocardiographs have been normal but if youre still having the painwell somethings going on lets have you in and do a full checkup but stan would have none of it nope im staying here but youll come again next saturday his voice was anxious and mike knew just how lonely the old man was tell you what mike suggested how about if i get the district nurse to call ill still come next week but shell come every other day as well just until were sure everythings right but stan wasnt having that either i dont want a fuss he said definitely he sighed sometimeswell yeah i get chest pain and yeah im miserable but its nothing that having cathy back wouldnt fix he sighed again and looked closely from mike to tess but look at the pair of you heres me fretting about myself when i should be saying how glad i am to see you finally wrapped around a womans little finger young mike youre smelling of april and may if ever anyone was so when are you two going to tie the knot tess blushed and mike shook his head thats for us to know and you to guess he told stan firmlybut the thought of what lay ahead was warm inside him he glanced sideways at tess and smiledand she smiled straight back dont hang around too much then stan begged its too bloody important you grab her while shes here and hold on for dear life the conversation in the aston martin on the way home was strained mike was trying to think about stan when all he wanted was to concentrate on tess theyd left strop snoozing under henrys bed for the afternoon and it was lovely to be able to see tessa instead of liver and white spots whenever he glanced sideways but the sight of tessand tesss leggingswasnt helping his concentration im still worried about stan he told her stiffly mmm tess pulled her knees up to her chin and hugged them she was wearing black leggings and a vast purple sweater that covered her from her knees right up she looked smashing i dont think hes eating she said why do you think that well when we went there last week i prowled she told him when you had stan in the bedroom giving him the complete onceover i poked my nose into his kitchen cupboards and just had a look at thingslike the level of cereal in his cornflakes packet and what groceries there were and where they were and tonightwhen stan walked us out to the car and i dived back inside because id left my bag i had a fast look again and nearly everythings exactly the same he hasnt touched his cornflakes theres exactly the same number of eggs in the fridge as last week and when i picked one up and shook it it sort of rattledyou know how really old eggs do i reckon hes eaten a few bowls of tinned tomato soup and not a lot else even the packet of bread in the freezer is the same one as last week i ripped a little edge off the packet last week so id know itand its the same packet only about six slices down youre a regular sherlock holmes i am she said smugly but her smile faded do you agree it fits mike said slowly thats one of the reasons id like to admit him to hospital hes losing a lot of weight hes missing his cathy so much yeah mike said grimly loves like that once it hits you cant get over it its a problem tess agreed with a sideways glance at her love silence there seemed nothing else to say the sleek aston martin ate up the miles between jancourt and bellanor and the silence stretched on and on mike cast his own sideways glance tess was now looking straight ahead peacefully contemplating the evening sky and he came to an instant decision this was impossible he wanted her so much taking her in his arms each night it was suddenly no longer enough marry me tess he said suddenlyurgentlyand then held his breath marry you thats what i said tess closed her eyes he hesitated and then pulled the car off the road so they were facing down the valley to the town below a bellbird was calling from the bushland outside the car high and sweet and lovely and tess sat silent for longer than he had dreamed possible tess surely there was only one answer here dear god he loved her and henry had said she wanted marriage she must love him but finally tess opened her eyes and as she did he knew what the answer was going to be she turned to him and shook her head so her flaming curls flew free and her eyes were bleak i love you mike she whispered but im not going to marry you not yet he moistened lips that were suddenly dry his eyes didnt leave her face may i ask why not she tilted her chin with that look of defiance and pride hed first seen in hera look hed come to know and love because youre asking me to marry you against your better judgement and thats asking for trouble what do you mean i mean you think youre letting your mother down by loving me youve broken your vow youd marry me and then youd wait for the time when disaster happens you know itll happen some time and youre right try as i may if you marry me then some time in the future ill interfere with your medicine sure ill help sure ill be beside you and medicine here will be better because of me but when i finally get in your way i doubt itll count on my part youll hate yourself and you may well hate me you wont interfere with my medicine he said calmly surely and theres no way i can end up by hating you tess ive thought this through no you havent not properly tess gave a lopsided grin and a shaky laugh mike life will interfere with your medicine all sorts of things can happen a tree could fall on your head and you wont be effective as a doctor because youre squashed flat youd forgive the treeor you would if you werent squashedbecause you havent made any vows about never going near trees but if i alter your life plan one bit and something goes awry because of it you wont forgive me because when i interfere with your medicine youll think its because you broke your vow she took a deep breath i love you mike but i want more than thatand im prepared to wait mike stared straight ahead through the windscreen trying to sort out her words dear god he was trying to pretend she wasnt saying exactly what he knew alreadywhat he knew was the truth this is stupid he said slowly it might be stupid but its how it is she told him and he knew she wouldnt budge from her position hed been thinking things through but so had tess he was prepared to risk problems because of his vow what he hadnt counted on was that tess wasnt she had it all figured out mike i love you she repeated softly and im prepared to hang in for the long haul here but i want this disaster to happen before you totally commit yourself to me i want you to see what loving me is all aboutthat it means letting life run its course side by side thats what i want no you dont not yet tess took a deep breath look mike lets leave it believe it or not i know what im doing here i want you so much it hurts but im not letting you make any more vows until youve come to terms with the last one you made until you let it go and accept that you can live with its release she took his face in her hands and she kissed him gently on the lips and you dont see what i mean yet but i do you need to wait we both need to wait mike to see what life throws at us but no weddings just love and lets just see if thats enough tess wouldnt budge from that position and in the end he accepted it he had no choice it was crazy he thought she was wrong oh she wasnt wrong in that she thought hed blame himself if he was distracted what she didnt see was that he neednt be with tess as another doctor surely there need never be a time when shed stand in his way meanwhile thoughlife was still infinitely sweet he and tess worked side by side the workload in the valley was magically halved he had time to raise his head from work and whenever he raised his head tess was there ready and willing to slip into his arms with his granddaughter as his chief medical specialist henry westcott improved beyond any expectations five weeks from the time theyd found him tess and mike prepared to take the old man home ill need to stay on the farm from now on tess told mike seriously on the friday night before henry was due for discharge this would have to be their last night together both of them knew the difficulties now the farm was too far from the hospital for mike to be on call even if he wished to stay with tess he didnt even though mikes body screamed its need for tess mike knew henry well enough to know that tess sleeping unwed with mike in henrys house would upset the old man enormously but tess was right she had to stay so we need to marry mike smoothed the curls away from tessas face and kissed her deeply on the lips soon strops going to miss you and ill miss you worse marry me nope nope nope you havent had your disaster yet im not intending to have a disaster itll happen ill tell you what though she kissed him back feather kisses that started on the tip of his nose descended to his throat and kept on going if you havent had your disaster by the time im fifty ill marry you regardless gee thanks dont you want to marry me when im fifty mike groaned her kisses were brushing his naked skin down across his chest downdown i may not live until youre fifty i may not live another ten minutes tess its a perfectly good offer take it or leave it tess im serious she stopped kissing him for long enough to rise and brush the hair back from his eyes and meet his look with all gravity mike itll happen i know it will lets just take this one day at a time and go from there so on saturday afternoon they borrowed the hospital car and tess and mike and strop took henry home with tess and mike trying hard to act as though they were friends and not lovers it didnt quite come off but if henry knew better he didnt let on his joy at being homeat seeing doris and her babies and greeting his goats and sitting in his own armchair before the kitchen firewas too great to let mikes occasional stiffness mar it he sat and gazed around at their handiwork in delight its a bloody wonder he told her eh tess girl his voice broke in rough emotion and mike found himself feeling almost as choked up as henry he had to leave hed had fallen into the habit of dropping in to see stan harper every saturday evening so now he helped check out henrys use of the walkingframe and his ability to get from the bathroom to the bedroom and back to the kitchen and then it was time to go tess will take good care of you sir he told henry and the district nurse will drop in on a daily basis that was what theyd arranged also matt jacob jeffriess eldest lad was coming each weekday morningostensibly to do some work on the fences around the house but in reality to keep a quiet eye on henry for the first few weeks of his convalescence that meant tess could keep her morning clinic going and as henry grew stronger she could take on more youre not staying now henry demanded pulling himself out of his pleasurable haze to realise what mike intended hell you have to stay boy i asked tess especially to cater for all of us shes cooking a roast i am too tess said proudly roast pork mikes eyebrows hit his hair pork surely hed still counted eight babies youre kidding tessas eyes crinkled in laughter at his tone dont even think it she told him perish the thought this is a nice anonymous leg of pork bought from a nice anonymous supermarket donated im sure by a nice anonymous pig i brought it in at dead of night so doris wouldnt see and i swear ill bury the remains at dead of night too very wise so you will stay tess grinned down at her grandfather and then back to him ive bought a can of dog food for strop and for us i have everything grandpa ordered apple sauce butternut pumpkin roast potatoes and fresh peas with lemon meringue pie to follow lemon meringue pie both men were now staring at her their faces reflecting disbelief and strop was looking just plain hopeful bother the dog food hey im not just a pretty face and then tess relented and chuckled well to be honest mrs thompson made the pie for me but the rest is mine do stay mike wed both like you to he hesitated but he was lost lemon meringue pie lemon meringue pie and tessa and strop would break his heart if he hauled him away from these smells stan only needs a social visit he said slowly i guess i can drop in tomorrow he couldnt at eleven the next morning he finally arrived at stan harpers farmand stan was dead it must have been a massive infarct tessa said softly it was monday morning she stood back from the autopsy table and looked across at mike shed insisted on doing this there was no way she was letting him do the autopsy on his own theres no doubt she told him now no time of death late on saturday night how about late afternoon saturday he said heavily and tess winced no theres no way we can say that theres no way we can say it was definitely later ok tess crossed to the sink and started washing watching him out of the corner of her eye ill accept that it might have happened late saturday afternoon when i should have been there by the look of this damage theres no way you could have helped even if you had been there she told him the arterys completely blocked you know as well as i do that this wasnt a minor recoverable heart attack if hed been in the bestequipped hospital in the world i doubt hed have been saved but there were no signs apart from the pain which we couldnt pinpoint the electrocardiograph was normal i tried to get him to go to melbourne and see a specialist but he wouldnt that was his choice tessas voice was flat and devoid of emotion her eyes were calmly watchful i should have insisted and he would have refused at least i should have been there here it was the crux of the whole matter are you saying if youd been there you might have saved him yes no i dont know he turned his face away and stared sightlessly at the bare wall who can say hed run himself down he wasnt eating if id spent more time therebullied him into eating instead of spending time with me she said softly that did have something to do with it the fact that im taking so much of your workload that you have more time than ever before has nothing to do with it the fact that if i hadnt been here sharing your work you might never have had time to pay any social visits at all but he wasnt listening i should have been there on saturday evening he said solidly i shouldnt have stayed on with you and your grandfather i knew stan was expecting me he wasnt expecting you youd called when you could it was only because ive been able to give you free time that youve been able to go at all tess sighed mike stan may well have been dead already if youd arrived on saturday afternoonor he might even have been fine and then died after you left theres no sign of previous scarring here apart from the chest pain which you couldnt pin down on examination there was no sign of such a massive problem this was an act of god mike it has nothing to do with you i should have been there silence tess dried her hands and pulled off her lab coat then she crossed the floor and took his hands in hers he stared sightlessly down at her his heart bleak mike is this our disaster she asked softly what will you hold this against us he didnt look at her he couldnt i should have been there he repeated dully how could he say anything else it was all he could think hed let stan down hed broken his vow hed known this would happen do you really believe that if you didnt love me then stan would still be alive but he couldnt answer his face was cold and bleak and hard and it reflected how he felt i dont know tess he said finally i dont know all i know is that that you want me to go away he closed his eyes and when he opened them he knew what he had to say yes please he said silence i knew this would happen tess said softlyfinallyand the pain in her voice was clear for him to hear arent you pleased now that you didnt make another vow arent you pleased were not married she walked slowly out of the room and closed the door behind her chapter ten what followed was an interminable month when mike tried to pick up the threads of his life where hed left off there were two sides to his life he decided pretess and posttess pretess had been bleak and hard posttess was just impossible he worked on two levels on the surface he was efficient and calm and under control but underneath he was so churned up he was wondering just how on earth he could cope maybe it would get better in time he told himself over and over maybe hed get used to tessa around the place and hed stop wanting her in his bed at night strop was back on his pillow and that was all the company he could allow himself maybe if he stopped seeing her every time he turned around it might solve his problems that wasnt going to happen tess was settling further into valley life every day she worked here she soon carved herself out a routine coming in to do clinics every morning and taking her share of house calls in the afternoons often she took henry with her on her house calls they purchased a reliable little truck between them and the sight of the old man and the flameheaded young lady doctor beetling around the valley roads soon became a familiar sight i dont know how you managed without her mike was told over and over and only he knew that hed managed a darn sight better without her than with her he was tearing himself in two we were fine by ourselves he told strop but strops big mournful eyes looked more mournful than ever and his tail didnt wag at all he hadnt minded sharing his mike with tessand tess was a dab hand with a can opener mikes pain couldnt go unnoticed especially by tessa youre being a dope she told him bluntly six weeks after stans death it was eleven at night shed come in to see a patient shed admitted to hospital that afternoon and came past the kitchen door to find him cooking himself bacon and eggs again youll kill yourself on that diet and youre still working too hard she stood in the doorway and glared you know damn well i want more work mike llewellyn give it to me you cant work full time and look after henry henrys getting better every day hes almost independent now she hesitated and then walked all the way in sitting down at the table while he cooked but that doesnt mean im leaving if thats what youre hoping mike im not going away if anything im getting closer henry and i have decided to sell the farm sell the farm that rattled him we love it but we dont need sixty acres she told him and living out there im too far from the hospital it was grandpas idea theres a great little place down by the river just half a mile from here grandpas been to see it and he loves it but he loves his farm so do we both but we love being together more this way we can stay together just me and grandpa and doris the pig and the eight porky babies he couldnt help himself mikes eyes twinkled and tess twinkled right back come out and see our babies some time theyre what you might call gooddooers even doris is feeling the strain we may keep little mikeor rather big mikebut thats about the limit i see mike yes tess hesitated and then sighed youre still blaming me for stans deathright no im blaming me thats worse it cant be helped he said stiffly its the way it is so youre intending to stay solitary for the rest of your life and keeping on working just as hard as you can thats the plan well its a really stupid plan she burst out just crazy do you think your mother would thank you for doing it for grudging me every piece of work i can get my hands on and for turning your back on a really magnificent love life what with me and grandpa and doris and strop who could ask for more and for running yourself into the ground because youre so damned miserable youve stopped looking after yourself thats ridiculous no its not she snapped you should be eating three solid meals a day with a nice family routine like with me and grandpa and our appendages even with a couple of kids tess flushed and then managed a smile well if doris can have little mikes i dont see why i cant and as for living on bacon and eggs i like bacon and eggs mike flipped his egg out on top of his bacon and stared down at it then he shoved the whole plate away suddenly he didnt feel like anything at all and tessas voice suddenly lost its aggressiveness youre ok arent you mike her face creased in sudden concern youre not sickening for something no so youre not dying of a broken heart her words were flippant but her face was still worried mike are you losing weight no i reckon you are tess said slowly her eyes narrowed as she checked him out in fact im sure you are and dont tell me you dont really feel like that eggs and bacon the plate lay before them untouched mike hauled it back before him and picked up his knife and fork yeah i do ok so eat ill eat when you leave im not leaving until i see you eat tess mike is there something really wrong here there is isnt there all of a sudden tess looked really worried mike tell me theres nothing wrong he said explosively ive just got a bit of a belly ache thats all and tonights the first time youve had it yes ok tess held her hands up in mock surrender i know when im not wanted but if it really has been going on for longer if theres something wrong there isnt if there isand you wont talk to me about it tess hesitated or even take a few days off and see someone in melbourne well a man would be foolwouldnt he there was nothing wrong tess left mike abandoned his eggs and bacon and took himself back to his apartment but tessas words kept playing in his head a mand be a fool theres nothing wrong he told himself harshly blocking off the thought of a few faint worries there was no need to talk to tessa or anyone else about this it was just a nagging gut ache that was all and it was caused by nervous tension there the diagnosis was easy hed got himself in an emotional state over a woman and it was physically taking its toll he just needed time to sort himself out he figured he needed to divorce himself from what he was feeling for tessa and then hed be fine he took some antacid and managed to eat and hold down a dry piece of toast then he said goodnight to strop and went to bed that was at midnight by dawn he was sicker than hed ever been in his life have you seen dr llewellyn tess had been in the hospital for a whole five minutes before she was hit by the question it was horrible hannah about to go off night duty tess met bill fetson coming on duty in the hall and hannah met them both mrs carters drip packed up about an hour ago and i need orders the nurse told them i rang dr llewellyns apartment but hes not answering he must have gone out on a call but hes not answering his mobile phone either maybe hes out of range bill said then he frowned but he knows where the phone cuts out if hes going to be out of range then he rings first and tells us where he can be contacted maybe he doesnt think it as important any more tess said now that i can be contacted he has backup he doesnt like us contacting you hannah shrugged but i guess that must be it or hes somewhere where the lines are down thats quite a storm outside it was the wind had been rising all night and now it was screaming around the sides of the building in the full blast of the onset of winter a storm like this would be bound to bring the odd telephone wire down tess frowned but forced herself relax ok lets not worry she saidbut she was worrying ill check mrs carter for you she did and she ended up doing a full round of mikes patients there must be an emergency to keep him away they decided but there was nothing they could do until he contacted the hospital tess had a house call of her own she should leave now but instead she made her way back to the nurses station hannah was still there having decided she didnt want to walk home until the worst of the weather had abated and so was bill so where is he she asked and bill shook his head beats me has anyone checked his apartment hannahs rung him more than once and theres no answer bill told her and i had hannah walk down and check while i rangjust in case theres a fault in the line theres not from this side of his door you can hear it ringing inside oh and strops inside you can hear him snuffling at the door mike must have decided to leave him indoors because of the weather mike has to be out yes but tess hesitated her face creasing in worry its just bill last night mike didnt look well he was off his food bill stilled they looked at each other for a long long minute outside the wind blew more fiercely bill what are we waiting for tess said at last and in her heart there was suddenly a lurch of real fear lets check strop met them as they unlocked the door and he was frantic with worry he saw them inside and launched himself at the bathroom door barking in a frenzy by the time they reached the bathroom they were expecting something bad and they found it mike was stretched out unconscious on the bathroom floor mike surfaced to the horrible hannah for a long moment he couldnt figure out where he was he lay absolutely still and let the room come into focus it didnt completely it spun but as he stared upwards the spinning slowed and then hannah was looking down at him oh dr llewellyn oh mike there was no mistaking it for the first time in his life mike heard real emotion in hannahs voice joy youre awake oh dont you dare shut your eyes im fetching tess tess hannah was calling tess tess it was all too much to work out and there seemed no need he was so damned tired he couldnt help it try as he may he couldnt obey hannahs order his eyes closed all by themselves and he slept the next time he opened his eyes tess was there and she was crying hed nearly died and it took him days to figure out why he hadnt days while strop lay as devoted watchdog under his bed and his body slowly recovered from its shock you had a massive bleed from a duodenal ulcer tess told him in a voice that still shook ive never seen so much blood we put five units of plasma aboard before we started operating and once wed crossmatched we had donors coming in from all over the valley we needed them all operating that was another thing he couldnt work out somehow hed been operated on and hed been operated on here you were operated on by me tess said when he was finally well enough to ask the right questions and dont ask me how i did it because i dont know and i never ever want to do such a thing again youre trained in general surgery but apart from my basic medical training im not so how but tess shook her head and her voice trembled she reached out and took his hand in hers and it wasnt just her voice that was trembling please mike dont ask i cant think about it it was up to bill to tell him and it was two days after the operation before he was well enough to take it all in it was a bloody miracle bill growled as he changed mikes dressings with hands that were amazingly tender for such a big man id written you off myself as soon as i saw you on the floor and saw the bloodwell i was all for calling the undertaker if it hadnt been for tess youd be pushing up daisies by now so what happened we couldnt evacuate you bill told him the weather was foul and no helicopter could get in even if there had been enough time to get you to a major hospital or get a surgeon flown in here which there wasnt and here you were losing blood like a stuck pig tessa was pouring in plasma but it wasnt nearly enough you were dying under her hands so she saidshe said she was going in but how the hell thats what we all said bill said grimly youve got no idea there was me and hannah and louise and tess and stropall standing around staring at each other like helpless dummies we were pouring in blood but we were still losing you and then tess said we had nothing to lose so who was going to do the anaesthetic and i just gaped at herbut hannah said shed have a go if tess told her everything to do hannahs such a pokenosetheres nothing she misses and shes been a theatre nurse in the city so tess took a deep breath and says great and not to worry because it might be the first time hannahs given an anaesthetic but its also the first time tessas ever been a surgeon which you can imagine made us feel a whole heap better yeah mike was trying hard to concentrate here the pethidine was making him drift in and out of reality but he was getting the gist of it so so tess rings melbourne bill said you should have heard her bossy you wouldnt believe it she organised a phone link with two specialists one for her and one for hannahone anaesthetist and one specialist surgeon they link up we use that teleconferencing line you put in where we talk handsfree i turn up the volume so both hannah and tess can talk and the two specialists can listen and throw in advice as needed maybe tess could have advised hannah on the anaestheticshe did a bit and kept her eye on herbut shes got her hands full with what shes doing to you bill shook his head and the tone of his voice indicated that what had happened was still unreal to him we had every nurse in the place back in here he said there were people taking blood donations and helping in the wards and in the theatre everybody wanted to help he gave a rueful grin and for those who werent needed and knew what was going on father dan ran a special mass tess said go right ahead she needed every ounce of help she could get and shed accept it from any direction she could oh and strop sat outside the kitchen door and howled but she did it mike said faintly yeah she did it you know you arrested on the table youre kidding nope hannah nearly died as well she was so frightened but tess stayed calm stopped what she was doinghad me hold the clampsand put on the electrodes jumpstarted you got the heartbeat going reassured hannah and then calmly went back to stitching the damned ulcer up she did it like a professional and the surgeon advising her told me afterwards that he doubted if hed have stayed as calm as she was and then bill gave a rueful smile maybe she wasnt all that calm though he said grimly after it was all over and youd opened your eyes and shed seen you might make itwell i went outside and she was throwing her guts up vomiting like it was she whod had the ulcer and not you you put her through the hoops boyo and thats the truth hell it was all of that bills smile softened and he gripped mikes hand all of that and more its bloody good to have you back but tess yeah it seemed there was something else on bills mind but he was having trouble saying it well bill shrugged and then dived straight in when i was helping her clean herself up she told me you wont marry her because she interferes with your medicine crying her eyes out when she said it of all the stupid things she interferes with your medicine without her loving you without her worrying enough to practically kick your apartment door down without her taking risks you wouldnt believe and laying her professional reputation on the lineway beyond the call of duty well without tessa youd be giving this community no medicine at all never again youd be one more statistic for the graveyard tessa mmm whitecoated and efficient tessa had breezed into his ward hannah behind her she picked up his obs chart and beamed at what she saw this is great she said you know we might start you on solids tomorrow no eggs and bacon though hannah grinned and tessa smiled her agreement youre right nurse no eggs and bacon we might try a little jelly and tessa sorry mike were you trying to say something tessa raised her

and he blessed her for it six weeks after mikes operation he stood clad in dinner suit white carnation in his buttonhole the sea breeze ruffling his hair and with an almost overwhelming happiness in his heart and waited for his bride the headland where the wedding took place was one of the loveliest places in bellanor nestled between two mountains about three miles from town the homestead here had long fallen into disrepair the land was used for cattle agistment and nothing else the bush had reclaimed the land on the bluff and it had taken a working party three days to clear enough room for the portable chairs and the vast marquee and the tiny altar there was normally nothing here just sea and bushland and native birdsand one solitary grave this was the headland where mikes mother was buried her grave was covered with a mass of native orchids almost an altar in itself and it was here that tess decreed shed marry because were going into this with our eyes wide open she told mile solemnly youre not breaking any vow youre renewing it with a difference and so he was he was renewing it with joy thrown in for good measure with tess and here she was pulling up in harvey beggs volvo

dog lead in her hand the lead was attached to a gleaming groomed and handsome strop resplendent in crimson bow strop was looking so mournful he was almost smiling of course he was smiling this was so right all the pieces of mikes jumbled life were fitting together and his tessa was walking steadily toward him tessa his bride and her eyes were loving him there were no doubts in mikes heart now there were no doubts at all this was right this was his fate this was where he was meant to be everything seemed to hush as mike and tessa made their marriage vows and it was right for this marriage
