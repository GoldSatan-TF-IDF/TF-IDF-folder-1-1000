blazed a trail for sisters in crime to follow sisters on the case introduction women writers and their detectives have been an important part of crime fiction since its beginnings who doesnt know miss marple or peter wimsey or ebenezer gryce and amelia butterworth wait butterworth gryce those arent household names a century ago they were both were detectives created by anna katherine green one of the most successful crime writers of the last hundred years at a time when americas population was a quarter what it is today greens books usually sold around a million copies she was president wilsons favorite genre writer she knew all the luminaries of the day and her detective ebenezer gryce anticipated sherlock holmes by a decade gryce did the same kind of forensic research as holmes examining medical evidence typefaces fabrics buttons and drawing conclusions based on physical evidence green was the first englishlanguage writer to create that most beloved figure in crime fiction the series character whose insights and foibles are opaque to other figures in the story but wellknown to the reader in green added amelia butterworth as an amateur aidedecamp to mr gryce on more than one occasion ms butterworths own insights saved mr gryce from making a serious blunder in green created a bold new phenomenon violet strange a female private inquiry agent almost a century before v i warshawskis arrival on the scene anna katherine green had created not one but two women detectives there are a number of differences between ebenezer gryce and sherlock holmes but the biggest is this anna katherine green is out of print while conan doyle never has been green is part of that long tradition of women whose voices fall off the margins of the page into obscurity in in a small room at a baltimore hotel twentysix women came together over stale sweet rolls to discuss the hurdles we had to jump as we built our careers as crime writers we were concerned that our own hard work and talent werent enough to keep our own voices on the page the issues discussed ranged from the isolation that affects all writers to the marginalization of novels by womenthey stayed in print about a third as long as those of our male colleagues they were reviewed as we later learned with a seventh the frequency at crime conferences we might be told that it was wonderful we had a hobby so that we didnt make heavy demands on our husbands when they came home from work libraries with restricted budgets would buy works by men because as one librarian put it women will read books by men but men wont read those by women many readers of crime fiction didnt know we were alive let alone producing wonderful novels indeed from to a woman had a better chance of winning the nobel prize in physics than she did of winning the mystery writers of americas prize for best novel of the year i had been hearing about these issues for almost a year from women all over the country with the support of my editor at ballantine mary ann eckels i convened the baltimore meeting to see if my sister writers cared enough about these problems to organize and change them out of that meeting grew sisters in crime and marked our twentieth anniversary this collection celebrates that milestone in when about a hundred women were involved we decided we needed a structure to help keep people in touch with each other and to make sure the concerns of all the members were heard we formed a steering committee dorothy salisbury davis charlotte macleod nancy pickard and i were writers kate mattes owned a bookstore betty francis a corporate executive by day was a reader with thoughtprovoking insights into both books and organizations that spring we decided on our first two projects one was tracking book reviews to see how women fared in the major national publications and in our own regional papers and magazines the other the brochure shameless promotion for brazen hussies too many of us had been raised to think that only a brazen hussy tooted her own hornand we knew that if we wanted people to hear about us we were going to have to start shouting our names in public a few years later carolyn hart linda grant and sharyn mccrumb undertook a heroic effort in creating sisters books in print so wed have a publication to take to bookstores and libraries in the last twenty years the organization has grown to nearly four thousand members worldwide whats truly wonderful is that readers have grown with us at first bookstores or libraries looking at our books in print would try a few books by our members these disappeared off the shelves so quickly that they tried a whole shelf and that grew in turn to an entire wall over and over bookstores told us they heard from women who said i hadnt read a mystery since i outgrew nancy drew because the characters just didnt speak to me now im finding dozens of books with characters i can identify with we in sisters in crime feel proud of our role in growing the market for mystery readers since weve had twenty presidents with very different profiles and ideas but weve all shared one goal the support and promotion of books by women to make sure that we dont fall off the page again the stories in this collection are by the women who helped build the organization we were honored from the start by dorothy salisbury daviss involvement a

prose is aweinspiring in sister death while barb damato chills in a different way in steak tartare dive in see for yourself what sisters who are on the case can accomplish sara paretsky chicago february sister death by sue henry i am grown old now and weary and speak more often with death though we have yet to strike a bargain she and i still she comes at times to sit on the low threelegged stool by my small fire and croons to herself under her breath then we may trade memories for a space before she goes out again for given a cup of herb tea she is willing to share rambling reminiscences half forgotten and i am comforted if a bit nostalgic at recalling past times and company she is well acquainted with fate for they are cousins time and again i see them together like shadows in their long gray dresses the lace edges of their windblown petticoats repeating the color and rhythm of the ivory foam on the leaden sea as they move slowly along above the cliffs of the cove to watch the tide come in over the jagged reef beyond the harbor quiet and unassuming is death and has a refined and exquisite sense of timing and taste she patiently does not initiate but responds in serenity and forbearance to inevitabilities she has a liking for old familiar thingssongs tales her few living acquaintances especially those of us on whom she must soon lay her cool hand i think she is reluctant to treat with me because she has grown fond of my hearth and companionship few enough there are willing to keep company with death and she is lonely unseeing most villagers pass her on the road for she is invisible to the incredulous they go by with a small shudder or perhaps a gasp of selfconscious laughter like a sob she turns her head to watch them a stoic patience in her clear gray eyes acknowledging their fear with tolerant understanding and sympathy some are intuitively aware of her presence a crippled veteran of the last war once mentioned a figure he feels keeping pace beside his slow uneven gait but who is never there when he turns his head soon he will recognize and welcome her i think it must be a disappointment and a burden to be feared and it is sad that most cannot understand that death is not the dreaded calculating haunt they imagine but generous and gentle as a mother well acquainted with grief she has a lovely poignant smile out of her solitude she values compassionate company of an undemanding kind some nights i shake off the shades of sleep to find she has slipped in out of the dark to sit contemplating the coals of my banked fire elbows on thin knees chin and hollow cheeks cupped in the graceful curve of her palms and long slender fingers she has the hands of a young woman does death soft comforting and as beautifully translucent as old porcelain once when i was far gone with a winter fever she laid one of them on my brow it was cool compelling and she smiled faintly but then swiftly removed it and shook her head a little as the hint of a frown drifted across her face willing i was for as i said i am weary of being lame and as wrinkled as one of last autumns leftover apples but she refused me and has since touched me not careful never to brush so much as a fingertip against my hand in accepting a cup so she must find some value of her own in our relationship i am not impatient for i know that one day soon her gray cousin will follow death in at my door and there will be no hesitation in the matter for the time being we are sisters of a kind and strangely closer than husband or kin sometimes when the pain flares up in an evil lump and flutters like a bird within the cage of my ribs she reaches one thin pale finger to draw a slow circle through the tea in my cup when i have drained it if i sit very still the agony slides away and i grow drowsy in the comfort of my own fire glamoured by its flickering ribbons the winter was long and dark this year and spring laggard to appear but lately there have been a few days warm enough to go out into my greening patch garden of herbs and sit on the bench in the sun to watch the gulls float high over the cliffs of the cove there i rest and sort through my memories like an old gypsy with a bag of bright buttons i recall days and hours and people i have loved and lost into the long passage of my years and find that often i can remember them more clearly than those of last week or even yesterday it is at times more difficult to recall the name of the boy who brings my wood or to decide if it was two days or two weeks ago he last knuckled cheerfully on my door i was sitting there this afternoon warming my brittle bones and watching a redbreast hop along the low garden wall after a beetle when i heard a merry whistle and the boy came swinging up my path a bundle of sticks on one shoulder and a grin of greeting on his crooked mouth how be you auntie he asked laying the bundle by the door and a gentle hand upon my shoulder i glanced up and was sad and cross to see among the old fresh bruises on his face and worse than usual one eye had swelled near shut and a split in the corner of his lower lip still oozed a bright bit of crimson as he wiped it away with the back of a hand his sleeve fell back to reveal dark bluish purple discolorationsclearly the result of his stepfather once again taking out spite where he was able leaving the marks of his cruel fingers in the flesh of the boys forearm i sucked breath through my few remaining teeth and recognizing the helpless anger in my eyes he gave me a smile shook his head and shrugged shoulders already well muscled from rowing the boat and hauling nets out of the sea ah auntie they are but trifling and petty things already mending shall i carry you up a fish when we return i turned my gaze down to the harbor and narrowed my eyes to pick out the figure of the brutal man who stood by the boat shaking a fist and hallooing an impatient demand for the boys attendance best you be off or hell make the next blow even less to your liking i suggested and be you cautious for he would care little if you came not home but drowned out of reach of shore he gave me only another quick smile for answer but i caught a hint of thoughtful anger and resentment in his eyes as he turned to scramble away down the steep path to the crescent of sand below then trotted along to join his tormentor earning another clout for his trouble with an ache of fury and fear hard under my breastbone i watched them cast off and turn the boat for open water the boy spending all possible effort to keep even the sweep of the long oars while his persecutor rested in the stern of the heavy craft as they cleared the reef and headed into the stronger waves of open water a hint of motion drew my eyes back to the shingle and told me i was not alone in my concern for that particular departure not high on the cliffs but close together where the boat had rested and the incoming tide lapped the narrow beach stood those two familiar cousins petticoats aflutter in the breeze each with a comforting arm of reassurance about the others waist patiently their consideration focused on the pair in that small shell of a vessel moving inexorably away over the rocking surface of the endless gray sea when it disappeared around the headland they turned and paced away slowly stepping together growing smaller to my sight until far along the shingle the cliffs loomed between us and they too were gone a long time later clouds dark and growling a heavy threat of oncoming rain slid across the sun and it grew cool and breezy even in the shelter there beside my cottage door unwilling to surrender my vantage point until i saw the boy home safe i grasped the stick that i keep against the bench beside me to pull myself stiff as a rusty gate to my feet and tottered inside in search of my old blue shawl and a cup of water to soothe my throat parched with disquiet back on the bench once more i felt my concern increase to see that the now howling wind of the approaching storm was assisting the incoming tide to hurl massive waves over the reef all but hiding it with their assault and its resulting spray the gulls that earlier had coasted circles in the air above the cove had fled away to some shelter of their own leaving the sky empty of all but a blackish green wall of cloud moving rapidly toward land and casting ragged lines of lightning into the watery maelstrom beneath narrowing my eyes and sheltering them with a hand to my brow i peered seaward yearning to see the boy in the boat pulling hard for the safety of the cove but there was nothing among the huge endless waves rolling one after another onto the reef and shingle below from the few huddled cottages that make up our small village a number of folk had hurried down to haul their boats higher on the sand and secure them from the greedy fingers of the rising sea i could make out the widow kale hair and skirts atoss in the blow and her two tall sons as they struggled to drag their old dory up over the wet sand lost at sea in just such a storm three years before her good man had left her little but helpless dread at the need to send her boys out as fishermen in his wake as soon as the boats were made safe as possible the shingle quickly emptied as they all rushed back to shelter except for the widow who hesitated and swung slowly around to have one last look at the oncoming storm then suddenly she turned her back on the writhing sea lifted her face and following the direction of her gaze i saw that she had marked the two grayclad figures of death and her cousin as they slowly made their way along the cliff top now hand in hand as they watched the sea so the widow too was familiar with the pair but it was apparent that she bore them no acceptance as she made a quick sign against evil in their direction whirled and caught up her skirts to hasten to the consoling shelter of her hut not long after her disappearance as the first fat drops of rain began to fall and splash dimples in the dust of my yard before seeking my own shelter i took another look beyond the waves dashing over the reef and was at last rewarded for my watchfulness by the sight of two figures in a boat as it rose on the crest of a wave then was whirled out of sight into the trough that followed it was only a glimpse but i could tell that both were now rowing hard and had not far to go to gain the shelter of the cove though that was now little calmer than the open sea that poured and pounded into it a sudden lump of fear in my chest bent me half over with concern for them again the craft rose a bit closer and i could tell that the rowers were making an attempt to ride the crests whenever possible in endeavoring to reach safety very slowly they pulled nearer and as i could see them even in the troughs now i could tell that the man rowing closest to the bow of the boat was angrily shouting something at the boy in the stern but it was impossible to hear his voice over the roar of the wind and crash of the waves there was no response from the boy his back to his stepfather struggling to pull the heavy oars evenly and keep the boat headed for shore again the man moved as if he were shouting leaning forward letting both oars drag through the water from the oarlocks there was still no answer from the boy intent on his rowing who had little chance of hearing within the fury of the storm that had swept over them in a deafening curtain of rain as it reached me i hauled myself partially erect fighting a stab of pain in my chest to gain the shelter of the door to my cottage and saw that the cousins had reached the foot of my path and hesitated there to join me in watching the pair in the boat though the wind still tossed their skirts and the lace of their petticoats the rain that had half soaked me through in a moment seemed to have no effect on the shadowy fabric of their dresses i was more concerned with the two in the boat who were silhouettes against a sudden flash of lightning and i could see that the craft had now almost gained the cove that gain must have been made from the efforts of the boy alone for the man had slid forward onto his knees and taken one of his oars from its oarlock ignoring the other he held it raised high over his head clearly meaning to bring it down on the head of the unsuspecting boy with murderous intent nooo i cried clutching at the air between us with the gnarled fingers of one hand the other dangled strangely unresponsive at my side when i attempted to draw it up to hold against the pain of panic in my chest the pain turned suddenly to a fire that ran down that arm and a great weakness came over me only by leaning against the frame of the door was i able to tell what happened next for it occurred so very quickly frowning and shaking her head slightly fate withdrew her hand from that of her cousin and raised it toward the boat we could just make out in the distance and made a swift and subtle gesture with a last stroke of the boys oars the boat was caught by a rogue wave that came out of nowhere unexpectedly catching it sideways and flinging it forward to stop abruptly hard on the stones of the reef now hidden by the tide their jagged sharpness tore a hole in the hull crushing it like an eggshell ruining the precarious balance of the man and tossing him oar still raised above his head out of the boat and onto the rocks as well there for a moment or two he lay quite still then was washed off into the outer waters of the sea and sank from sight leaving only the oar to rock and spin in the foam of the turbulent surface the boy had been cast backward into the bottom of the boat but i saw him scramble up in the sinking vessel and look about in confusion for his stepfather seeming dazed at seeing no one now completely awash in the sea the boat began to slip and disappear as the steep outer side of the reef lost its hold slowly inexorably it sank following the man into the depths threatening to take the boy as well but at the last moment he rose and leaping nimbly out of it onto the sharp stones of the reef threw himself over into the slightly calmer waters of the cove where he began a determined swim toward shore gasping and faint i sank to my knees in my cottage doorway apprehension fading along with anger in the relief of knowing he would easily reach the safety of the shingle with no more trouble a long time later i woke to find myself in my own bed the sharp pain was still there in my chest but it was less and i lay still in concern that i might wake it again the storm had passed and through the window i could see that the night was full of darkness and welcome silence a small fire crackled and i could see the kettle steaming gently over it near it was the boy peacefully asleep on a rag rug near the hearth i closed my eyes deeply glad to see him alive and whole and best of all free then opened them again feeling the presence of someone else the door which at times complains opened without so much as a whimper and enough moonlight slid into the room to define the pair of shadows that fell across the floor i looked up to see not only sister death but also her cousin fate standing together in the doorway as i had long expected them to appear one day come in and welcome i whispered as well as i could through my twisted mouth and beckoned with the fingers of my one good hand they came in together and closed the door fate said not a word but smiled and nodded before crossing to the threelegged stool where she sat slim and graceful by the fire staring intently into its bright compelling ribbons sister death stepped close to the bed stood looking down at me patiently and saying nothing said everything without words she had asked and i answered at last we had struck that longanticipated bargain she and i slowly she reached one pale hand with its slender translucent fingers and laid its coolness with infinite gentleness on my brow the pain disappeared and i took a deep breath you are weary she told me silently sleep obedient i closed my eyes and was content but for one thing care for the boy as thought faded yes hearing her name by susan dunlap they didnt look at her not one of them thats a bad sign right dennis means zip and anyway itll all be over soon dennis haggarty flipped back the pages of his yellow lined notepad dropped it in his briefcase and pushed himself up from the defense table elizabeth carla call me by my real name carla she snapped then relented despite everything its just good to be called who i really am she looked over her toothin toounkempt lawyer and wondered yet again if she had made a mistake hiring a man who couldnt even remember her true name when the media latched on to the breaking story it was feds capture fugitive in hiding for years and she was elizabeth amanda creiss her fugitive name carla dreseldorf meant nothing to them or their readers it was elizabeth amanda creiss and her two decades on the run that made the front page for the eight months runup to this trial every shabby room elizabeth amanda creiss had hidden in every menial job every guy she had spent a night with was a days hot story it was impossible to turn on the radio or television without hearing elizabeth amanda creiss even her high school graduation pictures had run over the caption elizabeth amanda creiss years ago carla dreseldorf was merely a footnote before carla went underground no one bothered with her name and when the other conspirators were caught and created their own rounds of publicity the news stories often didnt mention her as dennis repeated every time she worried aloud she had been the most peripheral conspirator present at only one meeting of the muchmoreradicalthansherealized group before they attacked the power plant she hadnt even known what kind of explosive they were using they were making a statement with their smoke bombs they had told her never had they said they were trying to blow up the plant everybody has endgames her mother would have told her you dont pay enough attention to see them true and way too late now to think about that better to remember what dennis said that to the conspirators she was akin to the political campaign worker who dropped off the doughnuts and trotted on home besides dennis concluded every single time no one had been killed and all the evidence against her was circumstantial still when they filed out the jurors hadnt looked at her dennis turned to her look juries are ecstatic that testimony has finally ended and they will never have to sit in those chairs again theyre like kids heading for the playground they dont waste time looking at you theyve had weeks of you theyre sick of the sight of you and me and jefferson k markoff over there not to mention the judge trust me i have never seen a jury pause for a last look he stood yanked ineffectually at his illfitting tweed jacket and turned toward the door come on lets get some coffee the speed with which the courtroom gallery emptied had increased with each week already reporters would be outside calling in their updates lawyers who turned up for the summations and the judges final instructions fled as soon as the last word was out the groupies knew the routine after these three weeks even the sensation junkies raced out carla was shocked at how much the trial her every action affected people she would never have guessed she walked through the double door that dennis always held open for herto remind viewers that you are a person worthy of caring aboutand to the kiosk just juice dennis i dont think my stomach can handle coffee anymore hang in there elizabeth were coasting now she didnt bother to correct him instead she took the plastic bottle of orange juice and stood against the wall orange juicethat was an unfortunate color how many years would she be wearing orange or do prisoners only wear those uglyoneveryone jumpsuits in court conspiracy for malicious explosion fifteen to twenty years she shivered so violently the orange juice shot over the side of the bottle and she just caught the flow with her napkin in prison would they call her carla or elizabeth or just seven nine nine oh four eight all the regulars had their spots in the gray marble hallway this corner for defense in the far corner jeff markoff angled his bald head to say something to his assistant a newbie in the das office who must have been a basketball star in college from the near corner a blond woman in her early forties offered a timid smile carla sucked it in as if its hope could fill her the blonde had been at trial almost every day carla felt a bond and wondered if the woman felt it too sometimes out here when the wait went on and on she made her eyes go blank like she had learned to do in the subway in new york and fantasized about the womans life a life that could have been hers if only she had said no to the seduction of saving the world the womans blond hair fell just at her shoulders with the ease of alignment only a stylist could achieve she wore a wedding ring probably had children in college now maybe one still in the last year of high school she took notes every day on an unruled pad maybe shed gone back to college herself now that her kids were older taking notes for a law class or a journalism seminar after court let out each day she could call her friendsshe would have friends old friends friends she could speak to without monitoring every sentence lest something give her away or she could fly to paris london saigon using her utterly legitimate passport in her real name if carla had ever imagined the last twentyfour years she would never have guessed how important a name was how much she would miss her own how she would loathe hearing elizabeth amanda creiss she swallowed and tried to smile back at the blond woman the defendant was looking at her laura powley felt a tingle right down her spine but she wouldnt write that not tingle too trite she was trying to be a writer she needed to be able to come up with a more original word to describe emotion rush shiver quiver maybe no still trite besides her reaction didnt matter what was importantkey was to get elizabeth amanda creiss now because everything would be over so soon she was a mere observer not one who had joined the club of the brave not like elizabeth creiss who had risked all because she believed in something so much her essay assignment merely allowed her to peek in the door look at elizabeth creiss leaning against the dark wood panel shoulders so straight she could be holding up the wall rather than vice versanice keep that she wasnt afraid to let gray muddy her brown hair didnt waste time on expensive cuts laura knew that her dark blue sweater plaid wool skirt and fleshcolor stockings must have been chosen to give the appearance of wholesomeness bet shed tear them off the minute she could she was so strong on the stand never made excuses for herself but never let that slime of a da twist her words either it was her testimony that set the groundwork for her pound dog of a lawyer insisting that to even be called circumstantial the das accusations had to have some relation to evidence look at her never once did she have family or friends to support her here she stood tall on her own laura powley tried to sip her orange juice but she was too anxious too excited she just wished she could tell her how impressed she was the jury could be walking back to the court right now it could end any minute but elizabeth creiss wasnt nervous she was so cool look at her in the far corner carla noted the older couple they made no eye contact not with her or anyone else some days they didnt even speak to each other there was a bench in the middle of the lobby but they never used it as if that would be an admission that they were part of the whole soap opera once a week or so ago carla had caught the womans eye the woman had jerked her head away before there was time for reaction but there had been plenty of time after for carla to wonder about them if they were like her mother how would it have been to telephone them whenever she wanted to tell them what she was doing where she was tell them she missed them so much she ached from the hollowness of it they had winced with her when dennis failed to remember her name or maybe she just wanted to believe that that first night after the explosion she got off the bus somewhere in nevada by a thirtydollararoom motel she had been desperate to call home just to tell them she was okay alive that it was all an awful mistake but she didnt dare not then she had thought she was just postponing the call that shed find a safe time she hadnt known the chance wouldnt come for twentyfour years that by then not only would she have created identities one after anotherbut her mother had created one for herthe girl who had lied abandoned her family and disgraced them the girl who didnt care elizabeth do you want to walk outside in the courtyard the bailiff will call us she jerked back to the gray marble hallway thats okay dennis for now how long do you think the jury will be out the longer the better if theyre going against you theyve already decided the vote will be a formality icy cold shot down her spine she stared at the juice the orange years in prison the rest of her life till she was old way older than the old couple till no one at all remembered her real name she had never not once allowed that thought in but now it was smothering her how long if they go against me an hour three hours like i say it could go very fast you should take that walk then her voice was a squeak she had to swallow and start again then you think it will go bad im not saying that just that a walk outside in the air under the blue sky would be a good idea a walk in a walled enclosure was worse than standing here she wanted to run into the jury room and beg them to understand that she not was a conspirator the guys who planned the explosion didnt want her advice didnt tell her their plans most of them didnt even know her name after an hour she did go out sat on the steps looked up at the sky she might never see any other way the courtyard reminded her not of the outdoors but of the motel rooms where she huddled time after time creating new identities forcing herself to give up the things that could reveal her as her her streaked blond hair her violet toenails the silver snake bracelet the boy who could have become her boyfriend had just given her she had watched her swimmers muscles go to flab as she avoided even motel pools at the sight of a bookstore she had crossed the street to avoid the temptation of lingering in front of the window those abandonments were painful but manageable they were the top layer she had ripped off the next layer like a bandage off tooraw skin good coffee marzipan steak very rare and the next the way she automatically stood when waiting arms crossed over her chest her quick retorts that brought a laugh that was the hardest to never ever say anything that made her other than bland to become next to nothing each time she plunked down her duffle and watched the town she had called home for a year or for three months shrink to nothing outside a bus window she had mourned her attachment to her life there each time she had sworn that her next identity would steer clear of the telltale link to carla dreseldorf that forced her to abandon this town and her few acquaintances who passed as friends the marble courtyard reminded her of the county record rooms and libraries she visited one after another till she found the name of the dead baby who would have been about her age born in the united states died in another country elizabeth amanda creiss had allowed her to get a birth certificate a drivers license a passport she hadnt been quick enough to use the legitimate name had made her a person again a frankenstein of herself still she had never dreamed she would come to hate it the jury theyre coming back omigod dennis is it too soon its okay itll all be over in a minute come on carla dreseldorf walked stifflegged up the steps in the lobby she saw the blond woman start toward her stop and just give her a thumbsup but she was too scared to respond the old couple stepped back as she passed it was them she felt the bond to they who walked as tensely stiffly as she she passed through the bar dennis had to tell her twice to sit and then pull her arm when the bailiff said all rise the judge spoke but his words didnt penetrate her ears the foreman spoke she swallowed hard forced herself to hear her future ladies and gentlemen of the jury have you reached a decision we have your honor we find the defendant not guilty on charge number one not guilty on charge number two not guilty on charge number three carla slumped into her chair hearing nothing but her heart pounding dennis arms were around her free free we won youre free lets go celebrate lets have the most expensive meal two people have ever eaten come on dont you want to get out of here she let him pull her up and guide her through the bar down the aisle toward the double doors free to go anywhere to call anyone to answer the phone without fear open the door without peering through the peephole free to say hello im carla dreseldorf free to call mom to go to moms house make her listen to the real story free to ask to demand why she hadnt come to the trial hadnt done as much as the blond woman the old couple these strangers who supported her by their presence she pushed through the double doors and walked across the lobby free to dennis opened the courthouse door she stood there letting the sunlight coat her body looking out past the reporters at the tiny green leaves of the live oaks the deep green pine needles the pale soft green grass the gray buildings sparkled silver cars danced in jelly bean colors a sweet breeze rippled her collar gray gulls rode the winds on the landing below the blond woman threw her arms up in victory oh elizabeth you were so smart so brave ill always be so impressed by you elizabeth amanda creiss dont call me that name dont call her that name the shot knocked carla onto the marble steps her chest burned she was freezing blood was over everything her blood why she whispered why the old couple was standing over her the gun hung from the womans hand as the bailiff reached in the woman bent closer my baby died we had nothing left of her nothing but her name elizabeth amanda creiss every time we hear her name on the news see her name in the papers under your picture it tears us up all we had left was her name and you made a travesty of it frighted out of fear or the bombs bursting in air by p m carlson the problem with diamonds is that when a young lady sells one she receives a lovely large amount of money and in chicago was filled to the brim with fashionable bonnets and delicious cakes and expensive parisian scentsin short as shakespeare says it was a surfeit of the sweetest things so i knew that the money would have disappeared quick as a wink i had just come from st louis where my darling little niece juliet not yet four years old lived with my friend hattie in a home that was pleasant but with a roof that was beginning to leak as there were only five diamonds remaining of the ones juliets father had left i had resolved to keep them for her future use for safekeeping id had them set into a cheap theatrical bracelet interspersed with flashy paste jewels to disguise their value oh i know rich people prefer to keep their valuables in bank vaults but an actress on tour never knows when money might be needed and if the diamonds are far away in a vault they arent much help besides when men like jay gould decide its time for their banks to fail everything disappears except for mr goulds share the bracelet had proved much more convenient for me not that i planned to use it except of course as part of my costume it was boom times in chicago just a few steps north of the train station i saw the brandnew home insurance building and lordy it must have been nine or ten stories high the april breezes were alive with the smells of the lake the smokestacks the bakeries the stockyards but to me it seemed the scent of money i reckoned id soon be joining the ranks of the rich folk like marshall field and george pullman there were a great number of shows playing and in the normal way of things a few cast members would have succumbed to sciatica or a catarrh by now but unfortunately actors in chicago all enjoyed superb good health that week even when i showed managers the kansas city clipping calling me bridget mooney the bernhardt of missouri one after another informed me that replacements were not required well hang it whats a poor girl to do when even her fellow actors conspire against her to avoid having to pry one of juliets diamonds from my bracelet i was reduced to performing my comic impersonation of lillie langtry in a variety show at kohl and middletons dime museum the one on clark near madison that week the program also included a local pair of jugglers called the flaming flanagans and a troupe of ten trained saint bernard dogs thoroughbred canine heroes said the advertisements shakespeare must have been thinking of a manager when he wrote he has not so much brain as earwax because the dogs received top billing even though i was appearing in an olive green figured sateen dress with handsomely draped bustle that had once belonged to the rich and beautiful lillie langtry herself the giant dogs were amiable but slavered copiously as we were preparing for the first show that afternoon one of them drooled into the flanagans box of juggling balls backstage johannathe female flanaganfetched the huge dog such a whack that he turned tail and ran for his trainer her eyes blazing bright as the torches that she and her brother juggled at the finale of their act johanna advanced on dog and trainer the trainer babbled confused apologies and johanna quickly relented oh the dear puppy i didnt hurt him did i she petted the animals massive skull and i decided she had a warm heart after all my judgment was confirmed after the show when she learned i was looking for lodging and promptly offered me a cheap bed i was quick to accept and johanna looked pleased good you can share my room in my mothers house she said mutti charges less than a boardinghouse and you wont have to pay till we get our money as kohl and middleton paid very little and not until the end of the week this was welcome news to me johanna you are so very kind will there be space for my costumes i gestured at the trunk id had brought from the station yes at the foot of your bed but did you say mutti are you german then i asked it was true that johanna was blond and tall in stature and looked more german than hibernian despite being a flanagan im half german she explained da is irish but we havent seen him these fifteen years and when my brother peter and i went on the stage with our blazing torches we thought the flaming flanagans was a good name she finished removing the rouge from her cheeks closed her box of paints and said lets go then peters off to the beer hall with his friend archie tonight andoh she looked apologetic i forgot to say i promised to call on my friend mabel on our way home do you mind just for a short chat you must come too shes ever so nice and good at finding bargains and we wont be long i would be honored to meet your friend oh good here let me help you get your trunk down the steps we pulled it out the stage door into the balmy april night i hailed a porter a holloweyed fellow in a yellow checked cap who gave his name as peebles and clumsily bumped my arm as he lifted my trunk into his barrow then i hurried up clark street toward johanna who had strolled ahead a few steps toward the crowds spilling from the grand opera house suddenly a strong hand seized my arm stop in the name of the law your kind arent permitted here i turned to see a man with a mustache and a derby hat despite his ordinary clothes he was wielding the weighted cane used by police detectives so i said most politely why sir i have done nothing wrong i am but a visitor to your city he seemed taken aback by my excellent speech as well he might be my tutor had been the great actress fanny kemble but he blustered on youre new in town that i believe if you think youve done nothing wrong red hair clothes beyond your meansyoure a tart lordy was there ever such an insult true my hair is red and i was still wearing the dress that had been the notorious lillies but those are not good reasons to arrest a perfectly innocent young lady who only rarely is forced to resort to the line of work he mentioned johanna had finally looked back and now came striding up nearly as tall as my captor but her voice was girlish as she simpered why detective loewenstein what a coincidence i was just taking my friend to meet your wife bridget let me introduce detective jacob loewenstein my dear friend mabels husband and one of the finest policemen in chicago detective loewenstein this is miss bridget mooney hang it he didnt seem such a fine policeman to me but he had finally released me and it appeared that i was about to call on his wife so i followed johannas lead and said loftily im delighted to meet you detective loewenstein it is indeed reassuring to know that you are protecting the citizens of chicago with such zeal yes er happy to meet you too he gave me a little bow looking a bit flustered and how is your friend officer degan johanna asked him loewenstein answered i believe he is well miss flanagan as auxiliaries to captain bonfield his unit is very busy these days as you must be im sure lets be on our way bridget johanna said sliding her arm into mine mrs loewenstein will be waiting for us i looked to make certain that peebles the porter was following and we joined the jostling throngs before the brightly lit opera house and courthouse we crossed a drawbridge and continued on wells street the crowds thinned as johanna led me north to a handsome threestory corner building adorned with a tower at the entrance i instructed peebles to wait and we ascended a wellkept staircase to the third floor where the loewensteins had their rooms of the two loewensteins i much preferred mabel she was short in stature with dark hair and lively eyes and her stylish dress was of lilaccolored foulard with flounces of ecru lace johanna its good of you to come we havent had a good gossip for quite a while and youve brought a friend what a pleasure johanna made the introductions and mabel sent her nephew to purchase some cakes for us while she went into the next room for tea the sitting room was wellappointed with turkey carpets lace at the windows soft upholstered chairs and a handsome parlor stove i murmured to johanna the city of chicago appears to pay detective loewenstein well for his efforts a thousand dollars a year whispered johanna eyes round at the prospect as mabel returned with the tray she said miss mooney that is such a lovely sateen she cast an admiring glance at me and my langtry dress i murmured my thanks and she added if you ever wish to sell it i have a friend who loves that shade of green tell me are you irish too i was a keenan before i married jake yes im irish and your husband is german he speaks it and thats very helpful these days with all the unrest do you know how many german immigrants are in chicago four hundred thousand poor jake has a great deal to do i could see the tenseness around her eyes besides the usual problems with gambling and unsavory women he says those dreadful german anarchists are trying to take over the labor organizations and turn the workers against all the decent people oh he should know better than that johanna said the german workers mutti knows are decent people too of course when pinkerton men shoot striking workers some of them talk about defending themselves but its all talk mabel frowned still i worry about jakey hes given some special assignments because hes a favorite of captain schaack what kind of assignments he wont say but come look said mabel abruptly taking something from under the leg of the stove we followed her into a velvetdraped bedroom she pulled a box from under the bed and unlocked it you mustnt tell because he doesnt think i know where the key is but can that be what it seems in the box sitting among gloves and watches on layers of lace and velvet was a round iron object emerging from one side was a thick cord perhaps five inches long johanna peered at it and gasped oh mabel how thrilling it looks just like the pictures in the tribune when they wrote about how the anarchists make bombs mabel shuddered its horrid ive hardly slept since i saw it there but how splendid that jake has found an anarchist hell be a great hero johanna declared you look on the bright side mabel locked the box and slid it back under the bed johanna youll be an excellent policemans wife johanna blushed pink as a rosebud oh mabel dont tease mabel smiled at me explaining officer degan is sweet on johanna i expect wedding bells any day what good news johanna i exclaimed in my most sincere tones although i have never been enthusiastic about marriage to anyone not even for a thousand a year this officer degan must be a good man oh yes matt is a dear fellow johanna said earnestly and he has promised to escort me to the park monday when we both have free time mabel clapped her hands oh johanna this puts me in mind of the days when jakey was courting me such a happy time well i couldnt imagine being pleased by the attentions of a fellow like detective loewenstein who hid bombs under his bed and tried to arrest perfectly innocent young ladies but in the past i too have had moments of being blinded to the truth by a manly shoulder or a twinkling eye and mabel was right it was a happy time so for a few moments we all three praised the qualities of johannas matt and mabels jakey and my dear departed slick and wondered if matt would be asking for johannas hand monday after this pleasant half hour johanna and i awakened peebles the porter and continued to johannas more modest home mutti was tall and of sturdy physique like her daughter and she seemed pleased to have a paying visitor the little bed in johannas room was narrow but clean and warmed with a featherbed and i would have had no complaints exceptfor one thing i had quietly checked the contents of the pocket id sewn into my bustle because a couple of handsome gentlemens hunting watches had found their way into it as we jostled through the throngs of opera patrons this evening but as i removed my langtry dress i gasped what is it bridget johanna already in her white nightdress was brushing out her long blond hair i took a deep breath as i confirmed that nothing had caught in the lacy sleeve of the dress a trifle part of my langtry costume is missing oh dear johanna turned from the little mirror over her table and looked at me with consternation what is it a trifle i repeated keeping the despair from my voice after all johanna was possibly guiltless though i remembered her slipping her arm through mine as we walked toward the grand opera i suppose the clasp broke and i dropped it along the way just a bracelet with a dozen paste jewels wellseven paste jewels the other five had been my little nieces future next morning as soon as johanna left our chamber to assist her mother i did a thorough but fruitless search of her vanity table and clothingalthough i couldnt truly believe that johanna had it for all her skill as a juggler she didnt seem clever enough to remove a bracelet from under the sleeve of a young lady as alert and knowledgeable as i i donned a simple walking dress and went in to a hearty breakfast afterward i thanked her mother told johanna i would see her at the theatre and set off to retrace my steps i did not have high hopes of finding my bracelet johanna had not been the only one who had been near me the night before the porter peebles had bumped my arm as he lifted my trunk into his barrow and numerous people had brushed by on the crowded streets as i walked i tried to remember the details of our journey the night before here was a corner where id paused to look back at peebles and my trunk here johanna had met a german relative of her mothers on the street here was mabel loewensteins home i paused could i have dropped it on that turkey carpet it was too early to call on her but later i would i continued down the street and across the drawbridge if the hasp had broken there the bracelet might have fallen through the steel grid into the busy chicago river below which teemed with scows and shouting rivermen but when i reached clark street and remembered the jostling throngs outside the grand opera i had to admit that even a young lady as clever as i might have missed a master pickpocket if distracted and hang it i had been distracted id been conversing with johanna and watching for gentlemen with hunting watches and making certain that peebles in his yellow checked cap was following with my trunk peebles who had nudged my arm he could so easily have taken my bracelet it was time to hunt for peebles it was not easy though i watched for him every day peebles did not appear near the theatre where i had first found him nor around the train stations johanna was no help being all atwitter about her upcoming monday walk in the park with the peerless officer degan toward the end of the week kohl and middleton asked us all even the slobbering hero dogs to play for a week at their second theatre a mile west on madison and sunday was spent moving and rehearsing in the new space on monday i wished johanna a happy day with officer degan and returned to question the porters at the railroad station at last i found a spikyhaired fellow who knew peebles hes not really one of us mum hes a machinist worked for mccormick reaper see but got locked out back in february along with the other union men he explained to put bread on the table he works as a porter when he can get the use of a barrow do you know where he lives my informant shrugged moves from one relative to another if you want to find him try looking at the mccormick works but you said hed been locked out a lot of the union men picket outside the gates and holler at the scabs when hed given me directions to mccormicks out blue island avenue i rewarded the unkempt fellow with a few pennies then took the streetcar as the mccormick works were some three miles from the city center i did not ride the full distance because when we reached twentysecond street i saw a large crowd of workers peebles perhaps among them the workers were gathered around a boxcar and atop it stood a man perhaps thirty years old with a handsome light brown mustache and a gaze that might have inspired shakespeare to cry look on me with your welkin eye he was speaking in german when i first approached and about half of the large crowd was nodding but he soon shifted to pleasantly accented english as i wandered through the crowd searching for peebles i couldnt help but hear some of what the handsome gentleman was saying wherever we cast our eyes he declared with a sweeping gesture we see that a few men have not only brought technical inventions into their private ownership but have also confiscated for their exclusive advantage all natural powers such as water steam and electricity they little care that they destroy their fellow beings right and left the blue eyes blazed and indignation radiated from his honest face who is the speaker i murmured to a grizzled man who was nodding enthusiastically he looked at me with pity you dont know he is the editor of the best german newspaper the arbeiterzeitung and one of our most popular speakers his name is august shpeece later i learned that in the peculiar way the germans have it was spelled spies but i always thought of him as august we must progress to cooperative labor for the purpose of continuing life and of enjoying it august told us anarchy does not mean bloodshed does not mean arson or robbery these monstrosities are on the contrary the characteristic features of capitalism well having recently been robbed i certainly agreed that it was a monstrosity and i was ready to do away with whatever had caused it though i wasnt certain what this dreadful thing capitalism was and august had mentioned anarchy favorablybut surely he couldnt be one of the horrid anarchists that the newspapers told us we must fear i couldnt believe it of such a kindly wellspoken man do not be slaves your toil produces the wealth it is yours not the bosses august cried workers must stand firmly together then we will prevail oh they were splendid words as stirring as shakespeares once more unto the breach i was on the verge of running up to kohl and middleton and pummeling them for higher wages but on reflection i wasnt certain that the other workers would stand firmly with me as august advised johanna might and perhaps her brother if he wasnt at the beer hall but those giant hero dogs were more likely to rescue the managers than attack them i decided id best wait for better troops there was no sign of peebles and i could see another clump of men farther along blue island avenue near the mccormick works so i left august and his enormous crowd behind me and moved on toward the pickets outside mccormicks suddenly a loud bell clanged a man called here they come and as workers began to emerge from the door the men whod been locked out began to holler scabs and shame and some german words that sounded even worse i thought i saw a yellow checked cap on the far side of the little crowd and started toward it eagerly but a few among the picketers picked up stones and threw them at the strikebreakers and suddenly there was a melee one of the two policemen on duty fought his way to a patrol box to call for help well my aunt mollie always said that a lady should never get involved in anything as lowclass as a riot so notwithstanding augusts inspiring words i ducked around the corner of a building and a lucky thing i did when i peeked i saw a patrol wagon full of policemen drawn by two galloping horses careening up blue island avenue and straight into the crowd its black jack bonfield cried a picket and a few stones were thrown at the police the officers laid about with their nightsticks and bloodied many heads and soon were joined by dozens of officers on foot the strikebreakers had run back into the building but a few picketers continued to throw stones although the police had the upper hand whenever i glimpsed a face under a helmet it looked frightened captain bonfield a squintyeyed fellow yelled something i couldnt hear above the shouting and the officers pulled their revolvers well in my experience revolvers make a situation a sight more dangerous than stones and nightsticks i dove back to safety and pulled my colt from my bustle pocket i heard gunshots and screams and in a moment the pickets were dragging their wounded friends away some to the haven where i stood the groans of the bleeding men were piteous indeed at last the gunshots stopped and i peeked again but could not see peebles i heard a familiar voice and saw august come running toward the factory looking as shocked and sickened as i felt the picketers had scattered and the police arrested the stragglers while shouting congratulations to each other for winning such a glorious victory yes indeed when theyd left i put away my colt and tore strips from my petticoat to hand to those who had crept out to help the wounded peebles was not among them my chance to find him was gone and even the handsome blueeyed august had left frustrated i kicked a stone into the street and made my way back to kohl and middletons at the theatre i found johanna too in a dark mood she wore a terrible scowl and was distracted and clumsier than usual dropping a ball once and almost lighting her poor brothers hair on fire with a poorly aimed torch afterward he drew me aside please bridget walk home with her the only thing she said to me was you men are beasts well i had to agree with her opinion of men after seeing all the pelting and shooting at mccormicks i followed her out the door and murmured johanna what did that dreadful officer degan do nothing she strode up halsted street and i had to trot to keep up nothing you mean some other horrid man has hurt you no i mean he did nothing he didnt meet me in the park she began to weep i offered her a handkerchief patted her arm and asked didnt detective loewenstein say that officer degan worked with captain bonfields men they were in action today so perhaps matt couldnt but he promised johanna sobbed i suggested why dont we go speak to your friend mabel she can tell you if officer degan had adequate reason for such a terrible breach of courtesy johanna nodded and allowed herself to be guided toward the loewenstein home i was pleased for i too had questions im delighted to see you mabel in a violet jacket dress hugged us both jakey is so busy these days i dined alone again tonight a shadow darkened her lively features she looked more closely at johanna and added but johanna what is wrong though redeyed from weeping johanna was listening carefully to mabels words she asked you say jake is busy these days abandons you sometimes it seems that way captain schaack assigns him to these secret meetingsoh i shouldnt be telling you this johanna sank into a plush armchair sniffled into my handkerchief and asked do you think matt degan was assigned to a secret meeting mabel looked surprised i wouldnt think so hes not a detective if he had to stay on duty to help captain bonfield it wouldnt be a secret assignment like jakes matt should have got word to you he didnt johanna sobbed let me get you some tea mabel soothed i followed her into the butlers pantry she frowned back at johanna and murmured to me poor johanna she should not bestow her heart so easily do you mean officer degan is not reliable she shrugged and placed the teapot on the tray when i mentioned johannas hopes to jake he laughed and said degan had more than one young lady at his beck and call oh dear poor johanna mabel i had another question i may have dropped a bracelet while i was visiting here i described it as we carried the tea back to johanna who had risen from her chair and was pacing about the parlor i will look very carefully mabel promised with a little frown sit down johanna have some tea we finally convinced johanna that matt might yet apologize and she stopped sobbing mabel maintained that jake and the others were upset because of the labor unrest and would be kind and loving once again when the work was not so frightening jakey hates to feel frightened he much prefers being angry i couldnt help thinking of wise old shakespeare who said to be furious is to be frighted out of fear captain bonfields order to shoot had helped his men feel fury instead of fear but laborers were men too and bonfield had given them cause to be more frightened than ever and i wondered if their fear would turn to fury too instead they called another meeting at breakfast johanna was silent probably brooding on matt degan but her brother peter was reading the arbeiterzeitung and i asked if it mentioned the shots at the mccormick works oh yes he said they write about the injustice of the police firing on unarmed men and say workers should carry dynamite or revolvers in selfdefense theyve called a meeting tonight look its at the haymarket very close to the theatre our show will be over in time to hear the last speeches this is strong language his mother cautioned pausing teapot in hand to frown over his shoulder at the paper avenge the atrocious murder that has been committed upon your brothers todaydo be careful peter but like peter i wanted to go peebles might well be there with answers about my braceletand perhaps the handsome fiery august as well it was after nine and dark when johanna and peter and i departed from kohl and middletons leaving the saint bernards to finish the evening performance we walked a block to desplaines and turned north toward the meeting where peter met his ruddyfaced friend archie a reporter for the chicago times look at all the police captain bonfield has mustered archie said why do they call him black jack i asked he can be brutal like yesterdays shooting archie said or last year during the streetcar strike when he clubbed everyone in reach even store owners who came out to see what was happening a gas company worker named kerwin is still laid up from that beating they ought to replace bonfield peter said the mayor might but marshall field and his rich friends are nervous with this talk of dynamite and they think bonfield can frighten the eighthour supporters look hes lining up reinforcements archie gestured at the alley we were passing and made a note johanna said nothing but i saw her crane her neck to look for matt degan among the massed officers i tugged her arm and we moved on up desplaines there was a large crowd ahead and several men including the welkineyed august up on a wagon the man speaking was nearly as appealing as august but had coal black hair and mustache his beautiful english had a hint of a southern accent its albert parsons archie told us he edits the englishlanguage anarchist paper thats his wife and children on the next wagon see them parsons was saying i am not here for the purpose of inciting anybody but to speak out to tell the facts as they exist even though it should cost me my life i was beginning to think that the rich folks had it all wrong about the anarchists who claimed to be filled with the noblest of sentiments truthtelling cooperation and love for family parsons mentioned jay gould who owned railroads now instead of banks and someone shouted hang him no parsons replied this is not a conflict against individuals but for a change of system kill jay gould and like a jackinabox another or a hundred others like him will come up in his place hang him cried a boy and the huge crowd laughed archie seemed disappointed and snapped his notebookclosed wont sell any papers with that peaceful stuff but it was my bracelet that i wanted to find i excused myself and slipped into the crowd to search for peebles after introducing the next speaker a bearded british fellow named fielden parsons left the speakers wagon and joined his family nearby i continued searching through the crowd there was a low rumble of thunder in the north and a gust of wind blew papers about parsons called to fielden its going to rain do you want to finish in zepfs hall fielden said im nearly done then we can all go home parsons nodded and gathered his children to take them to zepfs for shelter many people were glancing at the sky and leaving fearing that i would miss peebles i made my way up the entry steps of a building for a better look at last in the glimmer of the streetlight i saw his yellow checked cap he was making his way toward lake street not far behind parsons family i started after it seemed now that there was a faint thunder in the south as well but i didnt take my eyes from him until i heard a loud voice call out disperse and peebles stopped to look back i looked too and hang it id never seen so many policemen the street was inky with them rank on rank filling desplaines street from the speakers wagon back toward the police station at the head of the wall of police was captain bonfield facing fielden on the speakers wagon fielden said but we are peaceable disperse insisted bonfields spokesman fielden didnt argue he said all right we will go and jumped down from the wagon the others shrugged and began climbing down even august i was about to turn back to peebles when i saw a bright spark like a shooting star sizzle through the air from the east edge of the street into the center of the police ranks and then lordy a fearsome thunderclap a flash as bright as noon a blast of wind that blew me against the wall around me windows cracked for just an instant silence quivered in the air i looked for peebles and he was standing there bedazzled like the rest of us then a woman shrieked and a man groaned a spinechilling groan and others began screaming and swearing and the terrified police began to fire round after round after round i lit out of there quicker than a rabbit oh i know i know a proper lady would have stood there weeping prettily until rescued by a noble officer of the law but hang it i didnt much like loud blasts and i didnt like wild shooting by frightened men and frankly i hadnt found chicago policemen to be all that noble besides peebles was hightailing it away so i followed the riot bell from the police station began to clang as i chased peebles past zepfs saloon i heard august call to someone it was a cannon wasnt it well im just a poor girl from missouri but my brother fought for the union and he described a bomb to me a bright flash and a thunderclap and i wondered if these anarchists of noble sentiment knew what their audiences might do the firing stopped it had lasted only three or four minutes around a corner i finally reached peebles and put my hand on his arm mr peebles do you remember me what his sunken eyes rolled with terror last week you carried my trunk in your barrow what the fellow was so stunned and terrified he could hardly think i finally caught his attention by tapping his nose with a coin peebles were safe the police have stopped shooting get hold of yourself and think you carried my trunk from madison and clark up wells street i waved the coin if you can answer my questions there may be something for you yesm there was still a little hitch in his voice but he seemed to be listening now on that night someone took my bracelet was it you nom of course not the truth peebles what did you do with it i never took it dont lay it on me you gave it away i gave it away yesm when that detective stopped you ladies allus give that detective something before he lets em go most times its money but you already told me you didnt have much and i saw him looking at the bracelet and putting it in his pocket afterwards so it warnt me took it i remembered the locked box mabel had shown us the lace gloves and broochesall extorted was my bracelet there now was the bomb i asked peebles why didnt you tell me i thought you gave it to im all the ladies do i sighed well heres something for telling me at last and gave him the coin i went back to desplaines no one was in the street now but a block away i could see policemen helping wounded officers up the steps of the police station i didnt see johanna or peter so i decided to go to the flanagans home as i turned back the glimmer of the streetlight showed me a telegraph pole peppered with bullet holes all of them were on the side that faced the police i shivered for i had passed that pole just moments before the frantic shooting on my way back there were several drugstores filled with wounded people buying medicines in the third i saw johanna and hurried in to greet her she was shaky and weeping and had a gash on her back not very deep i helped her get a sticking plaster onto it and arrange her torn dress then led her home youre bleeding what happened demanded her mother and when we explained she asked wheres peter but we didnt know i left the two of them to wait up for him and went to sit on my bed and have a good think i wanted to get out of chicago in the week id been here id seen too much shooting too much bleeding and much too much bombing but first i had to get my bracelet back from detective loewenstein how after what id just seen i didnt want to cross a policeman anytime soon i decided to lie low until things calmed down again then check with mabel to see if she could help me things didnt calm down they got worse lordy ive never seen anything like it policemen had never before died and been wounded in such numbers maybe theyd never before been ordered to shoot when in such close formation but of course they wouldnt admit theyd shot each other they blamed it all on the foreign anarchists and worked chicago into a frenzy of fear i was glad my hosts were named flanagan because everyone turned on the germans marshall fields favorite paper the tribune suggested restricting immigration to keep out foreign savages and even archies paper the chicago times said the bombers were not americans they were cutthroats of beelzebub from the rhine the danube the vistula and the elbe the knights of labor ran for cover saying they hoped the anarchists would be blotted from the surface of the earth the whole nation agreed a new york reporter said the mob poured volley after volley into the midst of the officers i reckon he hadnt seen the telegraph pole that proved the volleys came from the police maybe because he lived in new york maybe because the telegraph pole disappeared the next day jakeys superior captain schaack explained that the telegraph company had removed it in the common course of business yes indeed the courts backed up the police of course the state attorney told the police make the raids first and look up the law afterward they did hundreds of people were arrested fielden the speaker who had obeyed the captains order and agreed to leave was one handsome august was another the mayor consulted with marshall field and other notable citizens and made a proclamation to forbid crowds from gathering in public places but of course they could gather to spend money in big stores like mr fields and luckily in theatres too because we had other problems poor johannas sore shoulder prevented her from performing and when we learned that officer degan had been killed by the bomb she sank into a fever and could barely move i learned a few juggling tricks from peter so that i could pretend to be a flaming flanagan though i balked at the blazing torches i was glad for the extra few dollars for i would soon have enough for a ticket to new york but hang it i needed my bracelet as the week drew to a close i risked calling on mabel i embraced her and she winced but said bridget how good to see you dearest mabel i have a favor to ask of course its so lonely these daysjakey is very busy and out of sorts trying to find that anarchist lingg and he has all these secret projects yes i dont want to bother your husband thats why i came to you its about the box you showed us under the bed no please mabel fell into a chair and burst into tears dont even mention that horrid box oh mywhat happened i pulled a slipper chair to face her and dabbed at her wet cheeks with my handkerchief when i brushed her arm she flinched i dont know what happened she sobbed jakey looked in the box and the bomb was gone i dont know where but he shouted i was only to sell what he gave me and became furious gently i turned back the lace of her sleeve where a yellowing bruise marred her pale skin no wonder shed been wincing i said he struck you no no he loves me i know he does she gave me a brave smile i touched the scar on my cheek slick loved me too yes indeed her eyes locked onto mine and you left him yes a little afterwards he was shot i dont like to think about it but tell me did you look in the box to see why jake was angry no i mustnt its his she sniffled and added besides hes started hiding the key somewhere else i dont know where well hang it my chance to regain my bracelet had slipped away for now when payday came i took the train to new york and had better luck eventually joining a national tour with dear mr booth of course i read the news from chicago wherever my tour took me jakey became a hero when he helped capture lingg who was put on trial with seven other anarchists including dear august the charge was the murder of officer degan the only one killed by the bomb instead of bullets the police hadnt caught the bombthrower but said the eight had conspired to cause someone else to throw a bomb they even got one witness to claim hed seen august light the fuse though hed been half a block away on the speakers wagon clearly the police wanted to be the heroes of this melodrama and theyd cast poor august as a villain everyone knows villains must be punished whether the plot makes any sense or not i wasnt surprised when the jury decided to hang them there were appeals and three of the eight ended up with prison terms instead of a death sentence but in november of dear august was hanged i have to admit i shed a tear the next time i saw mabel was the autumn of id just returned from a horrid stay in london and was on my way to st louis to see my dear little niece but i didnt want to arrive emptyhanded so again i stopped in chicago i found a temporary role at the columbia theatre because one of the young ladies in the bells of haslemere had turned her ankle i knew there was little hope of recovering my bracelet but for juliets sake i was obliged to try it was evening after the show when i called on mabel loewenstein the boy whod brought us cakes before took up my card and in an instant mabel herself in mourning appeared on the steps to welcome me upstairs mabel what is it i asked concerned by her distraught appearance oh bridget you are just the one to tell me what to do please come in i followed her into the parlor it was as richly appointed as before with a few additions in the form of new lamps and paintings as she prepared tea she explained ever since he helped capture that anarchist lingg jakey has been praised by all captain schaack continues to favor himseems almost afraid of him i think both of them arewell not entirely honest what makes you thinkoh did you find the key to the box keys she corrected me tears glistened on her lashes as she handed me a cup now there are three boxes and one of them holds your bracelet oh thank you mabel its just a trifle but im fond of it how can i ever no wait i cant return your bracelet hed know that id been nosing about and hed the sobs broke out im so afraid he no longer loves me i asked he still strikes you then he comes home so late and so drunkand he says it is my fault our dear baby did not survive but how could i protect the little one when i cant she dabbed at her eyes i said mabel im so sorry how can i help she reached tentatively toward the little scar on my cheek you said you left him please tell me how well hang it there was a poser its easier to up and leave a fellow when youre a traveling artiste and have friends around the nation but mabel seemed so settled here i asked do you have family in other cities no my sister and brother are here oh i dont want to leave town i waited for a fresh spasm of sobs to subside and finally said i see a way you can leave jake yet stay in chicago but first i must ask if you can bear a bit of scandal oh must i that captain schaack already says im disreputable liar i promise you in the end it will fall on jake and not on you he would hate that she said with a damp smile the first thing to do is count up our strengths we must look in the boxes i raised a palm to quiet her fearful protest will jakey be back soon no hell be late and drunk but hell know we can replace everything just as before she still hesitated and i added do you want to be safe yes no i want him to love me but does he when her face fell i added the keys hurry with fearful steps she went to the boot stand in the entry and picking up a mans polished boot pulled three keys from the toe we pulled the boxes from under the tall carved bed opened them and there clumped with other jewelry in a corner of the second box was my bracelet my heart danced a happy jig the rest was even better than id hoped there were watches there was a fine silk scarf there were handsome dressesoh thats the one stolen from mrs hill mabel said warming to our task the thief was arrested but mrs hill never got her dress back there were rings and brooches look remember the anarchist lingg left a brooch to his sweetheart and after he died they couldnt find it there it is best of all there were official papers yes thats the man who testified he saw august spies light the bomb i frowned at the page thats not what he says here this is the mans original testimony captain schaack and jakey pay people to say what they want them to so in court this man swore august spies lit the fuse and then jake hid the original statements i flipped through the rest of the papers no wonder that lowdown schaack was afraid of jake and it looked as though black jack bonfield had reason to fear exposure as well i beamed at mabel mabel your future is bright bring a little valise or carpetbag looking hopeful she complied and protested only a little as i slid the papers the silk scarf and linggs brooch into the little black valise she brought my bracelet of course was already safe in my bustle pocket i was closing the valise when the downstairs door slammed and we heard a heavy tread on the stairs mabel gave a terrified squeal i grabbed her arm hush you must act as you always do dont mention me i finished relocking the three boxes and kicked them under the bed from a floor below came a muffled sleepy scandinavian voice yakey be quiet yah mabel whimpered dont leave me dont worry just help him to bed all the usual things i gave her arm a little shake are you listening i help him to bed yes good i ran into the parlor jakes heavy steps sounded very near now so i dove behind a settee that was angled across a dusky corner of the room i held my skirts close about me and trusted to the shadows and to jakes inebriation to protect me jakey dear mabel said as the door opened she was trying but i could hear the quiver in her voice do you want a beer he tossed his coat onto a peg his gun peeking from its pocket nah im tired move and he added an oath that no lady should be forced to hear although mabel did not seem surprised he tugged off his boots and staggered to the bedroom to fall onto his pillow when he began snoring mabel tiptoed to the entry to hang up his jacket and looked around but didnt see me as she turned down the lamps it was not a night for rest jake snored mabel sobbed and in my head aunt mollie was whispering to me that mabel was not strong enough i should take my bracelet and skedaddle and never see mabel or jake again but hang it i could also hear the piteous groans of the men bonfield had shot at mccormicks and at haymarket and the cries of panic afterward that bonfield and schaack and jake had created and thrived on and especially the idealistic voice of august of the welkin eye hanged because the police didnt want to admit theyd shot each other so i told aunt mollie to hush up crept out to empty jakes smith and wesson then returned to hide behind the settee and doze off with my colt in my hand i woke to morning light and the sound of an oath from their room i hurried silently to stand by the hinge side of their closed door wheres my watch stupid woman jakey its in your jacket mabel in her wrapper emerged to fetch his coat from the entry hall she didnt see me because i was behind the door shed just opened through the gap between the hinges i could see jakey stumbling to his feet fumbling in the pocket of the jacket she brought back pour the water yes jakey she poured water into the basin for him and handed him a towel apparently seeing him at his ablutions inspired tender feelings for she added dear jakey its not too late if you would only love me as you once did stupid woman he elbowed her away to wash his neck just then the boy knocked and called do you want pastries today yes please mabel hurried to the door and gave the lad some coins then returned to the bedroom and said jakey do you love another tell me im tired of your jealous nonsense mabel stop it or well have to split up she cried but ive kept quiet ive only sold what you told me to ive been a good wife shut up he grabbed his smith and wesson from his jacket and waved it about well i was pleased though mabel wasnt jakey no im a good wife just then i got the perfect angle through the gap between the hinges jake was in profile and i could have hit him square in the temple but instead as a favor to mabel i aimed a bit forward and took off his left eyebrow i know i know proper ladies are not good marksmen but growing up in st louis id learned to hit a squirrel in the eye from thirty paces and some days its hard to give up the old ways jake was much nearer and much slower than a squirrel and how can a poor girl resist when fate provides her with one of the finest colts in the nation once the favored gun of jesse james jake bellowed and fired twice and i shot him in the hand because if he kept firing he might realize that someone had emptied his smith and wesson blood streamed down his face blinding him and his cries grew weaker mabel was still whimpering jakey no when he fainted and fell on her i rushed out and down the stairs clutching the valise passing the old scandinavian neighbor on his way up help they need a doctor i gasped he began to shout doctor come quick while i ran down the front steps and melted into the morning crowds my first stop was at the lawyer kerns office on lasalle street when i sent in word that my business had to do with linggs missing brooch he consented to see me he was intrigued by the brooch and the papers and the keys to three boxes of further evidence when i explained that mabel would need a good defense lawyer because his fellow policemen would try to claim that she was trying to kill jakey instead of the other way around he agreed to take her case if she requested his help and meanwhile he would deposit the evidence into the vault at merchants bank next i found mabels sister and told her that mabel was in trouble and would have to move out and to be sure to take the three locked boxes under the bed along with her gowns and clothing and that a lawyer named kern was prepared to defend her for a reasonable fee but the police moved fast too mabel was in jail almost as soon as jakey was in the hospital captain schaack wouldnt let family or friends see her and i knew he was trying to get her to agree to his story but as jakey recovered he and schaack must have realized that mabel held all that evidence and they became more respectful i decided it was safe to go on to st louis especially since the actress with the sprained ankle was recovering and wanted her role back mr kern did well by mabel and got jakey to withdraw the charges but i grew impatient for action against those who had hanged dear august so unjustly marshall fields pet tribune was hopeless as usual because it favored the police version but when i returned to chicago after the holidays i left an unsigned note for archie at the rival chicago times telling him to talk to kern and keep a close eye on the loewenstein shooting case within days the times had published mabels side her home was turned into a warehouse for stolen goods captain schaack and jake loewenstein were in the game other and higher members of the force said to be implicated schaack and bonfield sued the times for libel but the editors had seen the proof and didnt back down heaps of newspapers were sold to a public eager to read about linggs brooch mrs hills dress and manufactured evidence in trials a month later mayor roche suspended all three officers they never caught the haymarket bombthrower a few years later in colorado i happened across a traveling carnival that featured a tall blond lady juggler called anna the anarchist i watched a moment until sensible aunt mollie began to whisper in my head that it might be best not to recognize johanna so i slipped out the side way but not before id seen that the gray balls she was juggling had been fitted out with burning fuses to look like the bomb shed stolen from the box under mabels bed the one that had landed with such precision on the faithless officer degan others were also chipping away at the police story and in governor altgeld looked at the trial record and fully pardoned the three anarchists who were still alive with scathing words for police and court alike but hang it life is not as neat as melodramas governor altgeld was not reelected and a new mayor reappointed schaack and bonfield to the force and rich businessmen erected a statue in haymarket square to the police the heroes of haymarket yes indeed guardian angel by rochelle krich although belinda believed that everything would turn out for the best it always did she couldnt help feeling anxious in part it was the exhaustion which she hoped would diminish as her body adjusted to the new schedule when the baby was finally asleep she took a quick shower and wrapped herself in the onesizefitsall gray and navy striped velour robe that shed bought in the mens department at macys bracing herself for the chill of the january morning she opened the door to take in the times the phone rang she had turned off the ringer in the bedroom but she hurried to the kitchen extension taut with apprehension that twisted inside her stomach and eased only a little when she saw the callers name in the receivers window her mother belinda didnt want to talk to her mother not today doing anything special linnie her mother would ask in the carefully cheerful tone belinda hated as if belinda were about to break into tiny pieces like the cup shed thrown against the wallonly one time but no one would let her forget it her mother would want to come over i havent seen you in weeks linnie is everything okay and belinda would have to invent another reason for turning her down and what if the baby started crying in her yellow kitchen commandeered by bottles nipples brushes and a phalanx of baby formula cans belinda slid the newspaper out of the plastic bag that she added to the others under her sink the bags were twoply perfect for disposing of eggshells and vegetable peels and chicken innards and overripe fruit oozing sticky liquids and for masking the ammonia and fecal odors belonging to the mass of soiled diapers that was growing at an alarming rate there was nothing of note in the california section belinda read it twice then checked on the baby she was still sleeping savoring the stillness belinda relaxed with a mug of hot coffee and the crossword puzzle which she finished in less than ten minutes in ink the one time she had mentioned the ink to her family her father had said dont preen linnie that had stung belinda never drew attention to herself she never boasted about the acts of kindness she performed some of which she could never reveal much as she was tempted like feeding meters about to expire and visiting the ill and doing their chores and dropping off groceries anonymously in the middle of the night for mary iverson a widowed friend of the family who couldnt make ends meet but was too proud to ask for help my guardian angel was here again mary would tell belinda her voice quavering with delight being called a guardian angel did make belinda feel special but it was unfair to say she was preening her mouth stretched into another yawn the baby whimpering throughout much of the night had slept fitfully and only in short bursts so had belinda and while the coffee robust and deliciously bitter had taken the edge off her weariness sleep tugged at her eyelids which felt like sandpaper if not for the baby she would crawl back under her comforter and stay in bed forever she did that sometimes when she was between projects well not forever but for hours there was nothing wrong with that though her family would disagree one time she stayed in bed for three days getting up only to relieve herself she didnt like to think about that dark period she had promised herself it wouldnt happen again kind of selfindulgent dont you think linnie her father would say a smirk playing around his thin lips slothful in fact your sister wouldnt do that alicias raising two boys but she still finds time to chair committees and help others you dont find her lolling in bed now arnold her mother would shush him with a gentle shove linnie is helpful in her own way and she does have a job then she would urge belinda again to move back into the room shed shared with alicia this old house is way too big for your father and me and why do you want to live all alone anyway and of course alicia the pretty twin married to a successful and shady real estate developer and mother to two bratty toddlers would throw belinda a pitying look before imparting some of her sage advice you need to get a life linnie alicia would sigh while studying the acrylic finish on her nails why dont you let me fix you up with one of martins colleagues or i can help you write your profile for eharmony or another internet site every pot has its lid her father would say every roaster too hed add with a sly wink enjoying his cruel reference to belindas large frame belinda had a life thank you very much she enjoyed copyediting the steady stream of manuscripts that provided her with security and some luxuries and allowed her to set her own schedule and she excelled at what she did finding the perfect word correcting diction or grammar or inconsistencies or clumsy phrasing in her desk drawer she kept notes from editors complimenting her thoroughness and expertise and from authors thanking her for saving them from embarrassment some authors listed belindas name in their acknowledgments belinda flushed with pleasure each time she saw her name in print but she didnt fault authors who hadnt thought to include her she didnt mind the anonymity sometimes she preferred it helping people making things right thats what life was about really whether it was fixing an authors words or providing groceries for a lonely widow or making sure megan conway was chosen class valedictorian in belindas senior yearnot that pothead jeffrey ames who had earned top class ranking with four years of cheating jeffrey had been the faculty and administration favorite until they found the marijuana belinda had placed in his locker no it was alicia who deserved pity belinda knew for a fact that martin was having an affair and not for the first time careful not to make noise belinda opened the door to the bedroom and tiptoed to the crib the baby had maneuvered herself into a corner and wriggled free of the blanket belinda had taken pains to wrap her in tightly she was fast asleep sucking on the thumb she had worked out of the covered sleeve on the pale yellow nightgown lilly belinda whispered she loved the name more every time she said it lilly made her think of whiteness of all things beautiful and pure leaving the bedroom door open and the bathroom door too belinda slathered her face with moisturizer and coaxed her damp hair into shape with her fingers she would have liked to use her hair dryer just as she would have enjoyed luxuriating earlier under the showers stinging hot spray but what if the baby woke and belinda didnt hear her she had learned to her dismay how quickly a whimper could become an earsplitting cacophony of shrieks that would turn the babys face a dangerous red and set her arms and legs flailing even if belinda took alicia up on her offer to fix her up with one of martins colleagues nothing would come of it and what could she put in a profile for one of those internet dating sites guardian angel solid dependable compassionate loves word games looking for same men werent looking for guardian angels they werent looking for solid or dependable or compassionate they wanted sirens they wanted voluptuous and vivacious and sexy like her neighbor melissa a mother in name only to little carrie the precious child she neglected and had probably never wanted melissa never took the baby out of the apartment never strolled her down the block it was as though the child didnt exist from what belinda had observed melissa was more interested in the men she invited into her bed the bed thumped against the wall melissa and belinda shared the noises made belinda cringe and had brought her close to phoning the police several times so no belinda would not be posting her profile on a dating site she knew she was dull she knew she was plain her face was flat and wide her thin brown hair was limp and without luster her chin was too square her pale brown eyes too small the lids almost lashless even with mascara which she rarely used because it irritated her eyes she had learned at an early age from her father and later from her classmates that she would never be anyones favorite she had seen disappointment on the faces of the blind dates for whom she had opened her door even plain unexciting women found husbands so she had to be lacking something else what alicia younger than belinda by two minutes had thick auburn hair that framed her heartshaped face and green eyes that sparkled when she laughed her tinkling laugh which she did often especially around men when the twins were toddlers passersby would stop in front of the double stroller and coo at the pretty one belindas mother would say both my girls are pretty she would pinch belindas cheeks youre a love is what you are you are the sweetest little girl in the whole world mommys angel and youre pretty just like your name thats what belinda means pretty the name was a jinx belinda had decided directing her bitterness at her parents and sometimes at god who had participated in the joke she couldnt remember when her parents had started calling her linnie probably to put an end to the lie but now the baby had come into her life lilly was a gift a miracle belinda would shower her with love and make certain no one ever harmed her her family would be shocked when they learned about lilly adopting a child what were you thinking linnie how do you plan to take care of that baby on your own they wouldnt understand they wouldnt have understood about megan conway either thats why belinda hadnt told them about megan or about her friend jim langdon he wouldnt have believed that his wife was cheating on him if belinda hadnt followed her several times and taken compromising photos that shed left in an envelope at jims office jim had a right to know he had left his wife and yes he was miserable but ultimately his life would be better because of belinda she hadnt decided when to let alicia find out about martin and his latest soon she thought alicia had a right to know too belinda was zipping her jeans when she heard the doorbell shutting the bedroom door behind her she walked to the front door and glanced through the privacy window at a uniformed policeman lapd the officer said were looking for information about the woman who lives next door melissa heckman did someone complain about her belinda asked maam about the noise from her apartment i dont like it either i thought about calling the police but i didnt you can tell her that actually thats not why im here can i come in belinda asked to see his id before she allowed him into her living room if youre not here about the noise she caught her breath did something happen to her to melissa her voice sounded shrill to her ears she hoped she hadnt woken the baby im sorry to have to tell you ms heckman is dead were talking to people in the neighborhood hoping someone saw or heard something belinda stared at him and sank onto the sofa cushion which whooshed under her weight oh my god oh my god when was the last time you saw her whats your name maam by the way belinda ellinson i cant believe shes dead the last time you saw her the officer prompted last night around seven i saw her drive off with a man melisssa had left the baby without a sitter again belinda had rung the bell and knocked on the door no one had answered melissa had left carrie alone several times even though belinda was right next door just for half an hour or so while she went to the market but still belinda had considered calling child services but what was the point they would warn melissa she would promise to do better and then shed go back to her selfish ways what happened belinda asked how did she were trying to figure that out the officer said we received an anonymous call from a man about an hour ago you mentioned hearing noises maam what kind of noises belinda felt color creeping up her neck and face she has lots of men friends and well you know theres a lot of screaming and other sounds night after night she had covered her ears to block the sounds and the accompanying images night after night she had tried not to think about the innocent child sleeping not ten feet from her mothers bedroom belinda had seen the baby the day melissa moved into the apartment a month ago she had brought a bundt cake and offered to babysit especially since there were no grandparents or other family to help out its just me and carrie melissa had said her daddys not keen on babies hes not thrilled about paying our bills either this man you saw her drive off with the cop said do you know his name belinda shook her head melissa and i arent close shed borrow a cup of sugar or a few eggs wed say hi when we saw each other i dont know much about her personal life belinda hesitated i did hear yelling tuesday night when she came back she and this man were fighting about what the officer said his interest quickened i couldnt hear what they were saying she sounded angry and she was crying ive heard her cry before though i asked her about it once and she said it was nothing she was fine if i had known belindas father would say that she should have known that she was to blame alicia would too of course and maybe even her mother oh linnie what have you done it wasnt her fault belinda had assumed melissa would be frantic when she came home and found the baby missing that was the point to teach her a lesson she couldnt have known that melissa would call carries father that he would drive over she couldnt have anticipated that melissa would attack him the minute he stepped into the apartment you never wanted her born melissa had screamed her anguished cry penetrating belindas wall you took her didnt you you sold her or did you kill her is that what you did you bastard did this guy abuse her the cop asked i saw her once with a black eye but she said she bumped into something and like i said she had a lot of men friends i dont know who she was with last night belinda couldnt have known that melissa would grab a knife put down the knife melissa put it down i said are you crazy that he would slap melissa that she would fight him baby killer you killed my baby why she couldnt have known he would slam melissas head against the wall shut up shut up i said slam it again and again and again until melissa was suddenly awfully quiet how could belinda have known any of that how could she have stopped it you saw her get into a car the officer said can you describe it no belinda sighed i wish id paid attention it was a black car or maybe blue or dark gray im sorry im not good with cars she hadnt wanted melissa dead she had wanted to frighten her to make her realize how reckless she was every time she left little carrie alone even for five minutes last night after melissa left belinda had let herself into the apartment with the spare key the former tenant had given her in case she ever locked herself out or if there was an emergency which most people would say this was the baby had been asleep in the pack n play belinda had scooped her up blanket and all and taken her to her own apartment did you see the license plate the cop asked even the first few letters or numbers would help i didnt think to look the officer hadnt asked about melissas baby belinda had been in a near panic at first wondering what she would do if neighbors mentioned carrie to the police but she had reminded herself that really no one ever saw the baby melissa never showed her off never took her out and there had been nothing in the times about melissa or the baby what about the man can you describe him the officer asked i only caught a glimpse im sorry she said again im not much help am i she had seen carries father more than once and could describe him accurately and his car he should pay for what he had done he had taken a life she was surprised that hed phoned the policehe was obviously the anonymous caller guilt she decided but if belinda helped the police find him he would tell them about the baby and how long before they would be back here questioning belinda and what would happen to the baby then they would put her in foster care where she would never receive the love she deserved belinda had heard horror stories about foster homes and orphanages if you remember anything about this man or about the car or anything else please call right away the officer handed belinda a card of course she would never tell anyone how terrified she had been waiting for melissas boyfriend to leave wondering if he would realize that the baby was next door her heart had pounded when she had entered the apartment and she had truly prayed that melissa was alive but she had found melissa on her bed slumped against the wall which was streaked with blood her eyes were lifeless her skin was gray belinda knew without touching her wrist that there was no pulse she had tried not to think about melissa while she transferred the babys things the pack n play bottles brushes formula diapers receiving blankets clothing ointments liquid baby aspirin she had almost forgotten to empty the hamper and the trash which was filled with soiled diapers she hadnt touched anything of melissas she had taken only what belonged to carrie to lilly a new life deserved a new name its terrible what happened belinda said meaning it just terrible and really could anyone say with certainty that if she hadnt taken the baby something horrible wouldnt have happened if not last night then another time melissa had said her boyfriend didnt like babies sooner or later he would have grown tired of supporting melissa and the baby melissas killer not her boyfriend because thats what he was belinda looked at the card and nodded she had done the right thing for the baby it was for the best never too old by linda grant sophia diamante was worried about her mother you know how she frets she told her sister cara you should never have told her about the russian its just upset her mother does not fret cara said it was the mildest retort she could think of what mother does not fret she repeated doesnt now never has when shes worried theres a good reason like the fact that a mafiya thug up for murder one has just told her oldest daughter she wont live long enough to go to trial sophias sigh was audible even over the weak cell phone connection i told you hes just blowing off steam these guys dont go after cops or prosecutors you know that cara knew that the italian mafia did not go after cops or prosecutors she did not know what the russian mafiya might do and she was pretty sure that sophia didnt either still she was sorry shed told her mother there wasnt anything that she could do and it just worried her not for the first time she vowed to play dumb from now on when her mother grilled her about her sisters life she doesnt look well sophia continued im worried about her she doesnt take good care of herself it was caras turn to sigh this was a rerun of a conversation theyd had before it was true that their mother had aged noticeably when they were young their friends had considered her the prettiest mom in their group now she looked at least ten years older than the other women just because she doesnt go to the gym or get her hair dyed doesnt mean she doesnt take care of herself cara said shes still plenty sharp i dont know shes getting forgetful remember that fancy orchid i bought her she forgot to water it and it died and she makes appointments and forgets them cara could have pointed out that their mother did not like houseplants especially ones that required special attention and the appointments she forgot were weekly luncheons with sophia cara suspected that her mother found it easier to forget than to deal with her eldest daughters inability to take no for an answer i think shes acting rather erratic sophia continued first she develops such a fascination with orchids that she has to rush off to a convention in chicago then she loses interest and forgets the one i got her and how about that distant cousin in denver she had to visit last month she cant remember whether the woman was related to aunt silvi or uncle phil cara had her own theory about her mothers trips she was fairly sure that there was a man involved their father had died when they were children and while their mother had never admitted to having a boyfriend there were always men happy to take care of household and automotive repairs of course it helped that tony diamante had been a close friend of the local mafia don and that that same don seemed to have a fondness for their mother but neither factor explained why the men seemed anxious to hang around long after the job was done or to drop by to see if anything more needed doing she understood why her mother wouldnt want to tell sophia if she had a male friend her sister would drive them both wild with her suspicious nature shed probably run a background check on the poor guy and badger the local cops into checking him out she needs some outside interests sophia said something to stimulate her mind and get her out of the house i keep telling her youre never too old to try new things shes fine cara said you worry too much about her and too little about yourself she thought whats happening with the russian by the way hes in lockup sophia said therell be a bail hearing probably monday its too late for them to get to him today will he get bail cara asked i mean hes up for murder and he threatened you they wont let him out will they sophia laughed but there was no mirth in the sound depends on the judge whether they think hes a flight risk whether they accept his apology about the threat i dont think hes a risk i doubt the judge will they might take it more seriously if you did cara said youre making it easy for them to dismiss the danger there is not much danger sophia assured her id just look like a wimp if i made a fuss there was no point in arguing cara realized sophia would rather put herself at risk than chance damaging her status as one of the boys shed worked hard to make her way in the das office and it hadnt made it any easier that her father had had close friends in the mafia if sophia was worried about her mother bianca diamante was even more worried about her daughter she was taking the russians threat entirely too lightly sophia was sure that a criminal wouldnt go after a prosecutor but that was naïve when the stakes were high enough anyone was fair game and in this case the stakes were the highest the russian one yuri reznikov was up for murder one and it was sophia whod convinced his girlfriend to testify against him the girlfriend was in protective custody what better way to convince her of the high cost of testifying than to kill the woman whod promised her the cops could keep her safe bianca wasnt about to gamble with her daughters life if anyone had earned a trip to the boneyard it was this guy and no one was better equipped to punch his ticket than bianca diamante while shed always made it firm policy never to mix personal and professional matters she was prepared to make an exception for the russian thats what tony would have done hed never have stood for a thug threatening one of his girls a hit man does not have to put up with poor behavior tony had been a real pro not a mob thug who blasted away with the biggest gun he could find hed worked freelance the money had been good and he was his own boss but theres no retirement program for hit men and when he got the cancer and knew he wouldnt be there to see his kids grow up hed provided for them the only way he knew how hed taught their mom the family business in the early days bianca had let tonys contacts believe that his brother had taken over even now only the man who acted as her agent knew her true identity he hadnt liked the idea of repping a woman but shed convinced him that she had unique assets that suited her for special jobs when she was younger shed used her looks to gain access to powerfulmen but in her late forties shed discovered an even better cover instead of trying to look younger shed aged herself as an older woman she was invisible people paid no attention to her a homeless woman talking to herself could stumble into a mobster without arousing suspicion a nicely dressed church lady could chat up guys whod never let a stranger get close youll need a niche tony had told her something you do better than anyone else so when a job comes up thats right they call you and they pay extra biancas niche was the convenient accident death by natural causes or unnatural ones that left no trace she was an expert in poisons it wasnt a subject they offered at the local jc so shed had to teach herself once she had the basic knowledge it was a matter of locating experts who possessed information not found in books it was surprisingly easy to get them to talk they were delighted to find someone who shared their passion especially when that someone was a woman adept at flattering their egos could they send her a specimen of this or that poisonous mushroom so she might see it for herself did they know where she could get a small bit of that amazingly potent toadskin toxin in recent years with the expansion of the internet just about anything was available if you knew where to look the russian posed several problems the first was timing bianca needed to set up the hit before he got out of jail then she needed to execute it before he could act on his threat the chance that the cops would keep him under surveillance made things even dicier the second problem was that she knew almost nothing about the thug a hit that didnt look like a hit required planning you needed background on the victim if you were to design a proper exit for him and research was the best protection against dangerous surprises this was not a job shed have accepted for any amount of money but then it wasnt about money she called marty the guy who handled her business dealings and asked him to find out what he could i need quick and dirty here she said an address whether he lives with anyone if he uses drugs and which ones anything you can get that might be useful marty whined when she told him she needed it in a couple of hours itll cost double he said and thats whether i get anything or not cause with so little time i might not get much not much was exactly what he gotan address and word that the guy lived alone hes midlevel marty said and a nasty piece of work i have to tell you that i thought you were being maybe a bit too worried i mean why hit a prosecutor they just bring in a new one but this reznikov has a real temper plus he dont like women and he really dont like a woman taking him down you know you dont have to do this one i could get someone to take care of it for you guys like him have enemies he gets whacked no ones gonna be too surprised bianca considered it hiring the job out was safer but it was also less sure she didnt want to risk a screwup while the cops might not look too hard for the killer if sophia decided the russian was hit to shut him up shed start digging around and bianca didnt want to think where that might lead the best way to learn about the russian was to search his house and the time to do it was now while he was safely locked away the address marty had given her was in a town about twenty minutes from her house she wasnt familiar with the neighborhood so she took a drive to check it out september had brought a break from the summers humidity but the air was still warm in the late afternoon only a few trees showed the first signs of color otherwise it was summer without the stifling heat reznikovs home was a fairly new twostory brick on a quiet street in an affluent neighborhood it was a family house but marty had said he lived alone bianca would have bet an exwife and kids lived in less spacious digs somewhere else the street was deserted several garages had basketball hoops but there were no kids banging balls off the backboards not for the first time bianca reflected that the more valuable the real estate the fewer people you saw enjoying it in neighborhoods like this the easiest way in was the cleaning lady ruse an older woman lugging cleaning supplies barely registered no one got suspicious when she went into a backyard or fumbled with a lock most people forgot theyd even seen her as she drove home bianca formed a plan if shed had more time shed have opted for an accident but you couldnt count on an accident to be fatal and she needed to nail the russian on the first try that left poison as the weapon of choice something fast acting that would incapacitate him before he could call for help a faked suicide perhaps feed him the poison let it do its work then come back and leave a bottle next to the body the police would figure he saved them the expense of a trial if his friends suspected otherwise they wouldnt be talking to the cops about it for faked suicides she had a special cocktail of a barbiturate and a drug prescribed as a sleeping medication each magnified the effect of the other and alcohol gave them an even bigger boost best of all it was colorless odorless and tasteless and she had it in both liquid and pill form it cost plenty and she had to put up with its producer alvin a brilliant chemistry student who was either bipolar schizophrenic or both conversations with alvin were always trying since he assumed they shared the same paranoid universe and got agitated if she muffed her lines but once she plugged into his fantasy he was delighted to provide whatever she asked for and to tinker for months to get it to meet her specifications the major problem with poison was targeting you had to be sure to get the victim without exposing anyone else you couldnt just lace his favorite snack with poison because he might share that snack with a bystander and one of biancas cardinal rules was that you never hit a bystander at home she donned her cleaning woman disguise shapeless housedress apron sensible shoes heavy support hose she collected a mop bucket blue plastic gloves and assorted cleaning supplies studying herself in the mirror she decided to add a wig of tight steel gray curls and thick glasses there was no way to know whether the suicide plan would work until shed had a look inside the russians house but it was worth taking the poison with her on the chance shed get lucky for that and for the wig and glasses she turned to the cabinet tony had built the cabinet when she pointed out that he couldnt have guns around with children in the house hed closed off about eighteen inches at one end of their bedroom closet and installed the cabinet there with the clothes pushed up against it the opening was all but invisible there were only two keys to the tiny lock hidden near the floor in the darkest corner bianca kept one and had given the other to one of tonys old friends who had promised to empty the cabinet if anything happened to her the guns had been replaced with biancas tools wigs glasses specially designed canes and of course poisons and the means of administering them she took a bottle of clear fluid from the cabinet and two unlabeled brown bottles secured to each other with a heavy rubber band one bottle held a common variety of sleeping pill that matched the fluid in the bottle the other a barbiturate they werent an exact match for the fluid but that wouldnt show up on any tox screen the coroner was likely to use before she left she took one final precaution she called sophia to make sure that reznikov was still in jail i know you think im a worrywart she said but i just wanted to know what was happening with that russian fellow hes in jail mom really hes in jail his bail hearing isnt scheduled until monday but that doesnt really mean youre safe i mean he could arrange for someone else to go after you ive heard that happens hes made his one phone call mom and hed have to be a real fool to arrange a hit from inside the lockup but just so you can relax the police are taking his threat seriously and theyre keeping close watch on him well then thats a good thing a very good thing mom im sorry if ive been short with you about this sophia said her voice softening i understand why youre worried and i appreciate it im sorry to put you through this bianca experienced the odd mixture of warmth and sadness she always felt when sophia let down her tough façade she was a sweet kid always had been but from the time she was in grade school shed needed to appear tough bianca had never understood why shed hoped that someday her eldest daughter would feel safe enough to let her softer side show but now that she was a prosecutor there was little chance of that sophia was not lying to her mother when she said that reznikov was in jail and that the police were paying special attention to him but she was stretching the truth when she mentioned the bail hearing on monday it had been scheduled for then but his attorney had requested that it be moved up ordinarily shed have objected and that would have been enough to keep him in the lockup but the cops had decided that it fit their interest to cut him loose they had plans for yuri reznikov and they needed him on the outside for those plans to work as she hung up the phone sophia felt a moments guilt about misleading her mother she valued her mothers trust when she was a teenager and the other girls moms had treated them like whores or criminals her mother had accepted her word but she told herself technically she hadnt lied the hearing wasnt for fortyfive minutes and it was worth shading the truth to give her mother some peace of mind bianca parked her car up the street some distance from reznikovs house there was no fence so she didnt have to worry about a dog in the yard she checked for an alarm system though shed have been surprised to find one guys like reznikov figured they were so tough that no one would dare break into their house and the last thing they wanted was to give the cops an excuse to enter without a warrant out of sight of any neighbor she pulled on thin surgical gloves the back door had a ridiculously simple dead bolt bianca had it open in less than a minute inside the house smelled slightly stale and the kitchen had the off odor of garbage going bad she set down the mop and bucket of cleaning supplies and did a quick reconnaissance the house was fairly tidy too tidy for a bachelor mob thugs didnt vacuum or mop floors hed have a cleaning service no one had cleaned since he left though there was a scattering of grounds spilled next to the coffeemaker and bits of dried food on the counters a check of the kitchen suggested that reznikov didnt do a lot of cooking there was more beer than food in the refrigerator and the freezer held frozen dinners and a bottle of vodka the living room was set up for a single guy who didnt have a lot of company a huge plasma tv with mammoth speakers on each side dominated the room a dark brown leather lounger sat squarely in front of it a small table to the side of the chair the guy probably lived in that chair bianca thought the dining room looked like it hadnt been used in ten years there was a china hutch but no china further proof of biancas theory that thered been a wife whod stopped putting up with the thug she checked out the upstairs bedroom hoping to find a stash of junk food or treats that might be doctored and the bathroom looking for prescriptions but she struck out on both counts a second bedroom held weights and expensive exercise equipment but nothing to eat or drink she was checking the medicine cabinet in the downstairs bathroom when she heard the click of a key in a lock she froze she heard a lock turn and a door open the sounds came from the front of the house reznikov was supposed to be in jail there was no sign that he shared the house with anyone no cat to be fed or plants to be watered but someone had just come in the front door it could be a friend orthe realization hit her with a shockit could be that sophia had lied to her the door slammed shut a man coughed it took only seconds for bianca to react mr reznikov she called out is that you mr reznikov there was no response she pulled on heavy blue plastic gloves over the thin surgical ones as she headed for the front door she shifted her gait to a shuffle rolled her shoulders forward to hunch her back and thrust her head out by the time she reached the entry she was inches shorter and years older the man she confronted there was at least six feet tall and heavybroad shoulders substantial gut thick black hair flecked with gray he wore dark pants and a thighlength black coat he had one hand inside the coat as if he might be reaching for a gun who the fuck are you he demanded in a low slightly raspy voice his heavy accent muffled the words but their hostility came through loud and clear im irma the cleaning lady bianca said giving her voice a nasal quality your regulars sick im filling in didnt they tell you they was supposed to call she shrugged the putupon employee they said the housed be empty a note of complaint in the last part whatre you doing home the man stared down at her not a guy hired to do any heavy thinking bianca decided slowly he withdrew his hand from his coat youre not supposed to be here till next week he said but he didnt sound suspicious just surprised bianca pursed her mouth and shook her head its that mary louise in the office that girl has spaghetti for brains and since shes started dating the delivery guy she cant keep nothing straight i can go if you want or i can finish up now i wont get in your way she paused but not long enough to let him answer you look tired mr reznikov she said now a picture of maternal concern you should rest can i get you a cup of tea or something if the russian was aware that it was odd to find a strange woman in his house offering him tea he didnt show it he lumbered into the living room and collapsed in the recliner no tea he said vodka its in the freezer vodka sure bianca said and headed for the kitchen she pulled the frosted bottle from the freezer chose the biggest glass in the cupboard and poured a hefty slug of the vodka into it then she retrieved her bottle of liquid from the bucket of cleaning supplies and added some to the vodka shed have liked to measure to make sure she had the right amount for the mans weight but she made a guess and added enough extra to guarantee the desired result reznikov took the glass without comment shed worried hed complain that shed poured too much but from the size of his first gulp that wasnt going to be a problem hed turned on the tv and was watching football she retreated to the kitchen before he could tell her to leave shed never been present to see the effect of this particular combo of drugs so she wasnt sure how long it would take but alvin had assured her that taken together theyd work in less than an hour she decided to pass the time by cleaning there was always the off chance that someone would remember seeing a cleaning lady go into the house if it hadnt been cleaned the cops would get suspicious as she washed the dirty dishes cleaned the counters and mopped the floor the commentary from the football game played in the background after about twenty minutes she walked quietly to the entry hall where she could see the table next to reznikovs chair the glass was almost empty as she turned to go back to the kitchen the sound of the tv went dead the word muted flashed on the screen she froze fearing that reznikov had heard her but he didnt get out of the chair he shifted position enough so that she could see he was holding a cell phone damn shed taken the house phone off the hook in the kitchen to make sure he couldnt call out but shed forgotten that he might have a cell phone max this is sam he said bianca tensed the fake name was a sure sign of trouble he was calling a hit man i got a job for you needs to be done soon like tomorrow there was a pause as he listened to the response biancas mind was racing she had to interrupt the call and fast whatdya mean half now half after what kind of bullshit is that there was no time for planning she had to stop him before he gave the hit man sophias name she rushed forward banged into the table and fell toward reznikov crashing into his right arm with all her weight the table tipped forward and the almost empty glass landed on the rug the cell phone popped out of reznikovs hand and flew across the room bounced off the wall and dropped to the floor the angle of biancas body when she hit reznikovs shoulder sent her sprawling into his lap he stared down at her stunned then his face twisted into a furious scowl bianca was up and out of the russians reach much more quickly than an old lady should have been able to manage oh mr reznikov she squeaked im so sorry that was so clumsy ill clean this up right away you stupid cunt he snarled get me that cell phone he started to rise from the chair bianca hurried to get the cell phone praying it would be broken her cell had died when she dropped it on a granite counter surely but the cell didnt look broken the call had been cut off but the screen displayed the time she picked up the phone stammering apologies oh mr reznikov im so sorry i broke your phone ill pay for a new one please dont tell the service theyll fire me sure reznikov was on his feet his hands balled into fists his face contorted with fury youre not who the fuck are you he bellowed bianca assessed her escape routes the chair sat in the middle of the room blocking the path to the front entry that left the way through the dining room to the kitchen and the back door but reznikov would only have to move a few steps to intercept her if the poison had slowed him down there was a chance she might make it but not a good one i said i was sorry ill pay for it honest she repeated oh i made such a mess but i can take care of that i gotta get the dustpan then ill clean that right up she began to edge her way toward the dining room moving slowly giving him no reason to grab for her he took a step toward her what the hell but his voice was less forceful and he had a strange expression on his face bianca hoped desperately that the drugs were taking effect it was all a matter of time now she took a step backward he took another step toward her if she could get him to move far enough from the chair she could make a dash for the entry putting the recliner between her and the russian reznikov weaved slightly his face was no longer knotted in a scowl the features seemed to have loosened his jaw had slackened and his mouth hung slightly open he looked more confused than angry you dont look so good mr reznikov bianca said i think maybe you should sit down she took a step toward him he raised his arm to take a swing at her but he couldnt follow through and it fell useless to his side bianca let out her breath and felt a rush of relief she waited watching him closely you you he was mumbling now it seemed to take all his effort to stand he stumbled backward and collapsed into the chair but his eyes were still fixed on her the color had drained from his face leaving it a sickly white bianca realized that this was the first time shed watched a man die for all the deaths that she had arranged shed managed to be absent for the actual passing she felt a kind of animal sympathy for the man in the chair not for reznikov the thug but for a fellow being who was dying and knew it a strange feeling there was no temptation to intervene no guilt really she had no doubt that the world would be a better place without this man it surprised her that she had any feeling for him at all as she watched the russian she remembered sophias description of attending the execution of a particularly brutal killer shed convicted shed had the same confused reaction emotions she didnt understand and couldnt explain bianca backed out of the room and stood behind the chair for long enough to satisfy herself that reznikov was not getting up then returned to cleaning the house the mess in the living room could wait it was full dark by the time she was sure yuri reznikov was no longer breathing she set the stage for his final scene by the light of the giant television it was not the first time shed done this the first time shed feared having to confront the sight of a man whose life shed ended but then as now shed felt little remorse when shed decided to go into the business shed drawn up a set of rules covering who was fair game and who wasnt tony had laughed at her marty had been incredulous and infuriated but she only took jobs that let her sleep at night the glass lay on the rug where it had landed when she knocked over the table what liquid thered been in it had soaked into the carpet bianca righted the table and picked up the glass holding it by the rim and bottom so as not to smudge reznikovs fingerprints she took it to the kitchen added a bit of fresh vodka to rinse it out then replaced it on the rug she wrapped reznikovs hands around each of the two brown bottles to provide the crime lab with decent fingerprints and dropped them near the glass so that it looked like the russian had knocked them off she stepped back and surveyed the scene it was then that she noticed the cell phone she picked it up and checked the call history to see what the russian had dialed the number was martys she stared at it shocked and shaken surely marty wouldnt have she shook her head refusing to consider it the halfnowhalflater demand was no doubt because marty knew reznikov wouldnt live long enough to pay off but under other circumstances she wouldnt have trusted his loyalty one thing was sure she didnt want the police having martys phone number put him in a cell and he wouldnt hesitate to give her up for a lighter sentence she aimed the phone at the brick fireplace and threw it as hard as she could it broke apart and fell to the floor bianca wished she knew enough about cell phone technology to be sure that the memory was erased but decided that any further damage to the phone risked raising questions with the cops it occurred to her as she was packing up to leave that the police might be keeping tabs on mr reznikov the house behind the russians was dark so instead of leaving the way shed come she walked through the backyard and down the neighbors driveway sophia came by the next morning bianca had never been able to break the girls of the habit of dropping in shed hinted that such unannounced visits could prove embarrassing for all concerned but to no avail were all grownups cara had said with a knowing smile it would be nice bianca thought if getting caught with a lover was the worst that could happen sophia had stopped at the bakery to pick up biancas favorite pastries and she brought flowers a sure sign that she was feeling the need to make up for some misdeed as they sat over steaming mugs of coffee in the sunny kitchen sophia said i wanted you to know that you dont have to worry about the russian he killed himself last night really bianca said then remembering that she was not supposed to know of reznikovs release she added in jail actually he was at home sophia said looking a bit abashed after i talked with you the judge set bail and we had to let him out oh bianca said well good riddance itll save the taxpayers the cost of a trial sophia laughed thats what my boss said i imagine its a relief to you all bianca said sophia hesitated just long enough to tell her mother that she was holding back theres something you arent telling me isnt there dear sophia gave her tight little caughtout laugh boy i could never keep anything from you okay its over now so i guess theres no harm in telling this was a sting and the russian was the bait losing him cost us the target bianca was getting a bad feeling about this the bait i dont understand dear i wasnt really honest with you about reznikovs threat i knew he was serious and so did the police we let him out so he could order a hit with traces on his phones wed have a straight line back to the hit man or maybe if we got really lucky to an even bigger fish a guy who arranges hits as soon as he made the call we sophia stopped midsentence mom is something wrong youre really pale bianca was having trouble catching her breath a chill had spread through her body at the memory of martys number on reznikovs phone i dont like the idea of them using you for bait she said working to keep her voice steady something awful could have happened i was perfectly safe i was with the cops the whole time wed have been in his living room as soon as he hung up and a second unit would have been on its way to the hit mans place i was never in danger not in danger of dying bianca thought but definitelyin danger of watching your mother led off in handcuffs in all her years as a professional this was the first time shed come even close to getting caught what happened she asked it was really weird he put in a call said he had a job and it looked like they were about to negotiate price when he hung up we waited for him to call back but he never did but if you had a trace you must have gotten the number of the person he called bianca said knowing her daughter would ascribe her knowledge of such things to her fondness for reading and watching police procedurals sophia shook her head the call was too short to trace she said and it appears he threw the phone across the room and broke it the cops think maybe he got cut off and smashed the phone in anger bianca laughed more from relief than amusement ive felt like doing that after a dropped call she said sophia nodded and was silent for a few moments then she said it doesnt fit i mean why would he start to order the hit then change his mind and commit suicide i tried to get them to go in when the connection was cut i knew there was something funny going on good lord my own daughter would have brought them down on me bianca thought what do the police think she asked theyre not thinking sophia said her tone sharp with aggravation with the cell phone smashed we have no leads on the hit man theres no evidence to suggest murder and they want to close the case if its suicide theyre done its too bad you lost the hit man but at least youre safe now she studied sophias face for signs of her intentions are you going to pursue it to investigate this mans death sophia shook her head no the case is closed its over i just wish i knew what happened in that house last night no you dont bianca thought you really dont murder for lunch by carolyn hart madeleine kruger held up the menu to hide her face it would be embarrassing if mike saw her although surely his lunch with that gorgeous young woman was perfectly aboveboard and meg knew all about it madeleine had a quick vision of megs tightdrawn slick face surgery makes a difference no sags no bumps no lines but plastic skin is as great a tipoff to age as wrinkles not that meg was all that old she was in her early thirties but thats old in hollywood madeleine wriggled uncomfortably was she being unkind madeleine hated to be unkind if she had a husband as young and appealing as mike perhaps shed try to wipe away wrinkles too willy had been dead for years but she knew he would love her just the way she was with untidy gray hair and nearsighted blue eyes and a shapeless bosom and plump hips madeleine heard a thump in the next booth mike and his friend were right behind her shed stay quiet as a mouse until they left she wouldnt breathe a word about seeing them to meg just in case it seemed odd that mike brought a guest to the cosy café it was a modest little place away from main street not the sort of restaurant young people preferred the waitress brought madeleines tomato soup so cheerful and warming on a rainy february day even southern california had its off season but this was nothing like the cold in kansas sometimes madeleine missed the crunch of snow underfoot and the frosty wreath of her breath have to kill her otherwise were stuck mikes clear baritone was brusque madeleines plump hand wavered soup splashed onto the formica tabletop she hunched forward struggling to hear over the roaring in her ears her blood pressure the girl answered but her voice was soft and low madeleine could make out only a few words when a wife dies madeleine watched all the detective shows a husband was always the prime suspect when a wife died mike sounded irritated have to kill her murders the only solution it ruins everything if madeleine put down her spoon she used her napkin to swipe at the spilled soup then grabbed the check she struggled out of the booth and hurried to the cash register oh dear oh dear she hadnt left a tip at the register she put down a bill twice the total and said breathlessly so sorry must leave please see that the waitress gets the tip she walked as fast as she could to the exit and didnt stop until she was a block away her legs aching and wobbly she couldnt escape the sound of mikes voice have to kill her murders the only solution madeleine shuffled the deck of cards with practiced ease she arched the cards in a high curve caught them expertly shed played cards since she was a little girl and was adept at everything from bridge to texas holdem faster than a croupier sorting chips she slapped cards facedown one after another solitaire helped her think dandelions orange paw flicked out and the first card slewed toward the edge of the table madeleine caught it in time bad girl but her tone was loving the orange cat hunched her shoulders waiting for another card to be played when the cards were down madeleine began to play occasionally righting a card from dandelions attack but her thoughts darted like minnows she should call the police would they listen mike would deny everything maybe she could warn meg shed never really talked much with meg it was mike who was friendly he seemed like such a nice young man and to think he and meg had moved to castle point because of her the block of flimsily built condos had been thrown up in the sixties each condo had three floors that had later been made into separate apartments an exterior stair served each unit apartments were scarce in the hollywood area shed told her best friend mia that the apartment beneath her was empty and the ad hadnt yet run mias nephew mike was looking for a place mike and meg moved in the next week both had jobs on the fringes of the business but they wanted to write movies didnt everyone in hollywood have a script to sell everyone but her she was a reader and hardly ever gave a thought to the fact that she lived in hollywood though occasionally she went to a show with mia madeleine felt a pang of sorrow for mia she and mia loved to play bridge they made good partners mia bold and aggressive madeleine with an uncanny card sense their regular foursome ended with betty baileys heart attack and her husbands move back to texas after the funeral now mia and madeleine played bridge with mike and meg every wednesday in madeleines apartment mike and meg were pretty good players madeleine suspected that the young couple agreed to play to keep on his aunts good side mia had no family other than her sisters son mia wasnt rich but her house once a modest bungalow had appreciated in worth to almost a million and someday would come to mike madeleine didnt find the evenings with mike and meg as cheerful as the old days with the baileys she had to put dandelion in the bedroom because meg didnt like cats mia said meg hated cats and she was sure it was because she was deathly afraid of them youd think anyone would know a pet cat wouldnt hurt them but some people that was as near as mia ever came to criticizing meg though madeleine was sure that mia and meg didnt like each other and were pleasant only because of mike oh how awful that mike would plan to murder dandelion reached out snagged a card madeleine caught it before it fell she drew her breath in sharply the ace of spades here she was thinking about murder and she held the ace of spades in her hand she had to do something because she knew well enough what shed heard and what it meant but the police would think she was a silly old lady it wouldnt do any good to call crime stoppers she had no proof madeleine gripped the ace so tight it bowed under pressure and the edges hurt her fingers if only there were some way to frighten mike she stared at the card tomorrow was wednesday theyd be coming here to play bridge slowly a plan took shape madeleine clutched the phone with a hand that shook she hated to lie and especially to imperious mia a former latin teacher with a cleareyed view of human frailty madeleine tried to keep her voice casual though she was afraid she sounded utterly false running late could you be here at seven thirty instead of seven thats fine with mike and meg ill have everything under control by then oh dear that wasnt what shed meant to say at all it sounded absurd there was the tiniest pause before mia responded seven thirty it is is there anything i can do to help oh no no its a family thing thank you mia ill see you then she hung up quickly madeleine added another swath of blush to her cheeks twin patches of red glowed like beacons she smoothed and smudged and ended up looking as if she had a rash that was all right young people never looked at old people and anyway the red smears would hide a flush if her blood pressure soared she must remember to focus on the cards and not think about mike and meg not for an instant at ten to seven she made sure dandelion was in the bedroom the door closed she patted the pocket of her loose blue smock scanned the card table checked the serving tray everything was ready the bell pealed promptly at seven madeleine pulled a fluffy white handkerchief from her pocket and clutched it in her left hand as she pattered to the front door she opened it her welcome effusive come in come in i have our drinks ready a light beer for mike and scotch and soda for meg she offered them easy chairs on one side of the coffee table brought the drinks mike looked around mia usually beats us here he had a long scholarly face with bright blue eyes and an easy grin his lanky frame made the chair look small megs expression was remote although some of its blankness might have been caused by stretched skin that emphasized a heartshaped face she took the drink with a murmured thanks madeleine patted her face with the hanky dropped onto the sofa mias running a few minutes late the traffic but shell be here before we know it madeleinetucked the handkerchief into the wristband of her smock and picked up a deck of cards we can have fun while we wait i love to read the cards she looked coy i used to pick up some extra money telling fortunes but i dont do that anymore ill do yours for free she lifted the deck shuffled shuffled again shuffled a third time have to start fresh to find out the truth suddenly her nose wrinkled she sniffled and reached for the handkerchief she sneezed into it murmuring oh that dandelion sometimes she makes me sneeze megs head jerked around in search of the cat as madeleine fluttered the hanky and thrust it in her pocket the shuffled deck disappeared replaced by a deck that looked the same but this deck had been very carefully arranged madeleine glanced at the clock we have time to do the magic square well do mike first she placed one cardthe ten of spadesin the center of the coffee table and snapped facedown three cards in a top row three in a center row three in a bottom row mike grinned and casually draped one leg over the side of the chair how about this we come for a game of bridge and instead were going to find out what the future holds his tone was genial but his glance at meg was amused meg smoothed back a lock of dark hair and bent forward in curiosity madeleine frowned at the card she turned faceup spoke in a low hoarse voice there may be trouble ahead some barrier something will go wrong she took a deep breath hesitantly began to turn over the cards her voice deeper and deeper disaster is ahead the cards are dark dark spades and clubs a relationship may be ended mikes smile slipped away he frowned megs eyes narrowed her hands closed into claws madeleine gave a moan theres a warning of danger and deceit the nine of diamonds is light but it is the symbol for a coffin i see a letter i cant quite make it out oh yes its an m m as in money no its a name some name begins with m death will touch an m the jack of spades means someone here no surely not heres a figure of authority a judge the police the death is supposed to be an accident but it isnt the police will find out oh heres the four of clubs it isnt too late for everything to change oh a gasp the ace of spades abruptly she swept the cards together she was breathing hard her face shiny with sweat ill get us a snack i dont know what to think her words trailed off as she struggled up from the sofa and hurried to the kitchen she stopped out of sight but she could hear mikes voice was uncertain do you think shes all right she looked sick meg spoke lightly more silly than sick superstitions absurd oh lord how long do you suppose well have to stay tonight the doorbell sounded madeleine bustled to answer welcoming mia within minutes the bridge began it might have been any wednesday evening madeleine wished her head didnt hurt she didnt win a single hand mike looked over his shoulder punched in cindys phone number he was a third assistant to the executive assistant in a startup development company his boss snarled like a junkyard dog if you made personal calls on company time mike was relieved when cindy picked it up on the first ring he had to convince her cindy the soft voice interrupted i rewrote the scene last night youre right mike we have to get rid of kellys wife to increase the pressure on him now hes backed into a corner the tight muscles in the back of mikes neck eased cindy was a swell writing partner theyd met in his script class at ucla and been going like gangbusters ever since he wished he didnt have to sneak around to meet her but meg would flip if she found out cindy didnt like things not being aboveboard but she understood when he explained that meg wanted to cowrite everything hed tried for a while but hed soon realized that meg didnt have the magic he thought he did especially with cindy a tiny thought darted in the back of his mind meg always acted like she knew so much about the business hed been excited when she assured him he was going to make it big someday thats why hed married her even though she could be fun and exciting sometimes he wondered if hed done the right thing but hed made his choice hed thought she had more contacts than she really had still she knew some people maybe when this script was finished if she didnt get mad shed help him sell it could he ever tell her about cindy well hed worry about that later great listen were almost there in the last scene meg was good at computers shed easily broken into mikes the new script was almost finished god it was good it should have been hers too shed teach him to doublecross her that was the only reason shed married him a longhaired kid with about as much attraction for her as a missionary but he could write that was for sure this script could hit it big really big she knew an alist producer whod kill for a script like this just like she would she clicked off mikes computer rose and paced to the kitchen she poured a drink leaned against the counter shed had it all planned as soon as the script was done theyd go sailing a crack with the tiller and off hed go the script would be hers and her fortune would be made how did the old bitch upstairs know how could she possibly know meg had a dim memory of her ancient aunt ida hunched over a table reading cards and saying a death was comingand the next day megs mother was hit by a car as she crossed la brea meg felt cold as ice how could cards know anything but madeleine knew those cards and that shaky voice now if mike died in an accident madeleine would run to the police meg looked up toward the floor above madeleine saw the letter m and somebody dead meg said it aloud m m for madeleine meg waited until the front door slammed mike hustling out for his morning run what a boy scout meg slipped out of bed and glanced in the mirror the red silk shorty nightgown emphasized her long slender legs she was proud of her legs she pulled on a tshirt and jeans over the nightgown it would take only a minute to return to the apartment strip them off shed tell the police she heard a scream shed be distraught she smiled in anticipation the old bitch always went down and got her paper first thing in the morning out of those boring sterile nights of bridge madeleine had droned on and on about her breakfast that hideous cat the wonderful paperboy always coming early the cost of milk and on and on and on more meg thought sourly than shed ever wanted to know but now it was paying off meg hurried to the cupboard above the broom closet she pulled on plastic gloves and picked up a small paper sack outside the door she slipped in the shadows to the stairway nice steep steps with a metaledged tread birds twittered as the first hint of dawn added a rosy glow to the horizon she started up the steps moving fast in the thirdfloor apartment madeleine hummed as she poured a cup of green tea and spread cream cheese on a bagel certainly mike looked uneasy last night perhaps shed send an anonymous letter too that should be enough to keep meg safe the sound of shredding cloth brought her to her feet oh dear dandelion was a love but she was ruining the sofa why didnt she meow madeleine rushed to the front door aware shed forgotten to let dandelion out this was her safe time to roam before the street was busy with traffic madeleine opened the door cautioned you be careful now stay out of the street the cat slipped out into the grayness of dawn the door shut behind her meg froze on the steps the hammer tight in one hand a slender strip of wire in the other the head of a nail protruded five inches from the wall to her left dandelion amber eyes glowing trotted toward the steps megs heart thudded she flung the hammer toward the cat dandelion slipped sideways her tail puffed she hissed launched herself forward claws extended meg recoiled she flailed away twisting turning trying to evade the cat the sharpedged steps forgotten her balance gone she arched backward scream rising she plummeted down her head smacking against the risers she crashed onto the landing to lie in a bloodied crumpled heap when the police arrived they found the strip of wire still clutched in a plasticgloved hand the hammer on the upper landing and the protruding nail that night detective lieutenant miguel mendoza shook his head as he told his wife about his day so go figure why this dame wanted to kill the old lady who lived upstairs maybe she played her music too loud guess well never know the whole world is watching by libby fischer hellmann the whole world is watching bernie pollak snorted and slammed his locker door you wanna know what theyre watching theyre watching these longhair commie pinkos tear our country apart thats what theyre

bought a flagpole for his front lawn and raised old glory every morning captain greer stood behind the lectern scanning the front page of the chicago daily news tall with a fringe of gray hair around his head greer was usually a man of few words and fewer expressions he reminded kevin of his late father whod been a cop too now greer made a show of folding the paper and looked up okay men you all know what happened last night right a few of the twentyodd officers shook their heads it was monday august where you been on mars well about five thousand of themagitatorsshowed up in lincoln park yesterday afternoon festival of life they called it kevin noted the slight curl of greers lip when we wouldnt allow em to bring in a flatbed truck it got ugly by curfew half of em were still in the park so we moved in again they swarmed into old town we went after them and arrested a bunch but there were injuries all around civilians too who was arrested an officer asked greer frowned dont know

thats him hes the leader of sds kevin whispered to bernie lets get one thing straight greers eyes locked on kevin as if hed heard his telltale whisper no matter what they call themselvesstudents for a democratic society yippies mobethey are the enemy they want to paralyze our city hizzoner made it clear that isnt going to happen kevin kept his mouth shut all days off and furloughs have been suspended greer went on youll be working overtime too maybe a double shift he picked up a sheet of paper im gonna read your assignments some of you will be deployed to grant park some to lincoln park and some of you to the amphitheater and the convention bernie and kevin pulled the evening shift at the amphitheater and were shown their gas masks helmets riot sticks and tear gas canisters kevin hadnt done riot control since the academy but bernie had worked the riots after martin luther kings death im gonna get some shuteye bernie said shuffling out of the room after inspecting his gear i have a feeling this is gonna be a long night mom wanted to talk to me i guess ill head home bernie harrumphed just remember kid theres more to life than the sears catalogue kevin smiled weakly bernied been saying that for years and kevin still didnt know what it meant but bernie was the patrolman who broke in the rookies and the rumor was hed make sergeant soon no need to tick him off kev bernie laid a hand on his shoulder youre still a young kid and i know you gotwhat mixed feelings about this thing but these these agitatorstheyre all liars wilkerson was there last night he yanked a thumb toward another officer he says they got this fake blood you know they holler over loudspeakers rile up the crowd then pour the stuff all over themselves and tell everyone they were hit on the head now theyre threatening to pour lsd into the water supply he faced kevin straight on theyre bad news kev kevin hoisted his gear over his shoulder i thought they were here just to demonstrate against the war these people want to destroy what we have what do you think all that flag burning is about bernie shook his head our boys are over there saving a country and all these brats do is whine and complain and get high they dont know what war is not like us kevin drove down to thirtyfirst and halstead part of a lacecurtain irish neighborhood with a tavern on one corner and a church on the other when he was little kevin thought the churchs bell tower was a castle and he fought imaginary battles on the sidewalk in front with his friends one day the priest came out and explained how it was gods tower and should never be confused with a place of war kevin still felt a twinge when he passed by his parents home a twostory frame house with a covered porch was showing its age he opened the door inside the air was heavy with a mouthwatering aroma that you sweetheart a womans voice called is that pot roast its not ready yet he went down the hall wondering if his mother would ever get rid of the faded wallpaper with little blue flowers he walked into the kitchen between the sultry air outside and the heat from the oven he felt like he was entering the mouth of hell its frigging hot in here the acs on she turned from the stove and pointed to a window unit that was coughing and straining and failing to cool kevin loosened his collar his mother was tall almost six feet her thick auburn hair still long and free of gray was swept back into a ponytail her eyesas blue as an irish summer sky his father used to say in one of his rare good moods looked him over are you all right great he gave her a kiss why wouldnt i be ive been listening to the radio its crazy whats happening downtown dont you worry ma he flashed her a cheerful smile we got it under control her face was grave i love you son but dont try to con me i was a cops wife she waved him into a chair im worried about maggie she said softly kevin straddled the chair backward whats going on she hasnt come out of her room for three days just keeps listening to all that whiny music and the smellhavent you noticed that heavy sweet scent seeping under her door kevin shook his head his mother exhaled noisily i think shes using marijuana kevin nodded okay dont worry ma ill talk to her as he climbed the stairs strains of surrealistic pillow by the airplane drifted into the hall he knocked on his sisters door which was firmly shut its me mags kev hey come on in he opened the door the window air conditioner rumbled providing a noisy underbeat to the music but it was still august hot inside the room kevin wiped a hand across his brow her shades were drawn and the only light streamed out from a tiny desk lamp long shadows played across posters taped on the wall the beatles in sgt pepper uniforms jim morrison and the doors and a yellow and black sunflower with war is not healthy for children and other living things maggie sprawled on her bed reading the chicago seed what was she doing with that underground garbage the dicks read it down at the station said they got good intelligence from it but his sister he wanted to snatch it away whats happening he asked managing to control himself maggie looked up she had the same blue eyes and features as her mother but her hair was brown not auburn and it reached halfway down her back today it was held back by a red paisley bandana she was wearing jeans and a puffy white peasant blouse she held up the newspaper you want to know read this she slid off her bed and struck a match over a skinny black stick on the windowsill a wisp of smoke twirled up from the stick within a few seconds a sickly sweet odor floated through the air the music ended the arm of the record player clicked swung back and a new lp dropped on the turntable as maggie flounced back on the bed another smell more potent than the incense swam toward him kevin covered his nose what is that awful smell patchouli oil pawho oil pachulee its a hindu thing supposed to balance the emotions and calm you when youre upset kevin took the opening moms worried about you she ought to be worried the country is falling apart bernie had said the same thing he recalled but for different reasons how do you mean idiots are running things and anytime someone makes sense they get assassinated does that mean you should just stay in your room and listen to music youd rather see me in the streets is that where you want to be maybe then you remember my friend jimmy the guy you were dating she nodded he was going to work for bobby who bobby kennedy they asked him to be the youth coordinator for bobbys campaign he was going to drop out of college for a semester i was too it would have been amazing but now she shrugged hey kevin tried to think of a way to reach her dont give up what would dad say hed understand he might have been a cop but he hated what was happening especially to michael kevin winced two years ago their older brother michael had been drafted twentyfifth infantry third brigade pleiku a year ago they got word he was mia their father died three months after that ostensibly from a stroke his mother still wasnt the same dad would have told you that michael died doing his job he said slowly launching an unprovoked unlawful invasion into a quiet little country was michaels job that sounds like something you read in thatin that kevin pointed a finger at the seed maggies face lit with anger kevin what rock have you been hiding under first martin luther king then bobby and now were trying to annihilate an entire culture because of some outdated concept of geopolitical power this country is screwed up kevin felt himself get hot damn it mags its not that complicated were over there trying to save the country not destroy it its only thesethese agitators who are trying to convince you its wrong these agitators as you call them are the sanest people around throwing rocks nominating pigs for president thats just to get attention it got yours maggie glared did you know father connor came out against the war kevin was taken aback she nodded he said its become the single greatest threat to our country and that any american who acquiesces to it actively or passively ought to be ashamed before god kevin ran his tongue around his lips hes just a priest he said finally she spread her hands maybe you should have gone into the army instead of the police what good is a deferment if you dont understand why you got it im the oldest son the primary support of the family well then start supporting us he stared at his sister dad would be ashamed of you maggie how do you know mother came out against the war what are you talking about you should have seen her talking to father connor after church last week why dont you ask her how she feels i dont need to i already know maggie shook her head youre wrong its different now kevin youre gonna have to choose he averted his eyes and gazed at an old photo on the windowsill himself mike and maggie he remembered when it was taken he and mike were eleven and twelve maggie seven mike had been wearing mismatched argyle socks he was scared his father would notice and he begged kevin not to tell kevin never did it was their secret forever monday night mayor daley formally opened the democratic national convention marchers set up a picket line near the amphitheater and thirty demonstrators were arrested but there was no violence and it was a relatively quiet shift kevin didnt touch his riot gear it was a different story at lincoln park he learned the next morning as he and bernie huddled with other cops in the precincts parking lot they beat the crap out of us wilkerson said see this he pointed to a shiner around his left eye but dont worry he nodded at the sympathetic noises from the men i gave it back he went on to describe how hundreds of protestors had barricaded themselves inside the park after the eleven oclock curfew patrol cars were pelted by rocks demonstrators tried to set cars on fire when that didnt work they lobbed baseballs embedded with nails the police moved in with tear gas the crowd spilled into old town and there were hundreds of injuries and arrests wilkerson said the mayor was calling in the guard what did i tell you bernie punched kevins shoulder no respect for anything when kevin didnt answer bernie spat on the asphalt well im ready for some breakfast they drove to a place in the loop that served breakfast all day and headed to an empty booth still wearing their uniforms two men at a nearby table traded glances kevin slouched in his seat one of the men cleared his throat look he folded the newspaper and showed it to his companion even from a distance kevin could see photos of police bashing in heads listen to this the man recited in a voice loud enough to carry over to them the savage beatings of protestors were unprecedented and widespread police attacked without reason even targeting reporters and photographers for example one reporter saw a young man shouting at a policeman hey i work for the associated press the police officer responded is that right creep and proceeded to crack the reporters skull with his nightstick bernie drummed his fingers on the table and pretended not to hear when their food came kevin pushed his eggs around the plate my parish priest came out against the war he said bernie chewed his bacon im sure the father is a sincere man but has he ever seen any action not in nam what about lincoln park has he ever dealt with thesethese demonstrators bernie lowered his voice when he spoke the word as if it was profane kevin shrugged well then bernie dipped his head as if hed made a significant point ill call your shiner and raise you an mia how could you compare vietnam to lincoln park maybe they have a point kevin said wearily what point comes out of violence couldnt they say the same about us were soldiers son bernie scowled we have a job to do you can bet if i was on the front line he threw a glance at the two men at the next table then looked back at kevin hey are you sure youre up for this what do you mean you seem well i dunno he gazed at him i got this feeling kevin tightened his lips im fine bernie really the cemetery hugged the rear of the parish church it was a small place with only one or two mausoleums unlike the doughertys most bridgeport dignitaries chose rosehill the huge cemetery on the north side as their final resting place kevin avoided going inside the church he didnt want to run into father connor despite the blanket of heat birds twittered and a slight breeze stirred an elm that somehow escaped dutch elm disease he strolled among the headstones until he reached the third row second from the left the epitaph read here lies a good man father and guardian of the law life with owen dougherty hadnt been easy he was strict and he rarely smiled especially after he gave up drinking but hed been a fair man kevin remembered when he and his buddy frank smashed their neighbors window with a fly ball frank got a beating from his father but kevin didnt his father forked over the money for the window then made kevin deliver groceries for six months to pay him back he sat beside his fathers grave clasped his hands together and bowed his head what would you do dad kevin asked this war may be wrong it took michael but im a cop i have a job to do what should i do the birds seemed to stop chirping even the traffic along archer avenue grew muted as kevin waited for an answer tuesday night kevin and bernie were assigned to the amphitheater again the convention site was quiet but the rest of the city wasnt on wednesday morning kevin heard how a group of clergymen showed up at lincoln park to pray with the protestors despite that there was violence and tear gas and club swinging and police cleared the park twice afterward the demonstrators headed south to the loop and grant park at three am the national guard came in to relieve the police greer transferred bernie and kevin to michigan avenue for the noontomidnight tension had been mounting since the democrats defeated their own peace plank when the protestors in grant park heard the news the american flag near the band shell was lowered to halfmast which triggered a push by police when someone raised a red shirt on the flagpole the police moved in again a group of youth marshals lined up to try and hold back the two sides but the police broke through attacking with clubs mace and tear gas as darkness fell demonstration leaders put out an order to gather at the downtown hilton protestors poured out of grant park onto lake shore drive trying to cross one of the bridges back to michigan the balbo and congress bridges were sealed off by guardsmen with machine guns and grenades but the jackson street bridge was passable the crowd surged across the heat had lost its edge and it was a beautiful summer night the kind of night that begged for a ride in a convertible when they were teenagers kevins brother had yearned for their neighbors yellow tbird hed made kevin walk past their neighbors driveway ten times a day with him to ogle it he never recovered when it was sold to someone from wisconsin hey dougherty look alive kevin jerked his head up bernies scowl was so fierce his bushy eyebrows had merged into a straight line about thirty cops including kevin and bernie were forming a barricade behind the police line were guardsmen with bayonets on their rifles a wave of kids broke toward them when the kids reached the cops they kept pushing the cops pushed back kevin heard pops as canisters of tear gas were released the kids covered their noses and mouths dont let them through bernie yelled kevin could barely hear him above the din he twisted around bernies riot stick was poised high above his head he watched as bernie swung heard the thwack as it connected with a solid mass a young boy in front of them dropped bernie raised his club again another thwack the boy fell over sideways shielding his head with his arms the police line wobbled and broke into knots of cops and kids each side trying to advance kevin caught a whiff of cordite had some guardsman fired a rifle the peppery smell of tear gas thickened the air his throat was parched and he could barely catch his breath he threw on his gas mask but it felt like a brick he tore it off and let it dangle by the strap around his neck around him were screams grunts curses an ambulance wailed as it raced down congress its flashing lights punctuated the dark with theatrical strobelike bursts somehow kevin and bernie became separated and a young girl suddenly appeared in front of kevin she was wearing a white fluffy blouse and jeans and her hair was tied back with a bandana she looked like maggie young people streamed past but she lingered as if she had all the time in the world she stared at him challenging him with her eyes then she slowly held up two fingers in a v sign kevin swallowed a copper he didnt know jabbed her with his club you get back go back home to your parents she stumbled forward and lost her balance kevin caught her and helped her up she wiped her hands on her jeans her eyes darting from the other cop to kevin she didnt seem to be hurt she disappeared back into the crowd kevin was relieved a few yards away a group of cops and kids were shoving and shouting at each other rocks flew through the air traitors an angry voice that sounded like bernie rose above the melee his outburst was followed by more pops as the tear gas canisters burst a chorus of screams rose the protestors tried to scatter but they were surrounded by cops and guardsmen and there was nowhere to go the cops closed in and began making arrests coughing from the gas kevin moved in he was only a few feet away when the girl with the long hair and peasant blouse appeared again this time she was accompanied by a slender boy with glasses he was wearing a black tshirt and jeans the girls bandana was wet and was tied around her nose and mouth she was carrying a poster of a yellow sunflower with the words war is not healthy for children and other living things the boy looked kevin over he and the girl exchanged nods what are you doing copper man his eyes looked glassy kevin kept his mouth shut you dont want this blood on your hands she told me how you helped her up come with us you can you know the boy held out his hand as if he expected kevin to take it wisps of tear gas hovered over the sidewalk kevin tightened his grip on his club he stared at the kids the girl looked more and more like maggie suddenly bernies voice came at them from behind kevin no dont even look at em kevin looked away dont listen to him man the boys voice rose above bernies youre not one of the pigs you dont agree with this war i can tell come with us kevin looked down get back you little creep bernie moved to kevins side and hoisted his club the boy stood his ground you know you dont belong withhe waved a handhim a commander in a white shirt at the edge of the barricade yelled through a megaphone clear the streets do you hear me men clear the streets now someone else shouted all right grab your gear lets go a line of police pressed forward but the boy and girl remained where they were everything fell away except the sound of the boys voice in an odd way it felt as silent as the cemetery behind the church times running out man the boy said his hand half covering his mouth how can you defend the law when you know its wrong bernies voice slammed into them like a hard fist kev dont let him talk to you like that kevin spun around bernies face was purple with rage brandishing his riot stick he swung it down at the boys head the boy jumped but the club dealt a glancing blow to his temple the boy collapsed bernie no kevin seized bernies arm bernie snatched his arm away do your job dougherty he pointed to the kids with his club they are the enemy the girl turned to kevin with a desperate cry make him stop kevin strained to see her face in the semidark go now get lost no help me get him up she knelt beside the boy what are you waiting for dougherty bernies voice shot out raw and brutal he clubbed the boy again the boy lay curled on his side on the ground moaning blood gushed from his head his glasses were smashed do something the girl screamed at kevin please her anguish seemed to throw bernie into a frenzy his eyes were slits of fury he raised his stick over his head kevin froze everything slowed down images of maggie floated through his mind she could be in the crowd maybe father connor even his mother he thought about mike and his father what bernie was doing what his duty was his duty was to serve and protect the moment of clarity came so sharply it hurt his chest tightened and his hands clenched into fists for the first timemaybe in his entire twentythree yearshe knew what that duty meant dougherty bernie kept at him his voice raspy either you do it or i will kevin stared at his partner then he dropped his club and threw himself over the girl she groaned as his weight knocked the wind out of her her body folded up beneath him but it didnt matter she was safe kevin twisted around and caught a glimpse of bernie his riot stick was still raised high above his head kevin wondered what his partner would do now he hoped the whole world was watching i killed by nancy pickard when the second man sat down the green metal park bench groaned and sank into the dirt he took the left side leaving a polite foot and a half between his arthritic spreading hips and the wide hips of the man leaning on the armrest on the other side of the bench they glanced at each other nodded heavily like two old bulls acknowledging one anothers right to be there then they turned their beefy faces back to the view each man inhaled deeply as if his wornout senses could still detect the burntgrass bakeddirt scent of autumn they both wore baggy gym suits that looked as if nobody had ever run in them behind them stretched an expanse of golden grass and then the elegance of fiftyfifth street on the opposite side of fiftyfifth the big windows of large wellmaintained houses looked out over the same beautiful vista the two men faced in front of them there was a cement path then trees then the goldengreen rolling acreage of jacob l loose park if theyd hoisted their aching bodies up and limped to the right theyd have come to a pond where swans paddled in badtempered glory all summer but which canada geese owned now that it was late november if theyd hobbled left instead theyd have come to tennis courts wading pool rose garden playground mansions and highrise highpriced condos ringed the big park in the middle of kansas city missouri to the north was a private school then the country club plaza shopping center to the south were the neighborhoods of brookside waldo and a short drive to the suburbs it was a tranquil wealthy civilized scene in the heart of the city the man on the right side of the bench said in a voice made gravelly from time and the cigars he no longer smoked you come here often after a long moment as if he hadnt much liked being spoken to and was considering ignoring it the second man said no his voice sounded as if he too had been a heavy smoker in his day i do the first man coughed deep racking phlegmy i come here every day when he was finished hacking he said without apologizing for the spasm this bench every afternoon regular as clockwork that right his bench companion looked away sounding bored yes it is you know the history of this park history now the second man looked where the first man was pointing him with a finger that looked like a fat manicured sausage he saw a black cannon a pyramid of cannonballs and what looked like a semicircle of signs for tourists no i dont know it and dont care to his tone implied this was the scene of the last big missouri battle in the civil war october twentythird the feds had chased the rebs all across the state from saint louis but the rebs kept getting away finally they took a stand here right here in this spot picture it it was cold not like today they were tired hungry there was a confederate general right here where that big old tree is its still called the generals tree his graycoats were standing here cannons facing across the green then the bluecoats suddenly came charging up over that rise horses on the run sabers glinting guns blazing he paused but there was no response thirty thousand men in the battle that day again he paused and again there was no response there was a mass grave dug afterwards only a few blocks west of here finally the second man said that right a corner of the historians mouth quirked up mass graves always get peoples attention saddam would still be alive without em you just cant kill too many people without somebody noticing who won feds of course battle of westport abruptly he changed the subject so whatd you do what did i do the question rumbled out like thunder from a kettledrum yeah before you got here to this park bench im assuming youre retired you look around my age youll pardon my saying so but we both got that look of being twenty years older than maybe we are and not to mention youre sitting here in the middle of a weekday afternoon like me almost almost what my age or retired both probably i figured you always think so long before you speak there was a moments silence which seemed to confirm it and then sometimes well retire quick is my advice i was a salesman the other man finally looked over at him but skeptically a slight breeze picked up a few strands of his thin hair dyed black and waved it around like insect antennae before releasing it to fall back onto his pale skull again you werent he said flatly yeah i was i dont look it i know you expect somebody smooth looking somebody in a nice suit not some fat goombah in a baby blue nylon gym suit baby blue my daughter picked it out appearances are deceiving i dont go to any gym either but ask anybody who knows me theyll tell you i was a salesman if you say so i do say so so what were you in your working days instead of answering his park bench companion smiled for the first time a crooked arrangement at one corner of his mouth were you good at selling stuff you look like you think thats funny its serious the sales business and supporting your family serious stuff yeah i was good how about you i killed no kidding doing what the other man placed his left arm over the back of the park bench his big chest rose and fell as he inhaled then exhaled through his large pockmarked nose let me think how to put this he said finally in his rumbling voice i never know what to tell people youd think id have an answer by now he was silent for a few moments okay i was a performance artist you might say really im not sure what that is comedian sometimes no kidding whered you appear anywhere they paid me ha i know how that is would i have heard of you you might i hope not you didnt want to be famous hell no for the first time the answer came fast thats the last thing id ever want but fame can be confining i get you the first man nodded his big fleshy face looking sage paparazzi and all that cant go anyplace without having flashbulbs go off in your face i hate cameras of any kind dont want none of them around no imagine if reporters had been here that day what day the battle of westport oh embedded with the troops like in iraq interviews with the generals shots of the wounded what a mess and no tvs to show it on the first man let out a laugh a booming ha thats right his companion took them back to their other topic as if hed warmed up to it lotsa people with lotsa money arent famous youd be surprised theyre rich as bill gates and nobodys ever heard of them i wouldnt be so surprised yeah probably not you look like a wise guy you wouldnt think i was so wise not if youd ask my son whats the matter with him the second man was talking faster now now that he was asking questions instead of answering them they were getting into a rhythm a pace a patter he think youre an idiot he says im a fool ought to mind my own business but you retired from that didnt you from what minding your own business that earned another explosive ha followed by some coughing thats right i did so the only business you got left to mind is his ha youre right thats pretty funny but he doesnt think so your son hes not so amused by you a serious guy my son the man in the baby blue gym suit sniffed the corners of his mouth dropped into a frown he settled his body more heavily into the bench if he still smoked it was a moment when hed have puffed reflectively resentfully on his cigar after a moment he pulled himself up and alert again so tell me you make any money being a comedian who didnt want to get famous i made plenty clubs i did some of those and private jobs thats how you got to know the rich people who arent famous some were famous some got famous after i met them id see their pictures and their names in the papers those onesthey ever call you again after they got famous no he smiled slightly they were beyond me by then really stupid shits people get big heads thats what famell do they think theyre too good theyre dead to me now he smiled to himself again as at a private joke sure so what was your act my act he frowned your shtick you know your routine i didnt have no set routine thats dangerous to be too predictable like that you dont want people to know whats coming you want to keep your edge keep them on edge so you take them by surprise startle them come at them out of the blue where theyre not expecting it its intimidating that way you shock em knock em off balance and never let em get back up straight again then you just keep knocking em down knockin the jokes down until theyre bent over pleading and gasping for you to stop cause it hurts so bad been a long time since i laughed like that thats as good as sex if i recall the second man smiled at that yeah its real satisfying i guess youd say i have a talent for shocking people and for improvisation like george carlin or that black kid with the mouth on him chris rock not everybody can get away with stuff like that ive gotten away with it for a long time good for you so that was your act improv sometimes it varied depended on the venue i suppose youre smiling did i say something naive no no youre right a lot depends on the venue whether its in the open airlike this like a park for instance or maybe its inside could be a great big room even as big as a stadium or could be as small as a bathroom size of the audience makes a difference too now that you mention it now that youve got me talking about it some things will go over well in a big crowd that are just overkill when theres nobody around and vice versa that was part of the improvisation you get hecklers if i did i took them out pretty good audiences though i had very attentive audiences very whats your secret you want to get their full attention immediately dont give them any time to adjust to your appearance hit em upside the head a big joke right off the bat huh a twobyfour a baseball bat bam get their undivided attention im not a subtle guy pretty broad comedy huh pretty broad there was one of those in pittsburgh ha ha vaudeville like slapstick that you slapstick i coulda used one of those ha ha borscht belt comedy you jewish me no way i was circumspect not circumcised ha youre a wise guy too that i am what about costumes you ever wear costumes yeah hairpieces teeth mustaches canes crutches i got a closet full of them or i would have if id kept any of it your own mother wouldnt have recognized you my mothers dead oh im sorry it was a long time ago i killed her too thats nice that she appreciated your humor your dad you get your funny bone from him oh yeah he was hilarious it sounded bitter as if there was jealousy he killed me nearly is that unusual what a comic from a happy family i thought all comedians came from bad families like they had to laugh to keep from cryin that kind of thing i dont know about that not much of a philosopher like youre not much of a historian hey defensive when i was workin i knew what i believed and what i didnt thats philosophy aint it like what did you believe i believed in doing my job and not cryin over it me too that right yeah do your job and fuck the regrets or fuck the pretty broads in pittsburgh i think maybe were kind of alike you and me a salesman and a comedian you still dont buy it that i was a salesman do you you said it yourself you dont look the part i look the part as much as you look like a comedian you bought it askin me all about it i was sellin you you think im no salesman but i sold people down the river all the time but you already know that dont you what gone silent again nothin to say so who sent you one of those wise guys i ratted out my son somebody else in the family and wheres your twobyfour you got a reputation for takin em by surprise knocking em flat first thing you said so yourself so why the conversation first before you take me out the conversation was your idea what about the twobyfour not as quick as the gun in my pocket what about the noise silencer witnesses they both looked around both of them taking note of the two young women with baby carriages over by the historical markers of the middleaged male jogger moving their way from the west of the young couple leaning up against a tree witnesses to what i get up and stand in front of you to continue our conversation you slump over but nobody sees past me i grab your shoulder to say goodbye when i leave youre an old man in a baby blue tracksuit asleep on a park bench and im an old man walkin back to my car and then what then you go to hell i go home and retire youre retiring all right see this wire on my baby blue jacket and see those young women and that jogger coming our way theyre fbi if you looked behind you youd see a few more including a sniper in the bedroom window of that nice house back there hes aiming at your head so dont think you can take a shot at mine i just made my last sale mr comedian and youre the product he stood up slowly heavily and then turned and looked down at the fat man with the gun in his pocket you should have paid more attention to history when i was trying to tell you you want to know why the confederates lost because the greedy fuckers stole a farmers old gray mare which pissed him off and so he told the feds where they could sneak over that ridge he pointed north and a little west as the first two agents laid hands on the shoulders of the other man it took the rebs completely by surprise then they got surrounded and they never had a chance the agents hoisted his audience to his feet just like you were going to steal my life which pissed me off so i told the feds how to sneak up on you so they could surround you and you wouldnt stand a chance you know the old song the old gray mare she aint what she used to be your life and mine they aint what they used to be but my life is still mine he banged his meaty right thumb on his chest im hanging on to it like that farmer and his old gray mare you know what they say about history he called out raising his voice to make sure the other man heard as they led him away if you dont pay attention to it youre bound to repeat it maubi and the jumbies by kate grilley a roach coach is the closest st chris comes to an

myself this week in my big enamel kettle best maubi batch ever he kissed the tips of his fingers as a sign of his own approval chortling as he packed my food and drink in a cardboard box is your quadrille group ready for the navidad de isabeya parade next weekend i asked digging in my fanny pack for cash my bands been practicing every evening with the dancers at the legion hall the parade wouldnt be a success without you ive put your group at the end of the lineup saving the best for last said maubi with a broad smile where you parked i pointed to my tenyearold hatchback a short distance away thats too far to go by yourself the jumbies could get you he leaned toward me lowering his voice its not safe like the old days we got drug dealers and lowlifes limin around the fort thats why i come to rest my van down here so late keep my boy and his friends out of trouble youve done a good job i said putting the change in my coin purse hes a fine boy hes graduating this year isnt he first in his class maubi beamed with pride he got a scholarship to cornell to study hotel management he works at harborview on weekends they want him fulltime this summer he called to his son quincy you take this food and see miss kelly gets to her car safe then come back and help me close up its time we go home quincy and i were at my car when we heard a clopping sound like horses hooves followed by maubis cry jumbie be gone we quickly turned toward the van to see maubi throwing salt in the air through the serving window maubi pointed at kongens gade in the direction of the anglican church on the western edge of town quincy sprinted up isabeyas main street against the sparse oneway traffic while i stayed at the van maubi what happened i asked i feel a chill a sure sign there be a jumbie about i looked around and saw nothing out of the ordinary the salt under my feet rasped like sandpaper against the rubber soles of my flipflops why the salt jumbie cure if you throw salt on the skin of a jumbie it cant harm you i always keep my salt close i thought of my grandmothers tales of spirits in her native ireland and the luck stone with a hole in it shed given me when i was a child that now hung from a leather thong over my bed with my collection of dream catchers the irish tradition said if anyone looked upon you with an evil eye looking back at them through the hole in the stone would ward off any harm they might wish you quincy jogged slowly back to the van panting from his fruitless exertion maubi took his cane from a hook and pounded it against the floor of the van a sound reminiscent of horses hooves he began to laugh he laughed until he was gasping for breath and tears were streaming down his face i fool you maubi said when he was able to speak quincy and i were not amused the next afternoon i took the ferry from the dockside hotel on the isabeya waterfront over to harborview on papaya quay where quincy was working at the water sports pavilion the history of papaya quay includes a ghost until the fire that destroyed isabeya in papaya quay was uninhabited after the fire the danish government was homeless with only fort frederick left standing to house the soldiers and dispossessed town residents temporary government house quarters were established on papaya quay when the first phase of the new government house at the foot of kongens gade was completed five years later papaya quay became the governors private retreat island legend tells us that the governor had a mistressan enchanting beauty who claimed descent from the original arawak indianswhom he stashed at papaya quay until her death one night during an early spring yellow fever epidemic she was buried on the quay but her grave has never been found it is said she haunts her former home to this day walking back and forth along the harborview terrace waiting and watching for her lover to come to her by boat quincy and i sat on the terrace drinking iced tea we decided to bring the legend to life that very evening we enlisted the help of two of the mocko jumbiesgaily dressed dancing figures on stilts a highlight of every st chris parade shortly after midnight isabeya was again shuttered and silent the quiet broken only by chirping crickets near the gazebo bandstand on the green between the fort and the library the slap of waves against the boardwalk and twanging boat lines the harborview ferry was docked for the night at papaya quay the boat captain snoring in his bunk in the harbormasters quarters maubi sat in his van facing the harbor chatting with the last of his customers he stopped in the middle of a story to stare wideeyed at a wooden rowboat approaching the seaside boardwalk from the direction of harborview he began to shiver in the boat were a man and woman in eighteenthcentury clothing the man wore a danish officers uniform with the scarlet sash across his chest favored by the governor for formal occasions the woman was dressed in a resplendent ball gown a gossamer shawl covering her head and shoulders maubi grabbed the salt the man extended his hand to help the woman alight from the boat as they passed silently arm in arm in front of maubis van salt showered the couple like wedding rice the electric lights in front of government house blinked once then went out flickering candle flames were visible in the windows of the government house ballroom the couple passed through the locked iron gates separating the government house driveway from kongens gade up the broad set of outside stairs to the double doors at the formal entrance on the second floor as they slipped through the doors the strains of a minuet were heard from the candlelit ballroom once the couple was inside the music ceased and the candles were extinguished one by one until government house was again darkened a woman laughed merrily then all was silent the lights in front of government house slowly brightened to normal quincy and i bit our fingers to keep our guffaws in check my luck stone dropped from my hand to rest on my chest like a pendant suspended from the leather thong around my neck as we were ready to leap from our hiding place to yell fooled you at maubi a second boat approached the boardwalk a rogue wave caught the boat broadside spilling the occupants into the sea we heard familiar voices cursing as they thrashed about in the shallows weighted down by their heavy clothing quincy and i ran to the boardwalk to help our sodden friends out of the water when we talk about that night which isnt often we always have shakers of salt in our hands maubi and the jumbies was originally published in the fall issue of murderous intent magazine in it was an agatha nominee for best short story and received a best short story macavity award estelle is dead by medora sale temptation kate brady tossed her keys on the table and began sorting rapidly through a weeks worth of mail the brightly colored flyers landed in the basket in the hall everything else no matter how unpromising it looked went into the dining room with her once she had trashed a check for eighteen hundred dollars because it had come in an envelope that looked like a begging letter now she opened everything bills and financial statements went into a pile requests from charities and classier advertising glided into another wastepaper basket the last envelope was from a university probably raising funds she slit it open impatiently glanced at the single sheet of paper inside and paused her hand hovered over the basket drew back and set the letter down on top of the bills and statements to be taken into her tidy little office she disposed of the bills and statements rapidly and efficiently checking every item preparedif necessary to spend the rest of the day disputing an interest charge or error she had fended off poverty and evictionfor too long after leaving home to turn careless over money only the letter remained it demanded a decision she was between books worse yet between contracts an irritating restless lethargy enveloped her prodding her into useless activity and keeping her from sleep and yesterday a set of royalty statements had arrived confirming what she already knew sales of her type of fictionthe romanticsadistic thrillerwere falling people were tired of bodice slashers she lay awake at night thinking of a long old age and no new income when that onetime windfall the film rights to death on a doubleedged blade had come in twelve years before her accountant had pointed out that she had better figure on living at least until eightyfive fortyseven more years it was then she had bought her house paid cash for it and started salting away her money but it wasnt going to be enough why ask herof all peopleto come and speak at sight and sound the windsor festival of the arts surrounded by poets artists and scornful intellectuals at least she wouldnt run into any old friends she thought grimly if she went no she couldnt still she picked up the letter again how much were they paying the hotel lobby was small and gleaming with polish on the brass and dark wood the plump pretty woman behind the desk greeted her with the enthusiasm of a longlost friend and kate wondered for a moment if she was she looked at her again not a chance when kate had moved to chicago this bouncing creature hadnt learned to ride a tricycle yet she smiled and checked in i almost forgot ms brady said the desk clerk theres a letter for you she walked into the dimly lit room swung her suitcase up on the bed and dropped her shoulder bag on the floor she peered into the dimness for a light switch my god kate youre going blind she muttered and yanked back the heavy curtains covering one wall light flooded the room the window was the width of the room and overlooked the river from where she stood she could see all the way upriver to the bend in the east and downriver to the bridge and islands to the west it was even better than the view from the tiny room in her grandmothers attic at that moment as if it had timed its arrival for her benefit a lake boat came into view on its stately progress down from lake superior in the golden sunshine during how many nights of her stormy childhood had the melancholy reassuring sound of the lake boats foghorns lulled her to sleep her face softened maybe tonight there would be fog she turned and kicked her shoulder bag for chrissake kate she muttered to herself youre pathetic in a minute youll be sobbing over this shitty town and all your shitty little friends friends i bet theyre fat as pigs with six kids each living on welfare then she noticed that she was still clutching the letter dear estelle it began she froze for a second unable to think hardly able to breathe she took a deep breath and started reading again welcome home i was thrilled to discover that you had agreed to speak at sight and sound i know youll be a great addition to the weekends entertainment ive been following your career as closely as i could since we were all in school together in those days i admit i worshipped you from afar alas youve been even further from my grasp since then there is so much that i would like to talk to you about and even more that i would like to tell the world about your varied talents i am writing an article about your life and exploitsfor the star if you wish to discuss what ought to go into it meet me tonight at nine oclock at the east end of the sculpture garden there is a bench in between the four pillars standing alone and the plump selfsatisfied gentleman on the horse a fitting spot i thought i will be there you still look pretty athletic these days its not far from your hotel and youll find theres enough light for walking e who in hell is e she said crumpling up the paper and then smoothing it out again over her thighs the telephone rang and she jumped like a frightened cat yes she said in a cracked uncertain voice ms brady kate brady she murmured agreement rob martin from the sight and sound committee i hope you had a good trip look most of the others came in yesterday and we laid on a dinner for them we thought you deserved a good meal as well how about tonight can i pick you up at the hotel at six thirty or have you made other plans it was like talking to a bulldozer by the time he gave her a chance to answer it was too late she had agreed to meet him downstairs said she would be wearing black with a red leather jacket and hung up rob martin appeared to be in his late thirties or early forties he was balding slightly but that suited his rangy athleticlooking frame his smile was friendly his grey eyes cool and assessing if he hadnt been a little young for her she might have considered him as possiblevery possiblelight relief during the next four days she still might she thought glad that she had dressed with care where are we going for dinner she asked bracingherself for the worst she couldnt remember there being a whole lot of decent restaurants around here to the art gallery he said with a quirky smile thatannoyinglyreminded her of someone isnt that carrying the idea of the weekend a bit far do we bring sandwiches and munch as we troop through the exhibits or are there benches to sit on theres definitely someplace to sit he said coolly the gallery has a restaurant with interesting food artistically presented of course i thought you might like it if you prefer a burger somewhere we can do that too but the art gallery is just along the street we can walk there in two minutes kate brooded over the menu hovering between the venison espiritu and the duck breast vestido de fumar i have to admit that i wasnt expecting this sort of food she said it doesnt fit exactly with my image of the city try the venison it might change your image said rob ms brady will have the venison he murmured to the waitress and ill have the duck he turned back to kate but havent people around here always appreciated good food do you come from here i grew up in a town near london came here to go to university and never left what about you have you always lived in chicago winnetka she said its not quite chicago but its on the lake as well i like living near water so do i he said sometimes its fascinating it has its dark and destructive side though dont you think the arrival of the wine relieved her from having to respond to that one lunch had been a cup of coffee and the venison was superb she ate everything on her plate except for a sprig of fresh herbs and the flower and sat back turning her wineglass around and around staring at it why invite me to speak she asked abruptly along with the pretentious arty types my junk doesnt exactly fit the image i write bodice slashers as my editor calls thempink perfumed scary porn to make a living we all have to make a living he said smoothly i suppose someone on the committee likes your books and thinks itll be fun to have you on the list i dont know im a messenger boy thats allnot one of the powerhouses why did you come curiosity i suppose she said killed the cat he replied with a lazy grin what are you up to tonight i could take you around to the nightspots or if you prefer theres a poetry reading at the capitol theatre id love to she said injecting all the sincerity at her command into her voice but after driving all day and eating this spectacular dinneryou know it really was terrific she added in normal tones but im going for a walk along the river with a friend like i said i have a thing about rivers i thought you didnt know anyone here hes from detroit i said id meet him at eight thirty judgement kate went back to her hotel room and put on the pale yellow outfit she wore for her daily two to threemile walks it showed off her legsstill one of her real assetsmaking them look even longer than they were she flicked a comb through her shiny hair snapped her pouch with cab fare and room key around her waist and set off she crossed the broad drive that separated the hotels and the art gallery from the riverside park and plunged from light into darkness trees blocked out the streetlights swallowing up the ambient glow of the city and the water she had forgotten how dark it could be down here and ran down the broad path in a mild panic when she reached the riverbank she slowed to catch her breath the water ran smoothly along beside her murmuring reassuringly giving her back her strength and courage she stretched her legs out and began walking quickly and confidently toward the meeting place she passed the four pillars and looked up the hillside there was the wooden bench halfway up the hill a figure on the bench was silhouetted in the light from the street above arms spread out head tipped back long legs crossed at the ankles stretched out in front of himthe essence of relaxation she stopped dead halfway up the slope and gasped omigod it came out between a squeak and a scream jack noit cant be she clapped her hand over her mouth to keep herself from saying more the man looked over at her the headlights of a passing car swept over his face and she laughed oh its you for a minute there i thought you were someone else you really gave me a turn what are you doing here waiting for you estelle sorry the name is kate or katie if you must thats up there on the other side of the road down here by the river youre estelle beautiful estelle leblanc you know in this light you look almost the same almost lithe slender graceful as a deer and strong i still am she protested i havent gained a pound in thirty years maybe but youve turned from a schoolboys fantasy into something nasty hard and stiff its sad but no matter were not here to talk about the ravages of time i saw you that night with jack you know down there on the far side of the railing i dont know anyone named jack she said youre crazy and i think ive heard enough she tried to move away and found that her wrist was caught in a grip of steel i dont know how you got him down there on the rocks remember how terrified he was of water but you did and you pushed him in i saw you thats crazy why would i push him in because he was hard to get rid of estelle because you promised to marry him and he believed you he told me that thats a lie i never said id marry him he bought you a ringhe showed it to me you accepted it and promised to be his forever but why say youd marry him and kill him a month later i never killed him he slipped she said quickly he did it was awful it had been raining and the rocks were slippery i tried to save him but i couldnt noi tried to save him estelle he said you ran away i jumped in after him but it was dark and i couldnt find him thats not true she slumped down on the bench beside him i thought i was pregnant she said in a vague faraway voice my dad wouldve killed me but i wasnt after all when i told him he wouldnt take his ring back youd got rid of the baby jacks baby so big deal she shrugged her shoulders you cant print any of this you know ill sue you and ill sue the paper for all its worth okay we were engaged then we broke up jack drowned trying to rescue his little brother who came to get him and fell in the river the little brother got out but he didnt tragic but by then id gone home thats what they said and as far as im concerned its the truth but im not a journalist estelle im not even on the committee what are you then her eyes widened in alarm call me an avenging angel revelation a pair of earlymorning joggers their backs warmed by the rising sun and their sweaty faces cooled by a light breeze off the river saw her first she was lying on a wooden bench near the paved walkway it was not far from a childrens playground bright with swings and slides birds chattered and quarrelled in the lush neatly trimmed trees the dappled sunlight flirted with a patch of dried blood caked in her expensive blond hair chiselled into the wood of the seat back was the inscription erected in memory of john william martineau by his loving brothers edward and norman look at that shes drunk leave her be she might be hurt the young woman walked over theres blood on her head she leaned over kevin come here she said unsteadily i think shes dead a laker heavily loaded and riding low in the water slipped downstream toward lake erie indifferent to the lives and deaths of the landdwellers the river lapped gently against its walls sergeant do you think she couldve been carrying a thousand bucks in twenties in that pouch around her waist he eased himself into the room standing more or less at attention no al i dont she was just out for a walk maybe she was looking to buy drugs i doubt it why do you ask because theres a john doe downstairs he came into emergency this morning unconscious with he pulled a notebook out nine hundred and sixtysevendollars on him and a thirtydollar bottle of scotch almost empty he could have bashed her over the head last night and taken the thousand he hits her over the head he strangles her takes a thousand bucks leaving her the twenty we found in that pouch thing he wanted to send her home in a cab maybe no al i dont believe it the guys who found him in the sculpture garden had a look around they found blood on a bench near him and down by those horses heads he kills her and carries her body all the way up the river why so shell be closer to her hotel you were the one who said the bodyd been moved sergeant not me the doctor did where did they pick the drunk up on a bench near the horses heads hes been there before they said wed better see him bring him up when he can talk it was not until five oclock that the committee in charge of sight and sound realized they were missing a speaker and began to make serious inquiries at eight oclock a miserablelooking man small thin and dishevelled was brought upstairs to be interviewed an ineffectual attempt had been made to clean him up for the ordeal the sergeant looked up hi billy howd you get mixed up in this he blinked hey paul hows it going you talking about the couple down by the river probably al its your john doe you take it name asked al billy everyone calls me billy full name your real name oh william sampson wed like to know how you laid your hands on almost a thousand bucks said the sergeant yawning in your own words it was like this see i had half a bottle i was saving from the night before yeah sure said al let him talk al and i come down to sit on the bench behind those horse heads its dark there and no ones gonna bother you mostly welltheres this guy sitting there staring down at the ground behind the bushes like and so i look to see what hes staring at theres a woman lying there wearing lightcolored clothes i didnt notice anything else about her i ask him if shes drunk and he says yeah she is and shes sleeping it off did you go look at her why would i she was his problem we shared the bottle and talked what about everything he said vaguely finally he said hed better take her home to her husband he used those words asked the sergeant to her husband yeah and he went down and got her on her feet sort of i came along to help but i slipped and fell and he just picked her up and carried her away before that he handed me this big bundle of money and said thanks for everything billy youre a good friend well say good night say good night estelle did he happen to say who he was why would he do that it was eddie martineau are you sure of course im sure i wouldnt never forget eddie remember we were pals like until we were twelve or thirteen lived next door to each other and went to the same school when his brother jack died he left and nothing was ever the same his eyes began to tear up and his nose dripped nothing ever the same he mumbled we knew estelle pushed jack off them rocks eddie almost died from diving down trying to pull him out poor eddie but hes happy now why do you say that cause estelle is dead yeah estelle is dead he told me that and nothing else he didnt tell you anything else no i would have remembered if he had because it was eddie can i go now why not we know where you live dont we i still live with ma at the old house can i have the money back eddie gave it to me he said ma and me we needed it more than he did come back tomorrow when youre sober and you can have it go on home to your ma billy are you really going to let him have that money why not no ones reported it stolen he probably took it out from under his mas mattress ive known him for years hes harmless but he was talking to the bastard who murdered that woman you cant just let him go he was talking to a ghost al said the sergeant yawning i dont know who this estelle is but his friend eddie martineau is long dead and the dead woman is a writer from chicago named kate brady here to give a talk two people have identified her the waitress where she had dinner heard her say she was meeting a friend from detroit to go on this walkits time we got on to that dont you think weve already lost a day because we didnt know who she was get rid of billy and find me the guy from detroit as soon as al left paul leaned back in his chair closing his eyes he saw the three of them clear as could be billy eddie and his wideeyed younger self sitting on the grass in the dark outside billys house eddie crying and swearing as he shivered with the cold water dripping off him saying if he ever saw estelle again hed get her good for what shed done and they swore solemnly that theyd help but no one believed eddie when he told them shed killed jack because he was sick and running a fever and they thought hed been hallucinating he went wild and the day he got out of bed he ran off to live with his aunt as far as anyone knew he never came back and the word was that he had died paul opened his eyes we swore wed help him jack he whispered to the sad drowned ghost and a promise made is a debt unpaid isnt it so now were quit because if eddie cant disappear again in the twentyfour hours weve given him ill be very surprised two days later on the bench where kate bradys body had been found someone had printed in a neat script using black paint and a narrow brush estelle is dead too jack steak tartare by barbara damato if you drive north from chicago along lake michigan you will pass through several increasingly wealthy suburbs the first and oldest is evanston then wilmette kenilworth and winnetka winnetka is one of the richest municipalities in the united states it may be that the average income in kenilworth nestled next to it is higher than winnetka but kenilworth is so small that it hardly counts basil stone had therefore been thrilled to be hired as resident director of the north shore playhouse located in winnetka it wasnt broadway of course but it was a very very prestigious rep house and you rubbed shoulders with nothing but the best people like tonight he spun his little red lexus around the curves of sheridan road which ran right along lake michigan and therefore was the place des vosges of illinois rue de la crème de la crème the street that accessed the highestpriced real estate in an already highpriced area and the falklands mansion was on the lake side of sheridan the east which meant beach frontage of course and was far tonier than living across the road these things mattered to basil pamela had given him the street number and told him to watch for two brick columns supporting a wroughtiron arch and elaborate iron gates and there they were he swung in spoke his name into the post speaker and the gates majestically opened god the place was a castle the drive wound in a lazy s up to a wide pillared veranda pamela stood on the lip of the veranda like a midwestern scarlett ohara framed among acres of flesh pink azaleas that swept away on both sides of the fieldstone steps welcome basil she said giving him a quick kiss on the cheek he pulled back fast not wanting her husband to see although everybody hugged and kissed when they met didnt they it didnt necessarily mean anything she drew him in the front door basil stopped just inside trying not to goggle at the immense foyer a tessellated marble floor flowed into a great entry hall stretching far back to a double staircase which curved out up and in the two halves joining at the second floor the ceiling was thirty feet overhead the chandelier that dimly lit the hall hung from a heavy chain and was as big as a chevy suburban turned on its end basil looked around found that they were alone and whispered pamela i dont think this was such a good idea oh please she said dont be so timid timid he didnt want her to think he was timid he was bold romantic still but what if he guesses he wont she patted his cheek leaving her hand lingering on the side of his face just then basil heard footsteps coming from somewhere beyond the great hall and he backed sharply away from her pamela laughed she touched him with a light gaze then spun to face the man who had just entered darling she said this is basil basil my husband charles falkland gesturing with his drink charles falkland said i know shell make a wonderful kate im very grateful that she wanted to do the show with her background in new york of course pamela is a brilliant actor and as kate she has just the right combination of bite and vulnerability absolutely falkland said placing his hand possessively on the back of pamelas neck she is extremely accomplished basil studied the room taking time to answer must be cautious here of course you know were an equity house so all the actors are professional theyll support her beautifully but why the taming of the shrew youd rather we did a drama dont you feel that its important for the general public to realize that shakespeare can be light humorous people are so deadly serious well falkland said drawing the word out some issues in life are serious of course arent they of course but but enough of this let me just mix us all a drink falkland busied himself with the bottled water lime and lemon wedges that the silent butler sloan had brought in and decanters of some splendid bourbon and scotch which the falklands were too wellbred to keep in labeled bottles but which to basils taste in his first drink seemed like knob creek or possibly the topoftheline makers mark not the kind you buy in stores even specialty shops you had to order it from the company here darling falkland said turning to pamela basils and yours pamela carried basils drink to him reaching out to put it in his hand her fingertips grazed his as he reached for the glass and her thumb stroked the back of his hand basils breath caught how beautiful she was he could scarcely believe his luck their affair had started the first day of rehearsals seeing her husband and this mansion knowing that she had been an actress of some considerable reputation he could imagine that she might be bored in this big house with a husband who looked chilly and austere pamela left her hand next to his just half a second too long basil resisted pulling back surely that would only make it more obvious but he thought falkland had seen or maybe not hed been pouring his own drink rather a stiff one but hed been casually looking toward them too over the lip of the glass did he notice after all what would he see a woman hands a man a drink just ordinary hospitality just what was expected abruptly falkland said pamela yes dear i just realized ive not chosen a dessert wine i have a lovely médoc for dinner were having a crown roast of lamb and the dinner wine should be just right but we need something to go with the sabayon and raspberries dont we yes i imagine so dear basil noted that sloan was waiting near the door that led from this great room to some unspecified back region briefly he wondered why sloan hadnt poured and passed the drinks well go to the wine cellar with sloan and find something special would you of course darling an expression of mild puzzlement passed over pamelas face not rising quite to the level of a wrinkle across her lovely brow we want something beyond the ordinary for basil dont you think something that sings a finale a last act after all he is an artiste uh yes darling its just that you usually make the decisions about wine yes but basil is your friend of course help mrs falkland please sloan falkland said pamela went out the door and sloan after nodding to falkland followed her it was just a bit awkward with pamela gone basil found he rose strolled about stopping at the french windows facing the back admiring the lake view the private dock and the yacht anchored there sleek long and bright white even in the dying daylight he tried a few questions about falklands line of work but when the man answered at length he realized that he didnt know what earbitrage was and couldnt intelligently carry on that line of conversation pamela was taking entirely too long with the dessert wine she should have stayed here to protect him after all this damned dinner had been her idea he wondered whether maybe she was a risk taker and liked to skate close to discovery hed had hints of that when he saw her drive out of the playhouse parking lot at highway speed perhaps tonight she was teasing her husband well basil would have to be doubly careful if so then falkland quoted and bonny kate and sometimes kate the curst but kate the prettiest kate in christendom kate of katehall my superdainty kate you know the play oh yes i was quite a theater scholar once upon a time in fact i met pamela through the theater oh i was a backer for one of her shows she of course was the star but she doesnt act outside of rep anymore oh i need her all to myself thy husband is thy lord thy life thy keeper thy head thy sovereign one that cares for thee shakespeare has kate present some good arguments against that point of view ah but such duty as the subject owes the prince even such a woman oweth to her husband basil did not respond how had he gotten drawn into this discussion anyhow and where the hell was pamela sloan appeared in the arch between the great hall and the dining room basil was startled for a second to see him and he realized how very soundproof the back regions were one heard no sounds of cooking or plates rattling or glasses clinking dinner is ready sir whenever you are basil had not studied sloan before since basil had been fully occupied with other problems but now he realized that the man was extremely sleek his suit was as well made as falklands or nearly so his cheeks were pinkly smoothshaven his hair thin on top and combed down flat with no attempt to cover the bald center was rich brown and shiny therefore it was a bit of a surprise that apparently unknown to sloan a small tuft no bigger than the wing of a wren was disarranged in back perhaps he had brushed against something while cooking if indeed he was the person in the ménage who cooked falkland murmured what say you to a piece of roast and mustard basil winced he was getting bloody damned tired of shakespeare we should wait for pamela shouldnt we well just start on the appetizer i think falkland said basil sat across from falkland himself to the right and falkland to the left of the head of the long table a wide pond of shiny walnut between them candles were the only lights the head of the table apparently had been left for pamela which made some sense since it put her between them and she was the only woman present or absent as was the case currently basil regarded the silver at his place setting with dismay why five forks there were also three spoons but he was sure he could figure those out one was likely for coffee or dessert there was a rounded soupspoon a fellow director had once told him on a shoot where they were doing a twoshot of the happy couple at dinner that a small round soupspoon was for thick soup and a large oval soupspoon was for clear soup but five forks only one perhaps identifiable as a salad fork now that he thought about it the setup was probably designed to intimidate him well he wasnt going to let that happen he said where is pamela well be done with the first course before she arrives if were not careful she might bequite a while pamela has always had a difficult time making up her mind basil had no idea what to say to that he sat unhappily in his chair wondering why falkland kept the dining room so dark it would make a wonderful set foroh hell the kind of atmosphere falkland had prepared would only be good for a show with a supernatural element or a murder gaslight macbeth deathtrap but of course it was just the natural dining behavior of the very rich for the thousandth upon thousandth time basil reflected that he should have been born rich candles at dinner were probably a nightly ritual at the falklands hed used them in his production of an inspector calls and of course macbeth thank god he hadnt uttered the name of the scottish play aloud very bad luck with the darkness crowding his shoulders and the flicker of the candle flames causing the shadows of his five forks to undulate as if slinking slowly toward the plate basil resolved to look upon the whole evening as a set of suggestions for his next noir production use it dont fight it he told himself sloan entered he carried two plates of something that surely must not be what it looked like surely it was just the low candlelight that made the lumps appear reddish and bloody and undercooked as the plate touched down in front of basil with scarcely a sound he saw it was indeed raw meat steak tartare falkland said a small portion makes a perfect appetizer as a main dish it becomes a bit much dont you think uh is he serving just us two what about pamela oh pamela wont be long as i was about to say as an appetizer i have sloan serve it without the raw egg although if you can buy fresh new eggs from greenrun chickens there is really no danger and of course with these new methods of preventing salmonella in chickenssomething about the properly inoculated feedyou can be quite confident nevertheless for the sake of my guests equanimity i forgo the egg and serve the steak tartare as an appetizer traditionally of course it is chopped fillet steak or sirloin twice run through the grinder then mixed with chopped onions and garlic and capers and raw egg salt and pepper and the patty is shaped with a depression in the center into that depression is dropped a perfect golden yolk it is a beautiful presentation really the yolk a deep cadmium yellow and the meat around it rich red well like this actually so fresh it glistens do you see uhhh yes of course charles said steepling his fingers as the manservant stepped back it can only be the very very freshest meat uh yes indeed and never never ground beef from the supermarket he uttered the word supermarket the way another person might say latrine the man basil thought should have been an actor himself he certainly got all the juice out of a word youre not eating now these are the traditional accompaniments around itcapers chopped onion and minced parsley mmmmm not used to steak tartare basil no some chefs mix in cognac as well and garnish it with caviar the swiss even add anchovies but it seems to me if youre going for the taste of fresh raw meat tarting it up with extraneous flavors is a waste dont you think so uhhh still to revert to our earlier topic i wonder why it had to be the taming of the shrew there are more interesting shakespeare pieces you could do uhhh the trustees actually the trustees wanted it well then i suppose youre stuck with it they do hold the purse strings but i wonder as time goes on if you could convince them to do shakespeares unappreciated masterpiece im speaking of titus andronicus of course mmm its reassuring to me as a shakespeare enthusiast that the julie taymor film of it is coming out at least but there isnt any substitute for the immediacy of the stage i agree of course basil half whispered real human beings near enough to touch and titus andronicus is so grand guignol it was shakespeares breakout play you know made his name although at the time people claimed to be upset at all the violence media violence fascinating to think that without it without all that excess we might never have known the name shakespeare basil picked up a heavy francis i fork he touched the chopped meat it was lumpy and bright red with tiny flecks of gristle or fat he wondered whether he could tell anything if he touched it with his finger if it was warm had it been in the refrigerator or was it body temperature but he couldnt bear to touch it falkland went on and what a story the son of tamora queen of the goths has been killed by titus for revenge she has her other two sons rape tituss daughter and cut out her tongue i know said basil in a strangled voice then titus in an antic burst of exquisite revenge invites tamora to dinner and unknown to her serves her a pastywed call it a potpie i imaginemade from her two sons heads im familiar with titus andronicus dammit oh of course you are dear boy youre a director terribly sorry uhhh my word basil you arent eating auuhhh you havent touched your steak tartare it could not be what he thought it could not how long had they been down in that cellar and how would falkland dispose of theof the rest but then he recalled the dock the boathouse the mansion backed directly onto lake michigan well of course it did it was on the highrent side of sheridan but what about sloan could falkland possibly have sloan so much in his pocket that he would do anything falkland asked inadvertently basil glanced up at sloan standing silent and lugubrious just left of the dining room door falkland caught his glance sloan is such a gem he said hes been with me for twentythree years now oh yes since i agreed to accept him from the parole board you see they would only let him go if he had permanent residential employment oh yes i see in a home with no children basil stared at his plate if he so much as sipped a smidgen of water he would be sick staring at his plate was worse he averted his eyes but it was too late perspiration started up on his forehead and he could feel sweat running into his hair his face was hot and his abdomen was deeply cold basil threw his napkin down next to the army of forks he half rose i dont think im feeling very well oh please we were so looking forward to this evening i think id better go he gagged out the words and could hardly understand what he himself had said it sounded like guhguhgo the swinging door from the pantry opened pamela stood in the spill of kitchen light holding a dusty glass bottle its a terrible cliché i know she said smiling apologetically but i picked out everything else and finally went back to the château dyquem uhuhuh basil said trying to stand upright but bent by the pains knifing through his stomach basil are you ill she said basil ran at a half crouch out of the dining room through the long hall and the marble foyer and pushed out the front door into the glorious cool night air oh dear pamela said still smiling falkland said fun darling fun the best weve ever done animal act by claire mcnab gday i said im kylie kendall im here to see arnold the bloke whod opened the door of the flamboyant beverly hills mansion looked at me without enthusiasm oh yes the australian lisette told me youd be coming by with his thick curly black hair deep brown eyes straight nose and jutting jaw he was handsome and he knew it wheres the blonde he asked shes the one who usually does the inspection his expression warmed slightly as he added goodlooking woman he was referring to my partner in kendall creeling investigative services ariana creeling shes out of town on a case i said youll have to make do with me he grunted and stood aside i suppose youd better come in i blinked at the entrance area two stories above light flooded in from a huge circular stainedglass window set into the ceiling multicolored patches of light were splashed over the black marble floor and chalk white walls a wide curving staircase with bloodred carpet led to the next floor scattered apparently at random were lifesize sculptures of various animals dogs cats a llama a potbellied pigdisplayed on white marble bases the one closest to me depicted a huge bear rearing up on its hind legs engraved on the pedestal were the words leonard dancing crikey i said i became aware the bloke was watching me with a sour smile it was apparent he wasnt intending to introduce himself so i said and youd be paul berkshire proper little detective arent you actually i wasnt id inherited fiftyone percent of kendall creeling from my father but wasnt a private eyes bootlace yet just a trainee there was no need to blab this to paul berkshire of course he set off for the rear of the house down a wide hallway not bothering to see if i was following even from the back he was a bonzerlooking bloke with a strong neck wide shoulders and a narrow waist paul berkshire was the nephew of rhea berkshire who before her death had been a crashhot animal trainer for movies and tv shed been a heavy drinker and six months agojust before i came to the states had died from an accidental overdose of bourbon and sleeping tablets the very specific provisions shed made in her will for her menagerie of animals at her ranch outside la ensured that all went to good homes many with other professional trainers the ranch itself was sold the proceeds going to animal charities one of her charges however received special treatment this was rheas most adored and successful subject arnold her will specified that no expense was to be spared her nephew paul was to ensure that arnold lived a life of luxury in rheas beverly hills estate for the rest of his days everyone knew arnolds story rescued from a shelter when just a puppy he was what we aussies call a bitsera bit of this and a bit of that he was a pepperandsalt charmer incredibly photogenic and very smart and he loved performing hed become a household word as the cute psychic dogalso called arnoldin the paranormal hit comedy series professor swanns spooks even before id come to the states id been a fan of the show most people in my outback hometown wollegudgerie watched the program on wednesday nights even my mum who wasnt what youd call a fan of televisionaddled your brains she always said darklyalways made sure the program was on the screen above the main bar of her pub the wombats retreat ahead of me paul berkshire had reached a black lacquered door and was looking impatiently over his shoulder i havent got all day i suppose in his place id resent being regularly checked to ensure that the conditions set out in his aunts will were being followed to the letter rhea berkshire had cause to use kendall creelings services long before i turned up on the scene shed become a fast friend of my fathers so shed instructed her lawyers frogmartin frogmartin flye to include in her will a generous payment to our company to visit arnold once every two monthsor more often if it seemed indicatedto make certain he was being treated in the manner a megarich canine should expect we were to liaise with his vet his walker his dietician his groomer and his roundtheclock companion lisette who had been in rheas employ for many years and paul berkshire of course as he had inherited his aunts business and so was arnolds trainer id heard a new series of professor swanns spooks was in the works and was going to ask if that was truemum would love to knowwhen the bloke threw open the door arnolds beauty parlor he said with a bit of a twist to his lip as he spoke i noticed these three words were engraved in ornate script on the doors lacquered surface gets up your nose does it i said what not sure i approve myself not very macho is it he looked at me blankly so i added i reckon a dog like arnold would prefer something more masculine how about sprucing room what do you think i think arnold cant read he said so he doesnt give a rats ass what the rooms called opening the door he said lisette this is the kendall from kendall and creeling here to check were not mistreating the dog hed said the dog with such a flat tone that i looked at him with surprise recently id read an article in hollywood reporter where berkshire had spoken glowingly of arnolds sweet nature and his ability to master new routines lisette will call me when youre finished he said turning away and stalking off back down the hallway before i could respond i stepped into the room and found myself grinning at arnold who cocked his head and waved his stubby little tail even more adorable in person than on the screen he was standing patiently on a table while a young bloke with a pale face and lifeless fair hair groomed him gday lisette i said to the woman who was smiling at me warmly im kylie she was much older than i expected small and wiry with a cloudburst of white hair hello dear arianas told me all about you she had the faintest suggestion of an english accent crikey all good i hope mostly said the young bloke with a bit of a smirk lisette introduced him as gary hartnel gday gary i said i couldnt resist adding and gday to you too arnold arnold blurred his little tail friendly i remarked not to everyone gary declared arnold has his likes and dislikes righto i said whipping a folder out of my bag ive got a checklist here lets go through it and then ill get out of your way lisette took me to meet the rest of the staff arnold came too trotting along beside us with a delightfully cheerful demeanor as we walked down the halls thick carpet i said to her does he miss ms berkshire do you think rhea im sure he does look at him when she said her late employers name arnolds tail drooped and he gave me such a pitiful look my heart turned over im sorry i mentioned it thats okay dear arnolds very sensitive we found him snuggled up in bed with rhea her being dead and all and him softly whining he was in mourning near brought me to tears soon i knew rather more about arnolds daytoday schedule than id ever intended to knowhis dietician went into such detail about the measurement and preparation of arnolds food that my eyes glazed over and his walker insisted on describing at length the variety of routes arnold covered every week is everything satisfactory lisette asked when id finished going through her duties as arnolds companion too right i said giving her the thumbsup shes apples she shook her head you aussies lisette arnold and i headed back to the front of the house all i need to do is to check a few things with mr berkshire paul will be in his officeno wait here he is now ive got pindrop hearing or i wouldnt have heard the soft growl arnold gave i looked down at him he was staring fixedly at paul berkshire his body language was a puzzleid heard a growl but he wasnt stiff with aggression he was unnaturally still waiting then he glanced up at me with the oddest expression on his face youre done berkshire asked me ive got a few more areas to cover with you lisette take arnold to his gym he doesnt need to tag along with us when i looked back over my shoulder arnold hadnt moved the blokes office was huge being more what id call a library with shelves and shelves of impressivelooking books and lots of maroon leather furniture paul berkshire plunked himself behind a massive antique desk and answered my questions about arnolds training regimen with cool economy it seemed there was to be a new series of professor swanns spooks and arnold was already learning new routines for the show nothing too risky it was one of our duties to make sure arnold was never involved in hazardous situations of course not arnold has a stunt double who looks exactly like him but not as talented berkshire gave me a thin smile more talented in my professional opinion a pleasure to work with the animal dopp is arnold without the attitude dopp for doppelganger berkshire raised his eyebrows my little joke i raised my eyebrows right back at him im surprised you say arnold has an attitude i found him a bonzer dog hes temperamental at times difficult could be hes getting close to the end of his performing life maybe hes grieving for your aunt a fleeting emotion flickered across berkshires face just that morning at breakfast id been reading in my invaluable reference source private investigation the complete handbook about microexpressions these only lasted for a split second but exposed the true feelings of a person before they could hide them in this case i reckoned hed revealed a pretty disturbing mixsneering anger tinged with arrogant triumph if theres nothing else ill get gary to escort you to your car he said clearly wanting to get rid of me gary a limp strand of pale hair flopping over one eye arrived once outside the front door he gave me a conspiratorial look i dont know if youre the one i should go to but lately arnolds been trying to tell me something i swear he has what sort of something you know about rheaher dying like that well of course it was a stupid accident but its odd how arnolds changed like he used to love paul but lately he just goes quiet when paul comes in the room arnold watches him weirdlike if you get what i mean and then arnold looks at me what do you think hes trying to tell you im not sure he glanced around furtively gotta go gary went i climbed into my car feeling a bit weirdlike myself i couldnt shake the idea that arnold had tried to tell me something too something bad earlier id seen dr stanley evers veterinary surgeon to the starsarnold was one of his most valuable celebrity clientsso i had everything i needed to write my report for frogmartin frogmartin flye turning off sunset boulevard i got my customary little thrill when i drove through the gates and past the sign reading kendall creeling investigative services i still had thousands of hours of supervision ahead of me plus an exam but one day id become a fully fledged pi and be worthy of my dads company our building was a pseudospanish house converted into offices i still wasnt quite used to its pinkish ocher color but i rather liked the black brassstudded front door gday melodie i said to our receptionistat least until her acting career took off green eyes wide melodie gave a practiced swirl of her long blond hair kylie its real urgent not mum again my mother was always trying to persuade me to return to the outback and help her run the pub no not your mom its lonnie julia roberts has been in his room for the fourth time this week he says hes desperate this time he means ithes calling the authorities i was outraged what and have her taken away just because he sneezes lonnie says its impacting his quality of life hes real serious kylie she clasped her hands and added soulfully he says its him or julia roberts as we were speaking julia roberts herself sauntered into view her tawny tail held high she was followed by the plump indignant form of lonnie moore our technical wizard and sufferer of severe feline allergies jules have you been wicked again i asked her you know very well youre not supposed to go into lonnies office julia roberts gave a quick contemptuous flick of her tail she never took criticism well lonnie sneezed blew his nose on a tissue he snatched from melodies desk then declared either that cat goes or i do his soft face was grim i really mean it this was a true dilemmai loved jules dearly but lonnie was absolutely invaluable to kendall creeling i had talked lonnie around before but this time his militant expression showed i had my work cut out for me injections i said lonnie looked horrified i dont want her killed just out of my hair im talking about desensitization for you its a course of injections giving you a tiny bit of what youre allergic to and your body gets used to it so you dont get a bad reaction anymore ill spring for the cost and any time off you need if you give up the idea of getting rid of jules kylie you know i dont like anything medical i cant stand the sight of blood there wont be any blood youll hardly feel a thing well melodie said helpfully and lonnie you wouldnt have to be looking out for julia roberts every moment of the day and you wouldnt be sneezing all the time and you wouldnt all right all right ill do it he glanced at julia roberts who had one foot up in the air as she washed her nethers its not that i hate her or anything its her rotten personality i swear it amuses her to torment me speaking of personality i said i was at the berkshire mansion this morning checking on arnold hes a bonzer little dog love that show melodie exclaimed larry my agent says when auditions open for the new series of professor swanns spooks he guarantees ill get a part like with my psychic abilities ill be in sync with arnold arnold is no more psychic than you are lonnie snorted hes just a dog doing whatever his trainer tells him to anyway i hear hes on the way out taking early retirement i am too psychic melodie snapped and arnolds so cute no one could replace him lonnie was an authority on showbiz gossip so he probably had the good oil i had a sinking feeling that arnold was in danger hes got a stunt double called dopp i said paul berkshire spoke very highly of him when i was there this morning lonnie smiled cynically if thats the case i dont need to be clairvoyant to predict that arnolds retirement will be a short one and when he dies the beverly hills estate and all the funds dedicated to arnolds welfare will go to berkshire the sooner the guy bumps the dog off the sooner he gets his hands on it melodie scandalized said are you saying hes going to murder arnold as long as arnold is unique and working in the biz hes raking in the dollars bigtime so berkshire can afford to wait but if arnold can be replaced its goodbye doggie i told them about arnolds change of attitude towards paul berkshire awesome said melodie impressed like its practically mystic so what about rhea i asked lonnie is it definite her death was accidental he shrugged at the time there was lots of smoke but no fire it could have been an accidentshe was a heavy drinker and could have got confused about how many sleeping tablets shed taken maybe the dog knows for sure but hes the only witness and he cant tell anyone i think hes been trying to i said im going back there right now they both stared at me premonition i announced psychic flash melodie nodded wisely i have those all the time i left lonnie chortling and marched back to my car im coming arnold i said when berkshire opened the front door he was scowling forget something fraid so i missed filling out a whole page of my checklist cant write my report until ive got all the info jesus he said cant anyone do anything right these days sorry ill only be a mo lisette he yelled over his shoulder get up here fast he beckoned me in and closed the door ill be upstairs if you want me but im not expecting you to i watched him mount the long curving stairway it was like something out of gone with the wind except of course clark gable had been even more goodlooking yes dear said lisette hurrying up to me whats wrong do you get the feeling arnolds been trying to tell you something she seemed uncomfortable its just my fancy as she spoke arnold appeared trotting down the hall towards us he had a determined focused manner and when he reached us he sat down and fixed us with an unblinking stare would arnold be telling you something about what happened to rhea lisettes lips trembled id be lying if i said i wasnt worried sick about it all i took rheas death hard wed been together for so many yearsso i think ive exaggerated things in my own mind to the point of believing arnold was a witness to murder she said the last word in a harsh whisper it was almost melodramatic the way we both looked up the stairway on cue paul berkshire appeared at the top what the hells going on arnold i said im sorry i cant do anything if only thered been someone else there to bear witness arnold shook himself as though hed been dunked in water then dipped his head at me paul berkshire had started down swearing get the hell out of here arnold sighed then shot like a furry bullet up the stairs paul berkshire yelled fuck then tumbled down a flaccid doll bouncing obscenely until he came to rest on the marble floor his neck at an unnatural angle lisette rushed over to him oh my god hes dead arnold came down at a leisurely pace stopped to sniff the corpse then came over to me i said that wasnt an accident was it arnold fair dinkum that little dog cocked his headand smiled at me lady patterlys lover by charlotte macleod wed be doing him a kindness really said gerald you do see that eleanor lady patterly ran one exquisite hand idly through the thick fair hair of her husbands steward id be doing myself one thats all that matters born beautiful spoiled rotten as a child married at twentyone to the best catch in england wife at twentythree to a helpless paralytic bored to desperation at twentyfour that in a nutshell was eleanor lady patterly when old ponsonby had retired and her husbands close friend gerald had come to manage the patterly estates eleanor had lost no time in starting an affair with him discreetly of course she cared nothing for the world but she was vain enough to care greatly for the worlds opinion of her gerald had been only too willing as handsome as eleanor was lovely he had the same total lack of scruple the same cold intelligence the same passionate devotion to his own interests he took the greatest care of his old friend roger patterlys property because he soon realized that with eleanors help he could easily make it his own it was gerald who suggested the murder the killing part is the easiest a pillow over his face a switch of medicines nothing to it the big thing is not getting caught we must make sure nobody ever suspects it wasnt a natural death well take our time prepare the groundwork wait for exactly the right moment and then my love its all ours lady patterly gazed around the drawing room with its priceless furnishings through the satindraped windows to the impeccably tended formal gardens i shall be so glad to get out of this prison well travel gerald paris greece hong kong ive always had a fancy to see hong kong they would do nothing of the kind gerald was too careful a steward not to stay and guard what would be his he only smiled and replied whatever you want my sweet it will be just too marvelous sighed the invalids wife how shall we go about it not we darling you after all it would be eleanor not he who would inherit unless he married her afterwards he hadnt the ghost of a claim and suppose she changed her mind but she wouldnt with the hold of murder over her she could be handled nicely if he were fool enough to do the job himself gerald was no fool i shall continue to be the faithful steward and you my dear will be the dutiful wife a great deal more dutiful than youve been up to now lady patterly inspected her perfect fingernails frowning what do you want me to do i want you to start showing some attention to your husband dont overdo it build it up gradually you might begin by strolling into rogers room and asking him how hes feeling but i do every morning and evening then do it again right now and stay for more than two minutes this time oh very well but its so depressing its not all jam for old roger either you know how sententious of you darling shall i hold his hand or what why dont you read to him he loathes being read to read to him anyway it will look well in front of the nurse thats our objective eleanor to create the impression of devotion among the attendants you must be able to act the bereft widow convincingly when we lose him his mistress shrugged and turned toward the stairs oh and eleanor gerald lowered his voice yet another pitch wed better postpone any further meetings until its over we mustnt take any risk whatever and dont be surprised if i start a flirtation with one of the village belles she arched one delicately pencilled eyebrow have you picked out anybody special one will do as well as another protective camouflage you know its only for a few weeks darling he turned the full force of his dazzling smile on her and went out eleanor stood for a moment looking after him it was hard on roger of course still she had her own future to think of her husband had offered her a divorce as soon as the doctors had told him the sports car smashup had left him paralyzed for life naturally she had refused it wouldnt have looked well and besides the settlement hed offered was not her idea of adequate support no she would have it all she and gerald it was clever of gerald to have found the way she arranged her features in exactly the right expression of calm compassion and went to visit her husband day by day she increased the length of time she spent in the sickroom it was less tedious than she had anticipated for one thing roger was so glad to have her there she took to bringing him little surprises some flowers a few sunwarmed strawberries from the garden she had the gramophone brought into his room and played the records they had danced to before they were married nurse wilkes beamed marble the valet scowled distrustfully eleanor found herself looking forward to her visits planning the next days surprise thinking of new ways to entertain the invalid the weeks went by and gerald began to fidget i say dont you think we ought to be getting on with it you said we mustnt rush things and she went past him into rogers room carrying a charming arrangement of varicolored roses shed got up early to pick with the dew on them as had become her habit she took up the book she was reading aloud to him and opened it to her bookmark her eye now attuned to rogers every expression caught a tightening of the muscles around his mouth she put the book down you hate being read to dont you roger its just that it makes me feel so utterly helpless but youre not theres nothing the matter with your eyes from now on youll read to yourself how can i i cant hold the book i cant turn the pages of course you can well just sit you up like this eleanor slid one arm around her husband and pulled him up nurse lets have that backrest thing there hows that she plumped a pillow more comfortably now well prop the book up on the bed table like this and lift your arm like this and slip the page between your fingers so that you can hold it yourself a pinching between the right thumb and forefinger was the only movement lord patterly could make and when youve finished with that page we just turn it over like this see youve managed it beautifully so i have he looked down at his hand as though it were something miraculous thats the first thing ive done for myself since it happened for the next half hour roger read to himself eleanor sat at his side patiently moving his hand when he signalled that he was ready helping to slide the next page into his grasp she found the monotonous task strangely agreeable for the first time in her life she was being of use to somebody else when marble brought in the patients lunch and nurse wilkes came forward to feed it to him she waved the woman away hell feed himself today thank you nurse and he did with eleanor setting a spoon between his thumb and forefinger and guiding his hand to his mouth when he dropped a morsel they laughed and tried again at last lady patterly left nurse wilkes clucking happily over a perfectly clean plate and went to get her own lunch gerald was waiting for her ive got it all figured out darling he whispered as soon as they were alone ive been reading up on digitalis the doctors been leaving it i know on account of that heart of his all we have to do is slip him an extra dose and out he goes heart failure only to be expected in a helpless paralytic to her own surprise eleanor protested he is not helpless hes handicapped rather a nice distinction in rogers case dont you think sweet anyway there we are youve only to notice which is the digitalis bottle watch your chance and slip a tablespoonful into his hot milk or whatever they give the poor bloke and what happens when nurse wilkes notices the level of the medicines gone down in the bottle not clever gerald dash it you can put in some water cant you i suppose so eleanor pushed back her chair ill have to think about it think fast my love i miss you gerald gave her his best smile but for some reason her heart failed to turn over as usual she got up im going for a walk she started off aimlessly then found herself heading toward the village it was pleasant swinging along the grassy lane feeling her legs respond to the spring of the turf under her feet roger had loved to walk for the first time since the accident eleanor felt an overwhelming surge of genuine pity for her husband she turned in at the bookshop it was mostly paperbacks and greeting cards these days but she might find something roger would enjoy now that shed found a way for him to manage a book that was rather clever of me she thought with satisfaction she liked recalling the look on rogers face the beaming approval of nurse wilkes the unbelief in old marbles eyes as he watched his lordship feeding himself there must be any number of things i could help him do she mused i wonder how one goes about them she went up to the elderly woman in charge have you any books on working with handicapped people exercises that sort of thing physical therapy miss jenkins nodded wisely i do believe there was something in that last lot of paperbacks ah yes here we are eleanor rifled through the pages this seems to be the general idea but dont you have any that go into greater detail i could always order one for you lady patterly please do then as quickly as possible of course butexcuse me lady patterlywe all understood his lordship was quite helpless he is not again eleanor was startled by her own reaction he was sitting up in bed reading by himself this morning and he ate his own lunch you cant call that helpless can you why why no indeed good gracious i can hardly believe it nurse wilkes said nurse wilkes says entirely too much snapped eleanor she would have a word with nurse wilkes she walked back slowly studying the book page by page it seemed simple enough manipulating the patients limbs massage no problem there if only they had a heated swimming pool but of course roger wouldnt be ready for that for ages yet and by then she and gerald gerald was getting a bit puffy about the jawline shed noticed it at lunch those big beefy men were apt to go to flesh early he ought to start exercising too no earthly good suggesting it to him gerald made rather a point of being the dominant male roger was much more reasonable to deal with he was positively boyish about the exercises when the doctor dropped around for his daily visit he found them hard at it roger pinching on to eleanors finger while she swung his arm up and down see doctor hes holding on beautifully shes going to have me up out of this in a matter of weeks the doctor looked from one to the other there was color in lord patterlys face for the first time since the accident he had never seen her ladyship so radiant why should he tell them it was hopeless life had been hard enough on that young pair anyway who knew there was always the off chance the long bed rest had allowed some of the damaged nerve endings to mend themselves by all means go on as youre doing he said just take it a bit slowly at first remember that little heart condition eleanor suddenly thought of gerald and the digitalis her face became a mask ill remember she said tonelessly her husband laughed oh nonsense everybodys got these idiotic heart murmurs my father had and he lived to seventynine gerald has and look at him shoots swims rides all that gerald had better watch himself said the doctor he picked up his bag well the patient appears to be in good hands youre doing splendidly lady patterly splendidly dont be discouraged if progress is a little slow these things take time you know time said lord patterly is something of which we have plenty havent we darling his wife smoothed his pillow yes roger all the time in the world ill leave you to it then the doctor moved toward the door watch his pulse nurse give the prescribed injection of digitalis if it seems advisable after the exercises you keep the hypodermic ready of course all in order doctor right here on the medicine tray if need arises gerald was right eleanor thought as she gently kneaded the wasted muscles of her husbands arms it would be easy too easy she drew the covers up over him there thats enough for now i dont want to wear you out the first day shall i put on some music please she had taken to playing the classical records he liked it whiled away the time for her too sitting beside the bed letting the long waves of melody sweep over her daydreaming of all the things she would do when she was free today however she found her mind dwelling on more homely pictures miss jenkinss face when shed dropped her little bombshell at the bookshop the doctors when hed found her giving her husband therapy her husbands now as he lay with his eyes closed the long afternoon shadows etching his features in sharp relief he was as goodlooking as ever in spite of everything that jaw would never be blurred by fat what would it be like living in this house without roger she tried to imagine it and could not after dinner the following evening gerald suggested a walk youre looking peaked eleanor neednt stay cooped up with your patient forever you know his double meaning was plain she rose and followed him out the french windows to the terrace rather an inspiration of yours that therapy thing what do you mean easy enough to overdo a bit make the heart attack more plausible eh she did not answer he went on confident of his power over her you were right about the digitalis i decided ive thought of something even better potassium chloride i was a hospital laboratory technician once you know one of the jobs i batted around in after they turned me down for the army rum when you come to think of it i mean if it hadnt been for my wheezing heart i shouldnt have drifted into this post and if it werent for rogers i shouldnt be getting promoted shall we say anyway getting back to the potassium chloride its reliable stuff absolutely undetectable do an autopsy and all you find is a damaged heart and an increased potassium rate exactly what youd expect after a fatal coronary attack gerald must you this is no time to turn squeamish eleanor especially since its you wholl be giving it dont be a fool how could i oh i dont mean directly well let nurse wilkes do that she keeps a hypodermic of digitalis on the bedside table ready to give him a quick jab if he needs it how did you know that im the dear old pal remember ive been a lot more faithful about visiting roger than you ever were until your recent excess of wifely devotion nurse wilkes and i are great chums i can imagine men like gerald were always irresistibleto servant girls and barmaids and plain middleaged nurses and rich women who thought they had nothing better to do i took careful note of the type of hypodermic syringe she uses gerald went on yesterday when i was in london i bought one just like it at one of the big medical supply houses along with some potassium chloride and a few other things so it wouldnt look too obvious id dropped in beforehand to visit some of my old pals at the hospital and pinched a lab coat with some convincing acid holes in it wore it to the shop and they never dreamed of questioning me i ditched it in a public lavatory and got rid of the rest of the stuff in various trash bins on my way back to the station you think of everything dont you gerald eleanors throat was dry have to my love so here we are i give you the doings all ready for use you watch your chance tomorrow morning and switch the syringes then you put old roger through his paces till he works up a galloping pulse back off and let nurse take over and get ready to play the shattered widow the stuff works in a couple of minutes and then this is all ours its all ours now

times well have on dear old rogers money you dont plan to spend the rest of your life in that bedroom do you no said eleanor i dont her mind was forming pictures of roger being carried down to a couch on the terrace to get the sun of roger being pushed around the garden in a wheelchair of roger taking his first steps on crutches and someday of roger and herself walking together where she and gerald were walking now it would happen she knew it would because this was what she wanted most in all the world and she always got what she wanted very well gerald she replied give me the syringe come down into the shrubbery first so we cant be seen from the house she hesitated its full of wasps down there he laughed and steered her toward the dense screen of bushes once hidden he took the hypodermic out of his pocket here you are be sure to handle it with your handkerchief as im doing so you wont leave any fingerprints now have you got it all straight yes gerald she said i know exactly what to do good then youd better go back to the house and tuck roger in for the night ill stroll around the grounds awhile longer we mustnt be seen going back together he blew her a kiss and turned to leave wait gerald said eleanor sharply dont move theres a wasp on the back of your neck well swat it cant you lady patterlys hand flashed up oh too late sorry that was clumsy of me did it sting you badly she left him rubbing his neck and walked easily across the terrace the hypodermic barrel felt pleasantly smooth in her hand she lingered a moment by the garden well idly dropping pebbles and listening to them plop into the water far below if one plop was slightly louder than the rest there was nobody but herself around to hear it she went in to her husband how are you feeling tonight roger like a man again eleanor you dont know what youve done for me she slipped a hand over his no more than a wife should my darling would you like to read for a while no just stay with me i want to look at you they were sitting together in the gathering twilight when the gamekeeper and his son brought geralds body back to the house how strange eleanor observed to the doctor a short time later he mentioned his heart again this evening it kept him out of the army he told me but im afraid i didnt take him all that seriously he always looked so healthy thats always the way said the doctor its these big hearty chaps that go in a flash now his lordship will probably live to be ninety lady patterly smoothed back her husbands hair with a competent hand yes she replied i dont see any reason why he shouldnt not just the facts by annette meyers a possible homicide they call it the high line its an elevated meadow that rises some thirty feet above the streets of chelsea on the far west side of manhattan in the spring and summer the high line is a rich blanket of green dotted with wildflowers when francine gold goes missing it is here among the wildflowers on a sunny june afternoon that her body is found the high line used to be a railroad route running from gansevoort street in the meatpacking district all the way to th street and the tracks are still visible cutting through the flora that has grown around them people climbed the mound and strolled through the meadow marveling that such a wonderful place existed in the city so the city after much debate about tearing it down actually listened to the protests decided to convert the high line into a public park and closed it to the public pending renovation now of course as happens in new york architects and landscape experts are being consulted without end and there is no sign that any work will be done on the project in the near future this being the case were it not for chopper the wnys weather and traffic helicopter doing a sweep to report on sailboating traffic on the hudson this summer morning decomposition would have been more extensive what a sight let me tell you its a great day for the tall ships chopper pilot phil vigiani reports just enough wind to fill those beautiful sails boy oh boy wouldnt you like to be tacking the mainsheet right now i would he smiles at the photo of jen and the twins propped next to the

in a tiny onebedroom apartment on th and th part of the penn south houses a middleincome housing development she and walter her nineyearold calico she realizes she loves more than she did her late husband for whom the cat was named the high line is very much part of the neighborhood shed buy a rotisserie chicken make biscuits and potato salad walter would pick up a bottle of wine and theyd have a nice picnic up there in the tall grass it was like being in another world but that was a long time ago walter was gone and she was no spring chicken anymore though she still had her wits about her and the new copper color shed washed into her hair looked really nice if it was a body up there how had it gotten there the high line was closed off till the city got around to renovating it heck its new york anyone who wants to get somewhere bad enough finds a way she hears and sees on her screen that phil vigiani is connected to the th precinct on west th in short order the areas going to be crawling with cops firemen and emts doris disconnects freeing the line for another call the th precinct the th precinct is an oldfashioned limeandbrownstone precinct building on west th street betweenth and th avenues you cant miss it because of the large number of unmarked and radio cars plus suvs slantparked on the sidewalk in front of the house which pisses off some of the environmentally conscious locals not so much the parking all over the sidewalk so you cant walk but all those gasguzzling suvs with no thought to global warming the precinct covers a wide area from chelsea into hells kitchen combining both a large commercial industrial area and varying socioeconomic multiethnic residential communities including three housing projects fulton houses chelseaelliot houses and penn south houses the precinct houses claim to fame is that it was featured in the film the naked city the cops officers mirabel castro a twentyeightyearold redheaded latina with a nice

high line see if you can round up a few witnesses she eyes the gathering group of the curious held back by the wooden horses and yellow tape strung around by the patrol officers lets get some additional personnel here to make nice with the crowd and maybe come up with something valuable molly rosen slides the latex gloves on heatswollen hands and ties the booties over the black pumps which have begun to pinch she opens the gate and climbs the rattling stairs shes sweating buckets doesnt like that she has to stop at the top to catch her breath for chrissakes and to quiet her stomach her

listen to the jabber not him when he gets to the top of the stairs the sun bakes right down on him its an oven up here the body is going to stink something awful the corruption difficult give him a winter body anytime the crime scene the meadow is green almost lush in the late morning heat the sun is high and there are no clouds to offset the glare a faint breeze barely moves the blades of tall grass and the wildflowers the footfalls of the fire marshal and the two emts are unmistakable marking a passage of approximately twenty feet from the top of the stairs to the body it is understood that this may have obscured the path left by the killer should this prove to be a homicide because of this probability the body has been left uncovered scattered along the way from the top of the stairs to the body are various articles of clothing a black tshirt lying on a clump of daisylike wildflowers black pants and a stained white blazer closer to the body a lacy black bra and black bikini panties tossed to the right and to the left noriega marks each spot the vic is female late twenties early thirties slim long blond hair her eyes halfopen slits one side of her face obscured by dried brown blood purple bruising she is naked brutally beaten rigor has set in noriega snaps dozens of pictures of the vic from all angles then circles around taking care where he steps taking more photos of the area he narrowly misses tripping over an empty wine bottle wine bottle empty mark it he drops a marker slings his camera over his shoulder and sketches out the scene in his notepad the air reeks with decomposing body smells molly rosen steps aside so larry vander roon can get to the body she calls down to the patrol officers i want the body isolated and this whole area of the high line

at the concierge desk sorting mail the desk is actually a broad marble counter closed in above and on each side of the opening she reaches up and right and left putting residents mail in their boxes this is the most boring part of her job which she has held for three years but tips are frequent and it is particularly nice at christmas because the sixteen units of the condo are owned by very successful people and they are generous maybe more so because she knows all their secrets and she likes it that way she has the title concierge but basically she runs the place vasili the super is an albanian immigrant whose every response is no problem but hes a good worker and doesnt get in her face like the last one the superstud from ecuador who thought he was gods gift to women vasili handles three condo buildings on the block and lives with his wife and two children in an apartment in the one across the street susan kims parents are immigrants theyd like her to go back to teaching once

always giving her things like last week these black leather boots she swings one slim leg out flexes her foot elegant the boutique guys wife works long hours as a neurologist shes a cold snoot so susan has no sympathy for her when the husband brings models to the apartment some days the outside door opens and a tall woman in a white shirt and black linen pants comes in shes practically

connie begins to cry like she was saying goodbye the interviews part v detectives molly rosen and greg noriega arrive at east st street in the midst of crashing thunder and violent flashes of lightning just as they enter the building rain comes down in big splats they show the doorman their ids detectives molly rosen and greg noriega here to see mr robert malkin greg says apartment b hes

painters just left for the day bellas in the kitchen we can talk there i tell you i knew something was wrong with the whole escrow business hes not normally a paranoid person and norman has such a

what did you and francine gold talk about last week mr malkin why the fraud she said she didnt know anything about it she just collected the checks and gave them to norman for the escrow account youre not explaining it right robby bella says she slides the rugalach onto a metal rack norman lives in this building were having so much trouble with the plumbing here leaky pipes and the landlord does nothing no matter how much we complain so norman suggested a rent strike for a year weve done it norman set up an escrow account and we all give our rent checks to ms gold now the landlord wants to sell the building hell make all the repairs if we pay him the back rent his lawyer drew up the papers and if the landlord doesnt keep his end of the bargain by a certain date he will have to pay us a lot of money so we asked norman for the money in the escrow account and hes been putting us off for three months the fact is we are pretty sure now there never was an escrow account ms gold was very upset malkin says she said she would find our money but i didnt wait i notified the district attorneys office the suspects adam golds alibi sticks detective molly rosen says shes still got the morning

paperback called final exit molly covers her pretzel with mustard and takes a bite aces shes got her appetite back ninjettes by kate flora i was threading my way between cars in the dark garage when a man coming toward me said hey looks like you dropped something i stopped to see what id dropped before i recognized this as a classic attacker approach he was beefy and unshaven out of place in this upscale mall lot and his expression was an ugly mix of smirk and lust i checked out escape routes transferred my packages to one hand and got my keys ready he was close enough for me to smell tobacco and old spice as i clicked the lock and tossed in my packages keeping the car between us dont come any closer youre making me uncomfortable i said he grinned and flexed his fingers like a strangler warming up i jumped in my car stabbing the door lock as i jammed it into reverse he was right behind me fist raised his face demonic in the red and yellow glare of the lights i hit the gas and he became a dark blur as he dove out of my way as i braked and shifted i glanced back he crouched there like some malevolent animal shaking his shaggy head i reminded myself to breathe my selfdefense instructors words in my head dont worry about whether hes hurt whats important is your own safety keep moving get yourself out of there if youre breathing you can react i shook all the way home a postadrenaline chill that went right to my bones inside i dumped my packages on the table and undid my coat with shaking hands then snapped on the oven and pulled out a rotisserie chicken and salad stuff for dinner from behind his science magazine karl made an incomprehensible sound i thought i was fine until i stopped in cassies room she lasered my face with her sharp adolescent eyes mom what happened nothing honey there was just this creepy guy in the parking garage who are you okay i nodded did you tell dad i shook my head cassie pulled the ipod buds from her ears you need tea blessed are those who have daughters later as i hurried past karl snug as a bear in his new recliner he glanced over his copy of nature off to your ninjettes class sure am sweetie i said tonight were practicing plucking peoples heads off karl would have to help bobby our fifteenyearold who often got stuck on geometry and cassie who was struggling with college essays as both required handson assistance hed have to leave his chair and go act like a parent communication is my specialty five days a week i visit schools and community groups around the state helping parents and teenagers learn to communicate more effectively im good at helping people talk to each other youd think i could make it happen at home but karls developed an invisible shield that deflects my words like armor his conversation these days is mostly demands or complaints as though as his body gets wider his mind gets narrower they say women tend to marry their fathers my mother used to roll her eyes at my fathers constant demands and mutter maybe it would be different if he were winston churchill sometimes studying the back of karls magazine i wondered if mrs churchill was lonely too i probably sound bitter im not its just frustrating to have good communication skills and be such a failure at home lately ive been feeling desperately fragile between karl the house two teenagers and a job im stretched so far i feel like im teetering on a window ledge it was good to get out for something besides errands and work i punched the on button and got seeger and springsteen the last song i played was a cher song about jesse james the idea of a woman like me sending some arrogant studlet down in flames always left me smiling my ninjettes class as karl called it was actually a rad or rape aggression defense class offered by our local police department it was as much common sense and safety precaution as martial arts and selfdefense my friend katie talked me into it saying she didnt want to make an ass of herself alone but katies a tough lawyer whos good on her feet and looks like you wouldnt want to mess with her so i wondered if shed done it for me she always says i should get out more it was a sensible step for me increasingly i found myself in farflung parts of the state crossing scary parking lots at night when i was standing in a gym with a bunch of nervous suburban ladies our training had seemed distant and theoretical but today at the mall it had been just what id needed tonight we were practicing everything wed learned police officers in their aggressor suits were going to mug us and we were going to fight them off in the female officers locker room my classmates clustered around natalie burke natalie was a bigeyed slender brunette the kind of woman you think you wont like because shes too damned attractive she had perky implants while we were scooping up our saggy middleaged breasts and repackaging them with underwire and padding a sculpted body with visible muscles and a frightening amount of energy while we dragged our sorry asses into the gym each week mumbling our responses like a gaggle of middle schoolers natalie hit the floor with singeing intensity she wiped away tears and streaks of mascara while two women stroked her back and murmured comfort as i joined them katie whispered her husband just left her for a twentyfiveyearold i felt the instinctive anger i always felt at these stories karl still attractive despite the spread was unlikely ever to leave me its hard to get entangled with young honeys if you spend your life in your lab your car and your chair there were young lab assistants but anyone expecting halfdecent treatment soon left unless they were as obsessed with lipids as karl was he looked to be the exception though lately a lot of husbands were trading in their wives for younger models i could imagine someone youthobsessed leaving me my minds nice and tight but from shoulder to knee im soft as the pillsbury doughgirl natalie though was fit and gorgeous nor did the timing make sense theyd just moved into a new house i knew because every week she related another construction disaster he just natalies husky voice quivered came home one day and said he was moving on standing in the kitchen right in front of the children he says hes finally found someone who truly understands him who makes him feel young again she drew a shuddering breath who wouldnt feel younger if they didnt have to worry about homework sports schedules teacher conferences plumbers investments and finding a retirement community for his cranky mother her workout shoes slapped the dingy tile ive been understanding him for twentyfive years twentyfive years of bullying the cleaner about his shirts of running in from tball games and showering off baby spit after moving heaven and earth to get a sitter so i could meet him for dinner in boston looking glamorous a quarter century of dancing to his damned piper and he dumps me its just not fair she jerked off her wedding band and threw it across the room twenty years as a gym fanatic because he noticed every ounce i gained well fuck him the shiny gold spun like a dancer on the tile then disappeared between two lockers the room was so quiet i could hear the small clang of metal on stone as it fell natalie snatched a headband from her bag tied back her hair and pushed up her sleeves those cops better watch out because i am mad as hell and i have got to take it out on somebody whats his name katie asked sterling she said can you believe it his name is sterling infected by her anger we followed her into the gym lively for once and it made a difference when i shouted no i meant it when i punched and kicked it was in earnest i was thinking about the guy in the garage how id hated it that some creep could get his kicks terrifying me i got a real rush channeling my fear and anger into positive action using my breath to keep from getting rattled focusing my energy into a selfprotective response i wasnt alone the whole class was responding to the idea of men acting badly when the massive cop in the aggressor suit approached natalie i saw surprise and respect through the bars of his mask as she stomped kicked and punched him to the floor then it was my turn when we started the course i couldnt bring myself to shout i said no in such a quiet voice i wouldnt have deterred a threeyearold over the weeks my no had stopped sounding like an invitation to try again tonight i roared when natalie knocked that guy down and stomped the hell out of him i was on my feet with the rest of the class yelling yes it was one thing to cheer the others on another to face this guy myself even if he was limping a little and not showing his earlier gusto he was nearly twice my size and probably half my age when i began my nonchalant stroll across the gym i felt the same clenching fear id felt in the parking garage but nothing happened i was almost across the room when a fat gloved hand snaked around from behind and grabbed me i jabbed my elbow back hard as i seized his hand and spun around jerking him toward me i slapped his ear with one hand while snapping a kick toward his crotch breathe i whispered breathe maybe hed had enough because he grabbed my kicking leg and dropped me hard i scrambled back planted my hands behind me and kicked out at him snapping good hard kicks at his grabbing hands then a second guy grabbed my shoulders pressing me down i gave a sudden sideways roll and got my feet under me but as they moved in together i cast the rules of the exercise aside natalie help me instantly she was beside me her feet braced and her hands up in protective assertive fists i curled my hands into fists of my own and shoulder to shoulder we faced them back off keep away from me i growled the new man lunged no way i screamed jerking his arm so that he flew past as he regained his balance i should have run that was the point of the exercise but id called on natalie for help while my guy was still turning i rushed her attacker and hauled him off i grabbed her hand and we raced for the door giggling like tweens crossing the black safety line just before they reached us thanks i said hugging her you can be on my team anytime ditto i always forget that part about running i want to stay and fight for a moment she looked sad was she thinking about her marriage how you cant stay and fight if the other persons walked out and wont even give you a chance sometimes they dont give you a chance when they stay around i settled onto the hard wooden bleachers the exercise had left me feeling positive that id been able to assert myself but although it was only an exercise and id always been safe id felt genuine fear real vulnerability powerful anger toward my attackers something about that had stirred up memories of other scary times id had a blind date once where the guy had gotten drunk and violent instead of driving me home hed parked on a dark side street and tried to rape me id ended up running shoeless down an icy january sidewalk my blouse torn rescued by a kindly police officer about my dads age hed wrapped me in his creaky leather jacket given me tissues and told me that it wasnt my fault repeating it in his certain gravelly voice until i almost believed him that wasnt the only thing but it was the worst i wanted to live in a world where women didnt have to worry about things like this where i wouldnt be thinking that i should send my soontobecollegebound daughter to this class where people resolved their differences with language but who was i kidding i couldnt make language work in my own home and i was not naïve this class had helped with the man in the parking garage as long as there were men who got their kicks making women uncomfortable who didnt respect boundaries we needed to be responsible for our own safety when the two female officers whod run the class asked how we felt they got a chorus of great and incredible until they got to me i told them about my mixed feelings how i felt all jumbled up katie agreed and natalie and another woman named sandy whod had an even harder time yelling and being assertive the officers offered sympathy but seemed annoyed which annoyed me right back i get impatient with people who want approved answers instead of truth as we filed into the parking lot i said hey katie got time for a glass of wine katie looked surprised shed asked before and i always said no id fallen into a pattern of rushing home there was always so much to do and i could never be certain karl had paid attention to bobbys homework tonight though i wanted company sounds good she said i turned to natalie got time for a drink she checked her watch then tossed her head sure why not from somewhere to my left sandy said mind if i join you i could use a drink it felt odd going into the pub alone id never been there without karl and the kids when you were riding herd on coats hats mittens absentminded spouses or moody teens and outbreaks of sibling war you didnt notice ambiance you noticed how fast the service was tonight i saw beyond the menu and the popcorn i noticed how homey and inviting the hanging tin lamps were i saw all the laughing guys with their pregnant bellies pressed against the bar not one of whom probably worried about homework or whether he looked fat the smell of food made me hungry enough to order a burger instead of salad and to eat the fries instead of leaving them even natalie was tucking into a great big burger i used to think it was just guys she said but sometimes a woman needs a big hunk of meat sandy choked on her wine i meant the burger we discussed our reactions to the course sandy and katie telling stories of clients whod been unbalanced and menacing yet as i drank wine and ate forbidden food i realized i was having fun i liked sandys insightful comments katies punchy iconoclasm even natalie despite her brittleness and desperate sadness was a nice person to spend time with i admired her concern with protecting her kids from their fathers neglect and bad behavior if you dont mind my asking katie said did you have any idea your husband was seeing someone katie does a lot of domestic work natalie shrugged i was trying not to see it but it was there there was this company dinner a few months ago the bimboher names tiffanywas wearing a skimpy dress very inappropriate for a business dinner she kept coming up and sticking her chest in his face at the time i thought it was pitiful and wished someone would set her straight so she didnt embarrass herself she pushed a lonely ketchupdaubed fry around her plate on the way home i suggested sterling get one of the older women to give her some tips he said it was just that she was so young laughing you know like we were the grownups and needed to be understanding dammit she dropped her fork onto the plate now hes sleeping with her and im still supposed to be understanding katie whose nose was slightly pink signaled the waitress and ordered another glass of wine natalie checked her watch againkids at home and no spouse for backupand got one too sandy said what the heck i didnt want to be the only sober one so i caved the extra wine led to a brownie sundae and four spoons we were deep into chocolate when natalies phone rang excuse me its my son she flipped it open and turned away she listened then said he what tonight why didnt you call me there were more staccato questions her head tipped to catch the answers over the bar noise until she said oh honey i know that was hard but you did just right ill be home soon she snapped the phone shut goddamn that man goddamn him goddamn her hes lucky i dont have a gun she burst into tears sandy pushed a small packet of pink tissues with valentine hearts into natalies hand what did he do dear she asked her soft faintly southern voice invited confidence he showed up at the house tonight knowing id be at class i changed the locks see after he left i guess he thought he could talk his way in if it was just the kids her eyes traveled around the table to see if we understood he didnt come to see them he hasnt spoken to them since he moved out not even a call on sammys birthday he came to get our financial records for his lawyer she hissed the word lawyer like the guy was a real snake probably was when my sister divorced she had a snake she said it made all the difference my lawyer said dont give him anything until weve made copies she drained her glass that isnt the worst of it either he brought her with him to your house when the kids were home and you were out katie said thats really low the kids were good though they wouldnt let him in so he banged around in the garage and the mudroom then left she drummed on the table with her fists id like to beat his head in katie grinned in that manic way she does after a little wine what about her head why is she off the hook shes not some innocent seduced by the wicked wolf she went after a man she knew was married i mean shed met you for heavens sake anyone with any values knows thats wrong now shes showing up at the house to rub all of your noses in it whatever happened to discretion for that matter whatever happened to shame it does take two to tango sandy said yeah i agreed all these weeks weve been going to class learning how not to be a victim how to assert ourselves in threatening situations whats more threatening than someone out to destroy your marriage and whos doing the threatening she is natalie brightened i know where she lives what kind of car she drives and she never stays all night at his hotel howd you learn all that katie asked you hire a detective natalie nodded so what are we waiting for my voice cut through their wows maybe we should have a talk with the young lady point out the error of her ways i try to speak like an educated woman but i love clunky old clichés like the error of her ways and as we know alcohol lowers inhibitions they responded to my modest suggestion like id yelled charge we paid the check natalie called her kids by the time we were in the parking lot i was having second thoughts im a facilitator not an instigator and despite the meal company and restorative wine i was still jumbled i wasnt even sure why id made my crazy suggestion maybe we should rethink this i said what do we do when we get there no way its brilliant katie said its not like natalies going to beat this girls head in why shouldnt she have a chance to say how she feels thats all were going for put that way it sounded absolutely reasonable ill drive sandy said ive got a good head for wine if this were a movie wed have jumped into something big shiny and black probably been wearing leather too or navy blue fbistyle jackets with ninjettes in goldenrod letters and stilettos but this was a quiet suburban town and we were a clump of slightly tipsy matrons we all piled into her subaru wagon natalie took the front to navigate katie and i dumped ll bean canvas totes an umbrella rain boots south beach snack bars and assorted audiobooks into the back and fastened our seat belts this was either going to be fun or a monumental disaster tiffany lived on the first floor of a threedecker on a quiet cambridge street we found a parking space just one house away and waited trees just leafing out overhead were a soft yellow green under the streetlights and the air coming in the open windows had the earthy scent of spring i dont see her car natalie whispered shes got one of those mini cooper things a yellow convertible that would be hard to miss katie said last time she came back around eleven natalie said shed better come soon my oldest wont go to bed until im back last time sandy said natalie have you done this before i came once thinking id talk to her but i lost my nerve i hope she didnt see you katie said nope there could have been sixteen muggers in the bushes and she just went tripping past in wobbly little heels paying no attention to anything ill tell you i could have everybody duck sandy said theres a car coming katie and i nearly knocked heads as we squinched down in the small backseat if it was tiffany she must have been driving about one mile an hour i had a crick in my neck by the time sandy whispered its her now what do we do natalie talks to her i said natalie stays in the car she knows natalie katie said the three of us will do the talking i thought i was going to talk to her natalie said isnt that why we came mmm but ive been thinking katie said youre in a divorce you want to keep right on your side you dont want her getting a restraining order claiming youve been stalking her do you i never thought of that shes getting out of the car sandy hissed then what are we waiting for i popped upright and grabbed my door handle we were here and the facts hadnt changedthis young woman was causing natalie and her kids so much pain we might as well do it tiffany wore a short skirt pink cashmere bolero over a lacy lowcut camisole and cute little pink highheeled mules with black polka dots the purse slung over her shoulder big enough to house a small rhino held a matching pink tennis racket her multicolored hair hung in an expensively nonchalant shag and her lips gleamed like pavement on a rainy night she didnt look much older than cassie it was tragic how when girls were young and naturally lovely they slathered themselves with makeup tiffany sandy spoke in a ladylike unthreatening voice the girls vaguely sullen yeah reminded me of my own teenagers do i know you sandy shook her head we wanted to speak with you about your affair dear affair tiffany gave a little bark what affair she clutched the giant satchel closer to her side dismissing us with a scornful look not that its any of your business one of my mothers clichés dont judge a book by its cover pressed to get out we probably didnt look like much three middleaged women in baggy workout clothes and clean white gym shoes but katie was president of the local bar association sandy had won awards for her work with traumatized children and i spent my life teaching parents and teens to communicate about issues of trust and honesty and taking responsibility for your choices about risky things like drugs sex alcohol and speed what i did saved lives your affair with sterling burke i said family relationships matter tiffany when you disrupt a marriage and come between a father and his children thats not only selfish its immoral did you ever consider that she tilted her head in an icantbelievethisisreallyhappening gesture youre joking right she said i mean seriously you didnt tootle in from the suburbs to talk to me about morality she gave a disdainful sniff a fanny about the size of two softballs twitching under her abbreviated skirt look if some pathetic woman cant hold on to her husband thats not my problem this little lightweight had a lot of nerve calling natalie pathetic it was hard to raise kids run a house hold a job and sustain a marriage i held on to my temper and tried to explain but sleeping with a married man is a problem tiffany it interferes with important established relationships sterlings relationship with his wife his relationship with his four children i said in some states you know alienation of affection and adultery are still crimes i studied the peaceful city street the uneven brick sidewalks and budding trees such an unlikely place for me to be climbing onto a soapbox before you started this affair did you consider the pain you were inflicting on his family or whether you have the capacity and willingness to be a competent stepmother stepmother oh please she rolled her eyes brown eyes a lot like natalies i am so not interested in children im what twentyfive natalie can take care of them her selfsatisfied smile revealed unnaturally white teeth im taking care of him now why dont you three witches fly back to the suburbs and stir your cauldrons or something ive had a busy evening and im tired if this is about natalies husband sandy whispered to me why are you so angry before i could answer katie said you stop right there tiffany theres more at stake here than just what you want there are four kids who love their dad who miss him a woman who loves her husband and i dont care tiffany tossed her glossy hair if she didnt want him straying she should have been a better wife she should have paid attention to his needs instead of spending his money on fancy houses and bringing all those brats he didnt want into the world the subaru door slammed we sensibly got out of the way as natalie marched up to tiffany landed an openhanded slap on her ear ran a foot down her shin stomped on her foot and then sweeping her feet out dumped her onto the pavement tiffanys purse landed with such a thud it might have held bowling balls she wore the surprised look of a baby who has suddenly fallen onto a diapered bottom you hurt me she said you had no right having my husband leave hurt too natalie said and you had no right the girl pulled her bag toward her protectively you leave me alone she said what goes on between me and sterlie is not your business sterlie sterlie oh man i cannot believe you since when is my husband not my business natalie stood hands on her hips breathing like a runner in recovery then she straightened all right ill go before i do though lets be clear tiffany had wrapped her arms around her purse waiting for us to leave little white ipod wires ran from her ears and she tilted her head to unheard music natalie jerked on the wire unplugging her in a gesture we all understood if you take my husband you keep him she said theres no sending him back when you realize what a big baby he is and even if he says he didnt want them sterling is the father of four because he insisted we have four they need time with their dad so you get the kids all the kids every other weekend school vacations and half the summer no lastminute cancellations no weaseling out and the dog comes with the kids so i hope you like dogs i hate dogs i hate kids tiffany said sterlie and me are not into any of that she scrambled to her feet and was edging away tough shit natalie said hey wait a minute is that my tennis racket natalie snatched at the bag pulling out the racket she pointed at the name engraved on the handle you steal my racket and its none of my business my property isnt my business she swung the racket catching tiffany neatly on her cute little ass remembering to follow through which i never did upending the bag she dumped out a pink ipod pink visor and wristbands and a pair of pink and white tennis shoes sterlie gave me those tiffany said my ipod my clothes my shoes my racket all the stuff from my tennis bag natalie drove her backward with vicious swings of the racket goddammit what were you thinking it wasnt enough to steal my husband and leave my kids without a father you had to steal my things too you had to know they werent his tiffany looking stricken pressed a knuckle against her trembling lip this was what i talked to teenagers about all the timehad they considered the consequences of their choices and were they willing to accept those consequences natalie swung the racket past the pert little nose with admirable control i said what were you thinking he wanted me to have them tiffany sounded like she was about to cry he was so embarrassed that his own children wouldnt let him in when he just wanted to get some papers it was really unpleasant he knew i felt uncomfortable so he gave me this stuff to make me feel better ill show you uncomfortable natalie swung toward tiffanys head as i stepped between them youre crazy you know tiffany scrabbled for a cell phone im calling the police you belong in jail im not sure you want to do that i said worried that wed helped natalie commit an assault i looked to katie who shook her head were all witnesses that natalie found tiffany in possession of over a thousand dollars worth of her property she said tiffanys a thief and thats a felony even if mr burke gave it to her he stole it and she was there that makes her an accessory and a receiver of stolen property katie turned toward me as though i was the leader of this group anything else my mind was a jumble of thoughts about relationships the common decency we owed each other and sorrow that someone so young could be so selfish and could wreak so much havoc without any thought i also knew why i was so angry and who i was angry at guys who defaulted on their marriage contracts and the women who actively or passively aided and abetted them including myself my words rolled out tiffany what you want is not all that matters you and sterling arent alone in this relationship the choices you make have consequences for five other people youre not an innocent party youre an active player in your own life you have to take responsibility for the choices you make dont assume you can hurt people terribly and walk away untouched natalie and sandy and katie flanked me like we were a real team their approving glances saying i was making real sense this wasnt just about tiffany and sterling and natalie it was about making considered choices and taking action when things werent right i might still be jumbled but some of the right things had been shaken loose tiffany looked down at the open cell phone in her hand felony katie said tiffany snapped the phone shut shoved it in her purse and went inside wow thank you all natalie said i never thought id get all this from a selfdefense course neither had i ninjettes rock i said we highfived and walked back to the subaru the peoples way by eve k sandstrom the worst part was that rogar was trying to be kind you must see that there is no other way he said the baby has to die amaya pulled her legs up against her chest and laid her head on her knees shaping her body into a coconut she had no more words if she spoke again the tears inside would spill onto the huts sandy floor and the hard coconut husk she was using to conceal herself would crack all her fears and her griefs and longings would be revealed to this man she did not understand and to the strange people of his clan she turned her face away from rogar she stroked the back of the tiny girl sleeping on the grass mat rogar spoke again its not just my people who do this it was the same on your island amaya didnt move but she felt the air pass over her and she knew rogar had gestured angrily elosa says there is not enough for my clan to eat he said if we had plenty we could keep your sisters child but we dont have food for her she can share my food amaya said softly no you would become weak you should bear our own child and we need you to work you must remain strong rogar put his hand on her arm amaya did not pull away she barely felt his touch on her coconut shell arm did the arm feel rough and hard to him is it kind to keep the little one if we cannot feed her rogar said is it kind to keep the little one if the other women here hate her if she will be an outcast in this clan no its better to put her in the water now better for her better for you better for all of us he paused but amaya still hid behind her hard outer husk the silence grew between them rogar sounded despairing when he finally spoke we cannot oppose elosa she is the one who decides amaya spoke then and elosa hates me dont be foolish amaya did not answer what purpose was there in arguing with this man whom she knew so little yet who had power over her over the little one she had thought she loved him but he would not listen after another long silence rogar stood up im sorry amaya its decided ill take the baby into the water as soon as its light he walked softly from the hut into the darkness amaya sat motionless if she moved her husk would crack she kept her hand on the sleeping baby little tani all amaya had left of her sister of her own clan of her own home on the westward island if only if only she had not left there amaya had liked rogars looks as soon as he and his friends had come to her island bringing dried fish and cloth to trade he was strong and wellmade with broad shoulders he had smiled at her she had been flattered that such a handsome man had liked her and he had come from afar if she went with rogar she could see other islands meet new clans she had been pleased when he offered her uncle a brideprice her uncle hesitated but amaya made it clear that she wanted him to accept rogar as her husband her uncle had said yes and she had willingly gone with rogar to his own island then she had met elosa elosa had hated amaya from the moment she stepped on the shore of the lagoon and as shaman elosa was one of the most important members of rogars clan her hate was serious it had meant amaya was shunned by all but rogars close family rogars mother had welcomed her as a motherinlaw should amaya had even thought she saw a slight feeling of exultation in her greetings but most of the other women had been unfriendlyor perhaps fearful they had spoken to her but only sometimes if they met alone in the forest they would stop and talk but if she met the women in a group they would lower their eyes and pass by amaya had asked her motherinlaw about it why what have i done youve done nothing amaya they are afraid of elosa but she is the shaman she is responsible for the clans welfare but the clan has had problems since elosa became shaman our harvest has failed the fish have been few the tribe has become divided but i have done nothing to cause the division rogars mother looked away elosa wanted rogar for her own daughter when he took a bride from far away it made elosa fear that the people would think her foolish she put her arm around amayas shoulder dont worry rogar wanted you he is smart that son of mine elosa will become interested in something else already she is looking for another husband for her daughter the trouble will go away but the trouble did not go away it grew and it grew until it was not only between amaya and the other women of the clan but until it was also between rogar and amaya they had not known each other well amaya realized theyd only had a few days together without the interference of elosa now rogar grew impatient hard to please their lovemaking grew more awkward instead of more comforting amaya felt she had ceased to please rogar and she had wanted to please rogar she wanted to love rogar amaya had hoped the ritual trip back to her own clan would help but there they found greater disaster disease had come and her uncle had died and her sister and her sisters husband the only one left was tani the baby had grown since amaya had left with rogar now she was walking she was staying with the greatgrandmother but the greatgrandmother could not run after her tani would hide when the greatgrandmother called she would laugh but she would not come amaya saw that the greatgrandmother could not take care of her rogar had hesitated when she asked if she could bring tani back to his clans island she is a fine strong baby he said but she is just a girl and our clans crop was small this year amaya had not pleaded but rogar had also seen that the greatgrandmother could not care for tani and perhaps tani had won him over herself with her baby smiles and games he had grown fond of playing with her taking her into the lagoon to splash we will take her back he had said finally she is a brave little girl she laughs when water splashes her she will be adopted by my tribe but that did not happen elosa had hated the baby just as she hated amaya she had refused to take tani into the clan then she had decreed that the clan did not have enough food and she said that the child must die it is not right for this stranger child to take food from the mouths of our clan she said rogar must put her in the water amayas heart broke but her hard outer shell remained solid she had hidden behind it all afternoon rogar had argued with elosa tried to convince her that the clans resources were not so few that one tiny girl would cause others to starve but elosa was firm you must put the girl in the sea tomorrowas soon as the sun rises she said amaya could not argue rogar had spoken truly her own clan followed that custom too if food was scarce the oldest and the youngest among them must die it was best for the weakest to die to allow the strongest to live but amaya did not want tani to die she was her sisters child she was the final link with her own clan her own island if tani died amaya would be left among a strange people subject to a strange husband with no one to care about and no one to care for her and tani was a strong child she would grow into a strong woman who would help her clan but what could amaya do amaya nestled behind her hard coconut shell and thought wildly she thought of killing elosa she could take the club she used for breaking coconut shells she could creep up upon elosas house she could hit the witch in the head the shaman would die a feeling of pleasure swept over amaya at the thought but it was closely followed by a shudder that shook her whole body and rattled her teeth no she could not kill elosa even if she managed to creep into elosas hut undetected rogars people would guess who had done it she would be killed tani would still die killing elosa would accomplish nothing except that amaya would herself die and her spirit would be condemned to roam the sea forever never finding rest on the heavenly island could she run away could she steal a canoe and go back to her own clan amaya could paddle a canoe of course everyone could do that but only men men like rogar who had been taught to read the stars and the currents could go so far as her native island and be sure of finding it could she run away to the forest she could take tani and hide she could find food for them there but amaya knew that would give her only a few days rogars island was not her native place she knew only parts of it she might be able to hide from a stranger but she could never hide from rogar and the men who had hunted all over that island and from the women who had gathered food all over it she would have to sleep rogars people knew where the water was and she would have to have water if food was scarce the women would be looking for it everywhere they would soon find her a sob bubbled up from amayas soul like water bubbling from a spring it almost cracked her coconut shell coating she choked it back and she did not move but she saw no way to save tani was rogar right was obeying the shaman the right thing to do did she have to let him take tani into the water oh she knew it was the law the way of the people as rogar had said it was the way of her own island her mothers mother had become ill in the year the crop had been so bad when she had become too sick to work she had stopped eating the family had grieved but the old woman had turned away from food she had refused water it is time the old woman said her tongue grew thick her daughters keened and in three days she had died everyone had admired her action and when the wife of the headmans son gave birth to a child with a crippled foot the mother had wept but she had not argued the headman himself had taken his grandson and put him in the sea to die life on the islands was hard the strong must not be held back by the weak that was the ancient law amaya knew that if the law was not obeyed the islandclans would not be strong and clever they would not conquer their enemiesthe other tribes who wanted their territory the fierce beasts who lived in the sea and in the forests the very hardness of life but tani was not weak elosa had not said she must die because she was weak that years crop had been poor but there was enough rogar said so his father said so but elosa had not listened she said tani must die tani was to be killed because she was a strange child no amaya thought that was not true tani was to be killed not because the baby was strange but because sheamayawas strange elosa hated amaya not tani but amaya was married to one of the clans young warriors elosa did not dare attack amaya directly she had decreed tanis death because that was the cruelest thing she could do to amaya and this would not be the last thing she did to amaya elosa might not dare condemn her openly but she would find ways amayas own fate would be like tanis already elosa had threatened rogar because he argued with her over the baby amayas presence here on rogars island was all wrong she was unhappy and she was hurting rogar by being there she loved rogar and she did not want him to be hurt because of her amaya hidden inside her coconut shell finally knew what she had to do she stirred lifting the sleeping baby and holding her close murmuring softly little pet sweet one i love you we will always be together standing up she went outside into the dark she took the path to the beach where the waves were high not to the friendly lagoon she stumbled once on the way but her step was firm as she walked into the water soon it would be over she and tani would both die rogar would be rid of them and the problems they had brought him elosa would have won true but amaya would have obeyed the law she and tani would reach the peaceful island the gods would bless her action she pictured the peaceful island as the waves reached her waist she clutched the sleeping baby against her breast soon the cold water would waken tani and she would cry amaya knew she must be ready to hold her tightly then even to hold her under water to make sure that the baby died first that she wasnt left alone in the water frightened amaya paused embracing the child more firmly suddenly she was grasped roughly from behind what are you doing rogars voice was harsh you do not have to take the child into the water i will do it no no i will take her she must not be frightened i will not frighten her and it must be done as the sun comes up rogar tried to take tani out of amayas arms amaya clutched the child no let me take her we will die and leave you in peace you die you must not die its best rogar elosa will never allow me to be part of your clan she will not forgive you for marrying me there will be more trouble its best if i die with tani rogar held her and tani tightly his grip woke the baby and the little one began to fuss and cry sleepily when rogar spoke his voice was low and desperate no he said no amaya you must live we must live together the waves broke around them and the sand shifted under amayas feet she felt as if she were falling but rogar held her up we must live on together he said again i love you amaya amaya felt the coconut husk break she was in rogars arms with nothing to protect her with no shell to hide behind tani was crying and amaya was sobbing mighty sobs and rogars arms rogars love surrounded her he led her slowly back to the beach and there amaya collapsed in the sand still sobbing it was many minutes before she was able to speak is there no way to save tani we have to obey the law rogar said amaya can you trust me trust you rogar laid his cheek against her hair yes amaya trust me i can do nothing by myself amaya said dully this is your island your people i know you do not want tani to die but if she musti trust you not to let her be afraid rogar helped amaya up and led her back to the house amaya did not put tani down but held her the rest of the night just as rogar held her finally she fell asleep the stirring of birds woke her and she realized she was alone rogar and tani were gone no amaya jumped to her feet no no it was still dark in the hut but outside the light was coming rogar had already taken tani away to put her in the water amaya ran along the path to the beach she could hear the waves pounding loudly the tide was coming in ahead she saw a figure silhouetted against the morning sky rogar rogar paused but he did not stop amaya ran on until she was beside him please rogar there must be another way he walked on go back amaya he said you said you would trust me please please rogar did not answer instead amaya heard the cackle of elosas voice the strange child cannot take food from the children of the people rogar knows the law strange woman he obeys the law of his people the voice brought amaya to her knees please she said again but this time she whispered you have brought disgrace to rogar and our people elosas voice gloated the way of the people must be followed amaya formed her body into its coconut shell rogars mother and sister knelt beside her be quiet elosa rogars mother said amaya is obeying the law but a woman who likes seeing a baby put to death is no real woman surprised by her motherinlaws sharp words to elosa amaya looked up at the shaman elosa did not reply to the criticism but she pointed to the surf with her heavy staff rogar obeys the law amayas eyes followed the staff and she saw that rogar was walking into the water tani was not frightened she was laughing and clapping her hands to her it was just another of the games rogar had taught her to love rogar did not go out very far the waves were rolling it would not take a lot of water to drown a tiny girl he seemed to be playing with tani and amaya remembered he had promised to keep her from being afraid he held her close to his body and he ducked under the water but when he arose the baby was gone rogar stood motionless the waves beating over him then he walked back to the beach when he reached the edge of the water he turned and looked back his father joined him and placed a hand on his shoulder together they looked down the beach and rogars father pointed were they thinking where her tiny body would wash ashore amaya hoped so to think of tani not only dead but lost in the seait was more than she could bear then rogars father called out there there he and rogar ran down the beach and rogar knelt down and scooped up a tiny bundle he held it above his head amaya saw dark hair and legs and the legs kicked she is not dead elosa the sea has refused her amaya jumped to her feet and watched in amazement as rogar walked toward them tani was squirming and angry but she was alive elosa shook her staff furiously put her in the water again it is the law rogar stood silently for a moment before he turned once more toward the water amaya again sank into despair she watched rogar walk through the surf the waves breaking over him and tani again he sank beneath the waves with the child in his arms again he rose without her and slowly walked back to the beach and again he and his father watched down the beach until a tiny bundle washed ashore once more they ran down to pick up tanis body and once more rogar brought the child to elosa alive elosa pounded her staff on the beach and screamed shes a demon she must die it is the law tani was very angry now but elosas fury frightened her she clutched rogar around the neck and shrieked rogar patted and soothed her until she became quieter and when the baby became quiet amaya heard other sounds looking behind her she saw many people they were buzzing with talk and they were all looking at rogar and elosa who stood facing each other neither of them looked around at the others elosa spoke and her voice was not loud but it crackled angrily put her back in the water rogar and take her farther out are you sure elosa are you sure this is what the law commands do you think that iyour shamancan mistake the meaning of the law the law that has governed our people for generations twice the sea has refused to take tani a third time now elosas eyes flickered right left amaya knew she was considering the people gathered behind her she took a deep breath and raised her staff take her out rogar leave her for the water to take she swung the staff around but rogar did not flinch away from the stick take her out elosas final words were a shriek it is the law rogar turned and walked back to the water amaya still knelt on the sand with rogars mother and sister beside her tears were running down her cheeks tani saw her there and waved a baby wave then she turned to look at the approaching waterstill unafraid and still trusting rogar trust me rogar had said trust me if tani can trust him amaya thought i must trust him too and she stood up proudly staring after her husband now the sun had moved over the horizon and it was hard to see what was happening with her eyes dazzled by tears and by the sun again rogar walked through the surf again he ducked into the water playing a game with tani amaya even thought she heard the childs laughter over the sound of the waves then rogar ducked beneath the water and when he arose tani was gone amaya did not allow herself to hope that the child would survive no the small one could not be lucky enough to be washed ashore three times this time she knew tani was dead and that was good if the child had to go into the water one more time amayas heart could not continue to beat rogar came through the surf and amaya went to meet him she put her arms around him and laid her head against his chest you tried rogar you faced elosa argued with her you tried your best she looked into his eyes i love you rogar smiled and i love you amaya now we had better go to tani he gestured behind her and amaya turned to see the same brown bundle tumble from the waves tani she and rogar ran down the beach and she scooped the little girl up tani coughed she sneezed then she screamed suddenly amaya and rogar and tani were surrounded by excited people rogars mother was embracing amaya and tani the witch is beaten she said this little one and my son have taken her power away what amaya was amazed three times three times rogars sister yelled it out rogar was smiling and amaya turned to him what do they mean rogar if the sea rejects the child three times then the interpretation of the law is wrong he said elosa condemned the child wrongly so tani will live and another will be selected as shaman an hour later tani had been fed and was asleep other women had come to marvel at the strong little girl who had survived the sea three times they brought gifts to the child the sea loved now amaya stared in awe at the little girl the others were taking tanis survival as a miracle were the gods of the sea showing that they loved her niece oh it was easy to say that elosa had condemned her wrongly and that the sea had rejected her but it was hard for amaya to believe elosa had not condemned others wrongly and her other victims had died amaya did not understand outside she heard a deep voice greeting rogar and she heard rogars respectful reply the headman had come would even the headman want to behold the miracle child but the headman was talking to rogar the elders are going to ask you to join their council he said join their council amaya took a quick breath but rogar was young too young to be an elder rogar sounded wary when he answered the headman that is too high an honor for me the elders must command canoes i do not have the years the headman chuckled but you have the head rogar and you have the knowledge rogar did not answer and you used that knowledge to benefit your people we are rid of elosa if she had admitted she was wrong after the second time the sea refused the child but she did not the headmans voice was brisk you gave her the chance to back down to save face she did not take it you handled her wisely the little one will be lucky to have you as a father the little one is already lucky yes she was lucky to have a man taking care of her who taught her not to fear the water that is one reason we wish you to join the elders but do not say no rogar the other reason is more practical he dropped his voice to a whisper and amaya barely heard his final words we need all the men who understand the currents and tides as you do to command canoes for the common good by patricia sprinkle i first met dr randall mcquirter in over a kosher tv dinner fresh out of college i had been hired by a private miami hospital to welcome patients and handle complaints and requests my boss was angie winters and in those days before medicare when some patients stayed in hospitals for months angie and i were the lubricant that flowed in graceful measure between them and any irritants that might mar their visit angie was a platinum blonde seven inches taller fifteen years older and a hundred times more glamorous than i she had selected the navy uniforms and threeinch heels we wore and my first day at work she called her own hairdresser im sending you a college student send me back a woman when i returned i almost didnt recognize my reflection in the plate glass doors angie gave me an approving nod and sent me to the administrator who fixed me with a steel gray gaze the motto of this institution is for the common good what is best for our patients is best for all of us therefore the only question you ever need ask a patient is how may i serve you do you understand angie worked eight to five she comforted grieving families helped choose nursing homes and handled our miami beach celebrities i worked from eleven until whenever greeting new patients and visiting each one every second day to see if they needed any special attention in my first week i fetched a mink jacket and false teeth from a beach hotel after an emergency admission wrote a letter to children in new jersey tactfully revising what the hells so important they cant come see their dying mother and one evening solved the problem of an elderly man who hadnt eaten for two days he swore he had no appetite but when i saw the jewish floridian on his bedside table and asked did you know we offer kosher meals he clutched my hand so hard he nearly took off a finger you got kosher bring me some of everything im famished i went down to the kitchen asked the night staff to heat a kosher tv dinner and offered to carry it to him myself i was halfway to the elevator when a man strolled toward me he had the dark eyes and hair of a mediterranean movie star and the godwalk that proclaimed him a doctor why hello he stepped deftly into my path we havent met but id sure like to next thing i knew i was backed up against the wall with nothing but a kosher dinner between me and ill never know i heard my name and angiewho should have gone home hours beforecame swinging down the hall i wondered where youd gotten to hello doctor i need celia up on three she put an arm around me and walked me toward the elevator when the door slid shut she murmured that was randall mcquirter head of our obgyn department dont ever cross him hes got a real temper but dont get stuck alone with the man either she spoke so casually she could have been offering a remedy for freckles i can take care of myself i resented her treating me like a kid sister the doctor was closer to her age than mine i wondered if she wanted him for herself several weeks later i arrived early one morning and dashed into the tiny coffee shop off the lobby for a breakfast milkshake angie was having coffee with dr magda gerstein our resident psychiatrist next to angie dr gerstein looked like a toadplump and plain her dark hair streaked with gray her face sallow and scarred her only attractive feature was a pair of intelligent dark eyes that terrified me i kept wondering what neuroses those eyes found as they probed my soul when angie saw me she called full moon last night so emergency was crazy five came in after a brawl in a coconut grove bar ive been running my legs off this morning rosa are you guys still stitching up the grove crew coconut grove bars were the hangouts of beautiful people so angie of course would handle those patients rosa marquez our head surgical nurse collapsed into a chair at their table still wearing green scrubs a cloud of dark hair fell to her shoulders as she pulled off her surgical cap we just rebuilt the jawbone of a young man who is lucky to be alive café con leche she called to the waitress approaching the table i cant stay but a minute but i have to have a breather not sure of my welcome in such august company i headed to a stool at the counter buenos días i greeted carlos who was wiping up a coffee spill the first cuban immigrants were reaching miami in those days all claiming to have been wealthy professionals executives and the cream of havana society some actually were according to angie who loved to pass on informationabout our coworkers carlos used to own one of the finest restaurants in havana luisthe meds nurse up on fivehad been cubas premier cardiologist and rosa came from one of havanas richest families but had run away at eighteen to join castros army after rosa got raped by her commanding officer so angie claimed she gave up the revolution and came to join her family in miami i was learning to take angies stories with a tablespoon of salt no way plain little dr gerstein had been the plaything of german ss officers in a jewish concentration camp and when i asked our administrator about serving on jack kennedys boat during world war ii he laughed who told you that i get seasick looking at a boat and got turned down by the army because of flat feet but angie said his face softened into an indulgent smile oh angie shes smart like a fox but like a child in some ways she loves drama and wants everybodyherself includedto be larger than life ignore her stories and learn from her heart angies got a gigantic heart i didnt need my friends larger than life it was enough for me that carlos made the best milkshake in miami he also had taken it on himself to teach me spanish so i could welcome our hispanic patients so far he had taught me six sentences i could rattle off with the staccato accents and speed of a native cuban good day i am the hospital hostess welcome to the hospital do you need anything special if the patient responded with anything except no i fell back on the other two one moment i am going to call an interpreter quiero un bestido de chocolate i said carefully i didnt know you spoke spanish angie called a little i boasted carlos laughed the two women working with him tittered rosas dimples flashed as she hid a smile behind her cup what what did i say wrong he gave me the severe look of a parent to a child you just ordered a chocolate dress dress ishe wrote vestido on a paper napkin and being cuban read itbestido milkshake ishe wrote and said batido he made me order correctly before he fixed the milkshake dr mcquirter came to the counter and stood near me hello celia his voice was like melted chocolate and he looked so good my knees wobbled no wonder new mothers swooned over him in the past month three infant boys had gone home with the name randall i did a quick calculation and decided our age difference wasnt too great bring your chocolate dress over here and join us angies invitation was more of a command when i obeyed dr mcquirter ambled along beside me and pulled up a chair between me and rosa angie frowned two minutes later the overhead pager came to life miss winters emergency room dr gerstein emergency room stat dr gerstein muttered an oath in german angie pushed back her chair what now carver the head orderly hurried in and approached our table emergencys got one of those fellows back there nearly tearing the place apart oh lordy angie looked at the rest of us youd better come too celia we might need you the emergency room was offlimits in my job description i wasnt on duty yet and i still had half a milkshake left we both knew she was simply hauling me away from dr mcquirter i opened my mouth to protest but angie grabbed my elbow and dragged me with her rosa called to dr gerstein see you tonight dr gerstein might be short and squat but she moved fast she was already out the door soon angie and carver were right behind her with me bringing up a reluctant rear magda and rosa work at the overtown free clinic two evenings a week angie explained to carver as we hurried down the hall poor folks battered wives prostitutes dr gerstein interrupted impatiently you are sure carver it is one of them yes maam he was left in the emergency room sometime during the night wearing sweats as crazy as things were nobody noticed when he came in after the place calmed down they saw him sleeping in the corner but presumed he was a relative of one of the patients so they let him sleep he woke up a little while ago and started yelling that he had been he looked over his shoulder at me and stopped talking fixed i asked bluntly angie gave me a chiding look i am an adult i reminded her i read newspapers and watch the eleven oclock news dr gerstein still in the lead continued quizzing carver both testicles were removed and he does not remember a thing from the time he entered a bar until he woke up here doesnt remember a thing carver agreed just like the others i put on speed and came abreast of angie how many is that three in three weeks the other two were left at jackson i guess it was our turn poor guys we turned the corner by our equalopportunity chapel which had icons for the religions of all our patients i caught the eye of my favoritea madonna with dark hair dimples and kind plaster eyesand murmured god knows the first one deserved it how do you know angies eyes flashed i share all my gossip with you i wished i could take back my words still fair is fair his girlfriendor one of themhad a baby here a few weeks ago dr mcquirter delivered it for free i paused to let that virtue sink in but the look in angies eye pushed me on i recognized the mans name anthony miguel williams because he named the poor baby zhivago miguel and wanted williams on the birth certificate even though he refused to marry the babys mama she cried about that the whole time she was here you remember i called up to dr gerstein i paged you because she was threatening to kill herself dr gerstein wasnt listening she was heading to emergency like a horse to a barn angie claimed the psychiatrist had an internal magnet for people in trouble a guy refusing to marry somebody is no reason to do what they did carver argued hed already had three other babies by different mamas he bragged about that said zhivago was the second son hes had this year but the other baby was born at jackson and his mama had to get her prenatal care at a clinic because anthony hadnt met dr mcquirter yet not a nice person carver finally accepted my assessment we stepped through the swinging doors into chaos somebody had ripped magazines and flung them on the floor overturned the newspaper box and broken the glass front of the candy machine the telephone from the desk decorated a silk ficus in one corner housekeeping staff were putting the room to rights while patients and their families huddled on the far side with frightened eyes from one examining room came curses and shouts lawyer police dr gerstein trotted in that direction angie gave me a wave of dismissal theres nothing you can do here go on upstairs and start your rounds i backed up and stepped on carver his eyes were fixed on the examining room curtain while he pressed one hand below his belt whod do such a thing to such a nice man you know him i asked not personally but i heard it was lyle bradford lyle bradford was a big man in town important architect sat on the orange bowl committee gave money every year so jackson hospital could have santa claus for sick kids he was even a personal friend of the governor not like that second guy who got taken to jackson carver added in a voice rough with feeling him now he turned and headed out hes the one who really got what he deserved i caught up and trotted beside him toward the lobby you knew him no but he was part of a gang that raped a girl in my daughters high school the other guys were nineteen and they went to jail but because he was seventeen he only did a few months at juvey my daughter and her friends were terrified when he got out they claim hes been messing with girls all his life and threatening to hurt their brothers and sisters if they told well he aint gonna be messing with any more little girls carver spoke with a quiet satisfaction that made me uneasy ill catch the elevator here and go on up to my office see you later i stepped in and pushed the button my usual routine was to pick up our departments peach index cards on new patients and head out to welcome them instead i picked up the phone and called a former high school classmate who worked in the admissions office at jackson we have one of those castrated men here i reported i heard it was lyle bradford but i dont know for sure from her squeal i deduced id given her a top banana for their staff gossip tree she owed me what do you know about the men who turned up at your place she snickered they are singing soprano seriously ive read what the papers saidthat they went into a bar and didnt remember anything after thatbut is that all you know wellher voice dropped a registeri had to take admissions information from the first one and he said he remembered talking in the bar with a woman who looked like the virgin mary but he couldnt remember which bar he wondered if shed put something in his drink sounds more like bloody mary how did he get to your emergency room nobody saw anyone bring him no he was left in a wheelchair outside one of the ambulances found him sitting there at three am in a johnny gown with a blanket tucked around his legs it was a pretty night so at first they thought he was a patient who had gone outside for a smoke or something and fallen asleep they mentioned him to a nurse and she wheeled him back in figuring shed return him to his room then she discovered he didnt have an id bracelet about that time he woke up and started yelling thats when they realized hed had what we were instructed the next morning to call unauthorized surgery who was his doctor he didnt have one said hed never been sick the residents checked him out and said the surgery looked like a professional job so they let him recuperate a few days and sent him home dont tell anybody i told you this okay hes threatening to sue us so we arent supposed to talk about it of course not we both knew there is no place more gossipy than a hospital except a police station how did the second one get in looks like youd have been watching the doors pretty carefully after that we were the police got a call that he was down in biscayne park they found him sitting on a park bench dressed in loose sweats and carrying on so loud they thought he was drunk at first he didnt remember anything either except sitting at a bar talking to a woman he claimed was a gorgeous blonde with legs up to her throat not my image of the virgin mary mine either he at least could remember the name of the bar but they were real busy that night after a baseball game and didnt remember him how did yours get in full moon night i didnt have to say more anybody who works in a hospital knows a full moon brings babies death and all sorts of craziness he was found sleeping in a corner of the emergency room it gives me the creeps ive never been so glad to be a woman me neither see you later i hung up and checked my watch id give lyle bradford a couple of hours to get up to his room then no matter what angie said she was bound to tell me ill take care of this one since he was in a sense a celebrity id go welcome him i was dying to hear his story the no visitors sign didnt deter me i was hospital administration mr bradford lay on his back watching a soap opera he glowered as i came in who the hell are you a patient counselor i came to see if you have everything you need his glower deepened i mean is there something i can get you he started up in anger then sank back with a groan yeah theres a couple of things you could get me if you have a spare pair look im not a freak show okay ive already had another one of you in here that would be my boss i didnt know she had visited you so i came to say if there is anything we can do to make your stay easier just ask our job is to welcome patients and handle requests or complaints his language blistered my ears and singed my back hair cleaned up considerably what he said was i got a complaint all right some pirate tied me up and took my crown jewels he fingered a scrap of peach index card and squinted at something scrawled on it you ever hear of a guy named randall mcquirter sure hes one of our obgyns he laughed but it was not a pleasant sound youre kidding hes a womens doc yessir what was the matter with my tongue angie was always telling me that middleaged men dont like young women calling them sir lyle bradford didnt seem to notice he gave that rude laugh again well from what somebody told me thats not all he is if you see the bastard tell him i want to see him pronto okay hell be here tonight making evening rounds if i see him you find him you hear me he punctuated every word with a pointing forefinger ill tell him i couldnt believe my good fortune i had a patients orders to seek out dr mcquirter after angie had left for the day she went at five i am beat dont bother visiting mr bradford ill take care of him i wont i assured her at five thirty i started lurking in the lobby dr mcquirter strolled in at six and paused in the doorway to cast a quick worried look around he actually took a step backward as i approached to announce i have a message for you he grinned down at me as a pickup line id rather hear im so glad youre here ive been waiting all afternoon i have i admitted trying to keep my balance under that deep black gaze lyle bradford wants to see you hes in room i dont know lyle bradford he started for the elevator i followed he came in today i think hes on the orange bowl committee he shook his head still doesnt ring a bell he specifically asked to see you maybe he has free tickets for you or something dr mcquirter put his right hand in his pocket he asked for me by name ill check with him after ive seen my patients want to meet me on five in an hour and have coffee when im done with him put that in your pipe and smoke it angie i said softly as i headed on my rounds as soon as i stepped off the fifthfloor elevator an hour later i heard shouting two orderlies were sprinting down the hall luis the meds nurse who might or might not have once been havanas premier cardiologist dashed out of the nurses station and headed the same way running in heels i made a late fourth we all could hear the shouted threats you did this to me im gonna sue you for millions your pretty ladies will have to work night and as i reached the door of lyle bradfords room dr mcquirter pulled a gun out of his pocket and killed the man before he finished the sentence by the time of dr mcquirters trial i had accrued some vacation days i sat in the packed courtroom with other hospital personnel who didnt have to testify grateful that luis had pushed me toward the elevator immediately after the shooting you were never here stay out of this he and the two orderlies testified that mr bradford had accused dr mcquirter of castrating him and had then threatened the doctor the defense attorney went after the word threatened trying to plant the notion of selfdefense luis refused to play mr bradford was standing by his bed wearing only a hospital gown where could he hide a weapon he was too sore to even wear boxers every man in the courtroom squirmed the prosecutor put a police detective on the witness stand to testify they were seeking connections between dr mcquirter and the other two unsolved castration cases the defense attorney managed to get that testimony ruled inadmissiblearguing successfully that mcquirter wasnt being tried for castrating mr bradford just for killing him on the second day the defense started its arguments and dr mcquirter himself took the stand the jury seemed unimpressed by his explanation for why he was carrying a gun on rounds that eveningid gotten an anonymous threat that afternoonand unconvinced by his reason for checking on bradford who had no need of an obgyn and was three floors above dr mcquirters other patients i got a message he wanted to see me i caught my breath would i have to testify after all heaven knew what angie would do to me if she learned id been in bradfords room nobody called me instead angie was called to the stand she testified that dr randall mcquirter was an excellent doctor highly respected and loved by all his patients and the hospital staff she gave him a dazzling smile as she stepped down after that physicians nurses ward clerks and even carver spoke about what a wonderful doctor dr mcquirter was and how he must have been seriously provoked to do what he had done as we left for the day i saw angie in the parking lot you sure laid it on thick in there she shrugged why not he is a good doctor but thats not going to keep him out of jail a good doctor i drove home thinking about lyle bradfords last words as soon as i got in i called another high school friend who had become an investigative reporter with the miami herald she had established amazing contacts throughout miamis seamier element and was so tenacious about research that her nickname was bulldog theres something odd about the mcquirter case i told her the teflon doc youre telling me you think he castrated bradford and those other guys i have no idea but he didnt shoot bradford for saying that he fired after bradford starting making threats what were his exact words she like me had taken senior english from a tyrant who made us memorize reams of poetry and famous speeches we had gotten real good at verbatim repetition first he said you did this to me then he said im gonna sue you for millions your pretty ladies will have to work night and thats when mcquirter shot him from the silence on the other end i knew she was writing it all down on a yellow pad interesting ill get back to you she didnt get back to me but she must have worked all night getting in touch with some of her contacts because the next morning in court the prosecutor got permission to introduce important new evidence the courtroom was electrified when two women testified that for several years dr mcquirter had augmented his income by controlling a number of prostitutes most of whom had come to him as adolescent patients or young nurses the two testified that the doctor had seduced the girlsthemselves includedand impregnated them then aborted their babies which was illegal in those days and told them that working for him was the only way to repay their medical bills they also testified that lyle bradford had been a regular patron with an increasingly nasty temper he had broken one womans nose and several had needed medical attention they had all complained to dr mcquirter about him the prosecutor insisted that their testimony plus the fact that dr mcquirter had carried a loaded gun to bradfords room pointed to premeditated murder the jury agreed they brought in a verdict of murder one and sent the doctor away for life men in miami slept easier bulldog wrote a series of interviews with prostitutes randall mcquirters women spoke bitterly about his treatment of them but other prostitutes praised his methods of dealing with violent customers violence against prostitutes dropped bulldog won a pulitzer the miami paper still occasionally refers to the local obgyn who avenged prostitutes by castrating violent johns another miami moment but some miami moments like some of angies stories are fabrications the morning after dr mcquirter went to prison i arrived early at the hospital and headed to the coffee shop for one of carloss batidos angie dr gerstein and rosa were having coffee at the back corner table before they saw me i saw angie pour something from a silver pocket flask into each of their cups they raised them in a toast for the common good as i approached the table i saw them as a stranger might a tall blond woman with legs going almost up to her neck a nurse who worked after hours at a free clinic and who had a cloud of dark hair and a dimple in her chin exactly like our chapel madonna and a psychiatrist with a face scarred like a pirates as dr gerstein lifted her drink her sleeve slid toward her elbow that was the first time id seen the row of numbers tattooed on her arm a family sunday in the park v i warshawskis first case by sara paretsky i the heat in the attic room was so heavy that not even the flies on the screens had the energy to move the two children lay on the floor sweat rose on their skin gluing their clothes to the linoleum normally on a hot august sunday theyd be at the beach but marie warshawski had decreed that her son must remain close to home today normally the cousins would have disregarded such an edict but today victoriatori to her cousinwas nervous wanting to hear as much of the grownup gossip as possible she and boomboombernard to his mother often spent sundays together that was when toris mother gave music lessons all afternoon in the minute front room of their south chicago bungalow tori either had to read upstairs taci taci carissimaor worse sit primly in the front room learning from gabriellas few good students in the winters tori followed boomboom to the makeshift ice rinks where he played a rough brand of pickup hockey no girls allowed period which caused a few fights between the cousinsaway from the boys boomboom made tori help him perfect the slap shot of his idol boomboom geoffrion in the summers though the cousins spent every sunday together they pooled their coins to take bus and train up to wrigley field where they would climb up over the backs of the bleachers and sneak into the park without paying or they dared each other to jump off the breakwater into lake calumet or rode their bikes past the irate guards at the south works playing a complicated hideandseek among the mountains of slag this sunday tori was too worried about her father to violate ciocia maries edict officer warshawski had been assigned to marquette park martin luther king was leading a march with al raby and other negroes to protest housing segregation in chicago thered been so many marches and riots already this summer where tony warshawski had been away from home for three days working treble shifts along with every other beat cop on the south side today was going to be worse hed told his wife and daughter that before he left for work on friday white people on the south side had vowed to do everything they could this summer of to show king and the other agitators hed brought with him that they should stay in mississippi or georgia where they belonged that was how boombooms mother put it she was furious that the cardinal made every priest read a letter to the parish on brotherhood and open housing our chicago negroes always knew their place before these communists came in to stir them up she fumed her own parish priest at st czeslaws read cardinal codys letter since he was a good soldier in christs army but he also preached a thundering sermon telling his congregation that christians had a duty to fight communists and look after their families aunt marie repeated the gist of father gielczowskisremarks when she dropped in on gabriella earlier in the week if we dont stop them in marquette park theyll be here in south chicago next father gielczowski says hes tired of the cardinal sitting in his mansion like god on a throne not caring about white people in this city were the ones who built these churches but cardinal cody wants to let those ni not that word in my house marie gabriella had said sharply oh you can be as highandmighty as you like gabriella but what about us what about the lives we worked so hard to make here mama warshawski she tells me always how hard it is to be polish in this city in gabriella said the germans were here first next the irish and they want no poles taking their jobs away she tells me how they call papa warshawski names when he looks for work and antoni he has to do many hard jobs at the police they are irish they arent liking polish people at first it is always the way marie it is sad but it is always the way the ones that come first want to keep out the ones who come second marie made a noise like the engine on the truck her brother tomas drove for metzgers meats she pursed her lips and leaned over to ask gabriella how she would feel if her precious victoria brought home one of them as a husband all gabriella and marie had in common was the fact that their husbands were brothers on politics on childrearing even on religion they were forever in each others hair maybe especially on religion marie had an icon of the virgin in every room in her house the sacred heart of jesus inside her front door was a sight that shocked and fascinated torithe large red heart with flames shooting out the top and barbed wire crushed around its throbbing middle those are thorns ciocia marie snapped if your mother cared about your immortal soul youd go to catechism like bernard and learn about jesus and his crown of thorns gabriella wouldnt allow such images in her home and she told victoria it was pagan to worship the heart of your god almost a cannibal to want to display the heartbarbarica gabriella didnt think like this because her father was a jew after all her mother and her aunt rosawho like gabriella had migrated to chicago from italywere catholics it was more that gabriella openly scorned religion when father gielczowski from st czeslaws came to visit gabriella to demand that she get victoria baptized to save her daughter from eternal torment gabriella told him religion is responsible for most of the torments people suffer here in this life if there is a god he wont demand a few drops of water on my daughters head as proof of her character she should be honest she should always work her hardest do her best work and when she says i will do this thing she must do that thing if she cannot live in such a way no water will change her the priest had been furious he tried to talk to tony warshawski about gabriella peaceloving tony put up his big hands and backed away i dont try to come between my wife and my daughter if you were a married man father youd know that a mother tiger protecting her young looks tame next to a mother human no im not lecturing my wife for you after that father gielczowski glowered at victoria whenever he saw her on the street he tried to tell marie to keep her own son away from the den of unbelievers but bernard warshawskiwho was usually as placid as his brother tonytold the priest not to meddle in his family besides the sistersinlaw only lived four blocks apart they needed each others help in keeping an eye on two of the most enterprising children in a wild neighborhood tony and bernard suspected too that gabriella and marie also needed the drama of their arguments true gabriella gave music lessons marie worked in the guild of st mary but both led lives of hard work they needed excitement and recounting each others monstrous deeds or words gave their lives a running drama right now the excitement was a little too much for everyone the mayor the cardinal police superintendent wilson theyd all agreed that martin luther king and al raby had the right to march in marquette park theyd also agreed that the ensuing violence might be horrific and tony warshawski was one of the officers assigned to the park tony hadnt been home for thirtysix hours already gabriella was worried for his safety she and marie had argued about it saturday night me i have seen those photographs from birmingham and little rock the hatred in those faces i thought i was looking at fascists from the war oh the press the press marie said they want to make good christians look bad they try to make the police look bad too when theyre just trying to protect property but in birmingham the police they are going against little black girls is that right to send a large dog onto a small child besides here in chicago antoni he tells me the police have the strictest orders to protect dr king and all the marchers yes i heard tony say that and i cant believe it little flecks of spit covered maries mouth the police theyre collaborating with these outside agitators instead of looking after the community they should know that the community isnt going to take that betrayal sitting down marie gabriellas voice was quiet with fury what happens if this community attacks my husband who is after all your own husbands brother what then what will bernard do if antoni is injured in such a way marie stalked away in a huff dragging boomboom with her gabriella sighed and took her daughter into her arms mia cara cuore mio you must not let this hatred poison you i must send you to your zia maria tomorrow because tomorrow come the girls to study their music with me these lessons they bring the money for your education if you are ever to go to a university which you must carissima devi studiare alluniversità devi avere una vita allesterno di queste fabbriche e questa ignoranza a life outside the steel mills and the ignorance of the neighborhood gabriellas goal for her daughter but meanwhile this adored daughter had to live in the neighborhood and that meant perforce spending sundays with la regina dellignoranza zia maria and do not run off to make some difficult or dangerous exploit with your cousin victoria you must promise me that i know marie believes you are eve in the garden of eden leading her precious weak boy into danger and me i see him leading you too often but truly one must agree that together you each lead the other where no sane person would travel on this weekend you must be like a good girl who knits and bakes and stays at home for papa do you hear me victoria on this weekend i give you a commandment promettimelo cara gabriella repeated her adjuration the next day when boomboom came to collect his cousin after mass victoria looked her mother in the eyes and promised they rode their bikes the four blocks to boombooms house while gabriella made tea and readied her front room for her students victoria took her new brownie the special present for her tenth birthday a week earlier she had photographed her father in his uniform her mother tending her rhododendron her cousin in a blackhawks jersey today she snapped an angry ciocia marie sweating in her hot kitchen marie served sunday dinner roast pork loin and boiled potatoes that no one felt like eating in the heat she fussed over boomboom when he picked at the heavy food was he coming down with something maries brother tomas who was also at dinner said that boomboom was healthy as a hog stop pretending that the boy is some kind of weaklinghes playing ice hockey with sixteenyearolds only because you encourage him tomas marie snapped her thin cheeks flushed pink she had suffered eleven miscarriages before and after boombooms birth and could never believe her only child wasnt a frail scrap that the lord might snatch from her at any second boombooms father uncle bernie had to work the afternoon shift at the docks this sunday so he missed dinner another of maries brothers karl was there with his wife who quickly changed the subject since she insisted on talking about the impending march in marquette park it didnt help the atmosphere at the table finally the children were permitted to make their escape up the steep stairs to boombooms room the cousins lived in identical houses four downstairs rooms attics that had been turned into their bedrooms unfinished basements that the fathers kept planning to fix up as family rooms on their days off in the small houses of south chicago no conversation was ever private after squabbling halfheartedly over toris refusal to sneak out the window and head for the beach the cousins lay on the floor where it was coolest and dozily listened to the adults in the dining room below with the children gone the conversation became franker and coarser tomas had been fired from his job at metzgers meats last week and he blamed it on the negroes but he was stealing from the company tori whisperedto boomboom how could that be martin luther kings fault he was not boomboom fired back wujek tomas was framed by the janitor and hes a nigger like king and all those other commies boomboom gabriella says thats the worst word to say worse than god damn it or any other swear word for a moment the cousins forgot the argument downstairs in their own fight which degenerated quickly to punches although boomboom was a year older and bigger he was also the one whod taught tori to defend herself which she was ready to do at a moments notice it was only when he tore her shirt at the collar that they stopped looking at each other with dismay what would gabriella say when she saw the torn shirt or marie when she saw the bruise on boombooms shoulder in the silence that followed their fistfight wujek tomass loud angry voice came up the attic stairs all im saying is im going to kill tony the front door slammed tori ran to the window and saw tomas get into his car it was a buick wildcat convertible nicer and more expensive than anything anyone else in the family could afford where had he got the money for it everyone asked it was gabriella who told tony while tori was in her own attic bedroom listening to her parents that wujek tomas stole meat from metzgers and sold it to supper clubs in wisconsin tony told gabriella that was all hearsay so why would wujek tomas want to kill tony downstairs marie was demanding that karl follow tomas and stop him but uncle bernard said tomas would cool off in time and uncle karl added that no one could catch tomas in his wildcat anyway but he said he would kill my dad tori whispered to boomboom her eyes wide with terror i have to find my dad i have to warn him tori you cant go to marquette park you promised zia gabriella you would stay here at my house all afternoon it was part of the ongoing battle between gabriella and marie that boomboom had to use italian when addressing his aunt and uncle zia gabriella zio tony while tori had to address boombooms parents in polish ciocia marie wujek bernie i dont care if your stupid wujek hurts my dad mamas heart will break in half way worse than that throbbing heart of jesus in your doorway before boomboom could stop her tori had run to the back window she opened the screen lowered herself so that she was hanging by her arms over the roof to the kitchen leanto a few feet below and dropped she rolled down the shingles and jumped to the ground she ran to the front of the house where shed left her bike and took off boomboom waited an instant too long to follow her his mother had run to the front door to screech at her niece to come back this minute right now and not to lead bernard into danger a moment later she ran up the attic stairs and grabbed her sons arm as he was following his cousin out the back window ii even half a mile from the park victoria could hear the screaming ten thousand throats open in hate the cops at the intersection uniforms wet under the hot sun were so tense that they shouted at everyoneold women asking what the trouble was even a priest riding up on a bicyclethe cops shouted at them all including victoria warshawski darting under the sawhorses that blocked seventyfirst street she had ridden her bike the three miles to seventyfirst and stony where shed chained it to a streetlight a number bus was just coming along and she climbed thankfully on board her torn shirt was soaked with sweat her throat was hoarse and dry she had eightytwo cents in her pockets if she used thirty cents on the roundtrip fare shed have plenty to buy a coke when she found a vending machine seventyfirst street was blocked off half a mile from marquette park cops in riot gear were diverting all traffic even cta buses in a wide loop around the park traffic was jammed on western avenue in both directions the cops told the bus driver that no one was allowed off the bus until it got to the far side of the park but while they were stuck in the intersection victoria forced open the back door and jumped out when the cops at western avenue yelled at her she was afraid one of them was a friend of her dads whod recognized her she didnt realize that every face was a blur to these hot edgy men but she couldnt help turning around to see if they were calling her by name when she did she saw something shocking uncle tomass white convertible pulled into the intersection uncle tomas was at the wheel another man a stranger to victoria sat next to him he was blond like tomas and riding in the open car had boiled both their faces bright red as red as the wild shirt the stranger was wearing at first the officer tried to stop the car but uncle tomas pulled out his wallet the cop looked around as if checking to see who was watching he took a bill out of tomass wallet then moved two sawhorses so the wildcat could drive through the uniformed man was taking a bribe this was terrible tony warshawski talked about this over and over again the people who tried to give him money to get out of traffic tickets and how wrong it wasit gave everyone on the force a bad name victoria took a picture of the cop moving the sawhorses and then of uncle tomas and the stranger tomas must have gotten someone to help him find her father the two men would gang up on tony and kill him and then some evil cop would take a bribe to pretend not to see that it had happened victoria started running she couldnt beat the convertible to the park but she had to get there as fast as she could to find her father before tomas and his partner did when she got to the park she saw this was going to be nearly impossible the crowds were so thick that a child even a girl like victoria who was tall for her age couldnt see around them she had to fight her way through them people were holding up signs with horrible words on them one said king would look good with a knife in his back but the others they said things that you were never supposed to say about anyone victoria used her elbows the way boomboom had taught her at hockey practice and pushed her way through a massive wedge of people they were yelling and screaming and waving confederate flags some of them had sewn swastikas to their clothes or painted them on their faces this was also very bad gabriella had to leave her mother and father forever and come to america because of people in italy who wore swastikas even as she looked for her father victoria realized she couldnt tell her mother the things she was seeingswastikas people calling martin luther king by a name worse than a swear word she hoped tony wouldnt say anything either it would upset gabriella terribly and she and tony had a duty to protect gabriella from any further unhappiness in this life as she moved farther west into the park she saw a group of teenagers turn a car over and set fire to it the people near them cheered six policemen in riot helmets ran to the teenagers who spat at them and started throwing rocks and bottles victoria pushed through the cheering mob to where the policemen were using their billy clubs trying to arrest the boys whod set the fire she tugged on one officers arm please im lookingfor officer warshawski do you know him have you seen him get back get out of the way this is no place for a kid like you go home to your mommy and daddy the man pushed her out of the way tony warshawski she cried hes my dad hes working here hes a cop i need to find him this time the men ignored her completely they couldnt pay attention to herthe crowd was protecting the boys throwing rocks and cans of coke at the officers one can hit an officer in the head the crowd roared with laughter when the soda spilled into his eyes blinding him the niggers are on homan someone shrieked the whole mob swerved west chanting find the niggers kill the niggers victoria followed them her legs aching a stitch in her side making her gasp for breath she couldnt pay attention to her pain it would only get in her way she had to find tony she elbowed her way past the screaming adults one of them put out a hand and grabbed her so hard she couldnt wriggle free and where are you going it was father gielczowski with him were half a dozen people she recognized from her own neighborhood two of them women carrying bags of sugar im looking for my dad have you seen him have you seen him father doesnt your jew mother teach you to respect your elders youre not my father victoria kicked him hard on the shin he let go of her shoulder swearing at her in polish victoria slithered away the crowd was so thick that the priest couldnt move fast enough to catch up with her daddy where are you where are you she realized tears were running down her cheeks babies cry you arent a baby she passed a drinking fountain and stopped to drink and to run her head under the stream of water other people came up and pushed her out of the way but she was cooler now and could move faster for over an hour she pushed her way through the mob it was like swimming in giant waves in lake michigan you worked hard but you couldnt move very far every time she came to a cop she tried to ask about tony warshawski sometimes the man would take time to shake his headno he didnt know tony once someone knew tony but hadnt seen him more often the overheated officers brushed her aside people were throwing cans and stones and cherry bombs one exploded near her filling her eyes with smoke a rumor swept through the mob someone had knocked king down with a rock one down eleven million to go a woman cackled king niggers on his feet theyre treating him like hes royalty while we have to suffer in the heat a man growled victoria saw the golf course on her right it looked green refreshing and almost empty of people she shoved her way through the mob and made it onto the course she climbed the short hill around one of the holes and came on the road that threaded the greens to her amazement uncle tomass white convertible stood there tomas wasnt in it only the stranger whod been with him back at western avenue he was driving slowly looking at the bushes victoria was too exhausted to run she limped up to the car and started pounding on the door what happened to tomas wheres my dad what have you done with him who are you the stranger demanded tomas doesnt have any kids my dad officer warshawski she screamed tomas said he was going to kill tony where is he the stranger opened the door the look on his face was terrifying for some reason the girl held up her camera almost as a protection against his huge angry face and took his picture he yanked at the camera strap almost choking victoria the strap broke and he flung the camera onto the grass as she bent to pick it up he grabbed her she bit him and kicked at him but she couldnt make him let go iii the battle between the cops and the protestors went on for five hours after dr king and his fellow marchers left the park by the end of the day every cop felt too limp and too numb to care about the cars that were still burning or those that were overturned or dumped into the lagoons ringing the park firefighters were working on burning cars but they were moving slowly too some patrolmen returning to their squad cars couldnt get far women had poured sugar into the gas tanks after going a few hundred feet the fuel filters clogged and the cars died when a fireman came on the body shoved under a bush he called over to a cop uselessly fiddling with the carburetor of his dead squad car the policeman walked over on heatswollen legs and knelt grunting in pain as his hamstrings bent for the first time in nine hours the man under the bush was around forty blond sunburnt and dead the cop grunted again and lifted him by the shoulders the back of the mans head was a pulpy mess not dead from a heat stroke as the officer had first assumed but from the wellplaced blow of a blunt instrument a small crowd of firefighters and police gathered the cop whod first examined the body sat heavily on his butt his eyelids were puffy from the sun you guys know the drill keep back dont mess the site up any moren it already is his voice like all his brother officers was raspy from heat and strain guy here says he knows something bobby a man at the edge of the ragtag group said bobby groaned but got to his feet when the other cop brought over a civilian in a hawaiian print shirt im officer mallory you know the dead man sir the civilian shook his head nope just saw one of the niggers hit him right after we got king one of them said hed do in the first whitey crossed his path and i saw him take a coke bottle and wham it into this guy the police looked at each other bobby returned to the civilian that would have been about when sir maybe five maybe six hours ago and you waited this long to come forward now just a minute officer number one i didnt know the guy was dead and number two i tried getting some cops attention and he told me to bug off and mind my own business only he didnt put it that polite if you get my drift how far away were you close enough to see the man with the coke bottle clearly the civilian squinted in thought maybe ten feet hard to say people were passing back and forth everyone doing their own thing like the kids are saying these days no one paying much attentionme neither but i could make a stab at describing the nigger who hit him bobby sighed okay were waiting for a squad car that works to come for us well drive you to the chicago lawn station you can make a statement there give us a description of the negro you say you saw and the time and all that good stuff boys youre as beat as me but lets see if we can find that coke bottle anywhere near here turning to the man next to him he muttered i hope to jesus this guy cant make an id the whole town will explode if we arrest some negro for killing a white guy today as they picked through the litter of cups and bottles and car jacks that the rioters had dropped looking for anything with hair or blood on it a squad car drove up near them the uniformed driver came over followed by a civilian man with his son mallory were looking for tony warshawski seen him bobby looked up we werent on the same detail i think hes over by homanoh he suddenly recognized the civilian tonys brother bernie bobby mallory had been tony warshawskis protégé when he joined the force fifteen years later hed moved beyond tony with promotions the older man no longer applied for but the two remained close friends bobby had spent enough weekends with tony and gabriella that he knew bernie and marie as well bobby was an enthusiastic supporter of boombooms ambition to supplant the golden jet with the blackhawks he wished he could also support the freedom tony and gabriella gave their own only child but he hated the way they let her run around with boomboom like a little hooligan thank god eileen was raising his own girls to be proper young ladies were falling down were that tired warshawski bobby said whats up bernie shook his sons shoulder and boomboom said its my cousin tori officer mallory victoria shemy uncle tomasafter lunch we heard him say he was going to kill tony because of wujek tomas losing his job and he thought it was tonys fault except he also blamed it on the ninegroesso victoria took off for the park here to warn uncle tony and she didnt come home and we saw it on tv the fight and i told my dad and he said we should come here and try to find her or anyway find uncle tony and then dad and i we saw you and maybe you know like is she okay bobby mallory rubbed his sunburnt forehead vicki came here god damn it who let her do such a stupid dangerous thing she took off sir and my ma she had ahold of me so i couldnt follow which is the only good news of the day bernie warshawski said otherwise wed be looking for both of you we saw where tori chained up her bike at the seventyfirst and stony bus he caught sight of the body under the shrub butthats tomas maries brother what happened to him he come with the st czeslaw crowd and pass out he moved over to kneel next to tomas come on man get up youve had your fun now get on your feet bernie dropped the shoulder in horror tomas was never going to get up again when boomboom started to join his father at his uncles body bobby grabbed him and pulled him back we gotta get a meat wagon for this guy bernie give his name and particulars to one of the officers here while i get on the squawk box in the squad car and lets see if you recognize our helpful witness lionel one of the uniformed men limped forward bobby introduced him to bernie warshawski but when they went to look for the man in the hawaiian shirt who claimed to have seen tomass assailant he had disappeared just like a damned civiliandont get involved or maybe he didnt want to have to explain what hed been doing in the park all afternoon maybe hed thrown the brick that hit martin luther king hard enough to knock him to the ground jesus theyd been lucky king hadnt needed medical help bobby used the squad car radio to summon a detective when a man arrived to look after tomas wojceks body and to organize a search of the grass around him he turned his own aching body and numbed mind to the task of finding tony warshawski this morning he wouldnt have taken an overheard death threat against a cop seriously but that was beforesomeone had bounced a rock off his own riot helmet and squirted a can of coke into the eyes of one of the men in his detail if tomas wojcek thought he could use the cover of the marquette park massacre to kill tonybut had tony the most peaceable man on the force whacked tomas in the head hard enough to kill him bobby couldnt picture it unless tonyd become as crazed by the heat and the ugliness of the mob as the rest of the cops in the park he got into the squad car bernie and boomboom arrived in and directed the driver to do a sweep of the park using the car loudspeaker he kept calling tonys name or calling out to clumps of cops as he passed to see if any of them had seen warshawski at homan he was directed to the north end of the park where bobby finally ran tony to earth he was pushing a last bunch of rioters into the back of a paddy wagon when mallory and bernie went over to him tony warshawski was a big man close to sixfour like everyone else today his face was red up to the circle cut into his forehead by the riot helmet hed worn all day above it his skin looked almost dead white but when bobby and bernie explained the situation to him his whole face turned ashen beneath its burn victoria she came into this war zone hunting for me oh my god where is she bobby i need a squad i need to find her how can i face gabriella tony ill look youre too tired bernie put an arm around his brothers shoulders you get home stay with gabriella shes just about out of her mind worrying about you and tori both and marie oh my god what a daytomas is dead someone killed him over on the other side of the park how will i tell her that boomboom did your cousin say anything thatboomboom bernard bernard warshawski come back here this minute now the three men looked around twilight was settling in it was hard to see more than fifteen or twenty feet and boomboom had faded into the shrubbery around the lagoon iv as soon as his dad was occupied with uncle tony boomboom slipped off into the park if tori was still here shed be hunting for tony if shed left for home well then she was safe and he boomboom could find out what was so mysterious about wujek tomass death tomas was his least favorite uncle meanspirited prone to pinching boomboom or victoria so hard that he left bruises on their arms or bottoms but it was still unsettling to see him like that dead under a bush and mama she would cry like the world was coming to an end and somehow blame victoria for it when bernie had come home from his afternoon shift at the plant and boomboom told him what had happened marie said headstrong how gabriella spoils her no daughter of mine would run off like that not even a thankyou for lunch no manners of course italian a jew they dont know manners she hadnt wanted bernie to drive over to the parktheyd all seen the reports on television the violence white people fighting the policebut gabriella had telephoned asking for victoria to come home marie had been forced to say that shed run off gabriella arrived two minutes later still in the silk print dress she wore to give lessons her dark eyes two large coals in her pale face she had looked marie in the eye spat and turned on her heel she announced that she was leaving for marquette park at once but of course bernie told her to stay home that hed drive to the park and find tony and victoria boomboom headed for the center of the park away from the knots of cops who still lingered keeping out sightseers or waiting for working squad cars to arrive if their own had been disabled many of the men were lying on the grass helmets at their sides others were using their riot helmets as canteens filling them at the fire hydrants and pouring the water over their sweaty bodies at the lagoons that ringed the interior of the park boomboom was startled to see how many cars had been pushed into the water some had been rolled in so they were upside down he tried to guess how many men it would take to roll a car over and over like that he wondered if the guys he played hockey with could do it as he continued east toward the park entrance on sacramentosince thats where his cousin would have entered the parkhe came on a white convertible whose front end was submerged leaving the back sticking up in the air almost that looked like wujek tomass car his body was over near seventyfirst street this didnt make sense if hed been driving hed have drowned in the car why was the car here and tomas half a mile away boomboom stood next to the wildcat trying to decide if it was his uncles he didnt know the license plate number but there was a little red scratch near the bottom of the drivers door if he could get into the water he might be able to see it he was starting to untie his sneakers when a thumping from inside the trunk startled him if thats your ghost wujek dont worry im not here to hurt your car he called loudly to cover a moments fright boomboom it was his cousins voice faint tremulous tori what are you doing in the trunk he put me there get me out get me out before i die hang on ive got to get the trunk open dont go anywhere i need to find some way to smash the lock im not moving dodo but hurry im fried alive and ive been sick in here her voice ended in a gulp that sounded close to tears boomboom looked frantically around the grounds hed seen guys break into cars plenty of timesalso into trunks he needed something like a chisel and a hammer to break the lock or in the massive amount of junk tossed by the rioters he found a tire iron he ran back to the wildcat and managed to pry open the trunk his cousin was clinging to the spare tire her feet were damp from the lagoon water seeping into the trunk from the backseat and the shirt hed torn earlier in the day was covered with blood and mud and her own vomit she was shaking from head to filthy toe it was all boomboom could do to help her crawl out v it was dark by the time the cousins and their fathers found each other when victoria saw tony she burst into tears pepaiola mia cara cuore mio tony crooned the only italian hed picked up from gabriellamy little pepperpot he called his daughter whats to cry about now huh uncle tomas said he would kill you because he lost his job she sobbed i wanted to warn you but this man this friend of uncle tomass he picked me up and put me in the trunk i was scared papa im sorry but i was scared i didnt want you to die and i couldnt tell you and i didnt want me to die either no sweetheart and neither of us is dead so it all worked out lets get you home so your mama can stop crying her eyes out and give you a bath what man vicki bobby askedthe only person who ever used a nickname that gabriella hated the man with uncle tomas i saw them when theydaddy they gave money to the cop at the intersection and he let them into the park i took his pictureoh my camera he broke the strap and threw my camera away my special camera you gave me papa im sorry i didnt look after it like you made me promise victoria started to cry harder but bobby told her to dry her eyes and pay attention we need you to help us vicki we need to see if your camera is still here if no one stole it so you be a big girl and stop crying and show your uncle bobby where you were when this man picked you up its dark tony protested shes all in bobby victoria frowned in the dark it was where you come into the golf course one of the hills where the holes are on the seventyfirst street side of the park i know there was a statue near me i dont know whose with this much information bobby set up searchlights near the statue of the lithuanian aviators darius and girenas although none of the cops believed theyd find one small brownie camera in the detritus left in the park when boomboom whispered to his cousin the news that tomas was dead and the cops needed to find the man whod been with him victoria miraculously found some reserve of energy from childhoods inexhaustible reservoir she tried to remember in her body how slowly shed moved where shed twisted and turned on the walking paths and finally cut across the grass to the golf course boomboom stayed with her within another five minutes they found the brownie bobby took custody of it promising on his honor as a policeman that hed give the camera back the instant the pictures were developed and the cousins finally got into their fathers separate cars at home they received varying receptions from their mothers both women frantic both doting on their only children each showing it with tears and then a slap for being foolhardy and disobedient but gabriella instantly repented of the slap and took her daughter into the bathroom to shampoo her rough mass of curls herself carissima when will you learn to think first to act next after thinking this tomas this brother of maries he was amafiosoun ladrohe stole from metzgers meats and sold on his own sold the meat to restaurants in wisconsin he blamed the janitor who is a negro man for losing his job because the janitor reported seeing him but your papa is telling me tomas also cheated his capo in the mafia and this was a man also named antoni it is not such a rare name victoria if you asked me i would tell you this thing that your papa is in danger from the calca in the park but not from this brother of marie and then you do not get the most biggest frightening of your life and also then you are not giving me the same gigantic frightening and of course as it turned out when bobby got the pictures developed the man who abducted victoria who flung her into the trunk of the wildcat which he got several spirited youths to push into the lagoon was the tony who worked in don pasquales organization tomas had been stealing meat from metzgers and selling it in wisconsin for the mob but hed taken more than his share of the profits don pasquale sent tony in his red hawaiian shirt to marquette park to kill tomas under cover of the riots the don wasnt happy with tony for letting a little girl with a camera get the best of him he refused to post bail for his henchman so you see carissima è molto importante ask ask think think before you leap on your bicycle and turn my hair white gabriella finished promise me cuore mio promise me this is the last time that from now on you are turning over a fresh page you will become more careful more prudente promettimelo victoria si mamma te lo prometto victoria said you may already be a winner by margaret maron theyve done what oh carlie honey the whitehaired man reached past the coffee cup in front of him and clasped his nieces hand in dismay my sisters not even cold yet and your sisters are already stripping her house smallboned and fairhaired with blue eyes that were redrimmed from crying carlie baxter swallowed past her tears and nodded her silver her good jewelry the two rosewood parlor chairs even greatgrandmothers dollhouse that old thing why they dont have daughters and you were the only one who ever played with it marsha watches antiques roadshow and a similar one was valued at two thousand dollars carlie said bitterly when i came back to the house this morning i thought someone had broken in i almost called the police until mary told me that she and marsha had taken them for safekeeping now that the neighborhoods gone down so much well there is that uncle carlton conceded i tried to get genevieve to sell this place ten years ago when the mcnairy house was broken up into apartments and property values first started sliding but she was so sure the neighborhood would come back to its former glory she enjoyed most of the changes though carlie said with a ghost of a smile she liked the little shops that came in the bodega on the corner children playing on the sidewalks again even the signs in spanish and arabic all the same her uncle said i doubt if youll get half the money she could have gotten ten years ago me carlie asked startled by his comment you the old man shook his head sadly i had no business still being her attorney and i blame myself for not making genevieve update her will but i never expected to outlive my baby sister tears filled his eyes and carlie felt her own eyes sting again she had been named for this man her mothers beloved older brother except for her twin sisters and their sons carlton burke was her only remaining relative a retired attorney who had taken too many pro bono cases to amass a fortune he was almost twenty years older than mom and the closest thing to a grandfather the three sisters ever had carlie adored him mom left this house to me she looked past the archway of the dining room where they sat to the front parlor now denuded of its rosewood chairs and antique dollhouse and tried not to feel a surge of hope after her fathers death his pension and a series of parttime jobs had enabled her mother to continue living in the twostory victorian house and finish raising carlie unlike for her two older sisters though college for carlie had meant student loans and working every minute she could spare from the books two days after she graduated with a degree in french medieval history her mother had stepped out in front of a delivery truck without looking and was thrown into the path of an oncoming car both drivers were horrified and remorseful but clearly not at fault it was assumed that genevieve andrews had been on her way to the nearby bodega full of hope and optimism to buy her weekly lottery tickets carlie had planned to work a year before going on to grad school instead she had spent the last five weeks shuttling back and forth between the hospital where her mother lay in a coma and the house where buster moms elderly dog needed daily insulin shots mary and marsha both wept and then excused themselves for not pitching in more our jobs our sons our husbands oh its so lucky that youre still unencumbered carlie trying not to feel bitter carlie took a deep breath the house was shabby now it needed paint and a new roof and the plumbing was unreliable all the same if it truly was hers to sell then maybe she could register for fall classes immediately instead of waiting a year or maybe she would even spend this year studying in france uncle carlton shook his silver mane regretfully im sorry honey youll be lucky to get enough to pay her debts and its all my fault i should have written another will for genevieve i dont understand you just said the house was mine it is when i wrote the will after your dad died the twins were out of college and she knew it was going to be a struggle for you to go the house was appraised at a quarter million back then so she left fifty thousand to each of your sisters and the rest including all the contents of the houseto you she thought you would end up with at least a hundred and fifty thousand but if the house is only worth half that now i wasnt thinking carlie instead of a dollar amount i should have phrased it so that your sisters each got a fifth and you got threefifths carlie had always been good at mental math thats okay uncle carlton maybe the house is worth more than you think and even if it isnt that still leaves me with what twentyfive thousand again he shook his head not after all her medical bills and funeral expenses are paid well maybe your sisters will be fairminded about the situation they both sighed then knowing just how unlikely that was oh carlie how perfectly awful for you said marsha when the will was read to them after the funeral two days later the fair and equitable thing would be to sell the house and its contents and split anything left over after your mothers debts are paid said uncle carlton i wish we didnt have to take the money said mary but the boys will be starting college themselves in a few years it was no less than he had expected nevertheless he was disappointed by their selfcenteredness and fixed them both with a stern eye just remember that the things you took from the house belong to carlie and shes going to need every penny for her own education you must return them immediately or else pay her their worth but mom always said i was to have her silver and her diamond pin mary protested and she promised me those rosewood chairs and her gold bracelets said marsha with a stubborn look on her face under different circumstances a widowed and childless uncle might have wielded considerable influence but a widowed and childless uncle who barely had enough to live on when carlie was his favorite they would never be openly disrespectful but as far as they were concerned he could whistle down the wind its okay said carlie who hoped to avoid a rift with her sisters but i do want the dollhouse back of course sweetie said mary prepared to be gracious and sisterly now that talk of fairness was behind them well even send the boys over to help you clear the house said marsha they can start by getting rid of all the junk mail mom saved coupons and contest forms stuffed in every cranny you may already be a winner right and i may already be the queen of england do you think she was getting a little senile there was nothing wrong with your mothers mind uncle carlton said sharply but all those magazine subscriptions from publishers clearing house come on uncle carlton who needs twenty magazines coming into the house every month she gave me three trial subscriptions for christmas i know said carlie sensing how much their cynicism cut at the old man i told her that she didnt have to buy anything to enter their sweepstakes but she thought that increased her chances did she honestly believe that the prize patrol was going to show up on her doorstep someday with a check for a million dollars asked mary hope springs eternal carlie said lightly you know mom remember how happy she was when the lottery finally passed last year marsha rolled her eyes not half as happy as i was no more weird magazines my birthday card had five scratchoff cards in it this time i actually won seven dollars i won twelve with the ones in my card mary said smugly lucky for us that she was such a pennyante gambler said marsha i was afraid she might get in over her head spend her grocery money on powerball tickets no said carlie five dollars a week was her limit she loved checking her tickets against the winning numbers remember how close she came to the jackpot back in january for a moment they were united in the memory of their mothers flushed cheeks and sparkling eyes as she told them how she had held her breath when the first five numbers precisely matched the first five on her ticket how certain shed been that it was her lucky day eleven million dollars carlie sighed thinking of france the new jackpots fiftythree million said marsha equally wistful split four ways the everpractical mary reminded her thats still over thirteen million apiece said carlie doing the math in her head wonder why the fourth person hasnt come forward to claim it its been at least three weeks since they announced the winning number probably consulting an investment banker first said uncle carlton taxes are going to take a big chunk and if they dont have a game plan in place the rest will melt away before they know it ive heard that every leech youve ever met comes crawling out of the woodwork said mary as she gathered up her things to go i shared my candy bar with you in kindergarten so why dont you give me a half million for old times sake i read about one man who won forty million and was broke and back on welfare three years later if i ever won i wouldnt tell a soul not even me asked marsha especially not you marys laugh was meant to show that she was joking but marsha still looked miffed when they left true to their word marsha and mary sent their teenage sons over to help and they themselves came every evening after work to sort through the things three generations of baxters had acquired they even brought sandwiches and wine and they helped dig a grave in the backyard for old buster when he went to sleep on his rug beside their mothers empty bed and never woke up again just as well they said you couldnt have taken him to your apartment true but that did not stop her from grieving buster had been a part of her life since her twelfth birthday she told herself she would have found a way to keep him even though her student apartment up at the university was too small to hold all the other things she wished she could keep it was hard not to agonize over every teacup or knickknack that held its own special memory uncle carlton found a trustworthy appraiser who in turn recommended a buyer for all the furnishings he was her rock when grief over what she was losing threatened to overwhelm her or when one of the twins wanted to take a particularly nice piece let me see he would say running his finger down the appraisers list ah here we are dining room family portrait original gilt frame twelve hundred dollars but thats greatgrandfather baxter with his little dog mary cried he shouldnt go out of the family youre absolutely right he told her with an impish grin offer carlie a thousand and i bet shell let you have it three hundred and fifty for that little cream pitcher marsha was appalled made around by a wellknown potter according to the appraiser uncle carlton said blandly reading from the list if it didnt have that chip in the handle itd be worth eight hundred did you hear asked one of the boys as he came downstairs with a load of clothing to be donated to charity it was on the radio that fourth jackpot ticket was sold right here in this city man think of walking around town with a ticket worth thirteen million whoever bought it probably isnt walking around with it said uncle carlton if he has any sense hes stashed it in a safedeposit box a lottery tickets like a bearer bond you dont have to prove its yours to cash it in by the end of the week it felt as if they had barely scratched the surface although most of the closets and cupboards had been emptied of personal keepsakes basement and attic were still jammed full and their fathers study had not yet been touched except for moms bedroom this was the most personal room in the house and in unspoken agreement the sisters kept putting off the dismantling of both rooms the corner bedroom was bright and airy organdy curtains hung at the windows a flowersprigged comforter covered the bed and the carpet was bright with pink roses in contrast the study downstairs had a single stainedglass window it was small and dark with floortoceiling bookcases that held nondescript paperback books of no particular value the only furniture was a massive desk a swivel chair and a comfortable leather recliner yet their mother had claimed the room as her own after their father died she said the recliner made her feel as if he still had his arms around her this was where she read in the evenings this was also where she wrote letters paid bills and stashed receipts and proofs of purchase in the big rolltop desk it had cubbyholes and slots and even a secret compartment that held a lock of their grandmothers hair placed there by their sentimental grandfather on the shelves immediately behind the desk were stacks of unread magazines and plastic boxes stuffed to the brim with more bits of paper most of which read important save this receipt if yours is the winning number you must present this stub to validate your prize all week uncle carlton had encouraged them to dump books and photograph albums and boxes of letters from other parts of the house inside the door for a more careful perusal later every time someone opened a drawer and found a new cache of papers he told them a fresh tale of careless heirs who threw out stock certificates or promissory notes or valuable autographed letters in their haste to be done we ought to let the boys bag up all this stuff and haul it out to the curb said mary wearily surveying the messy stacks on the floor the desktop and the shelves around the desk no said carlie uncle carltons right one of us really ought to go through it not me said marsha who was as thoroughly tired of the whole process as mary besides if theres anything valuable in that pile of trash it would belong to you not us their sons were huffing impatiently it was saturday night and their plans for the evening did not include hanging around till their aunt decided what to save and what to toss i agree that one should never throw papers away without examining them first said uncle carlton but not tonight anybody up for tunisian food theres a new little restaurant around the corner my treat mary frowned everythings changed so much isnt that where carlyles used to be carlyles has been gone for five years marsha reminded her and good riddance uncle carlton said cheerfully tough steaks and soggy potatoes this new place serves a wonderful felfel mahchi everythings made fresh on the premises and they go easy on the harissa so you dont feel as if your mouths on fire thanks but no thanks said mary those places never look very clean to me they stepped outside into a hot summer evening and as they waited for carlie to lock the door they noticed a crowd of people clustered around a television camera truck parked in front of the corner bodega go see whats happening marsha told the boys they were off like rabbits and back almost as fast guess what thats where the fourth lottery ticket was sold really one of these people impossible to miss the disdain in marys voice they still dont know who has it said one of the boys but it was definitely bought here about eight weeks ago marsha sniffed probably by someone who cant read english and doesnt know hes won as they passed the little grocery store people spilled out of the place laughing and exclaiming for the television camera it was almost like a fiesta one of the new neighbors greeted carlie by name and began to tell her their speculations about the lucky buyer uncle carlton looked pensive i wonder he murmured then no its too improbable although he did not elucidate marsha glanced at mary whose own eyes had suddenly widened shortly before midnight carlie was awakened by a thump from the study directly beneath the room where she slept she sat up in bed and listened only the sound of an occasional passing car broke the latenight stillness she lay back down and was almost asleep again when another thump made it clear that she was not alone in the house the streetlights outside gave more than enough light as she slipped out of bed and looked around for a weapon nothing and she had left her cell phone in her purse on a table by the front door carlie did not consider herself a brave person but she could not cower up here while someone helped himself to whatever he could find when she eased open the door into the hallway she saw her fathers old leather golf bag at the top of the stairs she carefully pulled out the nine iron and tiptoed down the stairs the door to the study was open a narrow crack and the desk lamp was on there was movement by the desk and she heard a drawer squeak open then the rustle of papers moving closer to the door she cautiously pushed it open and froze in surprise mary marsha her sisters must have jumped a foot carlie you almost gave us a heart attack then were even i thought you were burglars what are you doing here mary lost an earring marsha said and we came back to look for it in the desk mary gave an impatient shrug in the desk on the desk under it who knows i remember that when i was looking at the books over here the back of my earring felt tight i must have loosened it too much andah here it is she said triumphantly although carlie thought she saw the earring flash in her sisters hand before she actually plucked it from the floor im sorry we woke you i thought we could just slip in and out without disturbing you you run on back to bed now and well let ourselves out thats okay said carlie ill watch to make sure you get to your car safely marsha started to argue but mary said thanks sweetie and maybe youd better put the dead bolt on you never know the next person might be a real burglar uncle carlton arrived early the next morning to take her to breakfast when carlie told him of her midnight adventure he immediately called a locksmith he had once represented even though it was sunday morning his old client came out and changed the lock within the hour but why carlie asked im only going to be here a few more nights at the most humor an old man he said when the locksmith had finished his work and handed him two new keys ill keep one you put the other one on your key ring and promise me you wont have duplicates made for your sisters but no buts he said sternly now come along i know where there are fresh bagels and the best coffee in town when they returned an hour later mary and marsha were cooling their heels on the front steps both were furious you changed the locks why asked marsha before carlie could answer uncle carlton said that was my doing girls we dont know how many keys genevieve might have given out over the years and id be derelict as carlies attorney if i didnt take this simple precautionary step to be sure that no one removed anything until she had signed off on it carlie voiced her surprise at seeing them i thought you were taking the day off we decided that if you could keep going we could too thats nice said uncle carlton actually said mary we have a proposition for you carlie proposition you have everything from the house that you want to keep right carlie nodded i guess so youve been down here so long you must be dying to get back to your own apartment so why dont you let marsha and me finish up here oh no i couldnt possibly do that the younger woman protested sure you can everythings on the inventory sheets we wont take a single thing on it without paying you full value carlie clasped their hands impulsively thank you marsha mary but really theres not that much left to do another big push by all of us and we could be done by the middle of the week if the boys will bag up the papers uncle carltons offered to go through them at his house the old man rubbed his hands in anticipation once the papers are cleared away im anxious to see if i can find all the secret compartments in that desk compartments asked mary theres more than one asked marsha at least two that i know of he told them cheerfully genevieve showed me how to open them years ago but something she said makes me think there may even be a tiny third one the twins exchanged glances then mary said marsha and i have talked it over and weve decided it was selfish of us to let moms will stand you were right uncle carlton the only fair thing is to sell the house pay her debts and then split whatevers left three ways carlie was incredulous really really they assured her uncle carlton beamed at them there now i just knew you girls would come through for your sister he pulled a folded legal paper from the breast pocket of his jacket lets go right down to the bodega and make it official bodega asked marsha official asked mary the owners a notary public hell witness your signatures and ill give your waiver to the county clerk of court when i file the will i drew up this form last week hoping youd do the right thing for carlie before they could protest he herded the three sisters down to the bodega where they showed the bemused owner their drivers licenses he carefully examined each in turn as they signed the document then carefully embossed it with his heavy seal and signed his own name and date on the proper lines in the legal world its a truism that you never really know someone until youve shared an inheritance with him for the rest of your lives uncle carlton told the twins you will always be glad you treated your sister so fairly genevieve would have been proud of you carlie glowed with happiness at the thought of france and of registering for fall courses are you sure you dont mind if i head back this afternoon were positive they told her go all right she said giving them more hugs i will and you dont need to stay either uncle carlton said marsha well take care of everything when the house sold two months later carlie came back to town to sign the final papers and pick up her share of the money the sale had brought more than uncle carlton expected and even after all their mothers debts were paid each daughter wound up with thirtysix thousand remember that lottery ticket that was sold at the bodega asked carlie as she and her uncle lingered over dinner that night no one ever cashed it in did they theres still plenty of time he replied another three months anyhow youre going to laugh at me she said turning her wineglass in her slender fingers but on the drive back to school i started thinking about how that ticket was bought a couple of weeks before moms accident but the winning number wasnt announced till after she was in a coma it made me wonder if that was the real reason marsha and mary came back to the house that night and were rummaging through the desk that maybe they thought mom was finally a winner and you were worried that youd exchanged a few thousand for thirteen million asked her uncle crazy i know carlie said with a rueful smile not at all he said it could have happened that way after all someone has to win and its logical that your sisters would consider it when the ticket was bought at her store and no one came forward with it it would have been all yours if they hadnt agreed to set aside the will and share the estate equally they certainly checked every shred of paper twice and im afraid your fathers desk was rather the worse for wear after they finished hunting for its secret compartments with a crowbar carlie shook her head i thought mom was the only gambler in the family but the twins gambled that the winning ticket was in the desk and you gambled that it wasnt i never gamble he told her except on sure things there was only one secret compartment in that desk but you mean you tricked them into signing that agreement guilty as charged he said happily it was for their own good too now they wont spend the rest of their lives avoiding you because they treated you shabbily and in all fairness they werent terribly angry with me for getting mixed up about the desk they put it down to encroaching senility you sly old fox she patted his hand affectionately thank you for my inheritance and for my sisters genevieve sent them lottery tickets in their birthday cards what about you my dear carlie shook her head my birthdays not till october a pity he reached for the wine bottle and divided the remainder between their two glasses my birthday was last month i know carlie said sadly the day after moms accident when the card came i was so upset and worried about her that i just stuck it on my desk and never gave it another thought until after the funeral when the twins said that she had started sending lottery tickets in their cards instead of magazine subscriptions carlie stared at him openmouthed you mean her uncle nodded then lifted his glass with an upward glance to the heavens your mother was always a winner in my book dies irae by dorothy salisbury davis brutal murder she could still at ninety remember the bold headline in the hope valley news and she could remember listening from the top of the stairs to her mother and father arguing in the kitchen about whether or not they would go to the funeral margaret you dont even know if theyll hold a wake for him wake or no they have to bury the man dont they youll go alone if youre going tom i knew he was trouble from the night i first laid eyes on him a mouth like a soft prune and eyes youd think were going to roll out of his head yes she could remember the very words for they were her mothers and therefore her own all three of them her mother and father and the girl she was then went to the funeral there were people there she didnt even know and she had thought she knew everyone in hopetown she was her fathers daughter in that you couldnt get him away talking to everyone he met on the street her mother would always wait in the car her mothers two cousins first cousinsshe called them aunt mary and aunt norahstood next to each other beside the grave but with room enough between them for another grown person maybe there was she had thought and tried to imagine what denny would have looked like with half his head blown off father conway always prayed as though he had a train to catch ed mcnair the sheriff was there and several deputies her father wasnt wearing his deputy sheriff badge donel rossa was there when the gravediggers loosened the straps to lower the coffin what flashed through her mind was the story her mother once had told her of the man who brought his wife coffin and all home to ireland and buried her on land he claimed was stolen from him shed never found out if it was a true story or one of many her mother made up in time she had asked her aunt mary if it was true for the sisters had come from the same village as her mother on the coast of the irish sea she could as well as not have made it up an answer the very ambiguity of which she had somehow found satisfying she had discovered you could tell the truth with a lie that may have been the moment when she first knew she was going to be a writer the sisters could barely have been more different from one another norah the older was thirtyfour tending to fatten as she grew older she smiled a lot but it never seemed to mean much on and off mary said if she ever laughed it was under her breath mary having met with a lifetimes share of troubles tended at thirtytwo to make fun of both her sisters and her own foibles rheumatism was already hacking away at her joints she was more bone than flesh anyway and her very blue eyes were sometimes shot red with pain the devil trying to work his way in as she put it norah was convinced he had already made it it was late on a morning of early august heat when mary saw him come out from the shade of the last elms that arched main street he stopped at the mailbox by norahs walk and seemed to study the names norahs was first marys scratched beneath it as though it was an afterthought which in a way it was after deciding perhaps which of the women it was he saw in the field between house and barn he came directly to her he stepped with care to avoid the potatoes she had forked from the ground he was unshaven and younger than she had thought at a distance and for an instant she felt she had seen him before he was youngold or better oldyoung his clothes werent shabby but theyd not been in a washtub for a while nor had he but his kind was not uncommon on the road men without work some wanting it some not the grain harvest then silofilling were soon ahead youre mary ohearn are you maam she looked hard at himsomething familiar againand he moistened his lips before saying more youre welcome to a cup of water there at the pump mary said the pump with the well beneath it stood a few feet from the faded red building she had converted from barn to the house she lived in beyond the pump and shrouded in rosebushes was the outhouse she still used norah had indoor plumbing his eyes shifted from the pump to the outhouse then back to her would it trouble you if i asked to use the wee house it would but she nodded and dug the fork into the ground to lean on while she waited for him to go and come back cows eyes she thought dark and murky if he was irish and she felt he was a spaniard had got in there somewhere black irish they called them with his looks at home when he came back he asked dont you remember the skinny runt of a kid that sang at your wedding thats what they used to call me skinnyrunt mary grunted remembering not the child but the man beside her with tears in his eyes when she suddenly looked up at him she could still hear the high sweet trill of song but what she had always seen remembering was the tears what was it you sang the ave maria thats what i always sang the ave maria and your name denny dennis ohearn the same as yours it was my fathers brother michael you were married to may he rest in peace there was almost mockery in the sound from her throat neither peace nor prayer came easy to her your voice has dropped a notch or two since then i was afraid it wouldnt ever he said she gave a snort of amusement she brought him a cup of tea with bread and jam where he sat on the bench by the door by then she was sure norah would have a crick in her neck trying to see what was going on bring your cup she led the way into the house through the kitchen and into the room she called her parlor the house was cool and dark more walls than windows she lit the one electric lamp and moved it to where it cast light on the portrait above the couch thats him denny said looking up at the tinted photograph lifesize head and breast of a young policeman in his highbuttoned uniform his mustaches bristled and his eyes had spark i wouldnt think id remember him so well but i do mary turned off the light and they went outdoors again without speaking he knew when to keep his mouth shut mary thought within months of her marriage to michael ohearn he was killed in the line of duty she squinted in the sudden sun to have a longer look at dennis i dont see any resemblance at all my mothers name was castillo so shed been right about the spanish strain by midafternoon he had picked all the potatoes shed harvested in two days digging it was easier for her to dig them up than to pick them and shed have paid a boy from the town a nickel a bushel she put off deciding whether to offer him the sixtyfive cents she watched him wash his hands and face at the pump and shake himself dry she thought of the dog she no longer had he wiped the dust from his shoes one leg against the other city shoes she decided even though they were highlaced broken in a hundred miles south on the streets of chicago have you no baggage she asked i left a carryall with the stationmaster ive to pick it up before dark the mean bastard she said it would kill him to turn on a light if there wasnt a train coming in he went back into the town before suppertime and about time norah thought she had watched off and on the whole afternoon and almost ruined a pattern trying to watch and use the scissors at the same time as soon as he passed her housea queerlooking dark fellow half indian she thought with the reservation a few miles northshe went across to where mary was washing the smallest potatoes have you lost your senses taking a stray like that into the house and letting him use your convenience convenience mary mocked you could catch something from the likes of him i could and wouldnt that surprise you mary gave her a bark of a laugh not in the least norah said fairly sure she was being made fun of im thinking ill fix a cot for him in the back kitchen so hes coming back is he and why not the hospitality of the house and never a word to me mary amnt i telling you now when youve already made up your mind there was a piece in the paper last week if you ever read it a mans watch stolen right from the table where he was asleep in his bed my old clock wouldnt bring much mary said then she told her sister you cant call him a stray norah hes michaels nephew his own brothers son norah sucked in her breath needing all of it michael more than ten years dead ought to have been out of their lives but he never would bea man she had never met never wanted to meet married to a sister she was sure she had saved from the streets after he died many times since she wished she hadnt and near as many times said so to mary when goaded by her out of this roiling memory she cried did you invite him to come did you know he was coming what a crooked mind you have mary said i didnt know who he was till he told me he sang at my wedding a wisp of a boy then he sang like an angel even michael cried his name is dennis dennis ohearn mary lifted her chin saying it as though he was a child of her own norah thought with another surge of anger she was as barren herself as mary more so an old maid the two lavery sisters had been brought over from ireland one after the other before either was twenty by the childless couple from whom norah inherited the farm lock stock and barrel it was not written into the bequest but confided to the priest as well as to norah that it was hoped she would take care of her sister if ever she returned in need mary had run away within a year of her arrival she was not greatly missed except by the farmer who had grown too fond of her norah could see the change come over mary it was always like that with her after she had been mean mary touched her toe to the mound of potatoes the size of marbles will you take a handful of these for your supper i will theyre sweeter by far than the big ones aye why shouldnt they be coming to you for nothing she knocked the soap from the dish by the pump and filled it bring the dish back the next time you come when norah was halfway along the path mary called listen for the telephone in case i ring you later mary was never without a drop of whiskey in the house she kept a small flask of it under her pillow to ease the pain at night everyone knew but nobody told in the town where she got it it would be a sad day for her when prohibition ended and the end was in sight theyd be shipping the real thing in from canada and it wouldnt be half as good as what she got from donel rossa rossa belonged to the first generation american irish who farmed the rich soil of southern wisconsin his principal crop was corn which he sold to a variety of consumers some no doubt to members of his family said to have connections with the chicago underworld something mary kept hidden in her heart was that soon after michael was killed she began to receive like clockwork and wherever she was a pint every month marked holy water since her coming back from chicago it was delivered by donel himself and if ever she mentioned paying him for it hed say ah mary michael ohearn was a fine man it comes to you with his pension god and mary knew the pension could take a supplement but whenever question of where it was coming from bothered her a tweak of pain put her conscience if not her bones at ease donel was older than the sisters closer in years to the old couple who had brought them over mary hadnt become close friends with him until she moved out of norahs house saying shed rather live in the barn the barn was an empty shell by then norah had auctioned off livestock equipment everything but the barn doors and since donel had had a hand along with father conway in bringing mary back to where she wasnt wanted hed undertaken to help make the barn livable he was the first one mary phoned to come round that night after supper ive someone here i want you to meet come and bring the missus and ill bring a smile he promised a smile his word for a bottle as though she hadnt expected it norah as usual put off going over for as long as she could stand not to go she wanted them to wonder what was keeping her and at the same time suspected they wouldnt miss her if she didnt show up at all they never tired of singing the old songs over and over and she could hear the thump of marys stick on the floor as she beat time when there was a quiet minute she imagined them passing the bottle to all there except margaret and toms lump of a girl pretending to be asleep on the couch norah got her shawl from the hall stand went out the front door and locked it behind her you never could tell at night she moved with caution along the path guided only by her memory of it in daylight rossas voice was the loudest it always was she didnt like him he treated mary better than he did his wife for one thing but closer to the truth of it norah was sure he did not like her she could never forget the look he had given her when she clapped her hands at news of marys marriage the smile on his face had seemed to say so now its all yours all yours hed been right of course and he was the one who came to tell her marys husband was dead so soon she would swear it was his cold eye that kept pity from coming over her now as she neared the barn she tried to listen for a new voice among the familiar the angel gabriel couldnt be heard over rossa and the thump of marys stick dennis ohearn wasnt badlooking when you saw him up close she decided but she would never have taken him for an irishman there was a hangdog look to him big sad eyes that reminded her of the dog mary wanted to bring into the house when they lived together now he picked up on a tune margaret hummed for him and put the words to it norah had not heard it before a nursery song nor had she heard a voice like his deep and dark and soft as velvet her love for music was the truest thing in norahs life it drew her to high mass on sundays and prompted her to buy a piano as soon as she had money it stood mute in her living room save for the few chords she had taught herself to play so that she might know there was music in it it was strange the way dennis ohearns and her gaze met and locked as though their eyes had got accidentally tangled he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand to hide a smile she felt and she sensed her color rising to the roots of her hair she caught at the foot of the girl stretched on the couch shed had to push it aside to make room for herself the young one pulled her foot away so fast norah almost lost her balance she flashed her a smile when shed rather have pinched her the upstart mimicked her smile back at her the room was stuffy and smelled of the men sweat and tobacco smoke and the cow barn and a whiff of marys liniment mary called this one big room her parlor norah always thought it resembled a gypsys nest to be sure shed never seen one but for example instead of a door to the kitchen the frame was hung with a curtain of beads mary had bought off a peddlers wagon the beads rattled if a wind came up or when someone passed from room to room marys nook of a bedroom was to one side chopped out of the kitchen if dennis ohearn roamed through the house at night it occurred to norah mary would hear him part the curtain would she call him in to the side of her bed and ask him to rub liniment into her knees surely not but mary was that way she was as easy with men as she was with women the songs they sang came most of them out of the golden book of songs norah had a pristine copy of it on her piano at home marys copy looked like an old prayer book that had lost its covers she tried to picture how this lot would fit in her parlor where the piano took so much of the room mary when first shed seen it let out a whoop holy mother of god it looks just like reverend mother they wouldnt fit at all norah decided they just didnt belong there can you sing mother machree dennis rossa asked i dont think its in the book theres a place in my heart which no colleen can own he started not waiting for dennis to answer suppose dennis could play the piano she thought there were people who played by ear and he might he picked up on mother machree and he knew the words by heart before he could finish rossa demanded that old irish mother of mine give me a minute dennis said let the man wet his whistle mary said isnt there a drop left in the bottle rossa sent his wife out to the car for the spare he kept hidden there norah the girls mother leaned toward her shed seen what happened between her and the upstart but that wasnt on her mind at all do you remember the queer woman at home whod come out on the castle grounds just before dark shed sing the last rose of summer dont you remember a veil round her head so you couldnt see her face but every night shed be there you know better than ask norah about something back home mary said shed turn to salt if she said the word ireland that was mary i rememberi remember the roses on the castle grounds norah said and the wreath they sent of them for our mothers funeral oh for the love of god mary said out of patience dennis sang the last rose of summer there was no beat mary could thump to liven the last rose of summer and she felt the party turning into slop she pulled herself up from her chair and announced she was going to fire up the kitchen stove and make tea she swiped at the curtain with her stick and set it jingling i think ill go home now norah said its been such a grand evening dennis was on his feet before she was ill walk you home miss lavery he said then you dont need to come back mary snapped quick as a dart you could hear the chirp of the crickets oh dear dear me rossa said then tom dixon added treacle stay a while longer norah and well all go out together mary would have as soon seen them all go out then a man as fond of the military as tom was known to be you wouldnt have thought such an appeaser but it was dennis ohearn who set things right again please come back and sit down aunt mary i know how to fire up the stove and ill put on the kettle for you denny will you put the kettle on took on a familiar ring in the next few days and finding that it pleased her he brought her a cup of tea every morning as soon as he heard the creak of her bedstead it was what he had done for his own mother till the day she died she never wanted more than a half cup shed send me to spill it out if there was more and it had to be hot as blazes then shed let it cool off before she drank it she wanted you more than she did the tea mary told him denny shrugged if it was so he didnt understand it mary did not lie long abed on these harvest days or many others for that matterbut with morning tea and afternoon tea and the cup she would say she was perishing for in the evening she learned enough about denny to know why he had come to her the last of four boys and by ten years the youngest he could remember his father saying he should have drowned him the day he was born the runt of the litter until he discovered when denny started to school with the sisters that he had a voice the nuns called sacred hed hire me out for weddings or funerals for a dollar or two hed give me a nickel and spend the rest before my mother got her hand out it was not the first time mary had heard a story like it would you like to hear me sing the dies irae he offered i would not most of marys necessities were obtained through barter and while she was frugal she was not miserly but denny wasnt long with her before she began to calculate the toll it took of her preserves and garden produce to bring home a pound of bacon the first time donel rossa stopped by after the night of dennis arrival she broached the possibility of finding a job for denny in the valley so youve decided to keep him rossa said youre a soft touch mary mary caught something in his tone too intimate for her taste did you have something to do with him coming donel whatever makes you ask a question like that it struck me he might be something else that came with my pension rossa found a place clear of their feet to spit youre sharp as a tack this morning mary i should be ive sat on a few rossa laughed he toed the spittle into the ground you know mary the holy water is going to run dry im not saying the statell go dry god forbid the dutchmen have a powerful thirst for their beer and theyve a throttle on the legislature mary pulled him over to the bench and hung on to his arm sit down here and tell me what youre saying she was never long on patience its time im thinking about time and change i have a horse that climbs the fence whenever i start up the truck he goes wild but any day now ill go out and see him nuzzling the radiator and the next thing you know hell be willing to go tandem with it its what the wear of time does to man and beast youre an old fart donel only mary could say it with affection she pointed to where denny was crawling from one currant bush to another at the bottom of the field hell be coming up from there any minute i sent him back to strip them clean now hell be counting every currant he puts in the basket have you sent him around the town to make inquiries hell need more starch in him for that mary said well there isnt a hell of a lot of that in the family ah now mary ive offended you rossa said for her chin shot out michael had the heart of a lion what about norah isnt there work she could put him to shed eat him alive rossa changed the subject in a hurry the nuns brought him up pretty well didnt they he can do his sums mary said hes not a child you know and hes strong as a bull he was digging ditches for the city of chicago till they ran out of money i hate to tell you what that qualifies him for on the farm mary she grunted and isnt the world full of it denny came up as rossa was about to leave his face was as red as the currants do you want to do a days work for me on the farm now and then rossa asked him a dollar a day and your grub on the farm dennis said as though to be sure didnt i say on the farm would i be sending you to australia and youll have to walk the five miles or hitch a ride on the road i could pay aunt mary for my keep denny reasoned aloud but in no hurry to take up the offer why mary wondered when half the country was out of work and why the aunt mary which had been dropped after the first day thats the idea lad rossa said as though to a child it wasnt starch denny needed it was yeast but mary was pleased too at the prospect of getting him out from under her feet now and then as long as it wasnt to norah norah had no great opinion of herself though most people thought the opposite trying to get denny out of her mind she kept at the sewing machine until her eyes were bleary and her foot going numb on the treadle she excused her backandforth trips to the window as the need to relieve cramps in her leg she said the hail mary every time but she knew very well that her true intention was to catch sight of denny going about his chores she even numbered his trips to the outhouse and noted when he carried marys pot with him though it turned her stomach to think of it not often but often enough to give her a surge of pleasure and only when mary was not in sight hed send a little salute her waythe tip of his fingers to his forehead to her sometimes she left the window open and sang while she worked harking back to songs of her childhood even as margaret had to the last rose of summer it wasnt true that she despised ireland that was mary belittling her it was ireland that let her go mary was the one with a passion for america but this was norahs busiest season the handmedowns were patched and freshened at home but in most hopetown families the oldest child got a new outfit at the start of the school year and as often as not norah was chosen over sears roebuck to provide the girls dresses no one at least to norahs knowledge ever remarked on the similarity between norahs new dresses and last years fashion in the sears catalogue the morning rossa came by and talked with mary and then with denny norah guessed rightly what it was about she intercepted denny on his way into town for mary that afternoon will you be going to work for donel she asked outright to be sure of a yes or no before mary interfered hes a hard man dennis i was thinking that myself and ill have to walk five miles before starting the days work doing what do you know denny its on the farm i made sure of that where else norah wondered but before she could ask mary was at the barn door shouting to him amnt i waiting for the sugar get on with you man dennis went on and norah sought out mary in her kitchen ive sugar enough to let you have five pounds mary hell be back in time she was picking over a great basin of currants her hands stained bloodred thank you anyway an afterthought norah settled on a kitchen chair she almost overflowed it creaked with her weight youre fading away to a ton mary said with pleasure where the inspiration came from norah would never know the thought just came up and out ive decided its time to get rid of all those things of theirs in the cellar they or theirs always referred to the couple who had brought her over from ireland theres some i kept for you if you remember when you first wanted a place of your own you might want to take a look at them now a little twitch of marys nose betrayed her interest and norah pressed on the wash boilerpure copperi ought to have sold it she began and the mirror it wouldnt hurt you to take a look at yourself now and then as soon as the jelly was sealed in jars mary took dennis with her to norahs they went first to the cellar door but norah waved them around it was his first time in her house and she didnt even ask him to wipe his feet dennis great dark eyes took in everything mary gave him time to see she nudged him on with the knob of her cane he wasnt a dumb animal norah thought but she smiled and bit her tongue above all she wanted him to see the piano mary shoved him past the parlor door norah had to lift the door to the storage room where it sagged on the hinges and scraped the floor maybe i could fix that denny said some rainy day when mary has nothing for you to do thatll be the day mary said but by then her curiosity was picking up and she was the first into the room where there was only a whisper of light from the groundlevel window norah pulled the electric switch mary let out a squeak of pleasure at things she thought on sight she had a use for then she settled down to a careful selection one glance at her own reflection eliminated the mirror nor did she want norahs junk denny figured the most in her calculation of course the clothes wringer for example would have to be fastened to the sink board in the kitchen where the only running water in her place came in shed not have needed it for her bits and pieces but laundering a mans wear could put a terrible strain on her knotty hands denny carted the wringer to the cellar door norah her arms folded watched with an eagles eye mary thought couldnt you go and sit down somewhere id be willing to help norah said isnt that what im talking about on dennys next trip between the storeroom and the cellar door he brought back an old kitchen chair hed seen near the furnace he even dusted it with his bare hand norah sat god save the queen mary cried norahs eyes and dennys met even as at the party but not this time by accident what she felt was like an electric shock she was sure they had struck a bond mary thumped her stick against a humpbacked trunk that stood beneath the window norah snapped out of her reverie leave that mary all but clapped her hands is it the bones of a lover shed read the story long ago watch out for yourself denny she was enjoying herself norah thought making fun of her that was mary her own thoughts turned to what she could do or say that might engage dennis there wasnt much left in the roomthe big wardrobe the mirror some picture frames shed thought shed use but hadnt the trunk full enough but not of bones and the rusted garden tools even mary wouldnt want and here among them half shrouded by an old umbrella where she herself had hidden it one winters night was the old mans shotgun mary hobbled to the outside door with a yardstick to measure whether they could get the wardrobe out that way she had begun to think of making a room of his own for denny there was room enough in the barn sure norah got up and took the chair back herself to where it had come from when she returned she saw that denny had discovered the gun he was bent over trying to see it better but not daring to touch aunt norah he looked round his eyes jumping out of his head not now she said and chanced a wink he winked back there was no way denny could transport the big cupboard from house to barn without help mary cursed the rheumatism and norah refused to make a fool of herself trying it was decided between the sisters that the wardrobe could wait till donel rossas next visit mary and denny left by the cellar door norah locked it turned off the light and went upstairs she wasnt sure what had happened to her but whatever it was had never happened to her before mary put up her first crop of tomatoes by the end of the week dennis kept the kitchen range at top heat under the copper boiler and though mary denied her need for the clock just to be sure she set the alarm for each step the sweat ran down both their faces and when a great drop fell from the tip of marys nose into a bowl of tomatoes she cackled sure they needed more salt in the evening they sat at the kitchen table where mary marked labels marys best for the jars she would seal with a final turn before bedtime hope valley market would take all she could provide through the open window they could hear an occasional car go by and the singsong chatter of katydids and closer overhead the frantic buzz of an insect caught on the sticky tape that dangled from the light sometimes music wafted their way from norahs radio dennis tilted back in his chair though shed asked him not to do it he sat upright suddenly and pinching his nose began to sing im just a vagabond lover my god mary said where did you learn that from the radio didnt you ever hear rudy vallee id just as soon not mary said try it without the clothespin he grinned cleared his throat and sang it in his own voice the voice of the child she remembered was gone but there was a deep sad music in what she heard do you miss the city denny no neither do i she said it seemed many yesterdays since shed come out from chicago on the train with donel rossa to norahs chilly welcome both sisters were alongside the road when the threshing combine on its way to rossas came rattling through town and stopped for denny men aboard the last rig gave him a hand up and all of them waved at norah and mary who watched until the blinding sunrise washed them out of sight children up at dawn to follow the caravan through town went home to breakfast and the sisters turned into their own walkways mary resented norahs being there but it was not in her heart to part without a word will you have a cup of tea the kettles on the back of the stove norah would rather have gone home more and more she felt the presence of dennis to be everywhere in marys house she even avoided seeing the cot where he slept in the back kitchen but what she said was let me close the front door and ill be over oh for the love of god mary said doors were anathema to her norah pulled a chair out from the kitchen table im leery of that one mary said from the stove i cant break him of the habit of teetering on the back legs of a chair youd think they were rockers i wont teeter norah said the chair creaked when she sat down and i wont be staying more than a minute mary brought the teapot and swirled the tea before she poured it it was on the tip of her tongue to say thisll put hair on your chest but she held it back she was trying to cure herself of saying the common things like it she had picked up god only knew from where norah helped herself to sugar whatever milk mary had was always on the turn in summer she could have kept it in the well like the couple used to did you want the old trunk in the storeroom badly mary i could empty it out what would i be putting in it and what will you put in the cupboard when you get it over wont he be getting clothes one of these days and needing a place to hang them norah was sure now she shouldnt have come she felt hurt pushed out she wanted to push back ive been going through the things ive kept in the trunk all these yearsi was thinking id make a rag rug of them someday but i never didher petticoats and his flannel shirts the shirts would fit denny you know i could shorten the sleeves for him marys face shriveled up like an old womans and the spittle sprayed from her mouth before she could speak keep his filthy shirts to yourself theyre all yours do you think id let him put them on his back it was a long time ago mary if it was forever would i forget it i know how you feel you know how i feel theres more feeling in this teapot than in you norah struggled to get up i dont have to take this from you mary i could turn you out if i wanted and nobodyd say i did wrong it wasnt my fault he made a strumpet out of you didnt you beg them to bring you over ill do anything that wants doing you wrote i read them your lettersshe couldnt readand i remember him sitting there laughing to himself isnt she the lively one now hed say he treated me like dirt from the day you arrived the two of you making fun of me behind my back i never told on you i never complained to her but she knew shed sit at the sewing machine and cry to herself at the mention of tears her own eyes filled not at what she remembered but at the feeling of emptiness building inside her im trying to help you if only youd let me ive tried ever since the day you came back even father conway says i could not have done more nor cared less mary said will you go home out of here norah youre like a great fat hen scratching everything into your nest cluck cluck cluck cant you leave him and me alone you think you own him body and soul norah blurted out youd hire him out to your bootlegger friend but you wouldnt let him wash a window in my house mary put her hand up to shield her face norah looked about to strike her and norah had never wanted more to hit her across the mouth but she pulled back and made her way toward the door she stopped and looked round at a burst of laughter from mary oh my god mary shouted youre in love with him norah quicksmiled you cant say that mary havent you always said poor norah she cant love anybody except herself rossa stopped for a word with mary when he brought denny back on his way into town i was wrong about him mary hes not all muscle hes got a brain up there and get him to sing home on the range for you arent you the one mary said sparing herself having to thank him christopher columbus could not have had more to tell returning from america than denny coming back from donel rossas farm did you learn how to milk a cow mary asked and how to squirt milk in the cats mouth denny said mary remembered learning to milk and the kick of the cow who didnt think much of how she went about it and she thought of norahs going on about how she had begged to be brought over shed known when she landed shed never go back in steerage sick as a dog all the way and him threatening to send her back if she didnt give in to him lie down on the bale there and turn up your arse shed never got over it even with michael and norah saying i know how you feel norah had gone home and pulled down the blinds on the windows that faced the barn when she came out of the house it was by the front door and she never looked across nor had she hung a stitch on the clothesline i didnt get to do much milking denny said its terrible hard on the wrists you know is it now would you teach your granny to milk ducks denny told things in spurts hed have told them better mary thought if theyd had a tune to them how the men on the wagon took the pitchfork away from him and made him load the sheaves by hand i couldnt get the hang of it you see they said id be murdering them and mrs rossas pies the look of them made your mouth water only shed made a mistake and put salt instead of sugar in them you shouldve seen donel i thought he was going to hit her but he put his arm around her at the last minute and told the men ill make it up to you and he sure did two bottles he told me after he was taking an awful chance one of the ones he didnt know couldve been a spy a revenue agent rossa had kept dennis a day and a night after the combine pushed on to the next farm and to hear denny tell it nothing as wonderful had ever happened to him before he discovered rossas collection of guns that he kept locked in the harness room rossa was a hunter he showed denny how to load and carry a shotgun and had taken him out at dawn that very morning to shoot at the crows where they were cleaning up grain left in the harvest stubble i told him about the gun in norahs storeroom you didnt even see it i bet ive seen it mary said its a shotgun donel says i knew that myself when i seen his he says if norah would let me borrow it hed help me clean it up and oil it and hell take me hunting with him in the fall they hunt small game with itsquirrels and rabbits he told me you can make a better rabbit stew than mrs rossa once in my life mary said once in my life donel skinned it for me and i pretended it was an old rooster denny pulled his chair closer to hers he wet his lips would you ask aunt norah for me she should never have taken him over there mary thought but shed been all over that with herself and she ought not to have made fun of norah blurting out that she was in love though she didnt believe it for a minute from the way norah was carrying on since mary wasnt sure what was going on with her ill have to think about it mary said shed begun to feel sorry for her sister the boob the big blubbering boob theres enough to do in the onion patch to keep you busy and for gods sake take off the clothes youre wearing and soak them in the tub i will denny said i sweated a lot donel says we should keep the gun ready just to fire off and scare the revenue men if they come snooping around he says they might i said ill think about it mary said how many times in those three days had norah said how dare she and attacked with fury every chore she could put her mind to she scoured the kitchen and bathroom sinks the toilet bowl the front steps she finished the last of the schoolgirls dresses folded them and called round for them to be picked up her anger fed on memories of one good thing after another that mary had spoiled for her even the piano the dead piano in her parlor marys joke but her anger and her feeling of shame wore down and that morning when she heard rossas truck pull up to the barn she looked out through the crack of daylight between the blind and the window frame and watched dennys return she pulled up all the blinds and boiled an egg for breakfast i could have done this myself the girl said wanting to hand in the dress without a hello or howareyou when norah opened the door margaret surely taught her better come in and let me look at you norah said dads in a terrible hurry no dear you are norah smiled and backed into the house i know your father tom dixon was a great talker mary got to know more about what was happening in the town from an hour with him than norah learned reading a month of the hope valley news the girl had little choice but to follow her indoors if you had more time norah said id ask you to play your latest piece for me when i pick up the dress maybe the thirteenyearold said she was even less fond of norahs piano than of the one at home she could kick hers and the place shed kicked wouldnt show youll have to put the dress on dear if im going to pin it up mother said norah stopped her elaine i know how to alter a dress the girl took the dress into the bathroom and put it on why they named her elaine norah would never know from a poem margaret had read she remembered or was it after someone in toms family he was english she certainly wasnt norahs notion of an elaine no wonder they called her lainie what was her hurry norah wondered when she let her out of the house and watched her lope across the way did the girl hate her that much norah did know she was fonder of mary and her ramshackle house it struck her then denny lainie burst into marys kitchen shes spooky thats enough tom said mary chuckled i think it myself sometimes she turned up her cheek for a kiss is it you thats growing or me thats shrinking wheres denny the girl asked didnt i tell you tom said to mary he was right the girl had reached the age where one word said it all boys ive fixed him a jar of tea you can take it down to him in the far field and make him share it with you you have the devil in you mary tom said she gave that rattle of a laugh sure its broad daylight and the blinds were up next door wouldnt norah be watching with the frozen heart of a chaperone mary pushed their tea things out of the way ive a question or two for you tom youre wearing your badge i see if i didnt the sheriff would take it from me i thought maybe something was up the revenue men going round say or is donel filling dennys head with goblins im on the side of the feds i have to be tom said its the law would they be after donel do you think im not in their confidence mary she let it go wouldnt you think theyd have more to do in this country than put and take laws like that one its a country for and by the people tom said scratch a veteran and find a patriot mary could beat time to it you know donels put down money on a building in town he added is that a fact she said all ears ive heard hell be opening a business of some sort a big one and quitting the farm the farms quitting a lot of us these days mary mary envisioned the main street of hopetown as she had last paid it attention vacancies galore what kind of business do you think its a ways off tom said he plans ahead mary said she was thinking of donels palaver about the horse and the truck and he has money sure thats what makes the mare go tom money makes the mare go ill put the dishes in the sink for you tom said getting up leave them theres something id like you to do for me while youre here give denny a hand with a cupboard hes to bring over from norahs she made her way to the telephone and gave it a mighty crank are you feeling better norah the very tone of marys voice the purr of concern put norah on guard im doing fine norah said ah thats good news i was worried about you mary chirped i was wondering if you felt up to it while i have tom here could him and denny pick up the cupboard i cant count on donel these days ill go down and unlock the door norah said would it be less trouble if i sent denny ahead for the key i said ill go down shed send denny ahead for the key taunting her thats what it was norah thought she was sure of it when all four of them crowded down the cellar steps the girl giggling and denny coming down backwards to give her his hand a gentleman hey its creepy in here the girl squealed couldnt we have more light mary called tom wants to look at your furnace while hes here denny opened the storeroom door for her where she pulled the switch that lit up the whole cellar denny seemed to light up with it as though she had conjured the light for his delight she could not conceal the pleasure of looking at him but she turned on mary is that light enough for you ah norah youre still not yourself its denny made me come along and speak to you for him i think hes afraid of you god knows why she gave a swipe of her hand at lainie whod crept up never wanting to miss anything go there with your father girl hell need your advice and to norah can we come in for a minute her stick ahead of her she was already in the storeroom canny as a scavenger she saw the gun but didnt let on at first then there it is she looked up at her sister its the gun norah its been on his mind ever since we were here if id known at the time id have said something norahs brief shock of pleasure went dead she felt let down by denny betrayed him letting mary in on the little bond shed thought between him and herself afraid of her marys nonsense nobody was afraid of her he was shy thats what she loved about him he stood there holding his breath waiting for the next word what about the gun denny cant you tell me yourself she didnt want to hear any more from mary aunt norah he started just plain norah denny he nodded could we borrow it aunt norah whos the we dennis mr rossa and me hell help me clean it up and take me hunting with him in the fall norah did not like donel rossa she didnt trust himall his trips to and from chicago and his holy water his smiles as he called them he was in the business she was sure why he coddled mary she never knew but she did know how he treated her like she was a crook like shed befuddled the old lady into leaving her everything in truth he made her feel about herself the way she felt about him have you ever fired a gun in your life denny i havein the amusement park in white city i shot down the whole row of ducks and i took the prize it was a kewpie doll i gave to my mother oh my god mary said tell her about the crows in the field this morning denny repeated the story much as hed told it to mary he wasnt sizzling mary thought but he was holding his own and so was norah mary could see her guard going up she was afraid of losing something of something being taken away from her and she didnt like donel mary knew tom and the girl had come to the door rossa knows guns tom said hell teach you proper im not a hunter myself but i know one when i see the gun in his hand dad wont even shoot a fox lainie said im a better shot than he is the bold thing norah thought next shed want to go hunting with denny and to hide in a duck blind with him could i show you aunt norah not waiting for leave he darted across the room and took the gun in hand he brushed away the dust and broke the breech not easily it needed his strength empty he said of the cartridge chamber you must never take a chance he locked the gun again and held it crosswise to himself and waited they were all waiting except mary who had neither patience nor use for guns especially this one she was determined denny could become the apple of donels eye what good is it to you norah couldnt i have taken it the day we were in here cleaning out for you you could not norah said shall i tell you why theres no need she turned round to the door come on denny lets go home norah spoke out so that all of them would hear you may borrow the gun denny if you give me your word as a gentleman it stays in this house when youre not out hunting with it but you must give me your word i do denny said with such fervor it made mary laugh she laughed but with no great pleasure norah had won something though she wasnt sure what her back was to them when denny put the gun back from where he had taken it thank you norah he said up close to her face norah thought it eloquent that soft rich voice simple and eloquent well have a key made for you denny his smile went through her tom was already testing the weight of the cupboard he had rarely visited the sisters that they did not end things with a quarrel between them he wanted away lets go denny i want to get home before the cows come in lainie was there first lifting the other end of the huge pine box with its clattering doors lay it down flat and you could put a couple of bodies in it she said to her father just above a whisper never mind he said but he let her help he always said she was more help to him than ever a boy would have been denny wanted to telephone donel that very night and tell him hed be able to go hunting with him in the fall when you next see him itll be time enough mary said and when he drooped like a spent daisy she explained donel rossa has more on his mind than teaching you how to shoot rabbits i know that but i could start working on the gun by myself its terrible rusty he suddenly brightened i know what ill doill go in town to the hardware store and theyll tell me what i need im sure they will mary said and maybe theyll tell you how to pay for it a storm blew up in the night and set the beaded curtain rustling old bones she thought thats what it was made of she hadnt listened to it much since he had come and she had a terrible premonition that she was going to lose him it was a new kind of pain as though she needed it she reached for the flask under the lumpy pillow she was going to lose that too rain came with the wind and in the morning she knew they were not going to pick a second round of tomatoes or plough under the potato field she also knew that one thing she had to do about denny was keep him busy she waited for him to come up from emptying the slops and wash the bucket at the outdoor pump by the time he came in he was soaked to the skin from the storage bin under the sofa she brought out a checkered wool shirt of michaels shed intended to wear herself someday the someday had never come itll keep you warm hunting ducks she said put it on for now at the first break in the weather they went out to the padlocked back door of the barn this is where the cows came in mary said and dennis with his nose in the air said i can tell piled along the cement frames where once there had been stanchions were several sheets of beaverboard and the lumber they had not used in carving a place of her own for mary donel had been generous and he dreamed big dreams she would remind him when the right time came of how theyd planned a second room and maybe a second stove off marys parlor she pointed out to denny the slit of light in the roof a boxed vent to where a chimney pipe might be raised it was her dream at the moment not dennys he wandered off he was a city boy sure and hed met cows for the first time in his life at donels and hed caught the smell of them here she was startled when he called out to her aunt mary someones standing in the doorway as she turned to see the man he greeted her the top of the morning to you oh my god she muttered it could have been donel with his makebelieve irish but it was not he was holding an open wallet for her to see his identification when she reached him she saw little except the government insignia for her heart started to pound she thought he was from immigration shed never lost the fear of being sent back what is it you want mister my name is spillane ive orders to search the premises for corn whiskey maam youve nothing to fear if youre clean mrs ohearn he stretched his neck to see behind and beyond her into the cavernous barn and he took a good look at dennis when he came up whoever he was his pale eyes had no warmth in them and he had stoked her fear she disliked him on sight what kind of name is spillane its irish as irish as yours and you a revenue man she said with scorn the full use of her tongue restored he put the wallet back in his pocket so youre one of those irish women he said i have a warrant in the car if you want to see it never mind take him around denny and be sure to show him the still where aunt mary denny had missed the point oh for the love of god go where you like mr spillane and take care you dont miss my bedroom he did not miss much he went to his car and brought a flashlight a touring car with the windows all open to let out the stink mary thought hed be losing his authority soon maybe that was what ailed him but he made denny lift the cover from the mouth of the well he searched its depth with the beam of the torch he looked up at mary where she watched from the back stoop and hed have heard her laugh he reached out and snatched the cup from where it hung by the pump and threw it into the well may you die of thirst mary shouted and went into the house when he was gone mary poured herself and denny cold tea from what was left in the breakfast pot what did he mean by one of those irish women denny wanted to know why didnt you ask him mary snapped shed known exactly what he meant they should never have been given the vote not of course that she had ever used it he didnt talk much i didnt like him either mary did he say anything to you at all yeah well what whered you get those great big beautiful eyes the bastard mary said yeah now can we call donel donel came in the afternoon he heard them out but he shook his head did you have to make an enemy of him mary was i to make a friend of him then its what ive been doing all my life and i eat three square meals a day he dropped his voice theyre all over the place so do me a favor mary if he comes back give him a cup of tea i know what ill put in it then him pouring the last drop in my bottle down the sink youve had worse things happen to you he was out of patienceshort of time she realized and he hadnt offered to replenish her holy water she saw a glint of anger in his eyes she wouldnt want him for an enemy either and ive had better in spite of herself she couldnt yield the last word but she rang a good change on it with a nod toward denny till this one denny grinned donel he said i got the loan of the gun donel grunted as though to give his memory a jog i plan to clean it up myself denny went on and be halfready at least when we can go hunting that wont do at all donel said its not a musical instrument its a weapon i know denny said you think you know thats worse than not knowing at all ill learn mary was proud of the way he said it donel said thats better lets have a look at it while im here i have to keep it at norahs denny said but im to have a key marys eyes and donels met for they shared a deep and silent association with the words when mary had run away to chicago she found a haven and employment with a friend of donels to whose house donel had a key hell make friends at murrays hardware mary said theyll get him started donel looked at his watch ill take you in town with me now and introduce you to murray if you can bring the gun hell know what youre talking about i will denny said ill ask aunt norah its a singlebarrel twelvegauge shotgun itll do donel said without enthusiasm it was one of the cheaper guns on the market and where in hell did you get the shirt youre wearing norah made a quick choice of where to hide when she saw rossa stop and wait in the truck for denny to come to her door she wasnt ready yet she listened as denny rapped and called out her name the note of concern was endearing she sat on the cushioned lid of the toilet and waited to hear the truck pull away in a snatch of memory she heard marys cackle god save the queen the bathtub she thought staring at it was big enough for him to flop over in hed splash and grin she thought of getting a bar of lifebuoy soap denny knocked on her door again late in the afternoon he had come back on foot carrying a brandnew canvas knapsack i must have heard you in my sleep norah lied i lay down with a headache after my lunch and wasnt i dreaming of you what was i doing you were playing the piano she said its just come back to me now you were dreaming all right denny said they went down through the house to the cellar and norah pointed out a workbench near the coal bin he could use couldnt i take it over there to work on you could not while she watched him unpack the knapsack she listened for a telephone call from mary or the rap of her stick on a window isnt mary feeling well shes all right which told her nothing i wondered if it was a doctor i saw stopping in this morning not for aunt mary she thinks theyre all quacks hed been given instruction norah thought on what he could say and what not she was furious not so much at what she might be missing but at the idea of marys taking advantage of his innocence she had made up her mind from what shed seen of marys visitor that morning that he was on a mission from donel rossa he might even be bringing her the monthly holy water he looked like a bootlegger and his longnosed car suited the notion will you save your tin cans for me norah donel says i should set them up on the fence posts in the far field and practice you know this is all my property dennis oh i do donel said i should ask you ill save you the tins thank you norah his smile was like honey it would do for the day she thought youd better go now shell be waiting for you she will shell want to hear to hear what denny about donels construction business mr murray shook hands with him its going to be great for hopetownfor the whole valley norah smiled how nice she said mary come outdoors quick quick she mocked and when she got to the stoop look he insisted i can hear them she said fading fast into the morning mist even as their cries grew dimmer the canadian geese were going south would god they were coming back she drew her shawl tighter for gods sake put your shirt on denny youll catch your death of cold i wont he still washed naked to the waist at the pump by the well he shaved at the kitchen sink they had eggs for breakfast that morning and though she knew he was only half listening she told him and probably for the second or third time she thought of how as children she and norah waded in the stream at home groping the sand with their toes for duck eggs whoever found one got the top when her father opened it for his breakfast the next morning did you and norah fight over it he was listening after all donel stopped on his way into town he was a little early due at the lawyers office within the hour to sign the final papers the teacup trembled in his hand he put it down ill be glad to get this over with he said will you have a drop from my bottle to settle you mary said not on your life macushla he had brought her the last smile he stretched out his hand and held it steady but his teeth were clenched he took up the cup again im clean mary he toasted heror himselfwith the lukewarm tea slainte let norah ridicule him all she liked mary thought but they would never know a man more irish norah was on the lookout she had been from the moment she heard rossas car drive into the yard the family car no less he sometimes drove her and mary to sunday mass in it lately hed been driving it into hopetown it was more befitting a businessman than the ford truck she knew denny would be going back to the farm with himto shuck corn and then to go hunting with him in the morning he would come soon for the gun and take it away for the first time and what would she have left a bag of tin cans with holes shot through them she caught a whiff of her cologne shed used too much of it and dreamed too much shed worn out a paltry thrill remembering it only once had she come even close to telling him she loved him hed been at the cellar workbench that day his back to her and what she told him was of her love for music and how beautiful she thought his voice was when he seemed to stiffen she thought it safer to talk about the piano and how shed hoped someday to even play it herself shed been pleased at the moment for what she said then but its my heart and not my head thats musical and denny looking around to her in the expectant silence couldnt you sell the piano i dont need the money denny aunt mary would have he said denny came out from the barn with rossa he put his knapsack and a box of marys preserves no doubt in the rear seat of the sedan he stepped back and watched rossa drive off without a glance her way he went back in to mary he would not come till the last minute waiting for rossa to return and hurry him away she watched the traffic coming into town not a car a minute but picking up these days she couldnt believe it had anything to do with donel rossas new enterprise hope county construction county no less she moved away from the window and then went back to straighten the curtain by sheer chance she saw the black longnosed touring car drive past the house and on into hopetown when she thought about it she wasnt a bit surprised in the late morning she heard dennis open the cellar doors she called down to him to leave them open that she would close them when the sun was gone i didnt want to bother you he said at the bottom of the kitchen stairs donel didnt think hed be this long mary says its the lawyers thats holding things up ah yes what mary says he was like a silhouette between her and the shaft of daylight im coming down she said you dont need to aunt norah he didnt want her to he wanted to go off gun in hand without even a thankyouverymuch im coming down he lifted the storeroom door for her when she went in to switch on the lights i was going to fix this for you wasnt i when i come back from donels she followed him to the workbench what if rossa doesnt come if something happened to change his mind hed let us know denny said he took the gun from the rack he had built for it and broke it to be sure the chamber was empty you are such a foolish boy dennis you believe everybody the revenue agent in the rain that morning i could have told you the truth about him but mary spat at me when i even mentioned him that bastard denny said no denny hes worse hes a gangster i would take my oath on it and isnt he back today for the celebration hes back denny questioned as though he didnt understand her you dont forget an automobile like that denny when donel left here this morning it came by right after him what an odd coincidence i thought at first and then i realized of course theyre going to the same place denny groped his jacket pocket and brought out a cartridge he loaded it into the open gun and closed it she was a second or two understanding what he had done he doesnt need you denny hes one of them youre crazy he said he edged her aside when she tried to block his way to the door its mary needs me dont you understand no i dont understand and i never will you cant have the gun denny its mine i want it back she tried to take it from him but he was by far the stronger she tried to twist it free the explosion rocked the house smoke and debris clouded the air she knew she was losing consciousness but now she couldnt let go of the gun it was frozen in her hands and her hands were wet with blood her sleeves her breast saturated she could taste it so much blood then nothing when the girl lainie got home from dennys funeral she put the mass card in the box of clippings she was saving from the hope valley news it didnt belong there and yet it did it would always carry her remembrance of the lone high voice from the choir loft singing the dies irae day of wrath and the single sob it brought from her aunt mary for as long as she lived norah would say that she had killed dennyin spite of the coroners finding that his death was most probably caused by a bullet fired from the cellar doorway an instant before or an instant after the gun in her and dennys hands exploded mary swore she had seen spillane when she started over at the sound of gunfire so she too bore willing guilt but it was donel who could beat his breast the hardest norah had been right spillane was a lowlevel member of the chicago gang donel had been in business with for years he had thought he was breaking away from them that fall the boss thought so too he suspected at first that donel was tying in with another gang and using marys place for storage spillane investigated even the well donel no more than mary doubted his claim to be a federal agent when the news of the construction business came outhope county constructionthe boss wanted a part of it donel refused as he told mary he was clean he thought he was but spillane caught up with him before he reached the door of the lawyers office that morning the boss expected him to postpone the contract signing and expand the partnership the boss promised he would get well paid whichever way he played it donel told him to go to hell why denny and not mary if spillane was his killer it was probably the bosss decision denny was michael ohearns nephew and michael had been killedin the line of dutyin an exchange of gunfire that also killed a young and promising member of the gang those many years before spillane was never found dead or alive about the authors p m carlson p m carlson taught psychology and statistics at cornell university before
