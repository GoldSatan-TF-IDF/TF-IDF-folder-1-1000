david morrell long lost to jeffrey weiner master of accounts a long time ago you made a promise and you kept it thanks for helping keep distractions from my door and giving me more time to write to the legion of the lost ones to the cohort of the damned rudyard kipling part one when i was a boy my kid brother disappeared vanished off the face of the earth his name was petey and he was bicycling home from an afterschool baseball game not that hed been playing the game was for older guys like me which is to say that i was all of thirteen and petey was only nine he thought the world of me he always wanted to tag along but the rest of the guys complained that he was in the way so i told petey to bug off go home i still remember the hurt look he gave me before he got on his bike and pedaled away a skinny little kid with a brush cut glasses braces on his teeth and freckles wearing a droopy tshirt baggy jeans and sneakersthe last i saw of him that was a quarter of a century ago yesterday by the time supper was ready and petey hadnt shown up my mother phoned his friends in the neighborhood but they hadnt seen him twenty minutes later my father called the police his worst fear until that moment at least was that petey had been hit by a car but the police dispatcher said that there hadnt been any accidents involving a youngster on a bicycle the dispatcher promised to call back if he heard anything and meanwhile to have patrol cars looking for him my father couldnt bear waiting he had me show him the likely route petey would have taken between the playground and home we drove this way and that by then it was dusk and we almost passed the bicycle before i spotted one of its red reflectors glinting from the last of the sunset the bike had been shoved between bushes in a vacant lot peteys baseball glove was under it we searched the lot we shouted peteys name we asked people who lived on the street if theyd seen a boy who matched peteys description we didnt learn anything as my father sped back home the skin on his face got so tight that his cheekbones stood out he kept murmuring to himself oh jesus all i could hope was that petey had stayed away because he was mad at me for sending him home from the baseball game i fantasized that hed show up just before bedtime and say now arent you sorry maybe you want me around more than you guess in fact i was sorry because i couldnt fool myself into believing that petey had shoved his bike between those busheshe loved that bike why would he have dropped his baseball glove something bad had happened to him but it never would have happened if i hadnt told him to get lost my mom became hysterical my dad called the police again a detective soon arrived and the next day a search was organized the newspaper this happened in a town called woodford just outside columbus ohio was filled with the story my parents went on television and radio begging whoever had kidnapped petey to return him nothing did any good i cant begin to describe the pain and ruin that peteys disappearance caused my mother needed pills to steady her nerves lots of times in the night i heard her sobbing i couldnt stop feeling guilty for making petey leave the baseball game every time i heard our front door creak open i prayed it was him coming home at last my father started drinking and lost his job he and mom argued a month after he moved out he was killed when his car veered off a highway flipped several times and crashed onto its roof there wasnt any life insurance my mother had to sell the house we moved to a small apartment and then went to live with my moms parents in columbus i spent a lot of time worrying about how petey would find us if he returned to the house he haunted me i grew older finished college married had a son and enjoyed a successful career but in my mind petey never aged he was still that skinny nineyearold giving me a hurt look then bicycling away i never stopped missing him if a farmer had plowed up the skeleton of a little boy and those remains had somehow been identified as peteys id have mourned bitterly for my kid brother but at least there would have been some finality i needed desperately to know what had happened im an architect for a while i was with a big firm in philadelphia but my best designs were too unorthodox for them so i finally started my own business i also decided it would be exciting to change localesnot just move to another east coast city but move from the east coast altogether my wife surprised me by liking the idea even more than i did i wont go into all the reasons we chose denver the lure of the mountains the myth of the west the main thing is we settled there and almost from the start my designs were in demand two of my office buildings are situated next to city parks they not only blend with but also reflect their surroundings their glass and tile walls act like huge mirrors that capture the images of the ponds trees and grassland near them one with nature my houses are what i was especially proud of though many of my clients lived near megadollar resorts like aspen and vail but they respected the mountains and didnt want to be conspicuous they preferred to be with nature without intruding upon it i understood the houses i designed blended so much that you couldnt see them until you were practically at their entrances trees and ridges concealed them streams flowed under them flat stretches of rock were decks boulders were steps cliffs were walls its ironic that structures designed to be inconspicuous attracted so much attention my clients despite their claims about wanting to be invisible couldnt resist showing off their new homes house beautiful and architectural digest did articles about them although the photographs of the exteriors seemed more like nature shots than pictures of homes the local cbs tv station taped a twominute spot for the ten oclock news the reporter dressed as a hiker challenged her viewers to a game can you see a house among these ridges and trees she was standing ten feet from a wall but only when she pointed it out did the viewer realize how thoroughly the house was camouflaged that report was noticed by cbs headquarters in new york and a few weeks later i was being interviewed for a tenminute segment on the cbs sunday morning show i keep asking myself why i agreed lord knows i didnt need any more publicity to get business so if it wasnt for economic reasons it must have been because of vanity maybe i wanted my son to see me on television in fact both he and my wife appeared briefly in a shot where we walked past what the reporter called one of my chameleon houses i wish wed all been chameleons a man called my name brad that was three days after the cbs sunday morning show wednesday early june a bright gorgeous day id been in meetings all morning and the rumblings in my stomach reminded me that id missed lunch i could have sent my secretary to get me a sandwich but what she was doing was a lot more important than running an errand for me besides i felt like going outside and enjoying the sun downtown denver is a model of urban planning spacious and welcoming with buildings low enough to let in the light my destination was a deli across the street bagels and more nothing on my mind but a cornedbeef sandwich when i heard my name being called brad at first i thought it was one of my staff trying to catch my attention about something id forgotten but when i turned i didnt recognize the man hurrying toward me he was in his midthirties roughlooking with a dirty tan and matted long hair for a moment i thought he might be a construction worker id met on one of my projects his clothes certainly looked the part scuffed work boots dusty jeans and a wrinkled denim shirt with its sleeves rolled up but ive got a good memory for faces and i was sure id have remembered the twoinch scar on his chin brad my god i cant believe it the man dropped a battered knapsack to the sidewalk after all these years christ almighty i must have looked baffled i like to think people enjoy my company but very few have ever been so enthusiastic about seeing me apparently we had once known each other although i hadnt the vaguest idea who the guy was his broad grin revealed a chipped front tooth you dont recognize me come on id have recognized you anywhere i did on television its me my brain was working slowly trying to search my memory im afraid i dont peter your brother now everything became totally clear my brain worked very fast the man reached out its so damned good to see you keep your hands away from me you son of a bitch what the man looked shocked come any closer ill call the police if you think youre going to get money from brad what are you talking about you watched the cbs sunday program didnt you yes but you made a mistake you bastard it isnt going to work on tv the reporter had mentioned peteys disappearance the day after the show six different men had called my office claiming to be petey your longlost brother each of them cheerily said the first call had excited me but after a few minutes conversation i realized that the guy hadnt the faintest idea about how petey had disappeared or where it had happened or what our home life had been like the next two callers had been even worse liars they all wanted money i told my secretary not to put through any more calls from anyone who claimed to be my brother the next three con men lied to her pretending to have legitimate business tricking her into transferring the call the moment they started their spiel i slammed down the phone the day after that my secretary managed to intercept eight more calls from men who claimed to be petey now they were showing up in person stay the hell away from me too impatient to go down to the traffic light i turned sharply found a break in traffic and headed across the street brad for gods sake listen the man yelled it really is me my back stiffened with anger as i kept walking what do i have to do to make you believe me the man shouted i reached the streets center line waiting impatiently for another break in traffic when they grabbed me i was riding home on my bicycle the man yelled furious i spun the reporter mentioned that on television get away from me before i beat the shit out of you brad youd have a harder time outfighting me than when we were kids the bike was blue that last statement almost didnt register i was so angry then the image of peteys blue bike hit me that wasnt mentioned on television the man said it was in the newspaper at the time all you needed to do was phone the woodford library and ask the reference department to check the issues of the local newspaper for that month and year it wouldnt have been hard to get details about peteys disappearance my disappearance the man said on each side cars beeped in warning as they sped past we shared the same room the man said was that ever printed i frowned uneasy we slept in bunk beds the man said raising his voice i had the top i had a model of a helicopter hanging from a cord attached to the ceiling just above me i liked to take it down and spin the blades my frown deepened dad had the tip of the little finger on his left hand cut off in an accident at the furniture factory he loved to fish the summer before i disappeared he took you and me camping out here in colorado mom wouldnt go she was afraid of being outdoors because of her allergy to bee stings even the sight of a bee threw her into a panic memories flooded through me there was no way this stranger could have learned any of those details just by checking old newspapers none of that information had ever been printed petey we had a goldfish in our room but neither of us liked to clean the bowl one day we came home from school and the bedroom stank the fish was dead we put the fish in a matchbox and had a funeral in the backyard when we came back to where wed buried it we found a hole where the neighbors cat had dug up the fish petey as i started back toward him i almost got hit by a car jesus it is you we once broke a window playing catch in the house dad grounded us for a week this time i was the one reaching out ive never hugged anybody harder he smelled of spearmint gum and cigarette smoke his arms were tremendously strong petey i could barely get the words out whatever happened to you pedaling home angry feelings hurt a car coming next to him moving slowly keeping pace with him a woman in the front passenger seat rolling down her window asking directions to the interstate telling her the woman not seeming to listen the sourlooking man at the steering wheel not seeming to care either the woman asking do you believe in god what kind of question the woman asking do you believe in the end of the world the car veering in front of him scared hopping the bicycle onto the sidewalk the woman jumping from the car chasing him a sneaker slipping off a pedal a vacant lot bushes the woman grabbing him the man unlocking the trunk throwing him in the trunk lid banging shut darkness screaming pounding not enough air passing out petey described it to me as we faced each other in an isolated booth at the rear of the deli id been headed toward you never should have made me leave that baseball game he said i know that my voice broke god dont i know it the woman was older than mom she had crowsfeet around her eyes gray roots in her hair pinched lips awful thin stooped shoulders floppy arms reminded me of a bird but she sure was strong the man had dirty long hair and hadnt shaved he wore coveralls and smelled of chewing tobacco what did they want with you were you i couldnt make myself use the word molested petey looked away they drove me to a farm in west virginia just across the border you were that close near a town called redemption sick joke huh really thats what it was called although i didnt find out the name for quite a while they kept me a prisoner until i escaped when i was sixteen sixteen but all this time why didnt you come to us i thought about it petey looked uncomfortable i just couldnt make myself he pulled a pack of cigarettes from his shirt pocket but as he lit a match a waitress stopped at our table im sorry sir smoking isnt permitted in here peteys craggy features hardened fine can i take your orders youre good at giving them what corned beef i told the waitress breaking the tension petey impatiently shoved his cigarettes back into his pocket a couple of buds as she left i glanced around assuring myself that no customers were close enough to hear what we were saying what did you mean you couldnt make yourself come to us the man kept telling me mom and dad would never take me back what not after what he did to he said mom and dad would be disgusted theyd disown you they wouldnt have i felt tight with sadness i understand that now but when i escaped lets just say i wasnt myself where they kept me a prisoner was an underground room jesus i didnt see the light of day for seven years his cheek muscles hardened not that i knew how much time had passed when i got out it took me quite a while to figure what was what but what have you been doing petey looked tortured roaming around working construction jobs driving trucks a little of everything just after my twentyfirst birthday i happened to be driving a rig to columbus i worked up the nerve to go to woodford and take a look at our place the house had been sold by then so i found out and dad had died i found that out too nobody remembered where mrs denning and her son brad had moved we were in columbus with moms parents so close petey shook his head in despair i didnt know moms maiden name so i couldnt track her through her parents but the police could have helped you find us not without asking me a lot of questions i didnt want to answer theyd have arrested the man and woman who kidnapped you what good would that have done me thered have been a trial id have had to testify the story would have been in all the newspapers he gestured helplessly i felt so its over now try to put it behind you none of it was your fault i still feel petey struggled with the next word then stopped when the waitress brought our beers he took a long swallow from his bottle and changed the subject what about mom the question caught me by surprise mom yeah hows she doing i needed a moment before i could make myself answer she died last year oh peteys voice dropped cancer uh it was a quiet exhale at the same time it was almost as if hed been punched he stared at his beer bottle but his painful gaze was on something far away kates normally attractive features looked strained when i walked into the kitchen she was pacing talking on the phone tugging an anxious hand through her long blond hair then she saw me and her shoulders sagged with relief he just walked in ill call you back i smiled as she hung up the phone where have you been everybodys been worried kate said worried you had several important meetings this afternoon but you never showed up your office was afraid youd been in an accident or everythings great i lost track of the time been mugged or better than great had a heart attack or ive got wonderful news or god knows what youre always mr dependable now its almost six and you didnt call to let me know you were okay and do i smell alcohol on your breath have you been drinking you bet i smiled more broadly during the day ignoring appointments with clients whats gotten into you i told you i have wonderful news what news petey showed up kates blue eyes looked confused as if i was speaking gibberish whos at once she got it good lord you dont mean your brother exactly but but you told me you assumed he was dead i was wrong youre positive its him you bet he told me things only petey could know it has to be him and hes really here in denver closer than that hes on the front porch what you left him outside i didnt want to spring him on you i wanted to prepare you i explained what had happened ill fill in the details when theres time the main thing to know is hes been through an awful lot then he shouldnt be cooling his heels on the porch for heavens sake get him just then jason came in from the backyard he was eleven but small for his age so that he looked a lot like petey had when hed disappeared braces freckles glasses thin whats all the noise about you guys having an argument the opposite kate said whats up looking at jasons glasses i was reminded that petey had needed glasses too but the man outside wasnt wearing any i suddenly felt as if i had needles in my stomach had i been conned kate crouched before jason do you remember we told you that your father had a brother sure dad talked about him on that tv show he disappeared when he was a boy kate said jason nodded uneasily i had a nightmare about it well you dont have to have nightmares about it anymore kate said guess what he came back today youre going to meet him yeah jason brightened when just as soon as we open the front door i tried to say something to kate to express my sudden misgivings but she was already heading down the hallway toward the front door the next thing she had it open and i dont know what she expected but i doubt that the scruffylooking man out there matched her idealized image of the longlost brother he turned from where hed been smoking a cigarette admiring the treed area in front of the house his knapsack was next to him petey kate asked he shifted from one work boot to the other ill at ease these days i think peter sounds a little more grownup please come in thanks he looked down at his halfsmoked cigarette glanced at the interior of the house pinched off the glowing tip then put the remnant in his shirt pocket i hope you can stay for supper kate said i dont want to put you out any nonsense wed love to have you to tell the truth id appreciate it i cant remember when i last had a homecooked meal this is jason kate gestured proudly toward our son hi jace the man shook hands with him do you like to play baseball yeah jason said but im not very good at it reminds me of myself at your age tell you what after supper well play catch how does that sound great well lets not keep you standing on the porch come in kate said ill get you something to drink a beer if youve got it the man who said he was petey started to follow kate inside but before he crossed the threshold i had to know are you wearing contact lenses no the man frowned in confusion what makes you ask you needed glasses when you were a kid still do the man reached into his knapsack and pulled out a small case opening it showing a pair of spectacles one lens of which was broken this happened yesterday morning but i can get around all right as you know i need glasses just for distance was that a little test or something emotion made my throat ache petey welcome home this is the best pot roast i ever tasted mrs denning please youre part of the family call me kate and these mashed potatoes are out of this world im afraid i cheated and used butter now our cholesterol counts will be shot to hell i never pay attention to stuff like that as long as its food its welcome when petey smiled his chipped front tooth was visible jason couldnt help staring at it you want to know how i got this petey gestured toward the tooth jason youre being rude kate said not at all petey chuckled hes just curious the same as i was when i was a kid jace last summer i was on a roofing project in colorado springs i fell off a ladder thats also how i got this scar on my chin good thing i was close to the ground when i fell i could have broken my neck is that where you live now i asked in colorado springs lord no i dont live anywhere i stopped chewing but everybody lives somewhere kate said not me jason looked puzzled but where do you sleep wherever i happen to be theres always someplace to bed down that seems kate shook her head what awfully lonely no friends nothing to call your own i guess it depends on what youre used to people have a habit of letting me down petey didnt look at me but i couldnt help taking his comment personally and as for owning things well everything of any importance to me is in my knapsack if i cant carry it i figure it holds me back king of the road i said exactly you seepetey leaned toward jason propping his elbows on the tablei roam around a lot depending on where the work is and how the weather feels each days a new adventure i never know what to expect like last sunday i happened to be in butte montana eating breakfast in a diner that had a television i dont normally look at television and i dont have any use for those sundaymorning talk shows but this one caught my attention something about the voice of the guy being interviewed i looked up from my eggs and sausage and lord the guy on tv sure made me think of somebodybut not from recently a long time ago i kept waiting for the announcer to say who the guy was then he didnt need tobecause the announcer mentioned that the guys kid brother had disappeared while bicycling home from a baseball game when they were youngsters of course the guy on television was your father petey turned to me as i got older i thought more and more about looking you up brad but i had no idea where youd gone when the announcer said you lived in denver i set down my knife and fork and started for here at once took me all sunday monday and tuesday mind you i tried phoning along the road but your home number isnt listed as for your business number well your secretary wouldnt put me through because of all those crank calls i told you about on the way over here i felt guilty as if he thought id intentionally rejected him three days to drive from montana you must have had car trouble kate said petey shook his head from side to side a cars just something else that would own me i hitchhiked hitchhiked kate asked in surprise why didnt you take a bus well there are two good reasons the first is in my experience people who ride buses tend to have the same boring stories but any driver with the courage to pick up a hitchhiker is definitely someone worth talking to the way he said that made us chuckle if it turns out theyre not interesting i can always say let me off in the next town then i take my chances with another car each rides a small adventure peteys eyes crinkled with amusement and whats the second reason for not taking the bus i asked the amusement faded works been a little scarce lately i didnt have the money for the ticket thats going to change i said i know where theres plenty of work on construction projectsif you want it i sure do i can give you some pocket money in the meantime hey i didnt come here for handouts petey said i know that but whatll you do for cash until then petey didnt have an answer come on i said accept a gift i guess i could use some cash to rent a motel room no way kate said youre not renting any motel room youre spending the night with us petey threw a baseball to jason who was usually awkward but this time he caught the ball perfectly and grinned look dad look at what uncle peter taught me youre doing great maybe your uncle ought to think about becoming a coach petey shrugged just some tricks i picked up on the road from friday nights when i ended up at baseball parks in various towns all you have to remember jace is to keep your eye on the ball instead of on your glove and make sure your glove is ready to snap shut kate appeared at the back door her blond hair silhouetted by the kitchen light its time for bed little leaguer aw do i have to mom ive already let you stay up a half hour longer than usual tomorrows a school day disappointed jason turned to his uncle dont look at me for help petey said what your mother says goes thanks for the lesson uncle peter now maybe the other kidsll let me play on the team well if they dont you let me know and ill go down to the ballpark to have a word with them petey mussed jasons sandy hair and nudged him toward the house you better not keep your mother waiting see you in the morning you bet im glad you found us uncle peter me too peteys voice was unsteady me too jason went inside and my brother turned to me nice boy yes were very proud of him the setting sun cast a crimson glow over the backyards trees and kates wonderful i said it was my lucky day when i met her theres no getting around it youve done great for yourself look at this house i felt embarrassed to have so much my staff teases me about it as you saw from the tv show my specialty is designing buildings that are almost invisible in their environment but when we first came to town this big old victorian seemed to have our name on it of course all the trees in the front and back conceal it pretty well it feels solid petey glanced down at his calloused hands funny how things worked out well he roused himself and grinned coachings thirsty work i could use another beer be right back when i returned with the beers inside kate had raised her eyebrows not used to seeing me drink so much i also had something in a shopping bag whats that petey wondered something ive been keeping for you i cant imagine what youd im afraid its too small for you to use if you want to play catch with jason another time i said petey shook his head in confusion recognize this i reached in the bag and pulled out the battered baseball glove that id found under peteys bike so long ago my god i kept it all these years i never let it out of my room i used to hold it next to me when i went to bed and id try to imagine where you were and what you were doing and i forced the words out if you were still alive a lot of times i wished i wasnt alive dont think about that the past doesnt matter now were together again petey thats what matters god ive missed you i handed him the glove although i couldnt see him very wellmy eyes were misted so what do you think of him i asked kate keeping my voice low as i turned off the light and got under the covers peteys room was at the opposite end of the hall he wouldnt be able to hear us even so i felt selfconscious talking about him lying next to me in the darkness kate didnt answer for a moment hes had a hard life thats for sure and yet he seems to enjoy it a virtue of necessity i suppose all the same what are you thinking kate asked well if he didnt like it he could always have lived another way how i guess he could have gone to school and entered a profession maybe have become an architect like you i shrugged maybe it wouldnt have been out of the question ive seen a couple of stories on the news about twins separated at birth and reunited as adults they discover they have the same job the same hobbies wives who look the same and have the same personality im not sure i like being linked with someones hobby besides you and your brother arent twins granted even so you know what i mean petey could have ended up like me but he chose not to you really think people have that much choice in their lives you told me you never would have become an architect if it hadnt been for a geometry teacher you really liked in high school wistful i stared at moonlight streaming through our bedroom window yeah i sure was weirdthe only kid in high school who liked geometry to me that teacher made the subject fascinating he told me what i had to do where to go to college and all if i wanted to be an architect well i seriously doubt that your brother had a geometry teacher did he even go to high school kate asked somebody must have taught him something hes awfully well spoken i havent heard a foul word from him kate turned to face me propping herself on an elbow look im willing to do all i can to help if he wants to stay here for a while until he decides what to do next thats fine with me i was hoping youd feel that way i leaned over and kissed her thanks is that the best way you can think of to thank me she asked i kissed her again this time deeply far more sincere she drew a hand up my leg mmm it was the last sound for a while the presence of a stranger in the house made us more selfconscious about being overheard when we climaxed our kiss was so deep that we swallowed each others moans we lay silently coming back to ourselves if we get more sincere than that ill need to be resuscitated i murmured mouthtomouth brings me to life every time getting up to go to the bathroom i glanced out the window in the darkness peering down toward the backyard i saw something i didnt expect what are you looking at kate asked petey what i can see him in the moonlight hes down there in a lounge chair asleep kate asked no hes smoking staring up at the stars given everything thats happened he probably couldnt sleep i know how he feels ill tell you one thing kate said anyone whos polite enough not to smoke in the house is welcome although petey had said that he enjoyed his life on the road i was determined to make sure he enjoyed it even more by paying attention to a few basic matters his appearance for example that chipped front tooth made a terrible first impression i had a suspicion that petey had been losing work because contractors he approached to hire him felt he looked like a troublemaker so the next morning i phoned our family dentist explained the situation and got him to agree for double his usual fee to give up his lunch hour dentist petey told me hell no im not going to any dentist just to smooth out that chip in your tooth its not going to hurt no way i havent been to a dentist since i needed a back tooth taken out six years ago six years ago good god all the more reason for you to have a checkup i didnt tell him that the hygienist had agreed to give up her lunch hour too before that i phoned several barbershops until i found one that wasnt busy long hairmy owns hardly what youd call short doesnt have to look tangled and scruffy after the barbershop we bought some clothes not that i deluded myself into thinking that petey could use dress slacks and a sport coat but some new jeans and a nicelooking shirt wouldnt do any harm after that a shoe store new work boots and sneakers i cant accept all this petey said im glad to do it if you want well call it a loan sometime when youre flush you can pay me back then it was time for the dentist afterward peteys teeth looked great although he had several cavities the dentist said theyd be taken care of when petey went back in a couple of weeks peteys hair looked stylishly windblown i was almost tempted to ask a plastic surgeon if anything could be done about the scar on peteys chin no matter a little maintenance had accomplished a lot he looked like hed just gotten dressed after playing tennis hungry always petey said yeah i get the impression youve been missing a few meals lately you could use about ten more pounds do you like italian food you mean spaghetti and meatballs sort of but where were going spaghettis called pasta and the dishes have names like chicken marsala hold on a second after lunch im going to take you to see a man about a job brad stophold it why whats wrong dont you have work to do petey asked you took yesterday afternoon off this morning you didnt go to work either kate said you had appointments meetings none of its as important as you but you cant run a business that way not and spend money on me the way you are we have a lot to catch up on but we dont have to do it all at once peteys worried expression started me laughing you think im getting carried away just a little then what do you suggest go to work theres a park across the street id like to hang out there for a while get my mind straight all these changes ill meet you at home for supper thats really what you want i asked youve done enough for me but how will you get home hitchhike petey said what if you dont get a ride dont worry ive got a knack for it peteys teeth looked great when he grinned i have a better idea i said use my car you can pick me up at the end of the day cant i dont have a drivers license thats something else well take care of tomorrow petey said were going to see about getting your glasses fixed too right petey said tomorrow petey and jason were cutting the lawn when i got home the power mower was awkward for jason so petey was walking beside him helping him make the turns hey look at me dad jason yelled to be heard above the motors roar i raised my thumb enthusiastically they stopped beside me can you control it jace petey asked im pretty sure then its all yours ill be over here talking to your dad jason nodded concentrating on keeping the mower in a straight line its roar diminished as he navigated among trees toward the far side of the yard petey motioned me toward the porch steps where he picked up a bottle of beer i mightve created a monster if he gets any better at this youre going to have to raise his allowance its the first time hes shown an interest could be youve hit on something i said normally a lawn service does this for me but itd be good for him to help a little and learn some responsibility cant be too young to learn responsibility petey took a drink of his beer listen i appreciate the effort but you didnt have to mow the grass i said no big deal it looked a little long i want to do my share honestly it isnt necessary im just glad to have you here anyway since youll be working next week take it easy for now petey cocked his head working next week yeah i made some calls i got you a job you did great on a building i designed couldnt be better uncle peter jason yelled in panic at the end of a row the boy struggled to turn the mower it veered toward a shrub hang on petey ran to help him no need to help with the dishes kate said its the least i can do petey dried another pot i cant remember when i had a tastier beef stew we dont normally eat this much red meat she said im trying to put some weight on you the lemon pie was spectacular jason eyed a second piece yeah we hardly ever get desserts in the middle of the week well you worked hard mowing the lawn kate said you deserve a treat sitting at the end of the table i couldnt help smiling the reality that petey was actually over there by the sink reaching to dry another pot still overwhelmed me anyway he said returning to an earlier topic it doesnt surprise me that you moved here to denver oh that camping trip you and i and dad went on remember petey asked i sure do out here to colorado what a good time of course the long drive from ohio was a pain if it hadnt been for the comic books dad kept buying us along the highway once we got here the effort sure was worth it camping hiking rock climbing and fishing dad showing us what to do the first fish you ever caught you were so excited that you reeled in before you hooked it good i said it jumped back into the lake you remember that much i thought about that trip a lot over the years a month after we got back school started and i couldnt make myself refer to peteys disappearance for a lot of years it was the last good summer of my life mine too petey looked down a long second later he shrugged off his regret and picked up the last pot anyway what im getting at is maybe you came out here because in the back of your mind you wanted to return to that summer camping jason broke the somber mood we looked at him hed been silent for a while eating his second piece of pie dad promised to take me but we never did jason said i felt embarrassed we went on plenty of hikes but we never used tents are you telling me youve never actually gone camping petey asked jason nodded then corrected himself except i once slept in a tent in tom burbicks backyard doesnt count petey said youve gotta be where you hear the lions and tigers and bears lions and tigers jason frowned looking vulnerable behind his glasses its a joke kate rumpled his hair she left some soapsuds he swatted at them mom but that might not be a bad idea she looked at petey and me a camping trip the two of you can pick up where you left off jump over the years i know its been hard for you peter but now the good times are starting again i think youre right kate petey said i can feel them what about me jason asked cant i come well all go petey said sorry not me gentlemen kate held up her hands saturday im scheduled to give a seminar kate was a stressmanagement counselor her specialty was advising corporations whose employees were burned out because of downsizing besides sleeping in the woods isnt high on my list just like mom petey turned to me remember yeah just like mom except your mother kate said was afraid of bees whereas in my case its a matter of natural selection natural selection i asked puzzled you guys are a lot better equipped to crawl out of a tent at night and pee in the woods ive been meaning to ask you something petey quit studying the map and looked at me about what it was almost eleven oclock a radiant saturday morning my ford expedition was loaded with all kinds of camping equipment wed followed interstate west out of denver and were now well into the mountains although jason wasnt appreciating their snowcaps he was dozing in a sleeping bag on the backseat after you i had trouble continuing it suddenly occurs to me that you might not want to talk about it theres only one way to find out after you got away from say it the sick bastards who kidnapped me its a fact you dont need to tapdance around the subject you were sixteen when you escaped youve talked about roaming the country working on construction jobs or whatever but you never mentioned anything about school when you disappeared you were in the fourth grade but youve obviously had more education than that who taught you oh i had plenty of education in politeness petey said bitterly the man and woman who kept me in that underground room insisted on a lot of yes sir yes maam please and thank you if i ever forgot they punched my face to remind me the sinews in his neck tightened into ropes im sorry i wish i hadnt raised the subject i said its fine theres no point in hiding from the past itll only catch up in other ways peteys gaze hardened he took a deep breath subduing his emotions anyhow in terms of education i have better memories as i wandered from town to town i learned that an easy way to get a free meal was to show up at church socials after sundaymorning services of course i had to sit through the services in order to get the free meals but most times i didnt mindthe services were peaceful after so many years of not reading id sort of forgotten how to do it when members of this or that congregation realized that i couldnt read the bible they took steps to make sure i learned my abcs and more important the good book there were always teachers in the congregations after work some evenings id get private classes at a church in whatever town i happened to be in there are a lot of decent folks out there im glad to hear it hear what dad jason asked sleepily from the backseat where hed woken up just that there are decent people in the world didnt you know that sometimes i wondered you and your uncle better concentrate on the map our turnoff isnt far ahead we were looking for a place called breakhorse ridge its odd how some names stay in my memory twentyfive years earlier that was where dad had taken petey and me on our camping trip somebody at the furniture factory where dad was the foreman had once lived in colorado and had described to dad how beautiful the breakhorse ridge area was so dad whod already committed to taking us camping in colorado had decided that would be our destination but back then all during the long drive id had a horrifying mental image of somebody breaking horses in half not knowing anything about how cowboys broke wild horses so people could ride them id been afraid of what we were going to see dad finally got me to tell him what was bothering me after he explained my fear turned to curiosity but when we arrived there werent any horses or cowboys just a few old wooden corrals and a meadow leading down to a lake and an aspen forest with mountains above it i never forgot the name but as petey jason and i had made plans i couldnt find the place on a map i finally had to phone the headquarters for park services in colorado a ranger had faxed me a section of a much more detailed map than i was using showing me the route to breakhorse ridge id spread my general map on the dining room table put the fax over the section we were interested in and shown petey and jason where we were going now we were almost there turning to the right onto highway heading north into the arapaho national forest it gets tricky from here on guys keep comparing the map to whats around us i said jason crawled into the front and petey buckled his seat belt over both of them what are we searching for jason asked this squiggly line petey showed him the fax itll be a narrow dirt road on the right with all these pine trees well have to watch closely itll be hard to spot i steered around a curve the trees got thicker even so i thought i saw a break in them on the right but i didnt say anything wanting jason to make the discovery petey must have read my mind i saw him look up from the map and focus his eyes as if hed noticed the break but he didnt say anything either i drove closer the break became a little more distinct there jason pointed i see it good job petey said for sure i added i almost went past it i steered to the right and entered a bumpy dirt lane scrub grass grew between its wheel ruts bushes squeezed its sides pine branches formed a canopy gosh do you think well get stuck jason leaned forward with concern not with this fourwheel drive petey said itd take a lot worse terrain than this to put us in trouble even if it snowed we wouldnt have to worry snowed jason frowned in june sure petey said this time of year you can still get a storm in the mountains the trees became sparse see those peaks ahead and how much snow they still have up here the sun hasnt gotten hot enough to melt it yet taking sharp angles the lane zigzagged higher the slope below us became dizzyingly steep the bumps were so severe that only those cowboys whod ridden bucking wild horses here years earlier could have enjoyed the ride who do you suppose built this road jason asked it looks awfully old the forest service maybe i said or maybe loggers or ranchers before this area became part of the national forest system i remember our dad saying that in the old days cattlemen kept small herds here to feed prospectors in mining towns prospectors gold jason asked and silver a long time ago most of the towns are abandoned now ghost towns petey said gosh jason said or else the towns became ski resorts i said hoping to subdue jasons imagination so petey and i wouldnt be wakened by his nightmares about ghosts the road crested the slope and took us into a bright meadow the new grass waving in a gentle breeze its the way i remember it when dad drove us here i told petey after all these years petey said in awe are we there yet jason asked the ageold question from kids i imagined that petey or i had asked our dad the same thing we looked at each other and couldnt keep from laughing whats so funny jason asked nothing petey said no were not there yet it took another half hour the meadow gave way to more pine trees and a slope steeper than the first one the zigzag angles sharper we crested a bumpy rise and i stopped suddenly staring down toward where the barely detectable road descended into a gentle grassy bowl sunlight glinted off a picturebook lake aspens beyond it then pine trees then mountains towering above yes i said my chest tight just as i remember it hasnt changed petey said on the right old corrals were the only variation in the meadow their gray weathered posts and railings had long ago collapsed into rotting piles we drove past them nearing the lake there werent any other cars in fact i couldnt find an indication that anyone had been around in a very long time we stopped fifty feet from the lake where i recalled dad stopping when we got out of the car i savored the fresh pleasantly cool air look at this old campfire dad petey and he were on the right side of the car i looked over toward a scorched circle of rocks that had charred hunks of wood in the middle old is right petey said i bet it hasnt been used in years he looked at me i wonder if this is the same place you and i and dad built our campfire its nice to think so jason brimmed with energy where are we going to put up the tent how about over there i pointed to the right of the old campfire site i think thats where petey and i helped dad put up our tent can i help dad of course petey said there was a moment after i lifted the back hatch and we unloaded our gear when the deja vu id been feeling reached an overwhelming intensity everything seemed realer than real i looked over at jason and petey as they pulled the collapsed tent from its nylon sack and tried to figure how to put it together jasons glasses and freckles his sandy hair at the edge of his baseball cap his baggy jeans and loosefitting shirt made him look so much like petey had looked as a boy that i shivered jason noticed whats the matter dad nothing this breeze is a little cold is all im going to put on my windbreaker you want yours naw im fine big brother petey called youre the expert in how buildings are put together do you think you can show us how to put this damned tent together the three of us needed an hour to get the job done by then it was almost kate had packed a lunch in a cooler chicken beef and peanut butter sandwiches along with soft drinks apples and little packages of potato chips jason didnt touch the apples otherwise he wolfed everything down the same as petey and i did we saw fish splashing in the lake but decided to get our poles out later for now there was plenty to do exploring we put our lunch trash in a bag locked it in the car and set out hiking to the left around the lake i remember there was a cave up there i pointed above the aspens and lots of places to climb petey yelled to jason who was running ahead of us do you like to climb i dont know jason turned to look at us continuing to run ive never done it youre going to love it the lake was about a hundred yards across we reached the other side and found a stream that fed into it the stream was swift from the spring snowmelt too wide to cross so we followed its cascading path up through the aspens the roar of the water sometimes so loud that we couldnt hear one another even though we were three thousand feet higher than the altitude of five thousand feet we were used to in denver the thin mountain air didnt slow us if anything it was invigorating it was like inhaling vitamins stretching my legs to climb over fallen trees or to clamber on and off boulders i felt such pleasure from my body that i criticized myself for not having taken time from work to do this earlier across the stream above us a deer moved its brown silhouette stiffening at our approach then bounding gracefully away through the white trunks of the aspens with the noise from the stream it couldnt have heard us coming i thought it must have smelled us then another silhouette stiffened and bounded away a third even with the noise from the stream i heard their hooves thunder soon we reached where the stream cascaded from a high narrow draw that was too dangerous to go into we angled to the left following a steep upward trail that had hoof marks on it the trail veered farther to the left maintaining a consistent level along a wooded slope so predictable that when a sunlit outcrop above us attracted our attention we decided to explore getting to it was more difficult than it appeared at one time or another both petey and i slipped on loose rocks underfoot wed have rolled to the bottom scraping our arms and legs maybe even breaking something if we hadnt managed to clutch exposed tree roots by contrast jason scurried up like a mountain goat breathing hoarsely petey and i crawled over the rim and found jason waiting for us on a wide slab of rock that provided a view of the stream below us and the chasm through which it churned two hundred feet above it we were far enough from the roar for me not to need to shout when i warned jason stay away from the edge i will he promised but gosh this is totally neat dad beats watching television huh petey said jason thought about it his face assumed an expression of i wouldnt go that far petey laughed wheres that cave you mentioned jason asked im having trouble remembering i said somewhere on this side of the stream is all i know for sure can we look for it absolutely after we take a break i settled onto the stone slab unhooked my canteen from my belt and took a long swallow of slightly warm slightly metallictasting incredibly delicious water the park ranger id spoken to on the telephone had emphasized that we needed to take canteens with us and knapsacks containing trail food a compass and a topographical map neither of which i knew how to use a firstaid kit and a rain slicker in case the weather turned bad dress in layers shed advised keep a dry jacket in your knapsack id already put on my denim windbreaker before we left the car now the hike had so warmed me that i took off the jacket and stuffed it into the knapsack anybody want some peanuts and raisins i asked im still full from lunch petey said jason looked uncomfortable whats the matter i asked i have to it took me a moment to understand pee jason nodded bashful go around that boulder over there i told him hesitant he disappeared behind it my parental obligations taken care of for the moment i stepped forward to admire the chasm the stream tumbled down a series of low waterfalls spray hovered over it how had jason described the view neat he was right this was totally neat behind me he suddenly shouted dad something slammed my back with such force that it took my breath away i hurtled into space the drop sucked more of my breath away the little that was left jolted from my mouth when i struck loose stones avalanching with them rolling sideways i groaned abruptly i hurtled into the air again plummeting farther my stomach squeezing toward my throat i jerked to an agonizing stop my left arm stretching as if it were about to be ripped from its socket my arm slipped free of something i dropped again and hit something hard cold mist swallowed me darkness swirled when my eyelids slowly opened black turned to gray but the swirling continued pain awoke throughout my body delirious i took a long time to realize that the gray swirling around me was vapor thrown up from the cascading stream the roar aggravated my dizziness i felt that i was breathing through a cold wet washcloth gradually i understood that my left arm was across my nose and mouth my shirtsleeve was soaked from the vapor that the thundering stream tossed into the air then i trembled seeing that my sleeve was wet from something besides the mist blood my arm was gashed alarm shot through me i fought to raise my head and discovered that i was on my back on a ledge below was a fall of what i judged to be i feet a series of outcrops led sharply down to the roaring stream jesus what had happened i peered up the vapor made it difficult for me to see the top of the cliff nonetheless through the haze i could distinguish a long slope of loose stones below the rim the slope had saved my life if id fallen directly to where i now lay my injuries would have been catastrophic instead id rolled down the slope painfully reducing the length of the fall but beneath the slope of loose stones there had been a ledge over which id tumbled to the ledge id landed on and the distance between them was about twenty feet a potentially lethal drop why wasnt i dead my knapsack dangled above me it was caught on a sharp branch of a stunted pine tree that had managed to grow from the side of the cliff i remembered stuffing my windbreaker into the knapsack and hanging the knapsack over my left shoulder before id walked over to peer into the chasm the branch had snagged the knapsack the sharp pain in my left shoulder indicated the force with which id been jerked to a stop my arm had slipped free from the strap id fallen a body length to this ledge luck was all that had saved me every movement excruciating i strained to sit up my mind tilted as if ball bearings rolled from the front of my skull to the back for a moment i feared that id vomit jason i tried to yell petey but the words were like stones in my throat jason i tried harder petey the roar of the stream overpowered my voice dont panic i fought to assure myself it doesnt matter if they cant hear me they know where i am theyll help me my god i hope they dont try to climb down i suddenly thought jason petey stay where you are youll fall and get killed my voice cracked making my words a hoarse whisper straining to see through the haze i hoped to catch a glimpse of jason and petey peering over the rim to try to find me no sign of them maybe theyre trying to get a better vantage point i thought or maybe theyre hurrying back to the mouth of the chasm hoping to reach me from below i prayed that theyd be careful that jason wouldnt take foolish chances that petey would make sure he didnt trembling i parted the rip in my sleeve wiping away the blood i saw a gash five inches long between my elbow and my wrist blood immediately welled up obscuring the wound it dripped from my arm pooling on the ledge bile shot into my mouth do something i thought i cant just sit here and let myself bleed to death my knapsack seemed to float above me i stretched my good arm but couldnt reach it in greater pain i mustered the strength to try to stand the firstaid kit in the knapsack i thought my legs gave out i clawed at a niche and barely avoided toppling into the chasm despite the cold from the stream i sweated shock made me tremble as i grabbed for a higher niche and wavered to my feet for a moment i saw specks in front of my eyes then my vision cleared and i stared up toward the knapsack despairingly it seemed as high as ever my injured left arm dangled at my side i extended my right arm upward another six inches all i need is six inches more i thought pressing my chest against the cliff standing on tiptoes wincing from new throbbing pain in my hips my sides and my ribs i stretched as high as i could then breathed out in triumph as i touched the knapsacks strap vapor from the stream had slicked the nylon i lost my grip but instantly pawed for the strap again pushing my tiptoes to their limits this time clutching with all my strength i tugged the knapsack to the side toward the chasm working to free it from the stout branch it had snagged on i tugged once twice and suddenly felt weightless as the knapsack jerked free falling i dove toward the ledge i screamed as my injured arm landed but i couldnt let myself react i had to concentrate solely on my good arm hanging over the ledge the knapsack dangling from my fingers cautiously i rolled onto my back and placed the knapsack on my chest the temptation to rest was canceled by the increased flow of blood from my arm nauseated i opened the knapsack pawed past my windbreaker and rain slicker pushed the ziploc bags of trail food aside and found the plastic case of the firstaid kit i clumsily pried it open dismayed to find only bandaids and twoinchsquare pads along with scissors antiseptic swabs antibiotic cream and a plastic bottle of tylenol none of that was going to stop the bleeding a tourniquet i thought ill use my belt ill tighten it around my arm and but even as i unbuckled my belt i remembered something id read about tourniquets being dangerous about the risk of blood clots and gangrene if the tourniquet wasnt loosened at proper intervals what difference does it make i thought ill bleed to death before i die from gangrene a pressure bandage whatever id read about tourniquets had warned that a pressure bandage was the safe way to stop bleeding something that put pressure on the wound without cutting off the flow of blood but where was i going to find something like that the bleeding worsened perhaps because i was lightheaded i took more time than i should have to remember something else that might be in the knapsack once when kate had been on a college trip to paris shed sprained an ankle and had limped painfully from drugstore to drugstore trying to find an ace bandage the wide long elastic material you wrap around a sprain to give the injured area some support since then whenever she traveled she made sure to carry one in her luggage and she always took care to pack one for me more dizzy i used my right hand to search through the knapsack where is it i thought it isnt like kate not to have packed one damn it this time she hadnt desperate i was about to dump everything out when i noticed a bulge at the side of the knapsack struggling to clear my mind i freed a zipper on a pouch and almost wept when i found a folded elastic bandage working awkwardly with one hand sometimes using my teeth to open packets i cleaned the gash with antiseptic swabs spread antibiotic ointment over it and pressed several twoinch pads onto it blood soaked them hurrying i wrapped the elastic bandage around my left forearm keeping it tight circling layer upon layer i saw blood tint each layer i urgently wrapped more layers applying more pressure worried about how little of the bandage remained i prayed that the blood wouldnt soak all the way through two more layers one i secured the end with two barbed clips that came with the bandage then i stared at the bandage shivering concentrating to see if blood would soak through for a moment i feared that the pale brown of the bandage would become pink about to turn red i held my breath exhaling only when a small area of pink didnt spread my watchs crystal was shattered the hands frozen at ten after two i had no idea how long id been on the ledge but when i peered up through the vapor from the stream the sun seemed to have shifted farther west than i would have expected from the brief time since id fallen evidently id been unconscious longer than it seemed i stared up at the rim but still didnt see petey and jason give them time i thought the trouble was if i didnt get off the ledge soon i was going to be in a lot worse trouble i wasnt an outdoorsmanid certainly proven that but it wasnt possible to live in a mountain state like colorado without seeing stories in the newspaper or on the tv news about the dangers of hypothermia hikers would go into the mountains wearing only shorts and tshirts a sudden storm would soak them if the temperature dropped if the hikers were more than three hours from warm clothes and hot fluids to raise their rapidly dropping core temperature they died from exposure lying on the damp chill ledge i shivered my hands and feet felt numb if i dont get off this ledge soon i thought it wont matter that i stopped the bleeding hypothermia will kill me i tried to calculate how to climb up the almost sheer face to the next ledge and then up the slope of loose stones to the rim i knew that my injured arm wouldnt support me the only other way to get off the ledge was i stared down trying to judge how the cliff led to the stream it was a steep slope of outcrops the ledge below me five feet away the one after that twice as far i didnt want to think about the obstacles farther down but the sun was already past the rim of the cliff the bottom of the chasm was in shadow even though it was only late afternoon darkness would come soon the nearby mountains would block the sun earlier than i was used to once it was dark i couldnt hope to be rescued until morning by then id be dead the pain of movement was excruciating as i eased the knapsack onto my back lay on my stomach and squirmed over the edge i dangled as far as my good arm would allow then dropped the shock of landing jolted me to the bone i almost fainted crawling over the side of the next outcrop i ripped my shirt and scraped my chest my lacerated knees showed through my torn jeans straining to control my emotions i kept struggling downward a few spots that looked impossible from above turned out to be deceptive boulders acting like steps other spots that looked easy were terrifyingly difficult throughout the light faded as the streams roar grew closer i descended with greater caution testing my footing i almost fell when a boulder dislodged under my weight and rumbled to the bottom while the dusk thickened so did the vapor from the stream beading my face soaking my clothes making me shiver harder i remembered reading that victims of hypothermia become stupefied near the end unaware of whats around them i fought to keep my thoughts clear as it was i struggled to the bottom before i realized it nearly stepping into the raging current so deadened by its thunder that i hadnt been aware how close i was lurching back i almost twisted my ankle unnerved by the surreal contrast between the blue sky above the chasm and the gathering dusk within it i shifted along the roiling water with delicate care spray drenched me as the chasm sloped toward its murky exit i worried that id break a leg within sight of my escape i made my way over slick rocks gripping boulders for support my mind and body so numbed that it took me a minute to understand that the object i leaned against was an aspen tree not a boulder that sunlight was angling toward me that id left the chasm a while ago and now was stumbling through a forest its almost over i told myself all i need to do is follow the stream through the trees to the lake as my steps quickened i imagined unlocking the car i anticipated the relief of crawling in and starting the engine of turning on the heater and feeling hot air blow over me as i changed into warm clothes from my suitcase jason petey i lurched from the aspens to the edge of the lake and squinted through dimming sunlight toward the opposite side my stomach sank when i saw that the car wasnt there easily explained petey and jason went for help i thought theyll be back soon all i have to do is crawl into the tent and try to get warm the tent was also gone no the veins in my neck threatened to burst but i couldnt stop screaming noooo denials an amazing emotion during my descent suspicions had nagged at me but id managed to suppress them too preoccupied with staying alive now i still kept trying to tell myself that i was wrong after all six hours previously the possibility that my brother would push me off a cliff would have been unthinkable especially given the load of guilt that id been carrying around my god what had petey done with jason furious shivering so hard that my teeth clicked together i yanked off my wet shirt pulled my denim jacket from the knapsack and quickly put it over my bare skin the jacket was damp from having been near the stream but it felt luxurious compared to what id been wearing it wasnt going to be enough i had to get a fire started had to dry my jeans and socks and shoes after opening a pouch on my knapsack and confirming that a metal container of matchbooks was as waterproof as the campingequipment clerk had promised i went to the aspens to get wood a breeze made my wet jeans cold and penetrated my jacket i hugged myself trying to generate warmth but trembled worse than ever not knowing what i was doing i imitated the campfire arrangement on the other side of the lake and put rocks in a circle in a clearing i placed some twigs and dead leaves in the middle set some broken sticks over them and struck a match but my hand shook so severely that as i brought the match toward the leaves the flame went out i tried again desperate to keep my hand still concentrating to control my arm muscles and this time the flame touched the leaves smoke rising fire crackling a terrible thirst overtook me but when i reached for the canteen on my belt it wasnt there i was dismayed not only that id lost it but that i hadnt noticed until now my tongue was so pasty that it stuck to the roof of my mouth the roar of the nearby stream tempted me to go to it and scoop water from my hands to my mouth but i had no idea what kind of bacteria might be in it i didnt dare risk getting sick vomiting or diarrhea would dehydrate me more than i already was all the while sunset dimmed i needed to pile up all the branches i could as the last of the sun dipped below the mountains i worked with greater urgency dragging back large fallen limbs too soon darkness enveloped me but it wasnt as black as my thoughts jason had petey hurt him please god protect my son please the word became my mantra as the nights chill made me huddle closer to the fire i was caught between the need to get warm and the fear of depleting my fuel supply before the night was over i picked up the shirt id taken off holding it to the fire turning it often i feared that id burn it before i dried it although parts of it were in rags it would provide an extra layer hating to expose my chest and back to the cold i quickly removed my jacket and put on the shirt then got into the jacket again i took the rain slicker from my knapsack and put that on as well pulling its hood over my head anything to provide more insulation my hands felt stung by the cold rubbing them over the fire i blamed myself for not having been smart enough to bring gloves hell if id been smart i never would have invited petey into my home but as hard as i tried to find some warning signs from the previous few days i couldnt think of any you bastard i inwardly screamed then regretted the word hating myself for insulting my parents every curse i could think of somehow involved them but what had happened wasnt their fault it was mine the weather forecaster had predicted a low of forty degrees fahrenheit if i fell asleep and the flames died my body might get so cold that id never wake up i thought of the warm sleeping bags that had been in the car i imagined zipping into one of them and awakening with a start i found myself lying on the cold grass next to the barely glowing embers of the fire terrified i tried to make my right hand work groped for a handful of twigs used a stick to poke them into the ashcovered coals and watched the twigs burst into flame clumsy i added larger pieces my numbness slowly leaving me but not the terror of dying from exposure drymouthed i tried to chew peanuts and raisins praying for jason helped energize my mind guarding the fire i brooded about petey hated him and stayed awake at first the feeling was so soft that i thought i imagined it an invisible cool feather tickling my face in the darkness then i heard a subtle hissing on the hot rocks around the fire in my confusion it reminded me of the hiss from our coffeemaker whenever a few drops fell from the units spout and landed on the burner at once the flurries became a little stronger the breeze that brought them turning colder i straightened from the stupor id been in the gray of false dawn hinting at what swirled around me my first alarmed instinct was to pile more wood on the fire but as snow sizzled louder on the hot stones the sun tried to struggle above the eastern peak providing sufficient light for me to see the white on the grass around me dark clouds hung low despite the extra wood id thrown on the fire the flames lessened smoke rose panicked i put on my knapsack as petey had told jason when wed left the highway early june wasnt too late for snow in the mountains on tv the forecasters sometimes cautioned people that at high altitude the weather could change for the worse without warning but that hadnt been predicted and id figured that with the car and the tent there wasnt anything to worry about now i cursed myself for not making better plans the highway was a half hour away by car frowning at the thickening angrier clouds i tried to calculate how far id have to go on foot the road into the mountains had been so bad the terrain so rough that most of the time i hadnt been able to drive more than twenty miles an hour that meant the highway was about ten miles off but with my ankle hurting ten miles might take me five or six hours on foot in clothes too flimsy for the cold besides as the flurries intensified preventing me from seeing the lake i realized that i probably wouldnt be able to find my way to the highway that id risk wandering in circles until i dropped of course if id known how to use the compass the campingequipment clerk had sold me my chances might have been different but regret wasnt a survival emotion fear for jason was rage at petey was thinking of jason i was suddenly reminded of the last time id seen him the shelf of rock wheres that cave you mentioned hed asked the cave if i could find it before the storm got worse fighting for strength i lurched into the trees abruptly visibility lessened and i stumbled to the right toward the stream not to drink from it but to use it as a guide a white veil enveloped me as i followed the churning water up through the trees the flakes became thicker the snow on the ground covered my tennis shoes my tennis shoes id bought a compass which i didnt know how to use and yet i hadnt taken the campingequipment clerks advice to buy sturdy hiking boots they werent necessary id told him we werent going to be doing anything heavyduty my feet started to lose sensation limping i worked my way along a slope worrying that a rock beneath the snow would shift and cause me to fall could i rely on my memory of where the cave was for all i knew it was on the opposite side of the stream and it was merely a crevice in a cliff which as a thirteenyearold boy i had thought was huge the slope reached a steep ridge that went to the left while i plodded along it the aspens became pine trees branches jabbed at my arms and scratched my face as the snow gusted thicker i feared that id stumble past the cave and never see it in the summer hikers would find my body or what was left of it after the forest scavengers had feasted on it im an architect not a survival expert i thought i could hardly feel my hands why the hell hadnt i put gloves in my knapsack i was so stupid i deserved to die trying to avoid a pine branch i lost my footing fell and almost banged my head against a boulder on my right stupid deserve to architect the vague thought nudged my dimming consciousness know how to slowly the thought insisted making me turn toward the boulder my head had nearly struck build things when i struggled to my feet i discovered that the boulder was as high as my chest a second boulder five feet to the left was slightly less high the boulders lay against a cliff which formed a rear wall build things i repeated i stumbled to the pine branch id tried to avoid put all my weight into it and felt a surge of hope when a snap intruded on the smothering stillness working as hard as i could i dragged the branch through the snow to the boulders and hefted it on top bracing it across them staggering i repeated the process several times overlaying the needles trying to form a roof the cold made my hands ache so much that tears streamed from my eyes freezing on my cheeks but i didnt have time to stick my hands raw and bloody under my rain slicker to try to warm them against my chest there was too much to do i used footballsize rocks to weigh down the edges of the branches delirious i kicked the snow from the ground between the boulders adding it to the drift outside the shelter i stuck two needled branches at the shelters entrance forming a further windbreak no matter how pained my hands were i couldnt stop i had to get dead twigs leaves and sticks piling them at the back of the shelter id left a small hole at the back where the boulders touched the cliff hoping that smoke would escape through it away from the wind and the falling snow i felt less assaulted by the cold but my hands were like paws as i clumsily made a small pile of leaves and twigs then fumbled to open the container of matches and pull out a book of them i could hardly peel off one of the matches my fingers didnt seem to belong to me the match kept falling it was finally so damaged that i had to peel off a second match and this one blessedly caught fire when i struck it it fell from my hands onto the clump of leaves and twigs remained burning and started a small fire smoke rose i held my breath to keep from coughing pushed by heat the smoke drifted toward the hole in the back my throat was so dry that it swelled shut restricting the passage of air to my lungs desperate for something to drink i reached my unfeeling right hand outside and fumbled to raise snow to my mouth instantly i regretted it the melting snow made my lips and tongue more numb than they already were shivering i felt a deeper cold i dimly remembered tv news reports that warned hikers caught in a blizzard not to eat snow as a way of getting moisture theyd use so much body heat melting the snow in their mouths that they had a greater risk of dying from hypothermia the small amount of water from the melted snow hadnt done any good almost instantly my lips became dry again my swollen tongue seemed to fill my mouth it was a measure of how dazed id become that i stared blearily down at the metal container of matches for a long time before my muddled thoughts cleared and i realized what i had to do shaking i put the matches in the firstaid kit i picked up their metal container reached outside into the wind packed the container with snow and set it near the fire slowly the crystals melted worried about burning my hand i put my shirtsleeve over my fingers before i gripped the hot container and pulled it away from the fire it was only half an inch thick and two inches square but it might as well have been a sixteenounce glass so irresistible was the tiny amount of water in it i forced myself to let it cool finally i couldnt be patient any longer i used my sleeve to raise the container i brought it close to my lips blew on it then gulped the warm bitter water my parched mouth absorbed it before i could swallow i reached greedily outside and packed it with more snow the lingering heat in the metal reduced the snow to water without my needing to set the container near the fire again i gulped it again the water never got near my throat i refilled the container placed it near the fire and put a few more sticks on the flames that became my pattern when my mouth and throat were moist enough i pulled a plastic bag of peanuts and raisins from my knapsack chewing each mouthful thoroughly making them last worrying about jason hating petey i stared at the fire i vaguely remember going out to clear a drift from the smoke hole and to find more fuel otherwise everything blurred a couple of times when i woke the flames had died out on those occasions all that kept me from freezing to death was the heat that the boulders had absorbed when i noticed that the pressure bandage around my left forearm was completely pink from the bleeding under it i didnt react with dismaythe arm seemed to belong to someone else even when i saw sunlight beyond the branches and drifts at the entrance to my shelter i felt oddly apart from it eventually i discovered that an entire day had passed but while i was trapped in the shelter time hardly moved probably id have lain in a stupor until energy totally failed me if it hadnt been for water dripping through the roof the cold drops struck my eyelids shocking me the sunlight was painfully bright i moved my head the drops fell into my mouth tasting vaguely of turpentine from the resin on the pine branches i gagged and spat the water out sitting up to reach a dry spot more drops splashed around me raising smoke from the almostdead fire coughing i grabbed my knapsack and stumbled outside kneeing through the branches and drifts at the entrance the heat of the sun was luxurious snow fell from trees rivulets started to form standing in the melting snow my feet and shins became wet again but it was a different kind of wet the sun warming me so that i didnt shiver from the suns angle in the east i judged that the time was midmorning as much as my body didnt want to move i knew that if i didnt take advantage of the improved weather i might never have another chance i took a long look back at the shelter it was loose and flimsy as if a child had put it together and yet id never been prouder of anything id designed i started down light reflecting off the snow lanced my eyes by the time the sun was directly overhead much of the snow had melted the ground turning to mud as i crossed the first meadow still the road remained hidden and with little to guide me all i could do was keep heading downward aiming toward breaks in the trees where the road possibly went through them i dont remember reaching highway or collapsing there or being found by a passing motorist apparently that was at sunset i woke up in a small medical clinic in a town called frisco by then a state trooper had been summoned he leaned over the bed and wanted to know what had happened to me i later found out that it took him twenty minutes to get a coherent account from me i kept screaming for jason as if my son was within arms reach and i could help him the doctor stitched my left forearm he disinfected and bandaged my hands which he was worried might have frostbite the state trooper returned from talking on the phone mr denning the denver police sent a patrol car to your house the lights were off no one answered the doorbell when they aimed a flashlight through a garage window they saw your ford expedition in the garage that doesnt make sense why would petey have gone back to the house the awful implication hit me jesus i tried to scramble out of bed it took both the doctor and the state trooper to stop me the officers broke a window and entered your house they searched it thoroughly its deserted mr denning do you have any other vehicles what difference does my head pounded my wife has a volvo it isnt in the garage that didnt make sense either the bastard must have taken it why and where are my wife and son the increasingly troubled look on the troopers face made me realize that he hadnt told me everything the master bedroom and your sons room had been ransacked the trooper said what drawers had been pulled out clothes scattered it looked to the denver officers as if somebody tore through those bedrooms in an awful hurry i screamed part two no matter how desperately i wanted to get home the doctor refused to release me until the next morning the state trooper drove me back to denver my right wrist ached from the iv the doctor had given me after two days without food i should have been ravenous but the shock of my emotions killed my appetite i had to force myself to chew slowly on a banana and take small sips from a bottle of orange juice when we turned onto my street i saw the maple trees in front of our victorian a van and a station wagon in our driveway and a denver police car at the curb farther along were other cars and two trucks from local tv stations getting out of the cruiser i recognized the female television reporter who stalked toward me armed with a microphone a cameraman behind her her male equivalent from a rival station wasnt far behind reporters scrambled from the other cars how the hell did they find out i asked get in the house holding out his arms the state trooper formed a barrier while i limped across the lawn the pants and shirt the doctor had lent me my own had been rags hung loosely on me increasing my sense of frailty i managed to get inside and shut the door blocking the noise of the reporters shouting my name but other voices replaced them a police officer several men in sport coats and others holding lab equipment stood in the living room talking to one another one of the men heavyset with a mustache noticed me in the foyer and came over mr denning the motion of nodding made me dizzy im lieutenant webber this is sergeant pendleton he indicated a younger thinner man cleanshaven we checked the attic the basement and the trees in back theres no sign of your wife and son pendleton said for a moment i didnt understand what the detective was talking about the officers whod entered the house the previous night had said that kate and jason werent home if petey had taken them in kates volvo why would the police now have checked the attic and the i felt sick when i realized that theyd been searching for wellhidden corpses you dont look so good mr denning youd better sit down webber guided me into the living room where the other men shifted to the side ill get you some water despite the fluids the doctor had given me i still felt parched when the detective came back with a full glass i had a moments disorientation as if this were his home and i were a guest i held the glass awkwardly between my bandaged hands and took a swallow my stomach protested i managed to ask youve no idea where my wife and son are not yet webber said the state police relayed what you told them but we need to ask you some questions he looked at the scrapes on my face do you feel strong enough to answer them the sooner i do the sooner ill get my family back a look passed between them which i understood only later they werent as confident as i was that id get my family back it would help if pendleton glanced at where my fingertips projected from the bandages on my hands we need to take your prints take my but why would so we can separate yours from the man who kidnapped your family which bedroom was his go to the left at the top of the stairs i felt out of breath the rooms at the end of the hall on the right thats the one with the baseball glove on the bed webber told a technician baseball glove i tensed on his bed pendleton frowned yes is that important the glove was peteys a long time ago i dont understand hes saying he doesnt want the damnedthing anymore because hes got something better slow down mr denning were not following you as a technician pressed my fingertips on an inky pad and then onto a sheet of paper that had a place for each digit i tried as hard as i could to make them understand longlost brother god help me yes but how did you know he really was your brother he told me things only my brother could have known the detectives gave each other that look again whats wrong just a thought webber said maybe you heard what you wanted to hear some con men are good at making general statements sound specific the people theyre trying to fool fill in the gaps no i tested him he got every detail right they can be awfully clever but it doesnt make sense a con mans motive would have been robbery all hed have needed to do was wait until kate and i went to work and jason was at school hed have had all day to loot the house he wouldnt have needed to try to kill me that was personal that was petey getting even pendleton made a calming gesture were just trying to get a sense of the man were after for gods sake a con man wouldnt be stupid enough to add murder and kidnapping to a burglary charge unless he enjoyed violence the direct look webber gave me was dizzying in its effect all along id worked to assure myself that jason and kate were alive now for the first time i admitted to myself that jason might be dead in the mountains that kates body might be lying in a ditch somewhere i almost threw up pendleton seemed to sense my panicked thoughts his tone suggested an attempt to distract me you dont happen to have a photograph of him do you no with the excitement of the homecoming you didnt take any pictures no i wanted to scream if only i hadnt let a stranger into my house but he isnt a stranger i tried to tell myself what the hells the matter with you i thought after twentyfive years petey is a stranger mr denning i looked over at pendleton realizing that hed said my name several times in an effort to get my attention if youre able wed like you to walk through the house and tell us if anythings missing whatever i have to do they handed me latex gloves and put on their own unsteady i began in the downstairs rooms and immediately i noticed that the silverware kate had inherited from her grandmother was no longer on the sideboard in the dining room a silver tea set was missing also in the tv room the dvd and videotape players were gone along with an expensive audiovideo receiver hed probably have taken the tv too i said bitterly except that its fortysix inches and wouldnt fit in the volvo i dont understand why he didnt keep the expedition its got more room he could have stolen more things webber looked uncomfortable well talk about it later finish checking the house the microwave and the cuisinart food processor were missing from the kitchen numerous compact power tools were gone from the garage my laptop computer wasnt in my office what about firearms pendleton asked do you have any in the house did he take them no guns not even a hunting rifle no im not a hunter i made my way upstairs and froze at the entrance to jasons room seeing his drawers pulled out his clothes scattered on the floor it took all my willpower to step inside and look around my son saves his loose change in ajar on his desk i said it wasnt there i had an even harder time going into the chaos of the master bedroom stepping over some of kates dresses on the floor i stared toward the back of the walkin closet four suitcases are gone as the implication hit me my knees weakened so much that i had to lean against the doorjamb id assumed that petey had ransacked the bureaus and closets because he was in a rush to find things to steal now daring to hope i took a closer look and realized that kates and jasons clothes werent just scatteredsome of them were missing if theyre dead he wouldnt have packed clothes for them i told the detectives theyre alive theyve got to be alive in a daze i followed webbers instructions and kept looking some of my clothes were gone too my emergency stash of five hundred dollars was no longer at the back of my underwear drawer kates jewel box was missing along with a gold rolex that i wore on special occasions none of it mattered only kate and jason did throughout the technicians kept photographing the chaos in the bedrooms and checking for fingerprints to get out of their way the detectives took me downstairs again i had the sense that the house no longer belonged to me why the volvo i managed to ask my voice seemed to come from far away you said wed talk about why he took it the expedition would have allowed him to steal more things yes pendleton spoke reluctantly but the volvo has something that the fourwheeldrive vehicle doesnt i dont know what you mean a trunk a understanding forced me to sit maybe it isnt a good idea to go into the details tell me my bandaged hands ached as i clutched the sides of the leather chair i need to know webber glanced away as if he couldnt bear to see my eyes the way it looks he came back here with your son and then subdued your wife we have to assume they were bound and gagged a rope seemed to cut into my wrists he wouldnt have risked driving with them scrunched down in the backseat sooner or later someone would have noticed pendleton said so he put them in the with the garage door closed nobody would have seen him do it jesus imagining the stench of gasoline and car exhaust i felt nauseated how could they breathe i suddenly remembered peteys haunted look when hed described how the man and woman had forced him into a trunk a shrill beep startled me webber reached beneath his blazer and unhooked his cell phone from his belt as he turned his back and walked toward the piano that kate enjoyed playing i barely heard his muted voice he put away the phone something i straightened nervously hoping the volvos been found at a rest stop off interstate twentyfive kate and jason are they not with the car he left the state wyoming troopers found the volvo north of casper wyoming for all he knew he had plenty of time and the volvo wouldnt have been missed for several days webber said but suppose your wife was expected somewhere saturday night or suppose friends were going to arrive and no matter what he did to persuade her she wouldnt tell him about it my skin turned cold at the thought of the pain kate would have suffered his best choice was to get your wife and son away before anyone suspected something was wrong webber said the nearest atm for your bank has a record of a sixtwentyone pm withdrawal of five hundred dollars the most that the machine is allowed to take from an account on any one day the videotape shows a man making the withdrawal but his heads bowed so his face is hidden sweat chilled me when i realized that petey had forced kate to tell him our atm number it looks like he drove until nightfall then used the cover of darkness to carjack another vehicle at the rest stop outside casper the likely target would have been someone traveling alone but the driver wasnt found near the rest stop so we assume that he or she is in the car with your wife and son until the drivers reported missing we wont know what kind of car to search for three people trying to breathe in a trunk jesus something in the detectives eyes made me guess what they were thinking as dangerous as petey was it might be only two people trying to breathe he might not have let the driver live wyoming but why in hell would he have gone to wyoming at once i remembered something petey had said montana you sound like that means something to you pendleton said what are you getting at montanas north of wyoming they looked at me as if i was babbling no listen to me my brother said that when he saw me on the cbs sunday morning show he was having breakfast in montana in a diner in butte maybe thats why hes heading north maybe something in montanas drawing him back for the first time webber was animated good he hurriedly pulled out his phone ill send descriptions of this guy your wife and your son to the montana state police well contact the butte police department pendleton quickly added maybe they know something about this guy if hes been arrested theyll have a photograph of him that we can circulate assuming he called himself peter denning up there i stared dismally down at the floor there are other ways to investigate kidnapping across state lines means the fbi will get involved the feds will do their best to match the fingerprints we find with ones they have on file if this guy ever used an alias we have a good chance of learning what it is i tried hard to believe what they were saying have you a recent photograph of your wife and son on the mantel i looked in that direction the beaming faces of kate and jason made me heartsick id taken the photograph myself normally i hardly knew which button to press on a camera but that day id gotten lucky wed been to copper mountain skiing although falling down was more what kate and i had done jason had been a natural however hed grinned all day despite our bruises so had kate and i in the photo kate wore a red ski jacket jason a green one the two of them holding their knitted ski caps kates blond hair and jasons sandy hair glinting in the sun their cheeks glowing well return it as soon as we have copies made pendleton said keep it as long as you have to the truth was i hated to part with it the empty place on the mantel reinforced my hollowness anything elseanything at alljust ask what they need more than anything i thought is for god to answer my prayers throughout the phone had rung frequently id been vaguely aware that a policeman had answered it now he handed me a list of whod called mostly reporters wanting an interviewtv radio what had happened would be all over the state by evening jesus kates parents hurrying i left webber and pendleton in the living room in the kitchen my bandaged hand shook when i pressed numbers on the telephone hello an elderly man said ray i could hardly make my voice work sit down im afraid ive got bad news it made me sick to have to tell them to hear their lives change in a minute neither of them was in good health even so they immediately wanted to drive the three hundred miles from durango through the mountains to denver i had a hard time convincing them to stay home after all what were they going to accomplish in denver kates father was breathing so fast that he sounded like he was going to have a heart attack stay put i said all we can do now is wait i had a terrible mental image of kates father rushing to get to denver losing control of his car and plummeting down a gorge you can wait just as easily at home ill let you know the instant i learn anything setting down the phone i took a deep breath then noticed webber and pendleton at the entrance to the kitchen what i asked we just got a call from the wyoming state police webber said i braced myself a woman from caspers been reported missing saturday evening she was en route from visiting her sister in sheridan which is about a hundred and fifty miles north of where she lives you think my brother carjacked her the timing fits just after dark she would have approached the rest stop where the wyoming state police found your wifes volvo if the woman had to use the rest room inwardly i flinched as i imagined petey coming at the woman and how terrified she must have been she was driving a chevy caprice pendleton said apart from the fact that she was driving alone her abductor probably singled her out because that type of car has a large trunk he kept heading north the wyoming police gave the license number to the police in montana who found the caprice at a rest stop on interstate ninety near billings were my wife and son with the caprice no something about pendletons tone made me suspicious what about the woman who owned it he didnt answer tell me pendleton glanced at webber who nodded as if giving permission her body was in the trunk dear god i didnt want to know and yet i couldnt stop from asking what did petey do to her tied her hands and covered her mouth with duct tape shependletons voice droppedhad asthma she choked to death thinking about the womans desperate struggle to breathe i could barely concentrate as webber explained that petey could have driven the caprice from casper wyoming to billings montana that same night hed presumably carjacked another vehicle at the billings rest stop as the driver got out of the car to go to the bathroom petey would have lunged from the shadows i imagined how horrifying it would have been for kate and jason pressed next to the dying woman in the dark the air foul feeling her thrash hearing her muffled choking sounds her frenzied movements her strangled gasps slowing getting weaker stopping its never going to end i managed to say no we could be close to boxing him in pendleton said you predicted right he was headed to montana probably back to butte billings is on the interstate that leads there the local police dont have any criminal record for someone named peter denning but theyre searching for a man who matches this guys description especially that scar on his chin the driver of the most recent vehicle he carjacked will soon have somebody report him or her missing once the butte police get the make and license number of the vehicle they can narrow their search meanwhile theyre checking motels and any other places they can think of where your brother might be able to hide your wife and son buttes not a big city believe me if he shows himself hell be spotted but what if petey senses the danger and leaves we thought of that the montana state police have unmarked cars along the interstate watching for any white male in his thirties whos driving alone as soon as the fbi processes his fingerprints well have a better idea of who were dealing with the way he operates hes had practice hes probably got a criminal record in which case the feds will come up with a recent mug shot we can distribute one of the callers on the list the policeman had handed me was from my office so i had to phone and again explain what had happened saying it out loud reinforced the nightmare several times i heard the buzz of call waiting twice i switched to the incoming call in case it had something to do with kate and jason but both times it was a journalist and after that i didnt pay attention to call waiting the moment i hung up the phone rang again we had caller id but most times id found it was useless a lot of the calls listed as unknown caller or in this case blocked number but i answered anyhow and of course it was another journalist after that i let the policeman answer the phone when the lab crew finally left webber pendleton and everybody else going with them the house had never felt so empty my footsteps echoed off the hardwood floors as i went upstairs fingerprint powder smudged furniture and clothes remained on the bedroom floors i sat on jasons bed inhaling his boy smell i went into the master bedroom picked up one of kates blouses and pressed it to my face i have no idea how long i remained there the phone rang again ignoring it i went into the bathroom took off my borrowed clothes and tried to take a bath without getting my bandaged hands and my stitched left forearm wet dirt and dried blood floated from me steam rose but instead of the waters heat what i felt was spreading pain as the effect of the pills the doctor had given me began to wear off the extent of my bruises was appalling i did my best to shave then put on fresh clothes but i begrudged their comfort telling myself that i didnt deserve it given the hell that kate and jason would be going through the doorbell rang limping i needed extra time to get downstairs meanwhile the bell rang again and then again if this is a reporter i thought when i opened the door i saw a straightbacked man in a dark suit with polished shoes and short neat slightly graying hair his lean face was all business mr denning behind him out on the street a camera crew started forward im not giving interviews i stepped back to close the door no you dont understand im fbi special agent john gader the man showed his id i kept phoning but no one answered so i took a chance and drove over i was i didnt please come in as the reporters neared the house i shut the door and locked it gader opened his briefcase and took out several small electronic devices these are voiceactivated tape recorders he linked one to the living room phone is there a phone in the kitchen he installed a recorder there also well deal with the rest of the house later ive already obtained a court order to have your phone tapped and all calls traced but it never hurts to have a backup system if the man who took your wife and son phones to demand a ransom well have a recording of it here as well as through our intercept at the phone company there wont be a ransom demand you never know i do know my brother doesnt want money he wants my wife and my son your brother gader sounded as if he knew only the general parameters of the case so yet again i explained what had happened gader pulled out a pocketsize tape recorder and took notes as a backup he assured me that the bureau would give my case its full attention after he left it was as if hed never been present emptiness again enveloped me this cant have happened i thought straining to convince myself im having a nightmare ill wake up soon kate and jason will be back everythingll be perfect the way it was but when i woke in the night pain racking my body i reached next to me and was confronted by the emptiness on kates side of the bed nothing had changed as the days stretched on the butte police failed to catch petey or find any sign of kate and jason the montana state troopers finally stopped watching the interstate he isnt your brother what the man who took your wife and son isnt peter denning gader said as he stood at my front door his names lester dant i felt as if id been shoved you mean petey used the name lester dant as an alias no the other way around for gods sake what are you talking about the prints the crimescene crew found in your house belong to a man named lester dant gader stepped inside heres the file we have on him background social security number criminal record bewildered i sat in the living room and stared at the photograph that came with the documents complete with chipped tooth and scarred chin peteys face confronted me from a mug shot that had been taken in butte but the file identified the man as lester dant hed been born in brockton indiana a year before petey was born over the years hed been arrested for but never convicted of auto theft armed robbery and manslaughter dant did time for extortion drug dealing and rape gader said its a miracle he didnt kill you all in your sleep see where the butte police have a record on him lester dant got in a bar fight and put a man in the emergency ward he was released from jail a week before the cbs sunday morning broadcast you were on but my sense of unreality intensified so much that the living room seemed to tilt how did he know so much about petey they must have crossed paths gader said maybe your brother saw the cbs sunday morning show and talked about it with some people he knew including dant later in private dant got more specifics from him and decided to pay you a visit i raised my voice in dismay my brother hung around with people like dant maybe your brother had as rough a life as dant claimed but why in gods name didnt petey come to see me himself gader stared at me and i tensed with the realization that dant might have killed petey to prevent him from interfering it doesnt make sense i told gader if dants this vicious why would he have packed clothes for my son why would he have taken jason along instead of the words caught in my throat killing him gader looked uncomfortable im not sure thats a topic you want to get into let me decide that answer me gader exhaled slowly its probable that dant took your son to put pressure on your wife by threatening to hurt jason he could force your wife to submit to him i felt as if id been struck in the face no im sorry mr denning you asked me to be candid petey lester dant fingerprints dont lie theres got to be a mistake what petey told me about when we were kids and how he was abducted what dant told you he probably kept buying your brother drinks to keep him talking supplying details but it all felt so real im sure he was telling the truth listen some of these con men are goodenough actors they could have won academy awards if theyd gone straight its just that everything was a lie the name of the town in west virginia where he told you he was held prisoner redemption theres no such place what other parts of his story dont hold together either he told you he got the scar on his chin last summer when he fell off a ladder on a roofing project in colorado springs thats right well our agents showed dants photograph to all the roofing contractors in that area nobody recognized him the same with the construction contractors if somebody had gotten a twoinch gash on his face theyd remember it they say it would have required stitches but the hospitals in the area dont have any record of a construction worker coming in last summer with that kind of injury however the colorado springs police have a securitycamera tape of a man who looks like dant beating a clerk in a liquor store robbery a police car chased his vehicle into the mountains he may have gotten the injury to his face when his car skidded off a curve and tumbled into a draw there was blood but no driver when officers climbed down to examine the wreckage bitterness twisted my voice yeah petey has a habit of vanishing you mean dant sure dant well get him gader said the money he took from you wont last long eventually hell have to steal again one mistake thats all he has to make and well get him eventually the word that gader had used stuck in my throat i tried not to think about what was happening to kate and jason so a man who was my brother or who wasnt my brother but who was pretending to be him had abducted my family and torn my world apart hed covered his trail by fooling me and the police into thinking he was going to butte montana then hed vanished off the face of the earth no other motorists were reported missing for that time period which meant that the police didnt have a license number and a description of a carjacked vehicle to focus their search there were numerous reports of stolen cars hundreds in montana wyoming and colorado thousands nationwide but when any of these were located petey i still couldnt bring myself to call him dant was never linked to them perhaps hed switched license plates with another vehicle the owner of the other vehicle might have taken quite a while to notice that the plates had been switched by which time petey might have stolen another car or switched plates again or perhaps petey had taken the money he got for the things he stole from my house to buy an old car and then showed a fake id to register the car under an alias that the police didnt know he had perhaps could have might have the local tv stations repeated the story the networks picked it up especially cbs which included excerpts from the sunday morning segment that kate jason and i had been in they emphasized the sick twist that a man who claimed to be my longlost brother had vanished again this time with my family i got calls from men who claimed to have taken kate and jason in graphic detail they described the torture they inflicted the police traced the calls but nothing was learned except that some people love to aggravate the suffering of others several of the callers were charged with obstructing the investigation but none ever went to jail despair and lack of sleep gave me headaches i went through the motions of working but my staff ran the business i spent most of my time in a trance as the search lost momentum it became obvious that unless peteyagain i tried to substitute dants name but i couldnt manage to do sounless petey stumbled into a policeman he was never going to be found especially if he grew a beard to cover the scar on his chin so his mug shot would no longer resemble him blurred photos of kate and jason appeared on milk cartons and in mailers have you seen this woman and this boy the caption read but if i couldnt recognize the indistinct faces i couldnt imagine anyone else being able to id never paid attention to the faces on those milk cartons and those mailers when it was someone elses wife or child who was missing how could i hope that anyone would pay attention when it was my wife and child who were missing friends were supportive initially phone calls of encouragement invitations to dinner but after a while many wearied of my despair unable to come up with fresh expressions of sympathy they kept their distance a few remained loyal though and it was from my nextdoor neighbor phil barrow that i learned how things could get worse i was listlessly raking dead leaves in my front yard vaguely aware that autumn had once been my favorite time of year frost in the air wood smoke the rattle of dead leaves and now it meant nothing when i happened to look up and see phil hug his sweater tighter to his chest then step off the sidewalk and approach me how are you doing brad kate had once told me that no matter how shitty either of us felt we should always answer never better phils shoulders moved up and down as if from a bitter chuckle yeah i can see that youve been raking that same pile of leaves for about an hour neatness counts phil looked down at his hands i dont know if i should tell you this oh i felt a cold breeze marge says i shouldnt upset you but i figure youve got enough trouble without getting more trouble from the people who are supposed to be helping you the breeze got colder what are you talking about an fbi agent came to see me at work yesterday john gader yeah that was his name he asked me if you and kate got along if there were a lot of family arguments if you ever hit your son what he wanted to know if you lost your temper when you drank if you had a girlfriend the fbi suspects me you son of a bitch gader faltered when i stepped in front of his car in the parking garage of denvers federal building calm down you think i killed my wife and son i gather that some of your friends told you id been asking them questions about you destroying my reputation is more like it fists clenched i stepped toward him take it easy gader said its engine echoing a car drove past in the garage the driver frowning at us this area has security cameras its patrolled gader said you dont even want to think about assaulting a federal agent on federal property itd be worth it gader held up his hands in surrender im not going to fight you if youll calm down and listen behind him a door banged open a guard stepped into the garages harsh lights his hand was on his holstered gun is everything all right mr gader im not sure gaders lean face was stern is everything all right mr denning i squeezed my fists so tightly that my knuckles ached if you go to prison hows that going to help your wife and son gader asked i trembled feeling anger burn my face think about what your family needs gader said i relaxed my fists its going to be fine joe gader told the guard you can leave us now ill watch the monitor the guard said good idea gader waited until the door rumbled shut how could you possibly think i killed my wife and son its a standard part of an investigation when a family members missing or killed a lot of times the person responsible is another family member jesus how could i have driven the volvo to wyoming then stolen a car and abandoned it in montana and somehow have gotten back here to maroon myself in the mountains you could have if this guy dant had been working for you the depth of gaders suspicion shocked me why would i have asked petey to do that dant if you had money troubles and needed the payout from a lifeinsurance policy or if you had a girlfriend who made your wife an inconvenience i clenched my fists again but there werent any unusual withdrawals from your bank accounts or your stock portfolio and there wasnt a hint of scandal about your relations with your family besides i couldnt figure out how youd have crossed paths with dant after he got out of jail in butte and quit staring at me like that the investigation wasnt going anywhere i had to try a different approach you son of a bitch you made my friends think im responsible for my familys disappearance it wasnt personal i told you i was following standard procedure the point is you came through the investigation perfectly youre in the clear thanks thanks a fucking lot you seem determined to avoid using lester dants name the psychiatrist said i didnt answer the fbi did a thorough background check the psychiatrist continued they proved that hes not your brother my chest was so tight that i could hardly get the words out they think dant crossed paths with my brother and learned what had happened to him as a child he decided to switch places with petey possibly killed him i stared out a window toward a pine tree but you dont believe it the psychiatrist said i cant cant the psychiatrist evaluated the word the tightness spread to my throat if i accepted that dant kidnapped my wife and son id have to admit that given his profile hed have done whatever he wanted to them and i couldnt bring myself to say killed them i kept staring through the window toward the pine tree but if petey was using dant as an alias my voice broke if petey took them theres a good chance theyre still alive the psychiatrist sat forward why do you think that ive tried to put myself in his place the tree became a blur ive done my best to imagine what petey must have felt when he came into my house my loving family my comfortable surroundings petey wouldnt have wanted merely to kill me for destroying his life hed have wanted my life the one id made for myself i forced myself to continue ive analyzed the moment when petey pushed me into the gorge ive relived it again and again i think peteys plan was to wait until jason wasnt around and then kill me making it look like an accident then he intended to sympathize with kate and jason to make himself indispensable and eventually to take my place the only problem was jason saw him push me i took a deep breath so the plan was ruined what was petey going to do kill jason make that death look like an accident also try to take my place with kate no jason was an essential part of what petey wanted not just my wife but my family obviously he couldnt live in my house then not without jason telling the police what hed seen but petey could steal my family he could hide them someplace and screw my wife whenever he wanted he could force my son to treat him like a father i squeezed the words out at least theyd be alive if petey and dant are the same person if petey took them but if dants who the fbi claims he is if he isnt petey he probably killed jason right away and hid his body in the mountains then he made the best of a failed plan by looting the house and forcing kate to go someplace with him probably the montana mountains where he could rape her as much as he wanted before he got bored with her and i stopped unable to admit kate might be dead the psychiatrist narrowed her eyes as if id just described hell but whether it was the hell that kate and jason suffered or whether it was the hell of what she considered my delusional mind i couldnt know as i swallowed another antidepression pill i heard the doorbell ring the fbi with news i hoped but when i opened the door i frowned at children in costumes on my porch trickortreaters it was halloween but i hadnt been aware i didnt have candy not that they cared they stumbled back as if i was the one in a scary costume when i tried to explain they ran from the porch i closed the door and shut off the light peering out a darkened window i saw other costumed children and as i hoped they passed the house i couldnt help remembering that halloween was one of jasons favorite holidays how hed loved to dress up as a space monster or a mad scientist how i had loved to go out with him but that wasnt going to happen now it made me angry that id frightened the children was my face that twisted with loss were my eyes that dark with insanity the vial of pills remained in my hand cursing i threw it across the living room depression gave way to fury what was it that petey had said when hed first approached me and id thought that he was a fake when id told him to get away before i beat the shit out of him brad youd have a harder time outfighting me than when we were kids well see i thought in that moment as i heard someone on the street shout to warn children away from my porch i vowed to stop waiting for the police and the fbi to do something i had to stop hoping that something would happen i had to make something happen a theory of substitution gader asked yes i was so distraught that i stood in front of his desk instead of sitting we know that petey lied dant but what if the reason he was so convincing is that he based his lies on the truth he was in butte and colorado springs at the times he said after all he just wasnt doing what he claimed whats that got to do with this theory of you told me that west virginia doesnt have a town called redemption thats correct but what about the rest of the country is there a town called redemption anywhere or what about towns in west virginia whose names have a religious connotation similar to redemption gader thought about it possibly it would help dant to keep his stories straight could you check gader leaned back in his chair his thin face looked even thinner from weariness ill try the bureau has me working double time on he pointed toward a thick stack of documents on his desk what difference would it make all that stuff dant said about his past was a lie to make you sympathize with him but what if it was only partly a lie it still wont help us find your wife and son every leads been followed the task force has been disbanded all we can do is wait for dant to surface petey i strained to keep control damn it doesnt anything you learn about him take you one step closer to understanding his patterns and where he might go sure gader said of course he stood and walked me to his frostedglass door the theory of substitution he said without conviction certainly ill definitely do some checking by all means if you think of anything else just let me know mr payne will see you now the receptionist said i set down the threemonthold newsweek which might as well have been uptodate given how little id paid attention to what was happening in the world crossing the small waiting area i entered an office that was spacious by comparison although in my own company it would have been considered tiny it was austere a wooden chair a desk a computer another chair and a fish tank into which a portly bespectacled man tapped grains of food his white hair contrasted with the healthy ruddiness of his cheeks his sport coat was off he wore yellow suspenders over a blue shirt how are you this afternoon mr denning not very good im afraid otherwise i wouldnt be here payne nodded his puffy chin bobbing slightly its for sure nobody comes to me with happy news i used to internalize it all at the end of the day id be a wreck but then i remembered the fish tank in my dentists office and how it calmed me before i went in to have my teeth drilled these are just gardenvariety goldfish i dont know if they help my clients but they do wonders for me would you believe that i used to be a hundredandfortypound bundle of anxiety but ever since i got these fish ivehe spread his arms to his girthblossomed i had to smile a little thats the spirit mr denning payne set down the box of fish food and eased into the chair behind his desk would you like some coffee a soft drink i shook my head no he laced his fingers over his ample stomach and gave me the most sympathetic look id ever experienced then tell me how i can help you haltingly i explained about kate and jason payne nodded i read about it in the newspapers and saw the stories on television a terrible thing my attorney says youre the best private investigator in denver maybe he doesnt know a lot of private investigators he says you used to be with the fbi he says you tracked down a serial killer thats right he says you predicted where a team of interstate bank robbers was going to hit next true and when they were going to do it he also says you blocked a domesticterrorist attempt to but that was only on the weekends the joke caught me unprepared please all that flattery just makes my cheeks get redder payne said i was part of a team we each did our share my attorney says that you did more than your share did he also tell you that it cost me my first marriage not to mention a bullet in my knee that forced me to leave the bureau i finally got the wisdom to stop having undue expectations of myself you shouldnt have undue expectations either mr denning im good but only because i often see patterns others dont for something like this its important to your emotional health that you dont count on the impossible with nowhere else to turn i swallowed my disappointment fair enough so let me ask you again how do you think i can help you the fbi and the police have given up i tried to keep my voice steady its been six months i heard somewhere that in missing persons cases the more time drags on the less chance there is of finding the people who are missing i could barely add finding them alive at least it depends every case is different statistics are a record of the past not a prediction of the future in other words youve got an open mind youre exactly the person i need name any fee you want money isnt an issue money isnt an issue with me either i charge the same fee to everyone payne said but what do you expect i can do that the police and the fbi couldnt at the moment theyre not doing anything possibly because there isnt anything to be learned i refuse to believe that understandably payne spread his hands but you have to realize that i cant duplicate the resources available to the fbi of course not you can listen to new ideas though you can i dont think ive made myself clear i dont want to hire you just to continue the investigation oh payne looked mystified then what do you want i want you to teach me so i can continue the investigation i need a handgun i said what kind the clerk had a beard and a pony tail whatevers the most powerful and shoots the most bullets rounds the clerk said excuse me theyre not called bullets theyre called rounds the bullets the part that blows away from the casing and hits the target fine whatever shoots the most rounds is this for target shooting or home defense the reason i ask is some people believe a shotguns the best way to deal with a burglar how about one of those a revolver it only shoots six these semiautomatics shoot more but youll need to decide which caliber you want ninemillimeter or fortyfive which is the biggest the fortyfive ill take it just so you know your options biggest isnt always best the fortyfive holds seven rounds in the magazine and one in the firing chamber but this ninemillimeter over here holds ten rounds in the magazine and one in the chamber a lot of power with eight rounds versus somewhat less power but eleven rounds how much less power with the ninemillimeter lets put it this way it gets the job done actually the only reason the magazine in this ninemillimeter holds only ten rounds is that in the mids congress passed an antiassault weapon law that limits the capacity of handgun magazines but before the law yes theres a gun show in town saturday ill introduce you to a friend whos willing to sell a prelaw beretta ninemillimeter that holds fifteen rounds in the magazine and one in the chamber thats a lot you bet dont misunderstand theres nothing illegal about him selling the weapon the law only forbids manufacturing or importing magazines that hold more than ten rounds but because my friend bought his before the law was enacted its legal that model doesnt come on the market often so i expect youll have to pay extra naturally but after that the clerk looked uncomfortable after that no offense youre obviously new to this so you dont shoot your foot off you might want to take some lessons in the darkness beyond my window the first snowstorm of the season gusted but i hardly paid attention too busy using internet addresses that payne had given me sites that he said the fbi favored for researching places next to my new laptop computer i had dictionaries and thesauruses to help me find words associated with redemption most werent promising i couldnt imagine anyone calling a place atonement propitiation mediation intercession or judgment for example as it turned out a village in utah was called judgment on the wall to my right id attached a large map of the united states periodically i got up and stuck a labeled thumbtack where a places name had a religious connotation after several hours there were tacks all over the country but no pattern none was in montana i was beginning to understand why gader hadnt wanted to investigate my theory my discouragement increased when i suddenly realized how many places had been named after saints more thumbtacks got added to the map i soon didnt have any more how does a person create a false identity payne considered my question while tapping fish food into the tank his chair creaked when he settled his weight into it the way it used to be done first you pick a city where youve never lived why to prevent your real identity and your assumed one from contaminating each other if you were raised in cleveland you dont want the character youre creating to have come from there too otherwise someone investigating your new identity might go there show your photograph around and find someone who remembers you under your real name i nodded so you go to a different part of the country but avoid small communities where everybody knows everybody else and can tell an investigator immediately whether someone who looks like you ever came from there pick a city theres less continuity memories are shorter lets say you choose los angeles or seattle go to the public library there and read newspapers that came out a few years after you were born youre looking for disastershouse fires car accidents that sort of thingin which entire families were killed that details important because you dont want anyone left alive to be able to contradict your story study the obituaries of the victims youre looking for an ethnically compatible male child who if he had lived would be the same age you are now and then lets say the victim you choose to impersonate was named robert keegan his obituary will probably tell you where he was born you send away for a copy of his birth certificate not a big deal people lose copies of their birth certificates all the time publicrecord offices are used to that kind of request but i frowned if robert keegan died wont there be a note about it on his birth certificate some kind of crossreference not in the days before computers became an essential part of our society payne said the year that you were born information wasnt exchanged efficiently the authorities would send you the copy of robert keegans birth certificate without giving it another thought wait awhile so that a further inquiry about robert keegan wont attract attention then contact the hall of records for a copy of robert keegans death certificate the reason i mentioned los angeles and seattle earlier is that the states of california and washington put social security numbers on their death certificates many parents apply to get a social security number for their children while theyre filling out birth certificate forms in the hospital so the odds are keegan had one even though he died young with his birth certificate and his social security number you can get a drivers license a passport and any other major identification that you need you can get a job pay taxes and open a bank account in short you can assume his identity payne gave me a long look but were not talking about you no were talking about my brother if lester dant were dead could petey have assumed his identity the way you just explained payne kept studying me before your brother was first arrested photographed fingerprinted and booked as lester dant theoretically then im not crazy i let out a long breath petey and dant could be the same person dant could be peteys alias but it didnt happen payne said what your brother didnt assume lester dants identity how can you be so damned sure because earlier this morning i paid a visit to gader we knew each other when i was with the bureau for old times sake i asked to be allowed to review dants file i felt uneasy about what payne was leading up to the file was very revealing payne said you were so insistent that your brother and dant were the same man gader had dants background doublechecked theres no death certificate anywhere moreover dant didnt even apply for a social security number until he was a teenager the signature on the application is consistent with the signatures dant had to give at the various times he was arrested dant and your brother are two different people no its the truth payne said that means my wife and son are dead not necessarily without evidence to the contrary theres always a reason to hope without their corpses you mean payne didnt reply for a moment im sorry mr denning i stared toward the fish tank you didnt see the look in peteys eyes when he told me about the goldfish that he and i had buried in the backyard and how the neighbors cat dug it up he didnt say it as if he were remembering something hed heard his eyes had the clarity of someone whod been there that was petey talking to me perhaps but i havent the faintest idea how you can prove it i will i stood believe me somehow i will before you go ive been meaning to ask you something i stopped at the doorway and looked back at him from my years with the bureau my nose is sensitive to the smell of cordite that smell is on my right hand from when we shook hands when you came in have you been using firearms mr denning ready on the firing line the female instructor barked we straightened ready on the right we checked in that direction ready on the left through safety glasses we checked in that direction making sure that nobody was doing anything careless one the instructor yelled grip your holstered weapon two draw and aim from the waist three raise your weapon to your line of sight four press the trigger eight almostsimultaneous shots filled the long narrow indoor shooting range they echoed off the concrete walls my protective earphones making the reports sound oddly distant although the instructor was directly behind me she too sounded muffled aim to the right of the target to the left we obeyed not firing but checking for other targets which shed warned could pop up at any time weapon to your waist secure it as one the eight of us completed the sequence and took our hands from our holstered firearms the range became silent not bad she said lets see if anybody hit anything each of us stood in a slot with a ledge in front for ammunition and spare magazines a button to the left engaged a motorized pulley that brought in the targets the instructor studied the results okay nobody hit the bullseye but i dont expect you to at this point at least none of you missed the target completely denning you hit closest but youre still a little high and to the left practice more dryfiring at home stop twisting your wrist when you press the trigger she went on to correct the other students we put masking tape over the holes in our targets touched a button that returned the targets to the end of the gallery and straightened when she shouted ready on the firing line i went to a fitness center every day id never been in top physical condition but since petey had taken kate and jason id fallen apart a junkfood diet in combination with too much alcohol and no activity had caused me to put on twenty pounds no longer i hired a trainer knowing that i had to start slowly i was nonetheless impatient to get on with it i progressed from thirty to sixty minutes a day on the machines i started jogging at first at the centers indoor track and then outside in the cold one mile two five i lost the weight id put on fat became muscle i took selfdefense classes angle force mass architects language i no longer pretended to try to work as far as i was concerned i had only one job so i disbanded my company giving my employees a generous severance package when i wasnt preparing myself by shooting and physical training i spent my time searching the internet using other web addresses that payne had given me in my former life id always been too busy to explore the internet now i was amazed at how much information i could obtain provided that thanks to payne i knew where to look i found lester dants birth information which was exactly as the fbi had indicated hed definitely been born in brockton indiana on april a year before petey had been born i searched the databases for every state in the union but couldnt find corresponding death information about lester dant without proof that petey had assumed dants identity i grudgingly tested the fbis theory that dant had assumed peteys identity but no matter how far i spread my search i couldnt find any proof that petey had died and if he had whether hed been murdered thanksgiving the holidays name made me bitter had passed kates parents had asked me to spend it with them id refused hardly in a social mood but then id thought that they were as desolate as i was and we might as well try to console one another the three of us drank some wine and watched football in the kitchen while we made the dinner but i never managed a holiday spirit constantly worrying that the denver police or gader and payne had mislaid the phone number id given them in case kate and jason were found while i was away for christmas kates parents came to visit but as soon as i saw kates father i wished that id saved them the trouble and gone to them i could barely conceal my dismay at how this once tall robust man had been so stooped by his heart condition aggravated by worry as hard as we tried to be festive we kept remembering former better christmases like when id been dating kate in college and id realized i was making progress when shed invited me to spend christmas with her and her parents of the many difficult things about the season choosing the tree had been especially hard for me because kate and jason had always joined mea big family event as soon as wed gotten home with it wed always begun putting on the decorations often not finishing until after dark this time every bulb that id put on the tree racked me with greater loss normally thered have been plenty of presents under the tree but this year kates parents and i had agreed not to exchange gifts after all there was only one thing we wanted and it couldnt be put under a tree as usual kates mother made eggnog it was as delicious as every other year but i could hardly get it down a few days later they went back to durango kates father felt so poorly that her mother had to drive phil barrow invited me next door for a new years eve party i did my best to be sociable but for me the holiday was a wake i went home an hour before the countdown at midnight as hard as i tried i couldnt remember what kate and jason sounded like spring came may june theyd been gone a year im leaving town i told payne yes sometimes its a good idea to get away from bad memories he said i was hoping that you wouldnt mind if i had my mail forwarded to you sure payne said no problem ive asked the police and the fbi to leave messages with you in case they learn something new payne nodded ill phone you the second i hear anything just give me the number where youll be and at the moment thats a little uncertain ill have to phone you you dont know where youre going not exactly but you dont just board a plane without having a reservation to someplace im not going on a plane i thought id simply get in my car and drive see the country go wherever the roads take me paynes eyes narrowed who are you kidding i dont understand go wherever the roads take you give me a break youre up to something what is it i told you i just need to get away you worry me i avoided his gaze and looked at the fish tank dont tell meyoure going out there to try to find him payne said i kept looking at the fish tank how the hell do you figure to do it payne demanded its impossible you dont have a chance at last i looked back at him ive done everything else i can think of without any leads its for damn sure youll be going where the roads take you all youll do is wander but i do have leads i insisted payne leaned his ample body forward tell me its hard to explain give it a try petey wanted to take my place and payne looked baffled now im going to do it in the reverse im going to take peteys place what im going to put myself in his mind im going to think like him im going to become him jesus payne whispered after all were brothers mr denning yes im as sorry for you as its possible to be god help you part three put myself in peteys mind think like him it was desperation yes but what was the alternative at least it would be motion it would keep me from losing my own mind i went to the street where petey had first approached me outside my officeor what had used to be my office the time was shortly after pm as it had been exactly a year earlier petey had shouted my name from behind me which meant that hed been waiting to the left of the buildings revolving door i walked to a large concrete flower planter where i guessed that hed been resting his hips i studied the front door trying to put myself in his place why hadnt he gone into my office as i leaned against the planter feeling invisible to the passing crowd i understood why hed done it the way he had in my office hed have been under my control whereas on the sidewalk yelling my name from behind me he was in charge i recalled our initial conversation this time from his perspective as he told me things that only my brother could have known seeing my amazement winning me over i went to the delicatessen across the street where our conversation had continued i sat where he had sat i imagined myself from his perspective as he continued to persuade me that my longlost brother had finally returned i went home and pretended to be him coming into my house looking around seeing all my possessions the things that hed never been able to have was it at this point that his plan had formed i deserve this not you he would have thought picking up this and that object he would have worked hard to conceal his anger you ruined my life and this is what you got for it you bastard kate would have been easy to look at her long legs her inviting waist but what about jason what would petey really have thought of him a damned nuisance peteys background didnt leave room for paternal instinct but jason was part of what petey wouldve had if i hadnt destroyed his life by sending him home from the baseball game jason went with the package with the attractive wife and the big house so petey wanted him petey wanted everything that i had i recalled the dinner that petey had eaten with us and how polite hed been helping to clean the dishes later hed played catch with jason he must have hated every second of it just as hed hated pretending to enjoy reminiscing about our childhood before i ruined his life but the worst moment of all the most hateful for him would have been when id brought him the baseball glove that hed dropped when the man and woman had grabbed him he must have wanted to shove the damned glove down my throat i went to peteys room i lay on his bed i stared up at the ceiling and discovered that id picked up the baseball glove and was slamming my fist into it again and again he would have wanted a smoke but he wouldnt have ruined his plan by lighting up in the house and annoying kate so hed crept downstairs through the french doors off the kitchen into the moonlit backyard where hed sat angrily on a lounge chair and lit a cigarette i remembered looking from our bedroom window and seeing him down there i imagined him pretending not to notice when my face appeared i put myself in his mind what are you doing up there hed have thought screwing the wife are you bro enjoy it while you can itll soon be my turn the next morning i went to the barbershop where id taken him i sat in the chair feeling the scissors against my head imagining that hed festered from the insult that i thought he looked like shit and i was going to make him presentable then i went to the banana republic where id bought him new clothes then the shoe store then the dentist where id made him feel selfconscious about his chipped tooth reinforcing his sense that i thought he looked like shit when i walked into the dentists office the receptionist glanced up in surprise we werent expecting you today mr denning were just about to close for lunch is this an emergency no confused i realized that id almost tricked myself into believing that i could truly repeat the pattern from a year ago i must have gotten my days mixed up sorry to have bothered you as i reached unsteadily for the doorknob i remembered waiting in the reception area while petey had gone in to have his teeth cleaned and the chip in his tooth smoothed away i tried to project myself into petey to imagine him sitting angrily in the dentists chair since he hadnt been to a dentist in years he would have been nervous tensing a little as the dentist came at him with actually there might be a way you can help my hand trembling i released my grip on the doorknob and went over to the counter that separated the receptionist from the waiting area she looked at me expectantly a year ago i was in here with my brother my heart pounded from the shock of the idea id just had yes i remember im terribly sorry about what happened to your wife and son its been a difficult time i fought to keep my voice steady to hold my emotions in check the thing is i was wondering i held my breath do you know if any x rays were taken of my brothers teeth there i told gader thisll prove it the somber man frowned at what id set on his desk prove what that my brother and lester dant are the same man are you still trying to my brother had dental x rays taken a couple of days before he kidnapped my wife and son when i was a child my parents made sure that petey and i went to a dentist for regular checkups show these x rays to our family dentist back in ohio he can compare them to his records hell prove that the teeth belong to the same person but a nineyearolds teeth wouldnt be the same as those of a man in his thirties gader objected because he wouldnt have had all his permanent teeth by the time he disappeared no my dentist says that my brother would have had a few permanent teeth and even if they changed over the years because of work done on them the roots would have kept the same structure what would it hurt you to look into it gader set down a thick file hed been reading all right he said impatiently to settle this once and for all in ohio what was the name of your family dentist i dont remember he looked more impatient but woodford wasnt a big town i said there werent many dentists it shouldnt be hard to track down the one we went to assuming hes still in business assuming he kept records this long gaders phone rang as he reached for it he told me ill get back to you when next week but that isnt soon enough he didnt hear me he was already speaking into the phone saturday morning i rose from peteys bed put camping gear in the expedition and packed sandwiches in a cooler as much as possible i did everything the same as a year earlier and at nine exactly when wed set out the last time i took interstate into the mountains the peaks were still snowcapped the same as they had been the previous june ignoring their beauty as petey would have i worked to recall our conversation i squirmed as i sensed a pattern almost every time jason had said dad and asked me something petey had answered first hed been practicing to take my place getting used to being called dad when i headed north into the arapaho national forest i imagined him hiding his anticipation i reached the lake and stopped where the three of us had stopped the previous year i looked at where petey jason and i had pitched our tent i hiked around the lake to the stream that fed it climbing the wooded slope to the gorge from which the stream thundered all the while i thought of him looking around for a spot to get rid of me and make it seem like an accident i climbed loose stones to the ridge above the gorge i felt peteys excitement when jason went around the boulder to urinate now brads back was exposed dad no the kid was returning too soon unable to stop i hurtled my goddamned brother into the gorge then spun toward the kid whose face was frozen in terror my mental image of jasons fright shocked me into the present snapping from peteys mindset i was nauseated from the darkness of pretending to be him despite a chill breeze sweat soaked me working down the loose stones to the trail at the bottom of the ridge i couldnt help wondering how petey would have climbed down without falling given that he had a frightened struggling boy to contend with then i realized that there was only one way he could have done it the answer made me sick as i imagined what it had been like to carry an unconscious boy through the trees and back to the expedition since the vehicle didnt have a trunk petey would have had to tie and gag jason putting him on the back floor covering him with the tent as petey i drove carefully home through the mountain passes never exceeding the speed limit lest a state trooper stop me and wonder about the squirming sounds beneath the tent in the back arriving home i drove into the garage and pressed the remote control with a rumble the door came down as i got out of the car i envisioned kate coming into the garage from the kitchen shed have just gotten back from the allday seminar shed been conducting the trim gray business suit shed been wearing when wed left that morning made her long blond hair more bright how come youre back so soon she frowned where are brad and jason we had an accident an accident hed overpowered her bound and gagged her gone into the house found her car keys then put her and jason in the volvos trunk the car had a backseat that could be flipped down so the trunk could hold long objects such as skis hed probably opened the seat partway to allow air to circulate into the trunk using the numerous objects hed looted from the house to keep the seat from opening completely and allowing kate and jason a way to escape hed hurriedly packed suitcases making sure to take some of my clothes after all as long as he was replacing me he might as well look like me around pm just as petey had i got in the volvo which the police had returned to me and drove from the house at exactly when petey had keeping my head low from the camera as petey had i got money from the same atm that hed used but as i headed north from denver following interstate i realized that with all the objects petey had stolen from me the volvo would have looked as if he were running an appliance store out of the car worried that a policeman might get suspicious petey would never have left denver with all that stuff he would have sold it as quickly as possible but he was new in town when would he have had time to find a fence rethinking the previous days i suddenly remembered that after the dentist petey had wanted some time alone in a park to get my mind straight the son of a bitch had used the afternoon to arrange to sell what hed planned to steal from me i drove to a rough section of town and imitated the transaction filling the few minutes that it would have taken then i returned to the interstate and this time i felt invisible one of countless vehicles on the road nothing to make me conspicuous a road sign informed me that casper wyoming was miles ahead i set the volvos cruise control to make sure i stayed under the speed limit when sunset approached and i put on my headlights i felt even more inconspicuous blending with thousands of other lights i passed cheyenne wyoming able to distinguish little except that its buildings seemed low and sprawling then four hours after having left denver i approached the glow of casper for most of the drive id sensed only flat land in the uninhabited darkness around me now the shadow of a mountain hulked on my left blocking stars a few miles north of town i saw a sign for the rest area traffic was sparse most of the vehicles having driven into casper an arrow pointed toward a barely visible exit ramp following it off the interstate i approached two squat brick buildings whose floodlights silhouetted three pickup trucks and a minivan but petey would have needed more seclusion so i took a gravel road that veered to the right from the pavement that led to the rest area the floodlights at the buildings reached far enough to show picnic tables and stunted trees in back satisfying myself that no one had emerged from the rest rooms and seen what might have seemed unusual behavior i reduced my headlights to parking lights and got just enough illumination to see a redwoodfenced area behind which the tip of a dumpster showed i parked behind the dumpster shut off my parking lights and walked in front of the fence verifying that no one a state trooper for example had seen what id done and was coming to investigate confident that i was hidden i unlocked the trunk what i imagined pushed me back kate and jason on their sides squirming terrified duct tape pressed tightly across their mouths hands tied behind their backs ankles bound eyes so wide with fright that their whites were huge moans that were half apprehension half pleas the stench of bodily excretions of carbon dioxide of sweat and fear petey would have taken off their gags and allowed them to catch their breath while hed warned them not to scream theyd have been too fearweakened and groggy from the foul air in the trunk to manage much of an outburst hed have needed to lift them one at a time from the trunk loosening their clothes so they could relieve themselves that unpleasant intimacy would have tested his commitment to his new family but his obligations were just beginning for example theyd have been terribly thirsty had he planned ahead and stopped at a fastfood place in casper to get soft drinks possibly french fries and hamburgers also as he regagged them and put them back in the trunk would he have said any reassuring words i love you i shut the trunk from the darkness behind the dumpster i stared toward the vehicles in front of the rest rooms i walked in that direction my footsteps crunching on pebbles the floodlights at the two buildings made me feel naked the closer i came by then most of the vehicles had departed leaving only a midsize sedan i went into the mens room and found it empty i stepped outside insects swarmed in the overhead light a woman left the other building pulled keys from her purse and approached the sedan she didnt look in my direction i imagined petey starting to rush her then pausing as headlights flashed past on the interstate not a lot but enough that there was never a gap never a moment when somebody driving by wouldnt have seen a man attack a woman so petey had waited for another opportunity gone into the womens room and subdued his victim there hed watched the interstate until there were just enough gaps between headlights that no one would see him in the few seconds that it took him to carry the unconscious woman around to the darkness behind the dumpster hed tied and gagged her then hed returned to the rest area used the womans key to start her car a caprice the police had told me hed kept the headlights off and driven back to the darkness behind the fence where he would have had to use a knife to make ventilation holes through the backseats into the caprices trunk before he transferred kate and jason into it but when hed put the driver in the trunk with them hadnt it worried him that there might not have been enough air for three people why had he risked suffocating kate and jason by putting the woman in the trunk with them as it was the woman had died why hadnt he killed her and hidden her body in the dumpster no one would have found her for quite a while if ever again i felt kate and jasons horror as the asthmatic woman fought to breathe with the duct tape pressed over her mouth her frenzied movements her gagging sounds her gradual stillness the release of her bladder probably her bowels as the caprice sped along the interstate kate and jason would have been seized by the outofcontrol fear that if it had happened to the woman it could happen to them the question kept nagging at me why hadnt petey just killed her and hidden her body in the dumpster the only answer that made sense to me was that no matter how indifferent petey had felt toward the woman he hadnt intended for her to die killing me was one thing as far as petey was concerned i deserved to die for ruining his life but this woman had merely happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time it was the first indication of humanity that id detected in him it gave me hope for kate and jason he could have left the volvo behind the dumpster where it might not have been discovered for days instead hed gone to the trouble of moving the volvo to the front of the rest rooms where it would be in plain sight because he wanted it to be found soon he wanted it to point the way north just as abandoning the caprice outside billings montana made it seem that he was heading toward butte hed been thinking with frightening control i drove back to the interstate a road sign indicated that billings montana was miles away my eyelids felt heavy but i had to keep moving i had to complete peteys escape had he slept along the way doing that certainly tempted me but i was afraid that if i steered off the interstate and found a secluded spota camping area for examplewhere i could get a few hours sleep i wouldnt waken until daylight in peteys case the caprice might have been reported by then he had to get to billings imitating him i kept driving i played the radio loud in the middle of the night it was hard to find a station the ones i did find broadcast mostly evangelists riddled with static a mountain range stretched from north to south on my left moonlight glowed off the snowy peaks my eyelids weakened to stay awake i bit my lips i dug my fingernails into my palms interstate became i passed sheridan wyoming and entered montana the signs changed character lodge grass custer battlefield national monument crow agency at hardin the interstate veered west meanwhile as the miles accumulated i imagined that petey would have worried that his captives werent getting enough air hed have stopped periodically on deserted roads to check on them it pained me to think of kates and jasons frightened eyes peering desperately up at him they flinched when he reached in to touch their brows to calm them as for the caprices driver he barely looked at her when i finally read a sign for billings i was troubled that the distance between casper and billings should have taken me only four hours but with frequent stops pretending to check on my captives id taken ninety minutes longer than i should have even so it was still dark when i came to the rest stop on the other side of billings a sign called it a scenic vista but with the moon having set i had only a vague sense of mountains to the north and south two vehicles were parked at the rest rooms a pickup truck and a sedan here too a service road led behind the buildings i parked in the darkness adrenaline overcame my exhaustion as i got out of the car the air was surprisingly cold two men in cowboy hats came out of one of the concreteblock buildings i waited while they got in the pickup truck and drove away at this predawn hour there was almost no traffic on the interstate i walked quickly toward the rest rooms and listened for activity in either one if i heard voices if there was more than one person id wait for a better opportunity but if there was only one set of footsteps at that hour few women felt safe to drive alone i assumed that the victim would have been male use a tire iron to knock him unconscious in the mens room drag him into the darkness take his car to the back put kate jason and the driver into its trunk would it have been at this point that petey had discovered that the owner of the caprice had choked to death from the duct tape over her mouth he wouldnt have been overwhelmed with sorrow hed given her a chance as far as he was concerned it wasnt his fault the penalty for kidnapping was the same as for murder so with nothing to lose instead of trying to hide her body hed left it with the caprice then hed gotten into its replacement and driven onto the interstate but instead of continuing toward butte where he wanted the police to think he was going hed taken the next exit ramp crossed the overpass and reaccessed the interstate reversing direction heading back toward billings i kept after him by then it was dawn i saw mountains ranches and oil refineries crossing the yellowstone river i no longer had the police report to guide me petey had been as tired as i was where the hell had he gone next the interstate forked i had to choosetake northeast through montana way up into north dakota or else retrace south into wyoming i chose the latter i didnt fool myself that intuitively i was doing what petey had my decision was totally arbitrary but as tired as i was if i didnt soon find a place to sleep i knew id have an accident petey must have felt the same even charged with adrenaline he couldnt have kept going much longer for certain he wouldnt have dared risk an accident he didnt have a drivers license and the car wasnt registered to him a state trooper questioning him would eventually have gotten suspicious enough to look in the trunk meanwhile as the sun got higher warming the cars interior i imagined how hot the trunk would have gotten no matter how many ventilation holes petey had made kate jason and the cars owner would have roasted in that confined space the suns heat turning the trunk into an oven the air getting thicker smothering if petey was going to keep them alive in the trunk he had to rest by day and drive by night because the denver detectives had said that duct tape had covered the dead womans mouth i presumed that petey had done the same to kate jason and the man whose car hed stolen i took my right hand off the steering wheel and pressed it over my mouth forcing myself to breathe only through my nose spring allergies had caused mucus to partially block my nostrils my chest heaved i couldnt seem to get enough air i had to concentrate to control my heartbeat to inhale and exhale slowly i couldnt bear the thought of breathing selfconsciously of taking in a minimum of air for what felt like forever in a hot closed space definitely no one in the trunk would have had a chance of surviving unless petey drove only when it was coolerat night but where could he have stopped a motel would have been dangerously public but what about a camping area tourist season was only beginning petey might have been able to find a wooded area that didnt have visitors listening for the approach of vehicles he could have risked letting his prisoners out of the trunk if there was a stream where they could clean themselves so much the better hed have needed to get food again at the next exit i saw a mcdonalds went to the drivethrough lane and ordered an egg mcmuffin coffee and orange juice while i waited behind other cars i frowned at my beardstubbled image in the rearview mirror but the beard stubble wasnt what bothered me id been trying to imitate peteys thoughts and id forgotten one of the most important things about him the scar on his chin it would have attracted attention i pulled a pen from my shirt pocket and drew a line where peteys scar would have been i wanted to know what it felt like to have people staring at my chin when i paid for my food the woman behind the counter pointed toward the ink mark mister youve got yeah i know i said i cant seem to get the darned thing off id intended to ask her if there were nearby camping areas but feeling conspicuous i paid for my food and drove away squinting from the glare of the morning sun i decided to let my beard keep growing and hide the streak on my chin a likely place for a campground would be along a river so when i crossed the bighorn i took the first exit there i debated whether to follow the river north or south a sign indicated that south would take me to the crow indian reservation that didnt sound like a place where id be invisible so i headed north traffic was sparse the land was fenced in a while i came to a dirt road that took me to the left toward the river it soon curved to the right to parallel the river although bushes and trees along the bank prevented me from seeing the water a weedovergrown lane went into the trees i drove down it parked behind the trees walked to the road and satisfied myself that the car was hidden i had no illusions that this was the spot where petey had stopped but logic suggested that it was similar petey would have ignored the cars owner while he tried to reassure kate and jason saying that he wouldnt hurt them unless they forced him to that if they did what they were told there wouldnt be trouble he would have kept one of them in the trunk while he let the other bathe making sure that a rope was tied to one and then the others waist to prevent them from trying to run he would have allowed them to change clothes he would have studied them while they ate their fastfood breakfast ill take care of you they wouldnt have known what to make of that as frightened as kate was shed have had all night to analyze the danger they were in shed have already decided that their only chance was for her to use her stressmanagement skills to try to keep him calm thanks for the food you like it despite their fear kate and jason would have been so hungry that theyd have gulped their hamburgers i said do you like it yes kate would have answered quickly it isnt much but its better than nothing was there a threat in the way he said it that if they gave him trouble he could make sure that was exactly what they got nothing kate would have taken another deep swallow from her soft drink knowing that it wouldnt be enough to replenish her fluids shed have brushed her tangled hair from her face aware that she had to try to look as presentable as possible make petey think of you as a human being not an object thank him for courtesies he showed behave as if the situation were normal make him want to go through efforts for you so he can get the gratification of being appreciated but what about jason as young as he was lacking kates training hed have been nearly out of his mind with terror gagged kate wouldnt have been able to talk to him in the trunk she couldnt have coached him she had to depend on giving him significant looks and hoping that hed understand her motives that hed follow her lead what are you going to do with us shed have asked when the time seemed right i told you im going to take care of you but why did were a family family dont react make even the outrageous seem normal brad had an accident what he fell off a cliff im taking his place kates stomach would have plummeted as if she had fallen from a cliff im your husband jason youre my son fighting to keep tears from swelling into her eyes kate would have echoed peteys earlier words reinforcing their import take care of us petey probably wouldnt have been familiar with the term the stockholm principle but he was a skillfulenough manipulator that he would have understood it after a period of time captives grow weary of their rollercoaster emotions grateful to be shown small kindnesses they tend to accept their situation and to bond with their captors that would have been peteys hope but of course he wasnt accustomed to providing for a wife and son the breakfast would have quickly disappeared and then thered have been the problem of what to do about lunch and supper petey wouldnt have thought that far ahead but even if he had how was he going to keep hamburgers and fries from spoiling and what about a way to reheat them he needed to buy a cooler a camping stove pots and pans and what had started as an urge to take my place suddenly didnt have the gratification it had promised everything was getting too complicated why not admit that hed made a mistake and chuck the whole business why not do what he wanted with kate and jason kill them and the driver in the trunk hide their bodies drive into the nearest big town abandon the car buy a bus ticket and adios the thought made me shudder no thats how lester dant would have acted i tried to assure myself lester dant would have killed jason right away then driven kate to a secret spot and dumped her body down a ravine when he got tired of abusing her he certainly wouldnt have taken the time and the risk to lay a false trail all the way to montana that only made sense if petey had abducted them if he was determined to take over my life and make kate and jason his family but his patience would have been sorely tested the only way he could have felt at ease enough to go to sleep was by putting kate and jason back into the trunk so they wouldnt try to escape while he was dozing the shade of the trees would have prevented the trunk from becoming lethally hot still petey would have had no idea how long he might sleep hed have loved eight hours even with numerous ventilation holes kate jason and the man whose car hed stolen probably wouldnt have been able to survive that long in the trunk without the lid being opened periodically to vent carbon dioxide two people though would have a chance thered have been onethird more air for them if thats when i knew that petey had deliberately killed the second driver whereas the first death had been an accident sleep i could barely keep awake but as i opened a back door staring at my suitcase knapsack laptop computer and printer i realized that i was going to have to put them in the front seat so i could stretch out in the back it would have annoyed petey to move his four suitcases another complication another nuisance in addition i was going to have to disable the cars interior light so i could leave a back door open and stretch my legs while i sleptto prevent the cars battery from dying one more damned thing to do no this wouldnt have been at all like what petey had wanted the sound of a passing vehicle startled me awake i sat up sharply before i checked my watch the angle of the sun told me that the time was late afternoon out of sight from the trees the vehicle kept bumping along the dirt road my mouth felt pasty as i got out of the backseat and peered through the trees seeing that the vehicle was a pickup truck a rancher in a hurry to get somewhere my back was sore thus peteys nervous schedule would have resumed checking on his captives lifting them out so they could relieve themselves and wash their faces in the river at some point he would have had to take care of himself his clothes would have felt grimy probably he changed them for some of the clothes that hed stolen from me perhaps hed felt angry as the rumblings in his stomach told him that he had to start thinking about getting more food for everybody he couldnt go on like this either he had to find a place in which to settle or he would have to kill kate and jason for creating his problems no the only way i could shove that mindthreatening thought away was by imagining how kate and jason might have reacted to peteys growing impatience kates training would have told her that she had to accommodate petey as best she could to make things less complicated for him to ease the strain he felt i can try to wash these dirty clothes in the river tie me to a tree and watch me on the bank that way youll be sure i cant run away what about these suitcases you moved to the front why dont i return them to where they were theres a lot of housekeeping i can take care of jason might have caught on by then he might have understood what kate was doing and tried his best to appear the obedient son reinforce peteys fantasies make him believe that his risk and effort were worthwhile that was the only way they were going to stay alive in a way it was the captives trying to make the captor fall into the stockholm syndrome petey would have been too close to where hed abandoned the caprice the new vehicle he was driving would soon have been reported missing maybe it had license plates from several states away suggesting that the driver had a distance to go before arriving home and wouldnt be reported missing until at least the end of the day all the same petey wouldnt have been able to depend on that he needed to get on the move but he didnt dare show the car until darkness made him invisible that meant waiting to get food for kate and jason but it also meant that kate and jason had more time to talk with him a chance to try to bond with him to personalize themselves so that killing them wouldnt be easy petey brought out the rope and the duct tape i need to ask you to do something kate said petey tied her hands behind her back please listen kate said i understand why you need to put the duct tape over our mouths youre afraid well yell and make somebody call the police petey tied her feet please kate said its almost impossible to breathe when the trunk gets hot when you press the duct tape across our mouths im begging you to petey tore off a section of tape please it wont threaten you if you cut a small hole where our lips are we still wont be able to yell but well be able to breathe better petey stared at her you promised youd take care of us kate said what good are we to you if were dead peteys harsh eyes were filled with suspicion he pressed the tape over her mouth and set her in the trunk he did the same to jason kate looked beseechingly up at petey who reached to close the trunk paused then pulled out a knife and slit the duct tape over their lips i hoped but when darkness finally came and i returned to the interstate i couldnt repress my unease that i was totally wrong about my reenactment of what had happened in wyoming i came to another fork in the interstate my palms broke out in a sweat as i tried to decide what to do next i could retrace my route on eventually returning to denver or i could veer east on the continuation of heading into the black hills of south dakota i couldnt imagine petey returning to denver but the black hills would surely have appealed to him plenty of places in which to hide footsteps paused outside the entrance to the mens room this was at a rest area in south dakota shortly after three in the morning in the harsh overhead light i stood at a urinal at that quiet hour sounds were magnified that was probably the only reason i noticed the footsteps approaching waiting for them to resume i looked over my shoulder past the toilet stalls toward the door on my right the place had the chill of concrete after the heat of the day had faded i waited for the door to swing open the silence beyond it grew still peering over my shoulder i zipped up my pants i went over to the sink and washed my hands fixing my gaze on the mirror before me which gave a direct view of the door there werent any paper towels only one of those power dryers that force warm air over wet hands they sound like a jet engine needing to hear everything i didnt press its button as my fingers tingled from the water on them i stared toward the door the silence beyond it persisted its only a tired driver who pulled into the rest area i thought he didnt need to relieve himself just to stretch his legs hes standing out there enjoying the stars and if im wrong i told myself i was overreacting after all i didnt have any firm reason to believe that someone was out there waiting to surprise me when i opened the door but id been in the foulness of peteys mind for so long imitating his movements recreating his logic stalking rest areas that i couldnt subdue the suspicion my imagination was so primed that i could feel the danger out there as if it were seeping through the wall when id parked outside mine had been the only vehicle an attraction to a predator he was listening for voices for more than one set of footsteps wanting to make sure i was alone hearing only me hed soon push the door open i thought of the pistol in the suitcase in my car and cursed myself for being a fool what good was learning how to use it if i put it where i couldnt get it if i needed the damned thing my legs were feathery i trembled no i thought what if id tracked down petey what if he was outside that door i pushed the button on the hand dryer its harsh roar obscured my footsteps as i shifted toward the back of the door braced against the wall i felt a spurt of fear in my stomach as the door swung open a man in his midtwenties wearing cowboy boots jeans and a cowboy hat came quickly in holding a tire iron the door swung shut behind him as he stopped at the sight of the empty rest room puzzled he stared at the roaring hand dryer he peered toward the toilet stalls abruptly he saw my reflection in the mirror over the sink he tried to turn i was already rushing slamming his back with such force that he hurtled forward his mustached face hitting the mirror smashing it into shards blood streaked the mirror as i grabbed him by the back of his collar and his thick belt ramming him toward the hand dryer driving his head against it so powerfully that the nozzle on the fan broke off the dryer kept roaring as i backed him up and drove his head against it even harder blood sprayed from the force of the unshielded fan the tire iron fell from his hand clanging on the concrete floor i slammed his head once more and dropped him he lay like a pile of old clothes eyes shut he moaned except for the rise and fall of his chest he barely moved my stomach was on fire the anger that had brought me close to killing him frightened me but the emotion that primarily seized me making me want to shout was that id won federal bureau of investigation the receptionist said special agent gader please i gripped my cell phone so tightly that my fingers ached it was nine in the morning sunlight glinted off a secluded lake surrounded by lumpy bluffs studded with pine trees the ridges were dark gray stone making it clear how the black hills had gotten their name id reached this area before dawn but when id noticed that the map indicated only barren open land beyond them id decided that petey would have stopped earlier than hed planned going to ground for the day the beauty of the lake looked odd to me after what had happened at the rest area i felt as if id stepped into an alternate reality agent gader is out of town on an assignment i picked up a rock frustration made me hurl it at the lake may i ask whos calling the woman asked brad denning i agent gader mentioned that youd be contacting him he said that hed spoken to mr payne about the matter you were interested in and if youd talk to i broke the connection i guess you havent been back to woodford in a while payne said pressing the cell phone to my ear i walked close to the lake its cool air drifted over me my beard stubble scraped against my hand i worked to calm myself not since my mother and i moved away when i was a kid how big was it then not very about ten thousand people a onefactory town payne said thats right my dad was a foreman i suddenly missed him so much how did you know because gader says the factory shut down and went to mexico ten years ago now woodfords a bedroom community for columbus and its population has doubled to twenty thousand there are several dentists but none of them ever heard of the denning family the air at the lake became colder but surely they know the dentists who worked there before them nope gader says you dont remember the name of the dentist you went to or his address my head throbbed it was too long ago then its a dead end gader says hes sorry yeah i bet he says if youre relying on dental records to prove that lester dant is really your brother using an alias youre setting yourself up for a big disappointment anyway hows that going to help find your family i dont know but i can think of words that are a whole lot stronger than disappointment the cell phones reception became staticky where are you calling from payne asked south dakota nice there i didnt come for the scenery i said well as long as youre determined to be on the road do you want some advice provided its not take it easy and get some rest no something else this might surprise you payne said itll sound like encouragement then go ahead and surprise me until i put on all this weight and i got to relying on the internet payne said i was a handson kind of investigator thats why i noticed things others didnt when theres time nothing beats going to the places and people you want to know about when theres time which you seem to have plenty of youre suggesting that if im determined to find that dentist i should do it myself more or less youre rightit does sound like encouragement why the change because im worried about you the reception became staticky again i listened hard im afraid if you dont satisfy yourself one hundred percent that youve done everything you can if you lose hope i strained to hear but the static became worse youll destroy yourself ill get back to you later in the week i said what i cant hear you i broke the connection as i imagined spending days in secluded places asleep in the back of the car using my nights to drive as far as i could i knew that petey wouldnt have tolerated that routine much longer the one thing that would have kept him motivated was his discovery from the widespread news reports on the car radio a couple of days later the media really loved the storythat i hadnt died in the mountains he wouldnt have told kate and jason that i was alive of course but his secret would have given him resolve imagining how my fear and longing for my family made me suffer no crowing midnight phone calls to me no gleeful postcards nothing with an inadvertent clue that might have led the police to him only taunting gloating silence but damn it where would he have taken them i thought about the south dakota badlands ahead in the old days rustlers used to hide in the maze of sunscorched canyons the environment so hellish that posses wouldnt go in after them it was too desperate a choice even for petey after the badlands there were hundreds of miles of flat grassland hardly a tree anywhere everything exposed but petey wouldnt have tolerated being in the open hide in plain sight i doubted it he wouldnt have felt protected without the shelter of hills and woods so had he found a place in the black hills a deserted cabin maybe or a id come as far as intuition could take me a dead end just as gader had said that the idea about the dentist was a dead end the dentist nothing beats going to the places and people you want to know about payne had said yes after sleeping in the back of the car until sundown i set out toward where i now realized my route had already been taking me toward where everything had started so long ago toward peteys lost youth part four brockton next exit the sign caught me by surprise it was two nights later id gone through iowa and illinois and was now on interstate continuing relentlessly east through indiana my destination was ohio just beyond columbus woodford my hometown but as i saw the sign for brockton lester dants birthplace i frowned although id long ago made myself familiar with brocktons position on the map this was the first time id realized that it like woodford was close enough to to merit an exit sign fixated on the dental records that i hoped to find in woodford i hadnt focused on brockton but at that moment my attention rapidly shifted i made the turn a twolane road wound through shadowy farm country after twenty miles street lights revealed rundown houses and a bleak main street twostory buildings flanked it some with for sale notices on windows a sputtering neon sign announced brockton motel vacancy it too looked rundown but with no other choice i stopped a bell rang when i opened the office door harsh overhead lights hummed a puffyeyed woman in a robe shuffled from a room behind the office how many nights i said two determined to stick around and learn as much as i could the elderly woman seemed puzzled that anyone would have a reason for staying in brockton more than one night cash only she named an amount a narrowness in her eyes suggesting that she thought the rate was a fortune which it wasnt when i gave her the money she looked relieved handed me a key yawned and shuffled back to her room softdrink machines outside next to the candy machine she murmured over her shoulder sorry for waking you plenty of time to sleep when im dead outside in the humid night a single bulb illuminated the parking area there werent any vehicles at any of the ten motel units the key id been given was for number one imagining that i was petey i noted that all the units were behind the managers room in the shadows i couldnt be seen if i took a bound and gagged woman and child from my trunk the room was small the sheets thin the mirror dusty i stared at my thickening beard stubble my eyes looked haunted i was a stranger to myself do you know this man the manager looked as tired as when id wakened her the previous night her wrinkled mouth left a trace of lipstick on her coffee cup behind the counter she tilted the police photo this way and that not exactly flattering howd he get the scar on his chin car accident cant say i recognize him you another fbi agent another last year somebody from the fbi asked me about this guy my optimism sank if gader had arranged for dants background to be doublechecked i was wasting my time he must have done something really bad for you to keep looking for him she said yes something really bad does the name peter denning sound familiar nope how about lester dant dant the woman thought a moment thats the name the other fbi agent asked about there used to be a couple of families named dant around here i felt more discouraged the hardware stores named after one of them she said but the man who owns it now is ben porter wasting my time i repeated to myself tempted to drive on to woodford i decided not to take anything for granted wheres the hardware store i dont know him ben porter was in his fifties as was just about everybody id passed in the sparsely populated town his coveralls were flecked with sawdust from boards hed been cutting but that doesnt mean much why not i never met the stores original owner i kept the name dant on the building to maintain tradition in a dying town the word tradition sounded brave you dont know any dants like i told the other fbi agent theyre before my time i moved here only ten years ago the expression on his face made it seem that he wished he hadnt can you think of anybody who might know about them sure the reverend who reverend benedict the way i hear it hes been in brockton just about forever the white steepled church and the cottage behind it were the only two buildings in town that didnt look in need of repair on the right between the church and a graveyard a path went through a rose garden ahead an elderly man in a shortsleeved blue shirt with a ministers collar had his back to me he was on his knees his head bowed in prayer then his arms moved and his head bobbed and i realized he was pruning the roses he had a hearing aid tucked behind his right ear it must have been an excellent model because he heard me walking across the grass and turned to see who i was reverend benedict his wrinkled brow developed more furrows as he came creakily to his feet his old pants had grass stains on the knees my names brad denning ben porter at the hardware store a fine man suggested i talk to you about a couple of families who used to live around here families the dants the reverends eyes had sparkled as if hed welcomed the opportunity to test his memory now they became guarded do you remember the dants i asked are you with the fbi no someone from the fbi asked me about the dants last year the reverend said i know that but im not with the bureau did the agent show you this photograph yes thats lester i told the agent the same thing youre sure of that its lester dant he was younger he didnt have that scar on his chin but theres no doubt its lester i felt sick the theory id worked so hard to believe toppled lester dant not my brother had taken kate and jason he wouldnt have had a reason to keep them alive why do you want to know about him it doesnt matter anymore reverend i managed to say hollow i turned to leave just a routine investigation the fbi agent told me i looked back at him hardly routine whats wrong mr denning you seem in terrible distress i hadnt intended to explain but something about him invited it in despair i started to tell him i tried to keep my voice steady but the more i revealed the more it shook the reverend stared he seemed to hope that i was finished but then i told him moreand moreand his shocked look turned to pity for someone who because of a boyhood mistake had been condemned to the torment of hell lester did all that or my brother pretending to be him thats what i needed to find out god help him god help you if only god would all prayers are eventually answered not soon enough reverend he seemed on the verge of telling me to have faith instead he sighed and motioned me toward a bench there are several things you need to understand about him understand i hope that doesnt mean make excuses or sympathize because what i really want to do reverend is punish him and please dont tell me to turn the other cheek or let god take care of vengeance you just said it for me we studied each other youre positive that the man in this photograph is lester dant i asked yes i felt sicker even so i had to know the truth all right then reverend despondent i sat on the bench help me understand him and his parents the reverend said you also have to understand his parents he thought for a moment the dants his frail voice strengthened there were six families of them originally they lived around here for as long as anybody can remember thats what my predecessor told me at any rate when i was assigned here but they werent really part of the community you couldnt even say that they were part of the united states youve lost me reverend they were separatists tribalists loners somewhere in their historymy predecessor had a theory that it went as far back as the civil warsomething terrible had happened to them they came from a place that they desperately wanted to forget and they settled around here determined to be left to themselves a bee buzzed my face i motioned it away fixing my attention on the reverend of course to keep their families going they couldnt be entirely insular they had to interact with nearby communities looking for young people to marry on the surface they had a lot to recommend them they knew their bible they owned property they didnt drink smoke gamble or swear for a while they attracted new members usually from families so poor that marrying a dant was a step up but word got around how severe they were and the dants had to look farther mostly among other strict groups trying to negotiate marriages their options became more limited by the time my predecessor arrived the families had dwindled to three i shook my head puzzled if they were determined to stay to themselves how come somebody named dant owned the hardware store a lifeline no matter how hard they tried they couldnt be selfsufficient even in a good year with bountiful crops there were necessities that they couldnt produce for themselves to them brockton was like a foreign country the hardware store was their embassy they exported their excess produce through it and imported lumber tools clothing medicines no reverend benedict said never medicines the dants were as fundamental religiously as they were politically to them sickness was a sign of gods disfavor they felt it was a sin to use human means to interfere with gods intention because of our fallen nature for which the dants believed god punished us the reverend said with a selfdestructive attitude like that its a wonder the families survived thats the pointtheyre all gone now reverend benedict pointed a wizened finger toward the photograph except for lester when did you meet him after the fire the fire ill get to that first you need to know that because the dants avoided doctors the town had no idea of the birth and death rate out there every so often emissaries would come to town and get supplies mostly men but sometimes women and children i suspect that their motive was to show everybody in the family how corrupt the outside world was it could be that we looked as strange to them as they did to us strange the effects of inbreeding were starting to show the law let them get away with it once in a while a state trooper went out to check on things but what was he going to charge them with except wanting to be by themselves child endangerment difficult to prove if the children are well nourished and can quote their bible isnt there a law that children have to go to school the dants hired an attorney who argued that the children were getting an adequate education at home it came down to religious freedom these days i suppose wed call them survivalists but they werent hoarding weapons and they werent plotting to overthrow the government so the authorities decided that dragging the dants into court was worse than leaving them alone live and let live became the motto until the weekend when lesters mother was one of the emissaries who came to town i listened harder her name was eunice she was visibly pregnant but evidently her husband believed that she wasnt far enough along not to travel she came out of the hardware store the next thing she collapsed on the sidewalk writhing in pain her husband orval tried to make light of it tried to pick her up and put her in the car but when he saw the blood on her dress and the pool of it around her he froze in confusion just long enough for a doctor and a policemanwe had several of both back thento notice what was happening and rush her to the clinic that served as our hospital orval tried to stop them but suddenly it was obvious that eunice wasnt having a miscarriage she was about to give birth to a premature baby the creep was willing to risk her life he didnt do it easily orval told the doctor and the policeman that the baby meant more to him than anything else in the world that he and eunice had already lost three children to stillbirths that theyd tried persistently to have another child and finally god had blessed them with this pregnancy but to rely on a doctor was the same as telling god that they didnt have faith orval said if they interfered with gods plan the baby would be damned orval felt so strongly about this that he actually tried to pick up eunice and carry her from the clinic but the doctor warned him that the wife and the baby would die if they didnt stay and receive medical attention the policeman was more blunt he threatened to arrest orval for attempted murder if orval tried to remove his wife by then the baby was on its way and even orval realized he was going to have to allow medical help whether he wanted it or not eunice nearly died from loss of blood the baby nearly died from being so small the baby was lester yes orval and eunice didnt believe in giving their children names that had religious connotations they compared it to idolatry no matthew mark luke or john for them once you take away the bible as a source for a name there arent many choices the name lester was neutral a default and then my predecessor retired i came here to take his place before he left he explained about the community and told me what ive just told you he said that despite the doctors expectations the baby lived in fact a week before i arrived orval had brought the child to town to show how healthy the boy was to prove to the doctor that gods will was the only thing that mattered but i felt more puzzled whats this got to do with you said you met lester after a fire years later i leaned forward the smoke woke just about everybody in town i remember it was a labor day weekend a heat wave had just broken so most people had their air conditioners off and the windows open taking advantage of a breeze my wife and i stepped outside coughing wondering whose house was on fire then i realized that the fire wasnt in brockton even with the smoke in the streets i could see a glow on the horizon to the south in the direction of where orval and eunice had their farm i knew that it couldnt be any other dants place because by then orval eunice and lester were the only dants left somebody rang the alarm at the fire station the signal for volunteers but when i got there people had realized that the fire wasnt in town there was a lot of confusion about whether we should go out to help them or whether we should let orval and eunice pay for insisting that they didnt need us in the end the town made me proud the fire brigade had a truck filled with water they drove it out there and a whole lot of people went in cars but even before we got close it was obvious from the extent of the glow on the horizon that even a dozen trucks filled with water wouldnt make a difference it hadnt rained in a month the wind got stronger on the left flames streaked across pastures sections of timber were ablaze far off a house and a barn were on fire we did what we could to stop the flames from spreading across the road other than that we were helpless by then it was dawn and somebody shouted toward a burning field i looked that way and saw a young man stumble ahead of the flames he swatted at his smoking clothes reached a fence and toppled over it i got to him first he was sobbing id never seen eyes so big with fear but it was obvious that they werent registering anything he was blind from hysteria i tried to stop him but he lurched to his feet and staggered along the road it took three of us to get him to the ground and smother the smoke coming off him that was lester the reverend nodded he wasnt able to tell us what happened until three days later after we got him to the ground something seemed to shut off in him he became catatonic we took him to the clinic he didnt have any serious burns or other obvious injuries so the doctor treated him for shock when it was safe to move him my wife and i brought him here reverend benedict indicated the cottage behind the church his eyes saddened when lester was alert enough he told us about the fire how the smoke and the dogs barking had wakened him hed shouted to warn his parents hed tried to run down the hall to their room but the flames were outside his door and he had to climb out his window in the yard he kept shouting to warn his parents past the flames in their bedroom he heard them screaming but when he tried to get in through the window and pull them out the heat was like a wall that wouldnt let him through the breeze had spread the fire beyond the house the barn and the outbuildings the fields and the woodseverything was on fire the only way he escaped was by throwing himself into a cattle trough soaking himself and running across a pasture while the fire chased him in the week that he stayed with us sometimes he woke screaming from nightmares of hearing his parents screams imagining their agony i shook my head from side to side did anybody ever learn what caused the fire lester said that a light switch had stopped working in the kitchen his father had planned to fix it the next day i know about buildings it sounds like an electrical short i said fire can spread along faulty wires and accumulate behind the walls when it breaks through the flames are everywhere at once according to lester it was terrifyingly fast and then what happened you said that he stayed with you for a week we wanted him to stay longer but one morning my wife looked in on him and he was gone gone wed bought some clothes for him they were missing a pillowcase was missing also he must have used it as a duffel bag bread cookies and cold cuts were taken from the kitchen he left in the middle of the night why i think it had something to do with my being a minister and the cottage being next to a church i dont understand lester was raised in a religious family the church shouldnt have bothered him their beliefs were drastically different from mine i still dont the dants believed that god turns his back on us because of our sinful nature what i preach is that god loves us because were his children ive always suspected that the night before lester ran away he overheard me practicing my sunday sermon he probably thought he was hearing the words of the devil and you never saw him again not until last year when the fbi agent showed me that photograph in despair i peered down at itat lester dant not my brother the hope upon which id based my search no longer kept me goingreverend benedict looked even sadder my wife and i wanted children but we werent able to have any while lester recuperated she and i had talked about becoming his guardians when he ran away we felt as if wed lost a child of our own he turned his gaze toward the cemetery beyond the rose garden she died last summer im sorry lord how i miss her he looked down at his wrinkled hands the last i heard about lester emotion made him pause a month after he ran away he was in loganville thats a town about a hundred miles east of here a fellow minister happened to mention a helpless young man who showed up one day and whom members of the congregation were taking care of i went there to find out if it was lester and to try to persuade him to come back home but he was gone by the time i got there if id somehow convinced him to stay with usthe reverend drew a breathperhaps none of the tragedies he caused would have happened you did everything possible lesters the one to blame only god can determine that the effort of explaining had obviously tired him i stood from the bench and shook his hand thank you reverend this was painful for you i appreciate the effort my prayers go with you i need them you said that orval and eunice lived south of town about eight miles everythings different now i suppose an agribusiness wound up farming the land but not much has changed if you head that way you can just make out the burned farmhouse from the road i dont remember driving south of town i was so dazed by what id learned that its a wonder i didnt drift off the narrow road and hit something i really had no idea why i was going out to where the fire had happened but the alternative was to drive pointlessly back to denver and i refused to do that paynes words kept coming back to me nothing beats going to the places and people you want to know about the ruined dant farm became one of those places a sign at the side of the road was weathered partially overgrown with brush but something in my subconscious noticed it bringing me to attention a large piece of plywood what i assumed had once been black letters had faded to gray repent that was all but it was enough to make me realize that id entered dant country on the right beyond a pasture i saw a farmhouse it was distant but even from the road i could tell that it was listing about to collapse and that its windows had been broken the roof on a barn next to it had already caved in but the reverend had said that orval dants property had been on the left so i focused my attention over there and soon noticed scorched stumps bordering fields of kneehigh crops i came to a section of trees where tall burned timber stood among comparatively shorter lush new trees then the land opened out again and i saw the weedcovered furrows of a dirt lane stretching back what seemed a quarter of a mile to a wide mound of something near another section of new trees a metal gate blocked my way it had a lock on a chain i got out and tested the lock finding it secure a strengthening breeze carried a hint of moisture earlier the sky had been stark blue but now it was hazy darkening on the horizon the rain wouldnt reach me for a couple of hours even so i reached into the car and got my knapsack which had trail food water and a rain jacket among other things the jacket was what most concerned me but the truth was id learned the hard way that even an apparently harmless walk in the woods might not work out as planned id also learned from what had happened at the rest area four nights earlier my pistol was in the knapsack i felt the packs satisfying weight against my back as i climbed the fence dust puffed around my sneakers when i came down on the opposite side i started at a walk but as i looked at the bushes around me i was reminded of something that kate jason and i had done the summer before theyd been kidnapped an architect friend had bought an old cabin up in the mountains trees and undergrowth had almost smothered the log building so one sunday hed invited his friends up to help clear the place in exchange for barbecued steaks and all the beer we could drink our families were welcome also jason had thought it would be fun working next to me helping to drag the cut bushes away and id felt my chest swell with pride that the little guy had tried so hard he made kate laugh when he objected to her wiping the dirt and sweat from his face and making him look like a sissy now frustrated that i was no closer to finding them i increased speed along the lane anger pushing me i stretched my legs as far and fast as i could the sun hot on my face sweat beading my skin my jeans and shirt sticking to me a quarter of a mile was too short i felt so infuriated that i could have run for miles as i used to before id left denver but back in denver id been hopeful whereas my frantic speed along that lane was a measure of how strongly i felt defeated i reached the end and slowed the wide mound that id seen from the road revealed itself to be the blackened walls of a collapsed wooden structure its boards had been reduced to long slabs of charcoal that had toppled into a chaotic pile dead leaves were wedged in the gaps thorny bushes and vines whose threeleafed pattern warned of poison ivy sprouted from the debris beyond a larger structure presumably the barn had similarly burned and collapsed despite the sweat id worked up i felt cold i told myself that i was only imposing my mood on what i was seeing all the same i couldnt ignore what had happened there lester dants parents had burned to death thirty feet from where i stood blackness overwhelmed me what the hell am i doing i thought i was about to go back to the car when something beyond the gutted house caught my attention an area of about thirty by thirty feet enclosed by a low stone wall the stones had been darkened by the fire some had fallen i passed the ruins trying to avoid the poison ivy as i approached the walledin area it had an opening where a gate had once been and when i came closer i saw that the enclosed area too was filled with poison ivy dead leaves and thorny bushes but amid the chaos i noticed regularly spaced clumps stepping closer i realized that they were small piles of rocks arranged in rows the pattern was too familiar not to be recognized as a graveyard instead of mounds there were depressions the earth having settled onto decaying wooden coffins and the moldering bodies within them the depressions were common to most old graveyards the only reason they didnt appear in modern cemeteries was that coffins were now made from metal and graves had sleeves of concrete onto which a concrete lid was placed after the coffin was lowered and the mourners had departed in that dismal enclosure generations of dants had been buried i imagined the pain and the loneliness with which their loved ones had laid them to rest what struck me most was how many of the graves were short indicating the deaths of children i dont know how long i stared at the graves meditating about the independent community that the dants had hoped to establish and how severely their dreams had failed at last i stepped away going around the back of the ruins a small animal skittered through trees behind me a squirrel perhaps but because id detected no signs of life around the place the sound startled me there werent even any birds sweating from the stark sun i noticed that the storm clouds were a little closer wary of more poison ivy i continued around the back of the burned house abruptly my legs felt unsteady for an instant i feared that something was wrong with my brain that i was having a stroke and my balance was gone my footing became even more unsteady my lungs fought for air when i realized in panic that it wasnt my brain or my legs the ground beneath me parted i plunged with a gasp i stopped caught at my hips my legs dangled in an unseen open area heart racing i pressed my hands against the ground and strained to push myself up through the hole that trapped me immediately my hands felt as unsteady as my legs had the more i pushed them against the earth the more they sank into it i dropped again but not before i flung out my arms blocking my fall an instant before the widening hole would have sucked me all the way down my legs dangled helplessly my body swaying in the emptiness beneath me only my head and shoulders were above ground my weight supported by my outstretched arms hearing muffled rattles below me i couldnt make my lungs work fast enough to take in all the air i needed the ground sagged again as the rattles got louder i shouted and plummeted all the way into the hole with a shock my feet hit bottom the impact bent my knees and threw me backward into darkness jolting me against something my knapsack jammed against my back the flashlight water bottle and pistol in it walloping against my shoulder blades i cracked my head and almost passed out a moldy earthen smell widened my nostrils the furious whir of rattles made me press harder against what id struck it felt like a wall it was made from wood that had turned spongy simultaneously i realized that what id fallen onto was the rotted remains of a wooden floor concrete showed through it was pooled with water and had soaked my pants but none of that mattered all i cared about were the rattles in the darkness across from me and the rippling movement in the sunlight that came down through the hole in the ground snakes i scrambled to my feet pressing into a corner the flashlight get the damned flashlight i thought frantic i tugged the knapsack off my back yanked at its zipper and reached in fumbling for the light in a rush i turned it on and aimed its powerful beam at the darkness across from me the floor over there was alive with coiled snakes their angry rattles echoing a moan caught in my throat i switched the flashlights aim toward the scummy water at my feet fearing that snakes would be coiled there but the greentinted water was free of them it was about two inches deep and i prayed that something in its scum was noxious to them the floor tilted down toward the corner i was in which explained why the water had collected there but to my right and left and in the corner across from me the raised part of the floor was dry which was why the snakes had gathered on that side how far can a rattlesnake spring i thought twice its length three times if so the snakes could fling themselves across the water at me but my fall had startled them making them dart back before they coiled their writhing mass was on the other side of the enclosure a sufficient distance to keep me safe for the moment the enclosure what the hell had i fallen into it was about the size of a doublecar garage to the left of the opposite corner a portion of the wall had collapsed behind its wooden exterior insulation and concrete had toppled inward exposing dank earth a downward channel in the earth showed that whoever had poured the concrete for this chamber had failed to put in adequate drainage behind it rain had filtered down accumulating behind the concrete until its weight had overwhelmed that section of the wall the gap explained how water had gotten into the chamber so did the roofnot concrete but made of timbers with plywood slabs on top the hole in the roof showed the layers and a waterproof rubber sheet above that with six inches of earth over everything nothing prevented mice and other small animals from burrowing through the earth reaching the rubber sheet and chewing through it once rain soaked down to the support beams the process of rot would have begun ultimately making the roof incapable of bearing weight but the chamber had obviously been built years earlier during that much time more than just a few inches of water would have accumulated where i was standing there had to be a crack in the floor that allowed the water to seep away that would have caused further erosion explaining why the floor tilted toward the corner i was in i stared toward the fallen section of the wall in the exposed earth a channel angled toward the surfacethe snakes used it to come and go i wondered desperately if i could dig up through it piling the earth in the chamber behind me as i went but how was i going to get past the snakes as the rattles intensified i braced the flashlight under my right arm and fumbled in my knapsack gripping the pistol immediately i realized the flaw in what i intended even with fifteen rounds in the magazine and one in the chamber not to mention a further fifteenround magazine in the knapsack i couldnt hope to kill every snake oh i could hit most of them there were so many that it would be difficult for me to miss but all of them killing them not merely wounding no way besides i had to consider the effect of the gunshots the reports would send the surviving snakes into a frenzy making them strike insanely at anything that moved even if it meant flinging themselves across the water to get at me and what about ricocheting bullets slamming back at me i pressed harder into the corner stay quiet i warned myself trying to control my hoarse breathing once the snakes realize youre not a threat theyll calm down i hoped but i hadnt brought spare flashlight batteries in a couple of hours the flashlight would stop working a few more hours after that the sun would go down the hole in the roof would darken id be trapped in blackness not knowing if the snakes would disregard the water which possibly wasnt noxious to them at all and slither close to me attracted by my body heat the meager illumination through the hole in the roof would have to be sufficient hoping that my eyes would adjust to the shadows i shut off the flashlight conserving the batteries despite the cold water i stood in sweat trickled down my face fear made me tremble stop moving i warned myself dont attract attention i squeezed my muscles straining to control their reflexive tremors at first i wondered if it was my imagination long seconds after i shut off the light and willed myself not to move the buzz from the rattles lessened slowly the frenzy subsided my shadowadapted eyes showed me the snakes eventually uncoiling their unblinking gaze no longer fixed on me their movements became less threatening a few went up the channel toward the surface but snakes preferred heat why had they gathered in the cool chamber rather than remaining outside and basking in the sun what had driven them down the question made my skin feel prickly especially when the few snakes that had gone up returned god help me what didnt they like up there the rattling had almost completely stopped just a few snakes continuing to coil then except for the hammering of my heart the chamber became quiet above i heard sounds past the hole id fallen through the breeze became a wind whistling through bushes i heard a rumble that i hoped was an approaching car but that i suddenly understood was thunder the light through the hole dimmed lightning cracked the wind shrieked harder but none of that was why fear squeezed my chest tighter no what terrified me was the pat pat pat i heard on the floor the rain falling through the hole it came faster the snakes that were positioned under the hole jerked when the drops hit them some slithered toward their companions on the far side of the enclosure they accumulated on something slightly higher than the floor a long flat object that the shadows kept me from identifying its soft contours having dissolved after years of periodic flooding but other snakes veered in my direction the floor seeming to waver as they approached the scummy water some slithered onto it rank fumes from the water assaulted my nostrils i aimed my pistol trembling holding fire when i saw that the snakes on the water reversed direction and headed back toward the dry floor others had paused at the water and angled away id been right something in the water repelled them but the rain fell rapidly through the hole splashing the floor widening its circle of moisture a small pool formed trickling toward my corner soon the entire area would be covered when there wasnt a dry space the snakes wouldnt have a reason to avoid my corner feeling smothered i turned on the flashlight and searched for something that i could use to hit the snakes if they came at me sections of wood and concrete that had fallen from the opposite wall were too far to reach without putting myself within striking distance of the snakes as the water spread across the floor the snakes crowded into a narrower area across from me it wouldnt be long before they set out in all directions looking for a place that was dry i thought about attempting to rip a board from the wall it might make a club i had to try it lightning flashed beyond the hole in the roof the water spread to the snakes across from me forcing them to pile on top of one another some dispersed theyd soon be everywhere i shoved the pistol under my belt and aimed the flashlight to my right looking for a crack in the wall that would give my hands sufficient purchase to yank off a board what had been shadows in my peripheral vision were i saw now support beams that had fallen from the roof leaning against the wall maybe i could use the beams to build a ramp maybe i could climb up and pull down other beams claw through the earth and reach the surface i didnt dare worry that the entire roof might collapse and crush me no matter what i had to get away from the snakes so much rain had fallen through the hole in the roof that the floor was now totally wet across from me more snakes dispersed rippling over the water i moved to the right and pressed a shoe against one of the beams that leaned against the wall to test it dismayed i found that the wood was so rotten that it crumbled under my weight the sudden lack of resistance threw me off balance struggling not to land in the water i lurched forward and struck the wall behind the beams the impact jolted my shoulder i almost dropped the flashlight worse the noise disturbed the snakes sending several of them into another frenzy of rattling i was certain that id go crazy start shooting and be killed by a dozen bites my terror so preoccupied me that it took me a moment to register that the wall id hit sounded hollow more snakes crossed the water toward me i shoved the other beam to the side and uncovered a door the nearest snake was three feet away when i gripped the rusty doorknob i turned it but the rust had frozen the mechanism i turned harder felt it budge and thrust against the door with all my strength it creaked another desperate shove and it suddenly swung inward with a crash taking me with it i sprawled on wet concrete banging my chin but ignoring the pain concentrating to protect the flashlight dazed i whirled toward the doorway a snake had coiled about to strike i kicked at the door but its old hinges didnt respond soon enough the snake leapt the door banged shut halfway along its body pinning it the snakes front half whipping this way and that the light from the hole in the roof was no longer visible only my flashlight trembling in my hand showed how the snake was caught its agonized movements tore its front half from the door its jagged midsection spewed blood as it flopped into the water and thrashed toward me i lurched backward my head banged against something and as the snake struck the bottom of one of my sneakers i stood frantically using my other sneaker to stomp the snakes head its bones cracking beneath my sole the snakes severed body thrashed under my heel its spastic movements slowing becoming less violent when it was finally still i raised my shoe and aimed the flashlight at the flattened bloody head reminding myself that a prick from its fangs could be poisonous even after it was dead i kicked the torso toward the door when it splashed down i raised my light to make sure that the door was closed and that no other snakes could get past it i swung around to find out where i was and if this place too was inhabited by snakes nothing slithered no rattling unnerved me but even though id escaped from the first enclosure i remained trapped i was in a tunnel roughly five feet wide and twenty feet long with a ceiling i could touch if i raised my hand the end opposite the door was choked with the objects id banged against blackened timbers and other debris from the fire unlike in the first chamber the concrete of the walls and the floor hadnt been covered with wood the ceiling though had the same poor design timbers with presumably plywood slabs a rubber sheet and earth on top the timbers had not yet fallen but water seeped between them and eventually the timbers would rot to the stage of collapse as i noticed two rusted metal ducts that went along the ceiling and into the chamber the rain streamed from the ceiling in greater volume rivulets poured down through the wreckage at the end of the tunnel the water on the floor rose to my ankles the crack at the doors bottom was too narrow to allow the water to drain i was trapped in what amounted to a cistern how much rain could a strong june storm unload an inch two that didnt seem a threat unless you considered the expanse of the ground above the tunnel and the square footage of the burned house both of which collected the water and funneled it into the fivebyeightbytwentyfoot space that held me the water probably wouldnt rise all the way to the ceiling but there was a strong chance it would get high enough that id have to dogpaddle to keep my head above the surface but how long could i do that as the water chilled me and hypothermia set in once i started shivering id be dead in three hours in fact id already started shivering my flashlight showed wisps of my breath as i splashed toward the debris that blocked the tunnel i braced the light between scorched boards its slanted glare making it difficult for me to see as i grabbed a burned timber and strained to tug it loose the effort made me breathe faster inhaling deeply i coughed from the smoky odor coming off the wet wood i pulled harder and freed the timber with a minor sense of triumph i was about to shove it behind me when the debris shifted and caused the flashlight to tumble i grabbed for it but my fingers only grazed it as it flipped from my grasp i lunged using my hands like scoops to catch it the instant before it would have fallen into the water i pulled it to my chest treasuring it almost certainly it would have stopped working if it had gotten soaked the panic of nearly having lost my light made me shiver more severely the chill water rose to my shins i tried holding the flashlight with one hand while i used the other to pull at the boards that blocked my way but i couldnt get a decent grip reluctantly i again tried bracing the flashlight among the debris but it almost fell the moment i pulled out another board my pistol dug into the skin under my belt it gave me the idea of cramming the flashlight under the opposite side of the belt but there wasnt room think i told myself there has to be a way i took off my knapsack opened a side pocket and shoved the flashlight into it when i resecured the knapsack to my back the light glared toward the ceiling but when i leaned forward to grab at debris the light did what i wanted tilting in that direction my frenzied movements echoed so loudly that my ears rang breathing stridently i pulled out more boards thrusting them behind me water poured down through the debris and rose to my knees no matter how hot i felt from my exertions i couldnt stop shivering i freed another board and stared at a sootsmeared concrete step that led upward with greater determination i pulled two more boards loose found another step and felt a growing surge of hope if i could uncover enough steps so i could climb above the water the danger of hypothermia would lessen i had food in my knapsack id be able to eat and rest conserving the flashlights batteries using them only while clearing the stairwell desperate i grabbed a timber and dragged it free about to shove it behind me when i heard a crack and gaped up at a huge plug of debris snapping loose i tried to scramble back but a jumble of scorched timbers and boards crashed down on me the force took my breath away knocking me toward the water i didnt dare let the flashlight get soaked deafened by the reverberating rumble i fought to raise myself to keep the knapsack from filling with water i pushed at the timbers weighing against me i thrust the boards away i grabbed something that didnt feel like wood it was round and soft i screamed when i realized that i was holding the snake its severed body drooping in my hands the fangs of its crushed head close to my arm as i hurled it away a floating timber knocked against me i fell the foul water went over my head it rushed into my ears crammed my nostrils and filled my mouth gasping i bolted to the surface coughing spitting out soottasting water struggling to breathe i wiped at my eyes frantically realizing that my lack of vision had nothing to do with water in them the flashlight had gone out in absolute darkness my other senses strained to fill the void the echo of waves splashing and wood thudding against the walls the feel of my wet clothes clinging to me the taste of soot and dirt the stench of the water making me gag my most extreme sense though was terror afraid to move lest i touch the fangs of the dead snake floating around me i stood rigidly trying to keep balanced in the darkness while i listened to the lapping of the waves slowly subsiding soon all i heard was water streaming from the roof and through the debris in the stairwell my wet knapsack was heavy on my back blind i took it off looped its straps over a shoulder and carefully took out the flashlight i shook it i pressed its onoff button nothing i unscrewed its cap removed the batteries dumped the water from the cylinder and blew on the poles of the batteries to attempt to dry them after reinserting the batteries i pressed the button the darkness remained total no i was wrong my eyes straining to adapt to the blackness became sensitive to a slight glow on my left wrist the luminous coating on the hour marks of my watch the speckled circle floated disembodied i poured water from the knapsack put the flashlight in it and my pistol which had dug deeper into the skin under my belt then i made sure that the packs zippers were tightly closed and strapped it to my back meanwhile the cold water rose above my knees move wading i groped ahead i flinched from a chill clammy pitted surface belatedly identifying it as a concrete wall when id lost my balance and fallen i must have gotten turned around now i had to make a choice right or left one direction led to the door the other to the choked stairwell i eased to the left pawing through the darkness something pricked my hand oh jesus id touched the snakes fangs jerking my hand back grabbing where id been stung i felt an object stuck in my palm no a splinter only a splinter id scraped against a board id found the stairwell as my watchs luminous dial zigzagged ghostlike in the darkness i tugged at boards i yanked at timbers i pulled and heaved shoving debris behind me my hands were in pain cut and gouged but i didnt care i had to clear more space before the water rose fatally higher my shoulders ached and my back throbbed my mouth became dry i had trouble getting air down my throat and finally had to pause to take my canteen from the knapsack and gulp water making my mouth and throat feel less swollen able to get more air but the brief rest didnt give me energy i felt lightheaded and realized that carbon dioxide was accumulating in the tunnel becoming denser as the water rose i didnt need to worry about hypothermia i was going to die from suffocation with a greater frenzy i grabbed sightlessly for debris and hurled it behind me i freed one step after another working higher but the water followed tugging at my hips i felt unsteady my mind whirled even though i couldnt see spots wavered in front of my eyes the air thickened my movements slowed debris floated against me when a timber broke in my hands i jerked backward almost falling into the water then i pulled a chunk of wreckage releasing not only it but a pool that had gathered in the ruins above me with the force of a broken dam it rushed onto me so strong that it swept me off the steps knocking me against floating timbers i was dazed barely able to keep my head above the surface i flopped one arm and then the other against the water trying to swim but remaining in place i was so weak struggling not to sink that it took me a moment to notice that the air had a hint of sweetness i stared toward the stairwell and feared that my mind was tricking me because the darkness was shaded i saw vague contours of the wreckage gray filtered down bolstered by the fresh air seeping in i found the strength to swim to the stairwell i wavered up the steps and pulled at timbers the gray beckoning urging me upward when i finally squirmed up through an ooze of soot squeezing past the jumbled skeleton of the collapsed house the sky was thick with clouds the air turned grayer making me think that the hidden sun was setting and that in my delirium it had taken me all day to burrow up from the stairwell the cold rain persisted it pelted me but the grime that covered me was like grease and wouldnt come off i clawed up through wreckage i strained and dragged myself higher several times boards snapped in my hands threatening to hurtle me back into the pit my bloodsmeared fingers hooked onto the top of a foundation wall i pulled myself over flopping onto mushy ground it took me several minutes before i could stand as i plodded through mud i wondered if id have the strength to reach my car steam rose around me but i couldnt get the bathwater hot enough the cold penetrated to my bones to my soul what use had the chamber served i kept asking myself why had orval whod possessed construction skills not built the roof with concrete what had been the purpose of the two ducts that had gone along the roof of the tunnel and into the chamber if the chamber had been a storage area there wouldnt have been a need to panel the walls cover the floor and use insulation i couldnt make sense of it unless where they kept me a prisoner was an underground room the man whod claimed to be my brother had said not petey god help me but lester dant why would orval and eunice dant have kept their only child in an underground room the horror of it made my mind swirl the puzzle of the roofs poor construction now became clear by working after dark using no more than the lights from the house orval could have dug the space for the tunnel and the underground chamber without anyone who drove by noticing and wondering working at night he could have mixed concrete in small amounts and used a wheelbarrow to transport it for the floor and walls of the tunnel and the chamber but the ceiling would have been a problem to construct it properly he would have needed to make concrete slabs once the slabs were ready however he would have needed a small crane to hoist them into place precision work that would have required more than just standard illumination from the house outsiders would have noticed and been curious about so much light in back of his house after dark better to be cautious by using wooden beams for the roof easily and quickly installed or maybe thered been a deadline maybe orval had been forced to compromise with the roofs construction because a timetable was hurrying him sickened i added more hot water to the tub but i still couldnt chase the cold from my soul making me even colder was my uneasy conviction that i hadnt learned everything i could have out there i was sure there was something darker god help me i didnt want to but i knew i had to go back i walked along the lane to the ruin the time was a little after ten the next morning my night had been fitful sleep coming only toward dawn my nervousness grew as i stepped closer i removed my pistol from a fanny pack that id bought clutching the weapon helped to keep my scraped hands from shaking the thought of the snakes made bile rise into my mouth i paused where i had the previous day from the lane i couldnt see the spot where id fallen into the chamber it was as if the earth had sealed itself but i had a general idea of where the tunnel and the chamber were and i plotted a direction that avoided them i studied the long grass for quite a while on guard against the slightest ripple finally i aimed the pistol and took one cautious step after another weeds scraped against my pants the poison ivy seemed harder to avoid i took a wide arc around the back of the house approaching a group of trees behind the house the previous night id imagined the design problems that orval had needed to solve insulate the prison chamber get heating ducts leading into it but what about ventilation one of the ducts would have taken air from the furnace in the house the other duct would have returned air to the furnace a closed system that would have been adequate if the chamber had been merely a storage room but if i was right and the chamber had been a cell the system would have needed to be modified so that carbon dioxide and other poisonous gases didnt accumulate and kill the prisoner to prevent that from happening there would have had to be another duct into the chamber powered with a fan to bring in fresh air the logical place for that duct would have been just below the ceiling but the snakes had prevented me from noticing the duct if it was there the outlet would have had to project above the ground otherwise it would have gotten clogged with dirt but how had orval disguised it the area behind the house was flat after the fire the townspeople would have swarmed around the wreckage hoping to find survivors they hadnt stumbled over the vent if they had theyd have wondered about its purpose and eventually have discovered the underground chamber so where in hell had orval hidden the outlet so that nobody had found it back then the trees were the obvious answer between fallen logs or inside a stump ready with the pistol i continued through the weeds and long grass the sun was hot on my head but that wasnt the reason i sweated each time a breeze moved blades of grass i tightened my finger on the trigger i reached the trees where the grass was welcomely shorter as i crisscrossed the area whenever i nudged a log my muscles cramped in anticipation of finding a coiled snake i picked up a stick making sure that it was in fact a stick then poked through leaves that had collected in hollow stumps i found nothing unusual but the outlet had to be in the area i turned in a slow circle surveying the trees damn it where would orval have hidden the outlet ventilation ducts became inefficient the longer they extended the outlet had to be somewhere among the charred logs and stumps everything else in the area was flat no i realized with a chill not everything the graveyard on my left about fifty feet from the chamber it looked so bleak that it discouraged me from going near it a perfect place to i stepped from the trees entering the long grass and the first rattle took my breath away i stumbled back saw the snake under a bush and blew its head off the reflex and the accuracy with which i shot surprised me hours and hours of practice no doubt explained my reaction but for over a year hate and anger had been swelling in me more than anything i wanted to kill something no sooner had i shot the first snake than a second one buzzed i blew its head apart a third coiled a fourth a fifth i shot each of them furious that the snakes seemed to be trying to stop me my shots rang in my ears the sharp stench of cordite floated around me relentlessly i shifted through the grass a sixth a seventh an eighth pieces of snakes flew blood sprayed through the grass yet more kept rattling and it seemed that it wasnt my pistol but my raging thoughts that shot them so directly and instantly did their heads explode the moment i fixed my gaze on them the last empty cartridge flipped to the ground the slide on the pistol stayed back as id done hundreds of times in class i pushed the button that dropped the empty magazine i drew a full one from my fanny pack slammed it into the pistols grip pushed the lever that freed the slide and aimed this way and that eager for more targets none presented itself either id frightened the rest away or they were hiding waiting let them try i thought in a fury as i picked up the empty magazine and proceeded more relentlessly through the grass reaching the graveyards low stone wall i climbed over brambles and poison ivy awaited me the place was too foul even for snakes the piles of stones in front of each grave made my nerves tighten as i stepped forward glancing behind me i thought i detected a slight furrow in the ground where earth seemed to have settled it was so minor that i never would have paid attention to it if i hadnt been looking for it faint it ran from where id fallen into the chamber it went under the graveyards wall even less noticeable it led to the grave nearest the underground chamber a short grave a childs grave angry i knelt i pulled away the pile of stones at the head of the grave for a moment i couldnt move the stones had concealed an eightinchwide duct sticking up the duct had a baffle on it so that rain would pour off and not get into the ventilation system i was right the chamber had been a cell i remembered the long flat object that the snakes had piled onto to avoid the rising water over the years the object had so deteriorated that in the shadows i hadnt been able to identify it but now i knew what it was the remains of a mattress it had been the only object in the room there hadnt even been a toilet had lester been forced to relieve himself in a pot contending with the stench until his captors took it away their son the horror of it mounted as i stared at the childs grave that theyd desecrated to hide their sin reverend benedict was where i had met him the previous day kneeling trimming roses in the churchs garden his white hair glinted in the sunlight mr denning he stood with effort shook my hand and frowned at the scratches on it youve injured yourself i took a fall he pointed toward my chin where my beard stubble couldnt hide a bruise evidently a bad one not as bad as it could have been at the dant place i nodded did you find anything to help you locate your family im still trying to make sense of it i told him what id discovered the wrinkles in his forehead deepened orval and eunice held their only son prisoner why maybe they thought the devil was in him i have a feeling a lot of things happened out there that well never understand reverend my head pounded how did lester escape from the underground room when the fire broke out did orval and eunice risk their lives to go down to the basement and free him did the parents somehow get trapped in spite of how theyd treated him did lester try but fail to save them as he claimed it fits what we know but it doesnt explain why he didnt tell everybody what hed suffered when something outrageous happens to us dont we want to tell others dont we want sympathy unless the memorys so dark that we cant handle it especially if a different kind of outrage happened out there reverend benedict kept frowning what are you getting at suppose lester somehow got out of that room on his own or suppose the parents released him every so often as a reward for good behavior did lester start the fire start the lord have mercy one way or another whether they tried to rescue him or whether he got out on his own did he trap his parents did he stand outside the burning house and listen with delight to their screams is that something hed have wanted to describe to anyone but thats not all that bothers me good god you dont mean theres more im from colorado i said the apparent non sequitur made reverend benedict shake his wizened head in confusion every once in a while theres a story about somebody who went into the mountains and came across a rattlesnake i said not often maybe its because the snakes have plenty of hiding places in the mountains and theyre not aggressive by nature they prefer to stay away from us but indianas a different matter lots of people dwindling farmland have you ever seen a rattlesnake around here no have you ever heard of anybody who has come across one i asked not that i can think of the reverend said a farmer perhaps rarely because the spreading population has driven them out presumably then how come there are dozens of rattlesnakes on the dant property in southern states in mississippi or louisiana for example so many snakes might not seem unusual but not around here what are they doing on orvals farm how did they get there i cant imagine well i can do you suppose that the dants could have been practicing snake handling out there the reverend paled as a religious exercise holding them in each hand letting them coil around their neck to prove their faith in god exactly if the snakes didnt bite it meant that god intervened it meant that god favored the dants more than he did the people in town if youve got a bunker mentality if youve got a desperate us against them attitude maybe you want undeniable proof that youre right its the worst kind of presumption and i suspect it destroyed them i dont understand you said that there were three dant families when lester was born by the time of the fire only one familyorval eunice and lesterremained you wondered if the other families might have moved away or had gotten deathly ill but im wondering if the snakes didnt send the dants a different message than they expected you mean the snakes killed them the reverend murmured the dants would never have gone to a doctor for help dear jesus snake handling would explain how so many got to be out there the dants brought them i said what it doesnt explain is why the snakes remained why didnt they spread perhaps they stayed where they belonged at first i didnt understand then i nodded maybe thats a foul rotten place out there reverend i think youre right if i were in your line of work id say that the snakes are exactly where they feel at home several bees buzzed my face i motioned them away just one more question and then ill leave you alone i said anything i can do to help you mentioned that after lester ran from your home he showed up in a town a hundred miles east of here across the border in ohio thats right what did you say it was called part five loganville was better than i expected a picturepostcard town with a prosperouslooking main street and a welcoming park in front of its courthouse i asked directions to the unitarian church whose minister id phoned to make an appointment the portly grayhaired man was stacking hymnals in the vestibule reverend hanley id explained on the phone why i needed to talk with him i showed him lester dants photograph and asked about the teenagers arrival at the church nineteen years earlier i realize thats a long time ago but reverend benedict seemed to think that youd remember what happened back then i certainly do its difficult to forget what happened that summer that boy meant a great deal to harold and gladys they wanted so much to become his guardians harold reverend benedict their greatest regret was not having children how is harold by the way i havent seen him in at least a year hes well enough to get down on his knees and trim roses reverend hanley chuckled no doubt saying a few prayers while hes at it he studied lester dants photograph and sobered its hard to add time and a scarhe could be the same person the intensity of his eyes is certainly the same he might be able to help you find your wife and son you said hes the one who kidnapped them the minister took a moment to recover from what id said i wish i could help you but i didnt get to know him well the person you need to talk to is agnes garner shes the member of the congregation who took the most interest in him and shes the one he most betrayed climbing the porch steps at the address id been given i found a woman in a wheelchair from her paintightened face i might have guessed that she was almost seventy if reverend hanley hadnt already told me that shed been thirtyeight when lester dant had come into her life nineteen years earlier ms garner mrs sorry reverend hanley didnt tell me you were married widowed he didnt tell me that either no reason he should have her abrupt manner made me uncomfortable thanks for agreeing to see me her hair was gray her dress had a blue flower pattern she had a cordless telephone on her lap you want to know about lester dant id appreciate any information you can give me reverend hanley called and explained about your wife and son do you have a photograph of them always with longing i pulled out my wallet she stared at the picture kates father had taken it when we were visiting kates parents in durango the magnificent cliff ruins of mesa verde arent far from there wed made a day trip of it the photo showed kate jason and me standing in front of one of the halfcollapsed dwellings we wore jeans and tshirts and were smiling toward the camera in the photos background next to an old stone wall a stooped shadow looked like a human being but there wasnt anything to account for the shadow jason had insisted it was the ghost of a native american whod lived there hundreds of years earlier ghosts i didnt want to think i was looking at ghosts a wonderful family thank you was all i could say theres so much sorrow in the world yes emotion tightened my throat mrs garner do you recognize this man i showed her the photo it pained her to look at him she nodded and turned away its lester i havent thought about him in years i try my hardest not to shes going to send me away i thought do you honestly believe that what i tell you can help she asked i dont know any other way hurt him excuse me were supposed to forgive those who trespass against us but i want you to hurt him if i get the chance mrs garner believe me i will she gripped the sides of her wheelchair there was a time when i could walk i was always the earliest to arrive for sunday services the change in topic confused me i made a point of getting to the church before everyone now i wonder if i wasnt too proud and thats why god punished me whatever happened mrs garner it wasnt gods fault it was lester dants hed sat at the top of the church steps with his back against the door a teenager mrs garner said his head was drooped but even without seeing his face i could tell that i didnt know him his clothes were torn so the first thing i thought was that hed been in some kind of accident the next thing i thought was the way his head hung down he might be on drugs but before i could make a decision whether to hurry to help him or run away he raised his head and looked at me his eyes were so direct there was no way he could have been on drugs they were filled with torment i asked him if he was hurt no maam he said but im awful tired and hungry by then other members of the congregation had arrived the reverend came but neither he nor anybody else recognized the boy we asked him his name but he said that he couldnt remember we asked where he came from but he couldnt remember that either from the rips in his clothes and the freshly healed burn marks on his arms we figured that he must have had something terrible happen to him that he was in shock the reverend offered to take him home and get him something to eat but the boy said no these people are waiting for the service to begin that sounds too good to be true i know but you werent there everybody who came to church that morning felt so concerned about the boy and so touched by his unselfish attitude that we had a sense of gods hand among us we took him inside i sat next to him and handed him a bible but he didnt open it i wondered if he was too dazed to be able to read imagine my surprise when the congregation read out loud from the scriptures and the boy recited every passage from memory i remember that the reverend said something in his sermon about keeping compassion in our hearts and helping the unfortunate he paused to look directly at the boy afterward everybody said that it was one of the most moving services that wed had in a long time the reverend took the boy home he asked me and a couple of other church members to help we made a big meal we got the boy fresh clothes he did everything slowly as if in a daze who was he we wondered what had happened to him where had he come from a doctor examined him but couldnt get him to remember anything the chief of police got the same results and asked the state police if they knew about anybody who matched the boys description and had been reported missing the state police didnt learn anything either that made sense i thought loganville was in ohio but the fire had happened in indiana the ohio police had probably decided that the boys arrival in loganville wasnt important enough for outofstate inquiries even if they had gone out of state inquiries to the indiana state police might have been pointless the fire having been basically a local matter that the state police wouldnt have monitored various members of the congregation offered to take the boy in mrs garner said but the reverend decided that since id found him i had the right to take care of him if i wanted my husband was the most generous soul imaginable five years earlier wed lost a son to cancer she paused caught in her memories our only child if joshua had lived hed have been the same age as the teenager id found on the church steps seemed to be i couldnt help thinking that god had sent him into our lives for a reason as a mrs garner had trouble saying the next word substitute i asked she nodded her pain lines deepening thats another reason i believe i was punished for vain thoughts like that for presuming that god would single me out and give me favorable treatment but back then i couldnt resist the idea that something miraculous was happening that i was being given a second son i told my husband what i hoped for and he didnt take a moment to agree if i wanted the boy to live with us while his problems got sorted out it was fine my husband loved me so much and her voice dropped she turned her wheelchair slightly so that she looked even straighter at me the boy came to live with us while the authorities tried to figure out who he was he was awfully skinny it took me days of solid home cooking of fried chicken and apple pies to put some weight on him his burns had healed but the scratches on his arms and legs where his clothes had been torn got infected and needed their dressings and bandages changed a lot i didnt mind it reminded me of taking care of the son wed lost i was pleased to do it but i couldnt help wondering what on earth had happened to him i left books and magazines on his bedside table so hed have something to amuse him while he was resting after a while i realized that none of them had been opened when i asked him if they didnt suit him if hed like to read something else he avoided the question and it suddenly occurred to me that the boy couldnt read id taken a seat on a porch swing now i frowned but you said that he could recite passages from the bible any passage i asked him then i dont understand i asked him to read the back of a cereal box i asked him to read the headline of a newspaper he couldnt do it i put a pencil and paper in front of him he couldnt write the simplest words he was illiterate as for the bible passages there was only one explanation someone had taught him the bible orally had made him memorize passages that were read to him it chilled me when i realized that what on earth had happened to him thats one of the few questions i have an answer for her gaze was intense you know wishing that i hadnt interrupted i nodded his parents held him prisoner in an underground room what as much as ive been able to figure out they believed that the devil was in him that the only way to drive satan out was by filling his head with the bible mrs garner looked horrified but why wouldnt they have let him learn how to read and write im still trying to piece it together maybe they believed that reading and writing were the devils tools the wrong kind of books would lead to the wrong kind of ideas and the next thing sin would be all over the place the bible was the only safe book and the surest way to guarantee that the bible was the only book lester knew was to teach it to him orally mrs garners eyes wavered as if shed become dizzy she lowered her head and massaged her temples are you all right i asked the things people do to one another ive told you what lester did to my family what did he do to your seconds passed gradually she looked up at me the pain in her eyes worse he was the politest boy i ever met he was always asking to help around the house at the same time id never met anyone so troubled some afternoons hed lie in bed for hours staring at the ceiling reliving god knew what in the nights he couldnt go to sleep unless his closet light was on he often woke screaming from nightmares they seemed to have something to do with the fire that had burned his arms id go into his room and try to calm him id sit holding him stroking his head whispering that he was safe that nothing could hurt him where he was that he didnt have to worry anymore she paused rubbing her temples again are you sure youre okay i asked so long ago why does the memory still hurt so much i dont mean to upset you if you need to rest for a while i can come back when i never spoke about this to anyone ever maybe i should have maybe it wouldnt keep torturing me if id told someone if id tried to explain do you want to explain it to me she looked at me in anguish for the longest while searching my eyes to a stranger yes someone whose judgments ill never have to face again i dont make judgments mrs garner all i want is to get my wife and son back do you know anything that can help me do that she struggled with her thoughts one night he kissed me on the cheek another night after one of his nightmares after i held him and calmed him he pecked my cheek again or tried to he grazed my lips as if hed aimed for my cheek and missed it was an awkward moment i stood as soon as i got him settled in bed i felt uncomfortable but i kept telling myself that i was imagining things that the boy hadnt meant anything mrs garner you dont need to i have to somehow i have to get it out of me i wanted to take care of the boy so much that i was in denial each intimacy seemed innocent like when i tried to teach him to read and write thats what i used to be a teacher at the high school this happened at the end of summer school hadnt started yet i had time to try to teach him i used the bible since he already knew the words we sat together at the kitchen table our chairs were close there was nothing wrong we were just a teacher and a student sitting at a table working on a school problem arid yet in retrospect i realize that he sat closer than he needed to when he helped me make dinner our hands would touch briefly i didnt think anything of it one of the reasons i havent told anybody about this is that im afraid itll seem as if i took some kind of she had trouble saying the wordenjoyment thats the furthest thing from the truth i know that there are a lot of twisted people in this world mr denning but im a churchgoing godfearing woman and i assure you that i am not capable of enjoying the touch of a teenager whom i considered to be like a son an uncomfortable silence gathered i made myself nod encouraging her to continue but its because i wanted so desperately to take care of him that everything happened one night after another of his nightmares when i held him he grazed my selfconscious she looked down at the front of her dress it seemed accidental yet i finally admitted that too many accidental gestures like that had happened and i told him that certain kinds of touching werent appropriate i told him that i wanted the two of us to be close but that there were different kinds of closeness he said that he didnt know what i meant but that if i wanted him to keep a distance he would the next night she couldnt get the words out her eyes glistened close to weeping may i see the photograph of your wife and son again please puzzled i took out my wallet she studied it even longer than the first time such a wonderfullooking family what are their names kate and jason are you happily married very now i was the one who had trouble speaking is your son a good boy the best my voice became hoarse how will this help you find them moisture filled her eyes if kate and jason are still alive i thought what id learned from reverend benedict filled me with despair im betting that he has habits i struggled to hide my discouragement if i can understand him i might be able to follow his trail a trail that started nineteen years ago i dont know where else to go he raped me the porch became deathly silent except for her sobs as tears trickled down her cheeks i felt paralyzed trying to get over my shock im sorry i shouldnt have asked you to talk about it dont talk about it her tears made scald marks on her cheeks god help me ive been holding it inside all these years thats the torture my husband was the principal of the school where i taught around dark the janitor called about a water pipe that had burst my husband hurried down to learn how serious the damage was i got ready for bed the boy the rotten son of a bitch bastard the torrent of what for mrs garner were the crudest of obscenities shocked me he came into my bedroom while i was undressing threw me on the floor and i couldnt believe how strong he was he was so fraillooking and yet he overpowered me as if he had the force of the devil he kept calling me eunice but he knew very well that my first name is agnes i tried to fight him off i scratched i kicked then i saw his fist coming at me twice three times i almost choked on my blood lying there halfunconscious while he her voice faltered she pulled a handkerchief from her dress raising it to her cheeks afterward some of her tears dripped from her chin after i vomited after i found the strength to stand i saw drawers open and realized that hed stolen anything of value that he could stuff into his pockets but that was the last thing on my mind i staggered to the phone to call the police and get an ambulance and all at once i realized that i couldnt do that i thought of the congregation and the town and the high school where my husband and i worked and i imagined everybody staring at me oh sure theyd be sympathetic but that wouldnt stop them from telling everybody they knew about what had happened to agnes garner being sympathetic wouldnt stop them from staring and it wouldnt stop word from getting around to the students who would stare even more than their parents rape rape i wavered in front of the phone i remember telling myself that i had to call for help that i was close to passing out instead i forced myself into the bathroom i used all my strength to get in the tub and wash myself where hed she wiped more tears from her face then i got dressed then i called the police and no doctor ever had a chance to examine any part of me except my smashed lips and my bruised cheeks i told everybody that id come into the bedroom and found him stealing money and jewelry not that i had much jewelry im not that kind of a woman all told he took about three hundred dollars which could be replaced but a simple necklace that my grandmother had given me could never be replaced my husband got home just after the police car arrived the police searched for the boy but never found him maybe he slept in the woods maybe he hitchhiked and got a ride out of the area the next day reverend benedict arrived from brockton i learned that the boys name was lester dant i learned about the fire that had killed his parents but i never told reverend benedict or reverend hanley what had really happened in my bedroom i never told my husband i never told anyone when word got around people stared yes but it was a kind of staring that i could tolerate wed taken a boy into our home hed repaid us by beating me and stealing from us i was the kind of victim that the town could deal with i cant tell you how sorry i am i said eunice she sounded anguished why on earth did he call me eunice i didnt answer you know about the underground room where his parents kept him prisoner what else do you know have you any idea why he called me eunice her tone was so beseeching that i found myself saying yes tell me are you sure you want the answer the same as you need answers i hesitated eunice was his mothers name mrs garner moaned it sounds as if he was punishing his mother punishing his mother god help me her voice cracked with despair hurt him remember your promise when you find him hurt him you have my word all the way to my car i tried not to let mrs garner see my discouragement when you find him shed said but i no longer believed that i would with no information about where lester dant had gone that night i hadnt the faintest idea what to do next worse i didnt see the point of trying lester was far more disturbed than the fbis information about him had revealed i couldnt imagine him keeping kate and jason alive grieving for them i slumped behind the steering wheel hate fought with grief hurt him mrs garner had pleaded yes hurt him i thought furious i drove past wellmaintained lawns and neatly trimmed hedges i reached a fourway stop and turned to the right at the next fourway stop i turned to the left no reason no direction i went on that way at random for quite a while driving through the prosperous farm town until i realized that i was passing certain homes and stores for what might have been the fifth or sixth time fatigue finally caught up to me making me stop at a motel called the travelers oasis on the edge of town it was almost five but for me it felt like midnight as i carried my suitcase and backpack into a room that faced the parking lot too exhausted to survey the spartan accommodations i returned to the car for my printer and laptop computer i wondered why id bothered to bring them they took up space i hadnt used them maybe its time to go home i thought in denver it was two hours earlier i picked up the phone payne detective agency a mans familiar voice said answering the phone yourself payne didnt reply for a moment ann had a doctors appointment ann his receptionist was also his wife how are you brad is my voice that recognizable i imagined the portly man next to his goldfish tank youve been on my mind when you called the last time you were in south dakota you said youd get back to me but you didnt ive been worried what are you doing in i heard paynes fingers tapping on a computer keyboard the travelers oasis in loganville ohio sounds like youve got a new computer program it keeps me distracted what are you doing there giving up im sorry to hear that i figured that as long as you were in motion you wouldnt do anything foolish to yourself you didnt learn anything i gather i sat wearily on the bed the opposite i learned too much but it hasnt taken me anywhere except to the travelers oasis in loganville ohio payne tried to make it sound like a joke but it didnt work i was hoping to find a pattern i said into the phone sometimes a patterns there we just dont recognize it yeah well my patterns been aimless something payne had said caught up to methe somber way hed said it ann had a doctors appointment is everything okay well see oh he hesitated a lump on her breast but it might just be a cyst the doctors doing a biopsy i took a tired breath ill say a prayer thanks before all this began that isnt something id have said that youd pray for somebody he asked the last few days i spoke to a couple of ministers and a very religious very decent lady i guess some of their attitudes wore off on me the trouble is i also learned about a man whose parents turned him into a monster lester dant you believe in him now oh i believe in him all right god help me another prayer payne said ill be starting home tomorrow ill phone as soon as i get back maybe youll have the results of the biopsy by then maybe paynes voice sank have a safe trip i murmured thanks and hung up please god keep his wife healthy i thought i lay on the bed and closed my eyes the draperies shut out the lateafternoon light i wanted to sleep forever please god i hope you didnt let kate and jason suffer i couldnt help thinking about the good and bad things that religion could do to people i couldnt help thinking about lester dant running from one church and showing up at another and the shock of the idea made me sit up i found myself standing excitedly thinking about what lester dant posing as my brother had told me more than a year earlier as i wandered from town to town i learned that an easy way to get a free meal was to show up at church socials after sundaymorning services jesus i thought he would have continued doing what worked hed have gone to another church in another small town payne had been right the pattern was there i just hadnt recognized it in a rush i arranged my computer and printer on a table next to the bed i unplugged the rooms phone from the wall and attached my own phone line connecting it to my computer then i turned on the computer and made adjustments to my internetaccess program so i could shift from aols denver phone number to one that it used in the loganville area the next thing i logged on to an internet geography site and printed a map for ohio along with ones for the surrounding states of michigan indiana kentucky west virginia and pennsylvania what i wanted was a list of towns dant would have avoided cities i was sure of it after the smothering closeness of having been imprisoned underground i imagined him recoiling from the congestion of cities the maps gave me hundreds of names too many to be of use but a start i made the list more practical by eliminating the names of towns that were on the extreme reaches of the other states i further reduced the list by eliminating indiana convinced that dant would have avoided going back to where hed been imprisoned that left ohio michigan to the north of it kentucky and west virginia to the south and pennsylvania to the east but the towns in them werent what i cared about what i wanted were the names of churches in those towns i typed churches in ohio into the internets search for box a list appeared complete with their locations and their web site addresses i matched them with the towns on my list i did the same with churches in kentucky west virginia pennsylvania and michigan i eliminated any church with a saints name in it certain that dant would have avoided catholic anglican and greek orthodox churches their theology and ritual would have been alien to him i need to identify protestant congregations i thought and then i can a loud knock on the door distracted me i jerked my head in that direction sunlight had long since faded from behind the draperies i looked at my watch almost seven hours had passed the hands were close to midnight the loud knock was repeated mr denning a mans voice asked when i stood my legs ached from having sat so long i went to the door squinted through the tiny lens and saw an elderly man in a jacket and tie i kept the security chain on the door when i opened it and peered through the fiveinch gap what is it the stark floodlights in the parking lot made me blink i just wanted to make sure that everything was all right our computer shows that youve been on the phone since around five oclock but when i tried to access the line to make sure you hadnt fallen asleep and left the phone off the hook all i got was static ive been catching up on office work the man looked puzzled on the internet i said pointing toward my computer on the corner table which i later realized he couldnt see the man looked more puzzled you have my creditcard number i said ill gladly pay all the phone charges as long as everythings okay couldnt be better have a nice night he left and i became aware of throbbing in my head of cramps in my stomach through the crack in the door i saw a harsh redandblue neon sign across the street the words it flashed were steaks n suds two eighteenwheeler trucks were at the edge of the crowded parking lot begrudging the time id be wasting but telling myself that i couldnt be any use to kate and jason if i didnt maintain my strength i disconnected from the internet locked the room behind me and walked toward country i jukebox playing something about a oneman woman and a twotiming mancoming from the restaurants open windows forty minutes later the steak sandwich id eaten felt heavy in my stomach i recalled the strict healthy diet that id put myself on in preparation for my search tomorrow ill rededicate myself i vowed tomorrow heres your coffee to go the waitress said thanks as i left the restaurant about to cross the parking lot a noise made me pause the jukebox had stopped but the conversations of the crowd inside were loud enough that i had to strain to listen harder on my right around the side of the restaurant i heard it again a groan a womans groan think you can leave me a mans muffled voice came from around the corner youre dumber than i always said you were i heard a metallic thump as if someone had fallen against a car another groan inside the jukebox started playing again something about lonely rooms and empty hearts the careful brad id once been would have gone back into the restaurant and told the manager to call the police but how long would it take the police to arrive and what would happen in the meantime imagining kate being punched i unzipped the fanny pack i always wore knowing that i could draw the pistol if i needed it i walked to the restaurants corner there were only a few windows on that side away from the glare of the neon lights my eyes needed a moment to adjust before i saw moving shadows between two parked cars a man striking a woman stop i said the man spun toward my voice the minimal light showed a beefy face a chain on his belt was attached to a big wallet in his back pocket this is a private conversation stay out of it he shoved the woman to the asphalt you dont want to live with me anymore well either you live with me or you dont live at all i told you to stop get lost pal or when i finish my family business ill start on you get lost you just said the two words i hate the most you heard me buddy the man jerked the woman to her feet and pushed her into a car when she tried to struggle out he struck her again but youre not hearing me conscious of the pistol in my fanny pack i stepped closer all right i gave you a chance to butt out the man spun toward me again now its your turn must be my lucky night he lunged the takeout coffee was in my left hand the liquid so hot that it stung my fingers through the styrofoam cup i yanked the lid from the cup and threw the steaming contents at the mans face aiming for his eyes the man shrieked and jerked his hands toward his scalded face i drove stiff fingers into his stomach just below the v of the rib cage the way id been taught sounding as if he might vomit the man doubled over i kicked sideways toward a nerve that ran down the outside of his left thigh paralyzed his leg gave out toppling him to the pavement where he shrieked harder from the pain in his leg i yanked his hands from his face and drove the heel of my right palm against his nose once twice three times cartilage cracked i stepped back as blood spurted he dropped to the pavement and lay motionless ready to hit him again i shoved him onto his side so the blood would drain from his nose i felt for a pulse found one smelled his sour alcoholsaturated breath and turned to the woman slumped in the car are you all right she moaned i was appalled by the bruises on her face are you strong enough to drive i asked i dont the woman was offbalance when i helped her from the car her lips were swollen yes she took a deep breath i think i can drive but do it behind me the man groaned hurry i said before he wakes up through blackened eyes the woman looked around in confusion bruises that deep couldnt develop in just a few minutes i knew they were the consequence of numerous other beatings drive she asked plaintively how i ran here i hoped i could borrow money from a girlfriend who works in this place it turns out she called in sick he was waiting instead stooping beside the man on the pavement i satisfied myself that he was still too dazed to realize what was going on i pulled his car keys from his pants then i took his big wallet from his back pocket and removed all the money he hadwhat looked like a hundred dollars here i told the woman i pulled out my own wallet and gave her most of the cash i hadaround two hundred i cant accept this she said my wife would have wanted me to give it to you what are you talking about take this please because of my wife the woman looked at me strangely as if trying to decipher a riddle i have a sister in baltimore she said as i gave her the mans car keys no its the first place hell look i said if youd robbed a bank would you hide at your sisters too obvious you have to pretend that youre running from the police but i havent done anything wrong keep telling yourself that you havent done anything wrong but that son of a bitch over there certainly has you have to keep reminding yourself that your only goal in life is to stay away from him in denver when life had been normal id been proud of the volunteer work kate had done as a stress counselor at a shelter for battered women i knew the drill pick a city where youve never been pittsburgh i chose it at random have you ever been to no then go to pittsburgh its only a couple of hundred miles from here leave the car at a bus station and go to pittsburgh look in the phone book under community services look for the number of the womens shelter i trembled in my motel room amazed by the rage that had overtaken me for a moment as the bastard had come at me id almost shot him the only thing that had stopped me was the realization that the shot would have sent people scurrying from the restaurant someone might have seen me the police would have come after me how could i have looked for kate and jason if i were in jail for reasons important to my family and me my email said im looking for information about a young man who might have come to your church in the late summer or in the fall nineteen years ago i realize that its hard to remember that far bach but i think that the circumstances would have been unusual enough that someone in your congregation would recall him the boy would have been in his midteens he would have collapsed against the front door of your church early before sunday services so that the first person to arrive would have found him there he would have been wearing torn clothes and would have had scrapes and scratches suggesting that hed been in an accident of some sort he wouldnt have been able to recall his name or what had happened to him or how he had come to be at your church members of the congregation would have taken care of him in particular womenbecause something about his eyes invites mothering he would have been able to quote the bible from memory but otherwise would have been unable to read or write someone probably a woman would have tried to teach him ultimately he would have stolen from the people who helped him perhaps have beaten them also and have fled town it may be that near the end heremembered that his name was lester dant if you have any knowledge of someone like this please send me an email at the above address i very much need to learn everything i can about this person a year ago he kidnapped my wife and son the next morning after a torturous sleep i sent that message to the email address of every church on my list staring at my computer screen i silently asked god to help me all i could do now was wait the need to urinate finally made me move but once in motion i remembered paynes remark that as long as i stayed in motion i was less likely to do something foolish to myself i went for a fivemile run i returned and checked to see if i had any email nothing i did an hour of exercises then checked my email again still nothing what did i expect that someone at each church would faithfully read the churchs email every morning that word of my message would spread instantly throughout each congregation that people who remembered something like the events id described would immediately send an email back to me i have to be patient i warned myself even in small towns news doesnt get around as fast as i want it to if theres a reply to be had i probably wont receive it until evening so i showered dressed and tried to read i went out and got a sandwich i took a walk i watched cnn but mostly i kept checking to see if any email had arrived none did by midnight i gave up shut off the lights and tried to sleep but unconsciousness wouldnt come and finally betraying my resolve of the previous night i went down the road to a bar and grill where i wasnt likely to be recognized if the man id beaten was looking for me the logical place hed do it was the restaurant across from the motel this time it took four beers and a shot of bourbon before i felt stupefied enough to go back to my room and try to sleep im going to hell i told myself i am in hell around dawn i woke but there still wasnt any message i faced another day of waiting time dragged on until i admitted that id been a fool to have hoped i hadnt been brave enough to identify with lester dant as closely as id needed to id been wrong in my prediction of where hed gone nineteen years previously and of what hed done when hed arrived there vowing that i couldnt persist in leading my life the way i was wondering if i wanted to lead my life at all i checked my email and tensed at the discovery of four messages i was certain that they didnt exist that id tricked myself into seeing things with a sense of unreality i stared at them unsteady i printed them out each was from a different state kentucky west virginia pennsylvania and ohio initially their sequence was alphabetic based on the senders name but after i reread them several times i arranged them so that they formed a geographical and chronological narrative mr denning the first began your message so disturbed me that it took me a long time to face up to answering it my husband told me not to pain myself but i cant bear the thought that other people have suffered the writer identified herself as mrs donald cavendish and the details of her message paralleled what mrs garner had told me if a rape had occurred mrs cavendish didnt mention it but i had a disturbing sense of a deeper hurt than even the strong facts of her message accounted for he hadnt called himself lester though he hadnt used any name at all the night that hed disappeared hed burned down their house this had happened in november a month after hed brutalized mrs garner what had occurred in the interval i checked my maps and found that the town in kentucky was two hundred miles from loganville ohio after lester spent the money that hed stolen from mrs garner had he wandered subsisting on the proceeds from house breakins and liquorstore robberies until his aimless path took him to kentucky the next message as i arranged them was from the neighboring state of west virginia and described events one year later when lester he used only his first name had been welcomed by a churchgoing family whose teenage daughter he eventually victimized it was the daughter who sent me the email revealing what shed hidden from her parents until she was an adult lester had warned her that if she told anyone what hed done hed come back one night and kill her to prove his point hed strangled her cat in front of her the next night hed robbed the house stolen the family car and disappeared the police had found the firegutted car two hundred miles away but although lester was gone it had taken the daughter a long time before shed stopped having nightmares about him the third message from pennsylvania described events a surprising eight years later hed shortened his first name to les his methods had changed in his midtwenties now he no longer had the air of vulnerability that had made it so easy to portray himself a victim and win the compassion of a smalltown congregation instead hed showed up at the church and offered to do odd jobs in exchange for meals his amazing ability to quote any bible passage from memory had endeared him to the congregation this time it was the church that hed burned but it was the fourth message that disturbed me most it was from a man who described events thirteen years after the fire in which lester dants parents had been killed it came from a town in central ohio this time when lester had disappeared hed taken the mans wife shed never been found but lester hadnt used his first name or its abbreviation les hed used an entirely different first name it turned me cold peter shivering to the core of my soul i stared at the maps and the placement of the towns from brockton southeast to loganville in ohio then farther southeast to the town in kentucky then east to west virginia then northeast to pennsylvania then northwest to the town in ohio a hundred miles from where i was raised in the middle of that state one month one year eight years thirteen years hed been to faroff places in the country during the intervals his fbi crime report made that clear but something kept making him return to this general area and i couldnt help feeling that the placement of towns on the maps wasnt random that it had a center that hed been skirting his ultimate destination each time getting closer drawn relentlessly back to where everything had begun part six it had been more than a quarter of a century since my mother and i had been forced to leave woodford to live with her parents in columbus payne had told me that the town was now a flourishing bedroom community for the encroaching city but i hadnt fully realized what that meant after i steered from the interstate following a newly paved road into town i tested my memory id been barely fourteen when mom and i had left even so from all the times that she and dad had taken petey and me to visit her parents i remembered that thered been a lot of farmland on the way to the interstate much of that was gone now replaced by subdivisions of large houses on small lots the panoramic outdoor view that owners had initially been attracted to had been obliterated by further development expensive landscaping compensated on what had once been the edge of town i passed the furniture factory where my dad had been a foreman it was now a restaurantmovie theatershopping mall complex the industrial exterior had been retained giving it a sense of local history downtowna grid of six blocks of storeslooked better than it had in my youth its adjoining twostory brick structures had been freshly sandblasted everything appearing new even though the buildings came from the early s one street had been blocked off and converted into a pedestrian mall trees and planters interspersed among outdoor cafes a fountain and a small bandstand the area was busy enough that it took me a while to find a parking spot my emotions pushed and pulled me when id been a kid downtown had seemed so big now the effect was the same but for different reasonshelplessness made me feel small despite the passage of years i managed to orient myself as i passed a comicbook store and an icecream shop neither of which had been in those places when i was a kid i came to the corner of lincoln and washington the names returned to me and stared at a shadowy doorway across the street it was between a bank and a drugstore businesses that had been in those places when i was a kid i remembered because of all the times my mother had walked petey and me to that doorway and had taken us up the narrow echoing stairway to our least favorite place in the world the dentists office that stairway had seemed towering and ominous when id climbed it in my youth now trying to calm myself i counted each of its thirty steps as i went up at the top i stood under a skylight another change and faced the same frostedglass door that had led into the dentist except that the name on the door was now cosgrove insurance agency a young woman with her hair pulled back looked up from stapling documents together yes sir i when i was a kid this used to be a dentists office i couldnt help looking past the receptionist toward the corridor that had led to the chamber of horrors she looked puzzled yes he has some dental records i need but i dont know how to get in touch with him because ive forgotten his name im afraid im not the person to ask i started working for mr cosgrove only six months ago and i never heard anything about a dentists office perhaps mr cosgrove would know she went down the hallway to the office that id dreaded and came back in less than a minute he says hes been here eight years before then this was a realtors office oh sorry sure something sank in me i guess it was too much to hope for discouraged i turned toward the door then stopped with a sudden thought a realtor excuse me you said a realtor used to be in this office yes she was looking at me now as if id become a nuisance does he or she manage properties do you suppose what assuming that mr cosgrove doesnt own this building whos his landlord you mean the dwyer building the bantamweight man in a bow tie stubbed out a cigarette his desk was flanked on three sides by tall filing cabinets ive been managing it for mr dwyers heirs the past twenty years the office mr cosgrove is in unittwoc can you tell me who rented it back then im looking for the name of a dentist who used to be there why on earth would you want some dental records if its a nuisance for you to look it up ill gladly pay you a service fee nuisance hell its the easiest thing in the world the secret to managing property is being organized he pivoted in his swivel chair and pushed its rollers toward a filing cabinet on his right that was marked d dwyer building he searched through files here he sorted through papers in it sure i remember now dr raymond faraday he had a heart attack eighteen years ago died in the middle of giving somebody a root canal after what id been through the grotesqueness of his death somehow didnt seem unusual did he have any relatives here are they still in town havent the faintest idea but check this phone book a long time ago dr raymond faraday im trying to find a relative of his back at my car i was using my cell phone thered been only two faradays in the book this was my second try my husbands his son a suspicioussounding woman said franks at work now whats this got to do with his father i straightened when my brother and i were kids dr faraday was our dentist its very important that i get my brothers dental x rays to identify him your brothers dead yes im so sorry it would be very helpful if you could tell me what happened to the records his patients took their records with them when they chose a new dentist but what about patients who hadnt been his clients for a while my brother and i had stopped going to dr faraday several years earlier didnt your parents transfer the records to your new dentist no i remembered bitterly that after my father had died in the car accident and it turned out that his lifeinsurance policy had lapsed my mother hadnt been able to afford things like taking me to a dentist the woman exhaled as if annoyed about something i have no idea what my husband did with the old records youll have to ask him when he gets home from the office the baseball field hadnt changed as the lowering sun cast my shadow i stood at the bicycle rack where my friends and i had chained and locked our bikes so long ago behind me the bleachers along the thirdbase line were crowded with parents yelling encouragement to kids playing what looked like a little league game i heard the crack of a ball off a bat cheers howls of disappointment other cheers i assumed that a fly ball seemingly a home run had been caught but i kept my gaze on the bicycles remembering how petey had used a clothespin to attach a playing card to the front fender of his bike and how it had created a clackclackclackclack sound against the spokes when the wheel turned it pained me that i couldnt remember the names of the two friends id been with and for whom id destroyed peteys life but i certainly remembered the gist of what wed said for crissake brad your little brothers getting on my nerves tell him to beat it would ya yeah he tags along everywhere im tired of the little squirt the friggin noise his bike makes drives me nuts hes just hanging around he doesnt mean anything bull how do you think my mom found out i was smoking if he didnt tell your mom we dont know for sure he told my mom then who did tell her the goddamn tooth fairy all right all right petey had nearly bumped into me when id turned id thought about that moment so often and so painfully that it was seared into my memory hed been short even for nine and hed looked even shorter because of his droopy jeans his baseball glove had been too big for his hand sorry petey you have to go home but youre just too little youd hold up the game his eyes had glistened with the threat of tears to my later shame id worried about what my friends would think if my kid brother started crying around them i mean it petey bug off go home watch cartoons or something his chin had quivered petey im telling you go scram get lost my friends had run toward where the other kids were choosing sides for the game as id rushed to join them id heard the clachclackdack of peteys bike id looked back toward where the little guy was pedaling away his head was down standing now by the bicycle rack remembering how things had been wishing with all my heart that i could return to that moment and tell my friends that they were jerks that petey was going to stay with me i wept unlike the baseball field the house had changed a great deal in fact the whole street had the trees were taller to be expected and there were more of them as well as more shrubs and hedges but those changes werent what struck me in my youth the neighborhood had been all singlestory ranch houses modest homes for people who worked at the factory where my dad had been a foreman but now second stories had been added to several of the houses or rooms had been added to the back taking away most of the rear yards both changes had occurred to the house id lived in the front porch had been enclosed to add space to the living room the freestanding singlecar garage at the end of the driveway had been rebuilt into a doublecar garage with stairs leading up to a room parking across the street seeing the red of the setting sun reflected off the houses windows i was so startled by the change that i wondered if id made a mistake maybe i wasnt on the right street but the sign had clearly said locust or maybe this wasnt the right house but the number was fixed vertically next to the front door just as it had been in my youth i felt absolutely no identification with the place in my memory i saw a different simpler house the one from which my dad and i had hurried that evening scrambling into his car rushing toward the baseball diamond in hopes of finding petey loitering along the way a wary man from the property next door came out and frowned at me as if to say what are you staring at i put the car in gear as i drove away i noticed half a dozen for sale signs remembering that in the old days everyone on the street had been so dependent on the furniture factory that no one had ever moved mr faraday had thin lips and pinched cheeks my wife says your brother died or something yes thats why you need the dental records to identify him he disappeared a long time ago now we might have found him his body yes well if it wasnt something important like that i wouldnt go to the trouble faraday motioned me into the house i heard a television from the living room as he opened a door halfway along the corridor to the kitchen the quick impression i got was of excessive neatness everything in its place plastic covers on chair arms in the living room pots on hooks in the kitchen lids above them everything arranged by size cool air rose from the open cellar door faraday flicked a light switch and gestured for me to follow our descending footsteps thumped on sturdy wooden stairs id never seen a basement so carefully organized it was filled with boxes stacked in rows that formed minicorridors but there wasnt the slightest sense of clutter and chaos two fans whirred from dehumidifiers at each end of the basement i cant get rid of the dampness down here faraday said he took me along one of the minicorridors turned left and came to a corner where he lifted boxes off a footlocker what can i do to help i asked nothing i dont want to get things mixed up he raised the lid on the locker revealing bundles of documents my wife complains about all the stuff i save but how do i know what i might need later on faraday pointed toward a stack of boxes farther along all my tax returns he pointed toward another stack of boxes the bills ive paid and this stuff he indicated the documents in the locker my fathers business records the ones i could find anyway he sorted through the bundles and came up with a stack of file folders what was your brothers name peter denning denning lets see denning denning ann brad nicholas peter here his voice was filled with satisfaction as he held out the file i tried to keep my hand steady when i took it what about these others do you want yours who are ann and nicholas my parents i felt heavy in my chest yes if its okay with you ill take them all my wifell be thrilled to see me getting rid of some of this stuff by the time i got back to the car dusk had set in i had to switch on the interior lights so i could see to search through peteys file no longer able to keep my hand from trembling i pulled out a set of x rays id never touched anything so valuable back in denver when id gone to the dentist to get a copy of the x rays hed taken of the man who claimed to be my brother id made sure to get a duplicate set in case the fbi lost the ones i gave them or in case i needed copies in my search now i could barely wait to get to a motel driving to the outskirts of town i picked the first one i saw that had a vacancy after checking in i rushed to my room too hurried to bring everything from my car except my suitcase which i yanked open pulling out the x rays from denver a childs teeth and an adults have major differences which made it difficult to tell if these x rays came from the same person for one thing when petey had been kidnapped some of his permanent teeth would not yet have grown in but some of them would have my dentist had said look at the roots hed said on a particular tooth are there three roots or four four are less common do the roots grow in any unusual directions with the adults x rays in my left hand and the childs in my right i held them up to my bedside lamp but its shade blocked much of the illumination i almost took off the shade before i thought of the bathroom and the bright lights that motels often have there hurrying past the bed i found that this particular motel had a large mirror in front of a makeup area when i jabbed the light switch i blinked from the sudden glare above the mirror after raising both sets of x rays to the fluorescent lights i shifted my gaze quickly back and forth between them desperate to find differences or similarities frantic to learn the truth the childs teeth looked so pathetically tiny i imagined peteys frightened helplessness as he was grabbed the adults whose were they slowly i understood what i was looking at as the implications swept over me as the various pieces of information that id found began fitting into place i lowered the x rays i drooped my head god help kate and jason i prayed god help us all an organ blared as i opened the churchs front door a solemn hymn i didnt recognize to the right of the vestibule stairs led up to the choir loft they creaked as i climbed them it was shortly after noon id been to eleven protestant churches before this one with only six more to go i was losing hope the choir loft was shadowy except for a light above the organ as the minister finished the hymn in the gathering silence my echoing footsteps made him turn sorry to bother you reverend i walked nearer holding out the photograph the secretary at your office said that you were almost done getting ready for choir practice im trying to find this man i wonder if you recognize him puzzled the minister took the photograph pushed his glasses back on his nose and studied it a long moment later he nodded possibly i tried not to show a reaction even so my heart hammered so loudly that i was sure the minister could hear it the intensity of the eyes is the same the minister put the photograph under the organs light but the man im thinking of has a beard he pointed toward my own beard id been right hed grown a beard to hide his scar perhaps if you put your hand over the lower part of his face i tried to sound calm despite the tension that squeezed my throat the minister did so yes i know this man he looked suspicious why do you want to find him im his brother i managed to keep my hand steady as i shook hands with the minister brad denning no youre mistaken excuse me denning isnt petes last name its benedict i didnt know what struck me more that petey was using his own first name or that hed taken the last name of the minister whod wanted to adopt him after the fire my stomach soured so he still wont use the family name the minister frowned what do you mean my heart pounded harder we used to live around here but a long time ago pete and i had a fallingout one of those family arguments that cause such bad feelings it splits the family apart the minister nodded evidently familiar with what that kind of argument had done to some families in his congregation we havent spoken to each other in years but recently i heard that hed come back to town this was the church we used to go to so i thought someone here might have seen him you want to be reconciled with him with everything thats in me reverend but i dont know where he is i havent seen him since the minister thought about it last july when mrs warren died of course he was at the funeral and before that the last time i saw him was oh probably two years im not even sure hes in town any longer mrs warren she was one of the most faithful in the congregation only missed one service that i can remember when pete showed up two years ago and volunteered to do handiwork for the church for free mrs warren took a liking to him she was amazed by how completely he could quote scripture tried to trick him several times but he always won that was my dads doing teaching pete the good book well your father certainly did an excellent job mrs warren finally offered him a handymans job on her property our loss her gain when she missed that service i mentioned i was convinced she must be sick so i telephoned her and i was rightshe had a touch of the flu the next time she came to church pete wasnt with her she told me that hed decided to move on yeah pete was always like that but you say he was here for her funeral evidently hed come back and was working as her handyman again in fact the way i hear it she left her place to him her place well she was elderly her husband was dead so were her two children i suppose she thought of pete as the closest thing she had to family sounds like a kind old lady generous to a fault and over the years as she sold off portions of the farm her husband had workedit was the only way for her to survive after her husband diedshe made sure to let eighty acres around her house go wild for a game preserve believe me the way this towns expanding we could use more people like mrs warren to preserve the countryside reverend id appreciate two favors yes he looked curious from behind his glasses the first is if you see pete before i do for heavens sake dont tell him that weve spoken if he knows im trying to see him im afraid hell get so upset that he might leave town your argument was that serious worse than you can imagine i have to approach him in the right way and at the right time whats the second favor you want how do i find mrs warrens place two miles along a country road south of town i reached a t intersection i steered to the left and as the minister had described the paved road became gravel my tires threw up dust that floated in my rearview mirror tense i stared ahead hoping that i wouldnt see a car or a truck coming toward me the countryside was slightly hilly and at the top of each rise i was afraid that id suddenly come upon an approaching vehicle and that hed be driving it maybe he wouldnt pay attention a quick glimpse of another driver but maybe he paid attention to everything or maybe he wouldnt recognize me with my beard but if he did or if he recognized kates volvo jesus why hadnt i thought to bring another car id lose my chance of surprising him id have even less chance of finding kate and jason sweating my shirt sticking to my chest i saw the expanse of thick timber and undergrowth that the minister had said would be on my left i passed a mailbox a closed gate and a lane that disappeared into the forest mrs warrens house was back there the minister had said where she could watch the deer the squirrels the raccoons and the rest of what shed called gods children roaming around the property relieved that i hadnt seen anybody and hence that no one had seen me i kept driving more dust rising behind me at the same time i couldnt help worrying that the reason i hadnt seen any activity was that petey wasnt there that hed moved on petey yes each x ray had shown a particular tooth with four roots that grew in distinctive directions the childs had been smaller and less pronounced than the mans nonetheless it hadnt been difficult to see that one had evolved into the other not that id relied on my opinion before going to the various churches id made sure to be at a dentists office when it opened with cash id gotten from a local bank id paid the dentist a hundred dollars to examine the x rays before he attended to his scheduled patients hed agreed with me man and boythe x rays had belonged to the same person so there it was the man whod claimed to be my brother had told the truth the fbi had been wrong lester dant hadnt assumed peteys identity petey had assumed lesters but that disturbing discovery settled nothing the reverse it prompted far more unnerving questions to threaten my sanity this was clear after petey had tricked the police into thinking that he was heading west through montana hed taken kate and jason in the reverse directionback to woodford because he no longer had to lay a false trail by abandoning vehicles that hed carjacked it wouldnt have been hard to avoid capture all he had to do was carjack a vehicle that had a license for a distant state the driver wouldnt have been expected for several days by the time he or she was reported missing petey would have reached mrs warrens property and hidden the car meanwhile hed have switched license plates several times and hidden the car owners body somewhere along the interstate mrs warren petey had been confident that he could intimidate her because thats what hed done a year earlier at the church where id learned about petey and mrs warren the minister had mentioned that petey was mrs warrens handyman that she never missed sunday service except for an uncharacteristic absence one sunday two years earlier one year before petey took kate and jason from me petey must have done something so dismaying to mrs warren that she found it impossible to go to church that sunday when the minister phoned her certain that only something dire would have kept her away shed claimed that she had the flu the next sunday shed been in church again meanwhile shed said petey had left the area the ministers phone call had probably saved mrs warrens life his concern for her must have made petey think that the minister was suspicious must have driven petey away but when mrs warren felt safe why hadnt she confessed the horrors that had happened out there the answer wasnt hard to figure like mrs garner in loganville shed been ashamed to let the other church members know what petey had done to her whats more petey had no doubt terrified her with a threat to return and punish her if she caused trouble for him maybe she started feeling secure again but then to her fright petey came back a year later he might have found a way to hide kate and jason from her no matterher torment resumed he intimidated her severely enough to make her put him in her will he feels like a son to me shed have been forced to tell her lawyer coached to sound convincing petey would have stood next to her in the lawyers office when she signed the document a reminder of his warning that if she turned against him hed make sure that she spent her remaining years in agony then hed have kept her a prisoner at the house while he dropped a word here and there among the congregation that she hadnt been feeling well lately that way people would have been prepared when she died after all as the minister had said mrs warren was elderly maybe one night she passed away in her sleepwith help from a pillow pressed over her face as i sped back to town i used my cell phone to call special agent gader but his receptionist told me that he wouldnt be in the office for a couple of days i phoned paynes office but got a recording that said he wouldnt be in the office for the rest of the week i had a hollow feeling in the pit of my stomach that told me his wifes biopsy hadnt been good that left getting in touch with the local police but when i parked outside the station the same brick building from years ago i had a disturbing image of policemen piling into squad cars and rushing out to mrs warrens i feared that their arrival would be so obvious that if petey was in that house hed notice them coming and escape out the back i might never learn what hed done with kate and jason even if the police did manage to capture him suppose he refused to answer questions suppose he denied knowing anything about where kate and jason were hidden if they were still alive they might starve or suffocate while he remained silent think it through i warned myself i needed more information i couldnt trust the police to go after him until i knew exactly how they should do it the pilot said something that i couldnt quite hear amid the drone of the singleengine plane i turned to her excuse me i said woodfords over there i glanced to the right toward where she pointed the sprawl of low buildings old and new stretched toward the interstate she put so much meaning into the statement that i shook my head from side to side i dont understand you told me you wanted to see how the old hometown looked from the air more or less seems like less youve barely looked in that direction what youre interested in are those farms up ahead we flew closer to the eightyacre section of woods and underbrush although the day was sunny there was a touch of wind once in a while the plane dipped slightly youre a developer arent you what weve had our share of development the last five years seems like every time i look theres a new subdivision it was an easier explanation than the truth yeah too much change can be overwhelming i stared down at the large dense section of trees i saw the lane leading into it from the gravel road i saw a clearing about a hundred yards into it where a brick house was surrounded by grass and gardens id bought one of those pocket cameras that had a zoom lens now i pulled it out and started taking photographs back in my motel room i spread out the eightbytens on a table id paid a photographer to stay open after hours and process them now it was after dark my eyes ached to help keep me alert i turned on the televisioncnnand as an announcer droned in the background i picked up a magnifying glass and leaned down over the photographs they were slightly blurred from the planes vibration nonetheless they showed me what i needed one thing was immediately obvious no one would have noticed it at ground level where the front sides and back of the house couldnt be viewed simultaneously but when seen from above the grass and gardens in back of the house looked different from those at the sides and the front they seemed to have had work done on them recently the area seemed slightly lower than the others sunken i wondered as when ground settles after its been dug up and then refilled in the background the cnn announcer explained that a distraught man with a gun was holding his exwife and his daughter prisoner in a house in los angeles a police swat team surrounded it with greater intensity i stared through the magnifying glass at the photos confirming that a section of grass and garden in back of the house did appear slightly lower than what was around it i noticed a blue pickup truck parked next to the house i studied a stream that wound through the middle of the woods in back but what i kept returning to was that area behind the house the grass seemed greener there the bushes fuller as if they were getting more attention than those at the front and the sides i set down the magnifying glass and tried to calm myself there was nothing sinister about relandscaping the police would say a blighted lawn and old bushes had been replaced with healthy ones but what if the lawn and bushes had been replaced because something had been built under them on the television behind me the announcer reported that the hostage situation had ended badly as the police tightened their circle around the building the man had shot his daughter and his exwife then pulled the trigger on himself i stared at the television when id driven past mrs warrens property id made the mistake of using kates volvo petey might have recognized it this time i drove only to the outskirts of town where i left the car among others at a shopping mall i put on my knapsack and hiked into the countryside as in most midwestern farm communities the road system was laid out in a grid that contained squares or rectangles of land avoiding the road that fronted mrs warrens property i took an indirect route that added several miles coming at the wooded eighty acres from the road behind under a bright hot sun i hiked past fields past cattle grazing past farmers tending their crops i adjusted my baseball cap and moved my fanny pack to a more comfortable spot on my waist trying to look as if i didnt have a care in the world that i was merely out for a pleasant day of walking in truth i wanted desperately to run the adrenaline burning through me needed exertion to keep it controlled if i didnt do something to vent the pressure swelling inside me i feared id go crazy to my right across a field the woods got larger nearer kate and jason theyre alive i told myself they have to be worried about being noticed crossing the field toward the woods i waited until a car went by and there wasnt any other traffic the stream that id seen in the photographs crossed the field and went under the road i climbed down to it its banks were high enough that i was out of view as i walked next to the water in contrast with the stark sun the air was cool down there after five minutes the stream entered the trees i ducked under a fence climbed the slippery bank and found myself among maples oaks and elms the noise i made in the undergrowth troubled me but who would hear me petey wasnt going to be patrolling his fences guarding his property against intruders the logical place for him to be was at the house or maybe hed be off somewhere committing god knew what crimes the forest cast a shadow a spongy layer of dead leaves smelled damp and moldy i wiped my sweatgritted face took off my knapsack and pulled out a holster that id bought that morning it was attached to the right side of a sturdy belt my spare fifteenround magazine was in a pouch to the left along with two other newly purchased magazines a hunting knife went next to it and a fiveinch long thumbwidth flashlight called surefire which the clerk in the gun shop had shown me was surprisingly powerful for its size i took the pistol from my fanny pack and shoved it into the holster the weight of the equipment dug into my waist thirsty from nervousness i sipped water from one of three canteens in the knapsack i ate a stick of beef jerky and several handfuls of mixed peanuts and raisins uneasiness made me urinate then i put on the knapsack and pulled a compass from my shirt pocket unlike a year ago id taken the time to learn how to use it remembering the photographs estimating the angle that i needed to follow in order to reach the house i took a southeast direction making my way through the trees all the while i listened for suspicious noises in the forest the scrape of a branch might have been petey creeping toward me but it turned out to be a squirrel racing up a tree the snap of a twig startled me until i realized that it was a rabbit bounding away birds fluttered wary i scanned the undergrowth studied my compass again and moved cautiously forward the next time i stopped to get a drink i checked my watch surprised to find that what had seemed like thirty minutes had actually been two hours the air felt thicker sweat stuck my shirt and jeans to me i took another step and immediately dropped to a crouch seeing where the trees thinned on my stomach i squirmed through the undergrowth the moldy smell of the earth widening my nostrils i crawled slowly trying not to move bushes and reveal my position from having designed homes for wealthy clients i was familiar with intrusion detectors i watched for anything ahead of me motion sensors on posts or a wire that might be attached to a vibration detector nothing struck me as unusual in fact now that i thought about it an intrusion detector would be useless in the woods the animals roaming about would trigger it animals i suddenly realized that for a while i hadnt noticed any animals nor a single bird the sense of barrenness reminded me of what id felt at the dant farm snakes i studied the ground ahead of me nothing rippled taking a deep breath i squirmed forward the trees became more sparse the bushes less thick peering through low branches i saw a clearing a lawn a flower garden in the middle was the redbrick house id come at it from its right side the twoandahalfstory wall had ivy white wooden lawn furniture and a brightly colored miniature windmill decorated the lawn i took binoculars from my knapsack and made sure that the sun wasnt at an angle that would cause a reflection off the lenses then i focused them and studied the downstairs and upstairs windows all had lace curtains nothing moved beyond them in the photographs id taken the pickup truck had been parked on the opposite side of the house so to find out if it was still there id have to crawl around to that side i stayed as flat as possible while i shifted through the undergrowth when i came within view of the back of the house i still didnt see movement in any of the windows i stared at the open area behind the house which from ground level seemed to have a natural slope its slightly sunken outline no longer apparent an unsuspecting visitor would have noticed nothing unusual about it except that the lawn and gardens were attractive if there was indeed a room beneath it i assumed that petey watered and fertilized that area frequently to compensate for the shallow roots that the underground structure would cause if so today wasnt his day to work in the garden he wasnt in sight the place seemed abandoned i dared to hope that id gotten lucky that he wasnt home but as i crept through the bushes toward the other side of the house my stomach soured when i saw the pickup truck where it had been the previous afternoon angry i continued through the undergrowth on that side of the house coming to a view of the front where a roofed porch had a rocking chair and a hammock homey and inviting but no one was visible there either and i retreated to a sheltered spot that gave me a view of the side part of the back part of the front and all of the truck bushes enclosed me i eased out of my knapsack sipped from one of the canteens ate more beef jerky peanuts and raisins and waited hours later i was still waiting the sun eased below the trees seeing a light come on in a downstairs window i felt my muscles compact then a light came on in an adjacent room and another farther over i strained to see movement through the curtains but the house continued to seem deserted for all i knew the lights were controlled by timers when an upstairs light came on and a shadow moved past a window i held my breath for a moment a mans shadow i was certain of it id caught only a glimpse but the broad shoulders and forceful stride obviously didnt belong to a female several seconds later the shadow appeared downstairs going from one room to another raising my binoculars i strained to see through the windows and suddenly focused on a man with a beard his face was toward me for only a few seconds before he went through an archway into the kitchen but a few seconds were all i needed regardless of the beard i couldnt fail to recognize him even through binoculars the solid shoulders and the intense eyes were unmistakable the man was petey go home id told him after a lifetime of being lost hed done exactly that hed come back to woodford did he ever drive by the house where we used to live did he ever go to the baseball field and remember that afternoon brooding about how different his life would have been if i hadnt preferred my friends over him and sent him away from that baseball game stop thinking like that i warned myself get control guilt and regret werent going to change the past they were a weakness they could get me killed they could get kate and jason killed petey wasnt my brother any longer he was my enemy my impulse was to crawl from my hiding place reach the window wait for him to step into view again and shoot but what if i missed my hand was shaking enough to throw off my aim or what if petey noticed me outside the window before i could pull the trigger suppose he ducked out of sight and used kate and jason as hostages or what if i did manage to shoot him but kate and jason werent where i suspected they were shoot to wound him how did i know the wound wouldnt be more serious than i intended petey might die before i could question him id have lost the chance to find kate and jason stay put think it through i warned myself if i make a wrong move itll be the same thing i was afraid the police would do i had to keep watching the house i needed to get a sense of his patterns when i phoned the police it had to be at the right time when the situation was in my favor sure and when the hell will that be i wondered in the darkness the air was damp and chill making me pull a woolen shirt from the knapsack and put it on it didnt warm me as peteys indistinct shape prepared food in the kitchen i told myself that i should eat also but i didnt have any appetite acid burned my stomach eat i told myself i forced a chunk of beef jerky into my mouth and reluctantly chewed the side dish was another handful of nuts and raisins the dessert dehydrated apples i had thought about bringing sandwiches but id been worried that they would spoil and make me ill after all i had no idea how long id have to stay in the woods and watch the house that was why id brought three canteens of water determined to conserve it i took only a few sips to help me swallow the dehydrated apples how long would the police have been willing to hide like this i wondered theyd have swatted at the mosquitoes buzzing around them theyd have felt the cold seeping through their clothes the dampness sticking their pants to their legs theyd have thought about hot coffee and a warm bed someone to share it with theyd soon have lost their patience and stormed the house i buttoned the woolen shirt all the way to my neck but still felt a chill raising the binoculars again i stared through a window through an archway toward the kitchen which was on the far side of the house there petey continued to prepare food eventually his silhouette disappeared my muscles cramped from not having moved in quite a while my arms and neck ached from keeping the binoculars raised minutes passed i checked the luminous dial on my watch a quarter of an hour became half an hour when a full hour had passed i couldnt ignore the pressure in my bladder i crawled back from where i was hiding stopped among trees and urinated close to the ground doing my best to make as little noise as possible the moment i returned through the bushes the light went out in the kitchen i tensed watching peteys shadow move from room to room downstairs turning off the lights a minute later one of the upstairs lights went off also i spent an hour gazing at the remaining upstairs light then it too went out the sky was overcast hiding the stars the house remained dark i hugged myself trying to keep warm my eyelids grew heavy i fought to keep them open turning from the house toward the murky lawn and garden in back under which i was certain kate and jason were imprisoned so close have to get to them have to my eyelids fluttered shut i sank to the ground and drifted into sleep a door banged jolting me from a nightmare of being whipped my eyes snapped open i jerked my head up enough to be able to see through low bushes toward the house the clouds had passed the sun was behind me glinting off windows across from me the reflection stabbed my eyes aggravating a headache a breeze from the day before had strengthened ruffling bushes the movement of the leaves around me must have been the source of my nightmare about being whipped i stared toward the back of the house where id heard the door bang petey came into view he wore a light green shirt which contrasted with his dark beard i recognized the shirt it was one that hed stolen from me a year earlier the wind tousled his thick dark hair he peered around assessing the woods then pulled a hose from a hook on the wall and went over to the area behind the house watering several bushes he confirmed my suspicion that something beneath the ground caused shallow roots in need of frequent care the wind sometimes sprayed the water back at him eventually annoying him enough that he dropped the hose went to the back wall to shut off the water and returned to the house the suns reflection off windows prevented me from seeing what he was doing inside after a half hour the wind had parched my lips so much that i reached for a canteen only to stop when i heard another door bang this one at the front petey came onto the porch hed changed his spraysoaked green shirt for a gray one it too had belonged to me he raised his head almost as if he was sniffing the breeze thats what my brother had become an animal assessing if there was danger because of me stop thinking that way i again warned myself he came down the porch steps and rounded the house making my pulse quicken when he got into the truck and fastened his seat belt the truck was faced in my direction but away from the suns glare so that i saw his beard and his stark eyes through the windshield before he made a uturn dust blew as he drove down the lane the blue of the truck soon vanishing among the windswept trees for a moment i was sure that my mind had played a trick on me had i actually seen what i most wanted to see was the sound of the truck actually diminishing in the distance for several long minutes i didnt move perhaps petey had only gone to check the mailbox at the road and would soon be coming back or perhaps he had somehow suspected that someone was watching the house and had driven away in order to lure an intruder into the open as soon as i started toward the house would he shoot me from where hed sneaked back and was watching from the trees the sun rose higher the wind grew stronger buffeting the bushes i hid among but it didnt cool me instead the morning seemed unduly warm sweat dried immediately on my dustcaked cheeks nervous i checked my watch and saw that fifteen minutes had passed if petey had merely gone to the mailbox hed have been back by now i told myself i scanned the woods where the driveway disappeared into them but the wind kept shifting the leaves and prevented me from noticing any movement where he might be hiding watching for an intruder i stared toward the bushes behind the house the police use the cell phone i thought but as i reached for it i worried that if petey was watching from another part of the forest hed hear me instead of muffling what i said the wind might carry my voice directly to him or what if petey wasnt alone what if someone else was in the house and would hear my voice as i used the phone to prevent that from happening id have to retreat several hundred yards into the forest before i felt safe using the phone but that would mean losing sight of the farmhouse and there was no telling what might happen while i was away the sun rose higher no longer reflecting off the windows nothing moved beyond them last night id seen no other silhouette only peteys was it safe to assume that he was alone the police wouldnt be able to get here in time before he got back damn it this might be my only chance i crawled through the undergrowth toward the back of the house if petey was watching from the trees in front he wouldnt be able to see me approach from the rear squirming through low branches i came to the edge of the clearing i checked again for any movement behind the lace curtains then i drew my pistol and hurried into the open the wind tried to push me back i reached a lilac bush used it for cover then darted toward a grape arbor which screened me while i studied the house a final time i sprinted to the back wall and pressed against its sunwarmed bricks steps rose to the back door at the top i raised my head warily to peer through a window beyond gauzy curtains i had an indistinct view of a kitchen cupboards a sink and a stove on the right an archway and a refrigerator on the left a small table was in the middle a single chair suggested that petey lived by himself what i started worrying about now was that petey might have a dog a pit bull for example trained not to show itself until an intruder entered the house at which time the dog would tear the intruder apart it would make sense for petey to have one but the more i thought about it the more i doubted that he did id been watching the house for over twelve hours and petey hadnt let a dog out to relieve itself true petey might have done so while i was asleep but wouldnt the dog have picked up my scent and attacked me and unless petey was superscrupulous about cleaning up after his dog wouldnt i have seen dog droppings on the lawn besides a dog locked in the house would limit peteys ability to stay away for periods of time he could leave food for kate and jason in their prison but it would be harder to leave enough for a big dog to survive for any length of time and that didnt take into consideration the mess that the dog would make in the house no i was increasingly convinced that petey didnt have a dog but on the offchance that he did i prepared to shoot it i tried the back door no surpriseit was locked i was going to have to smash the window reach through and open the lock from the other side i changed my position so that i could look down through the window and see the area above the doorknob the handle of a lock came into view after i smashed the window all i needed to do was reach through twist the locks handle and maybe only an architect or somebody in construction would have been bothered the lock was a deadbolt a type that i recommended on the outside the only way to get in was to use a key but on the inside there could be two ways to open the lock depending on how it was installed if there wasnt a window through which an intruder could reach a handle on the lock was both convenient and safe but in the case of a window the secure way to install the lock was to use another key arrangement rather than a lock with a handle that way even if an intruder broke the window and reached through he couldnt free the lock unless he had a key so did it make sense for petey to have a superior lock and an inferior installation granted mrs warren might have been the one whod had the lock put in but would petey with every reason to be cautious have ignored the security lapse i doubted it as i brooded about the problem something else troubled me the door had been installed so that it opened toward the cupboards on the right rather than toward an open space on the left an inconvenient arrangement that prevented the door from being opened to its full range and that risked damaging the cupboards if the door was opened forcefully nervous i used the butt of my pistol to smash the window with the barrel of the pistol i carefully pulled the curtains toward me once they were outside the window i yanked them loose gaining a clear view of the kitchen at least of the parts that i could see i went back down the steps exposing myself to the wind i found a dead branch on a shrub broke it free and snapped off the twigs i wanted a dead branch rather than a live one because i needed the branch to be stiff i climbed the steps again and peered down through the gap in the window careful not to show my head or hands i put the branch through the broken window and pressed down on one side of the locks handle which was horizontal rather than round and thus could be manipulated with the stick moving the lock made a scraping sound ready with my pistol i turned the doorknob stayed where i was and pushed inward the shocking blast made me flinch as a teninch jagged hole appeared in the opened door my ears hurt as if theyd been slapped the stench of gunpowder widened my nostrils taking a deep breath to steady myself i inched my head forward and peered cautiously through the doorway to the left i saw a pantry area where hinges on a doorjamb showed that a door had been taken off in the pantry a shotgun had been mounted to a worktable a strong cord had been attached to its trigger the cord went around a pulley behind the shotgun then up to another pulley and finally overhead to a metal hook at the top of the door on the inside the tension on the cord had been adjusted so that the shotgun would go off only when the door was opened a certain distance allowing for the intruder to show himself before the shotgun detonated the massive hole in the door made me wonder what the blast would have done to my midsection sickened i warned myself not to get distracted i still couldnt be sure that petey didnt have a dog uneasy i aimed toward the only other entrance to the kitchen the archway on the left the ringing in my ears prevented me from hearing anything else i saw no movement i stepped into the house the wind strengthened when i shut the door the gusts came through the broken window and the jagged hole beneath it as urgent as i felt i moved slowly when i passed the kitchen table my architects training again warned me about something the archway on the left was the only other entrance to the kitchen that didnt make sense there should have also been a door straight ahead that would give easy access to what i assumed were stairs in front leading up to the second story the way the rooms on the ground floor were laid out someone coming down from the second story had to take an indirect route from the front hall through the rooms on the other side of the house and finally into the kitchen mrs warren who was elderly wouldnt have tolerated the inconvenience the wall straight ahead wasnt being used for anything it would have been easy and logical to install a door there why hadnt it been done maybe there had been a door in that wall at one time i thought i stepped closer noticing a slight difference between the top molding on the wall in front of me as opposed to the molding on the wall to my left the white paint on the wall ahead of me looked slightly brighter than the white paint to my left the plaster felt smoother someone had put a new wall over the doorway preventing access to the front hall had petey done it why even for a young man the indirect route into the kitchen would be a nuisance why had he deliberately wanted it the only answer i could think of was that petey had blocked the other door because he wanted to force an intruder to go the long way through the house hed set other traps of course the kitchen didnt have a door that led down to the basement the entrance to it must be in the front hall but to reach it an intruder would have to go through the other rooms as the wind howled i stared through the archway toward the room on my left i noticed a broom next to the refrigerator and waved it through the archway moving it up and down and from side to side checking that there werent any other triggering devices electronic beams for example linked to weapons nothing happened i pressed the hard end of the broom onto a carpet that led through the archway the floor was solid i entered the dining room scanned its long table chairs and sideboard saw no obvious further traps and stepped toward another archway through it i could see old padded chairs and a sofa in what mrs warren would probably have called the parlor i tested another section of carpet and stepped toward the front room crack the floor gave way my stomach surged toward my heart plummeting i lurched forward slamming my chest against the edge of the trapdoor as the pistol and the broom flew from my hands i clawed at the wooden floor my hands slid i hooked my fingers over the edge and dangled frantic i peered down at a section of the basement that had been enclosed through a wooden platform below me knives protruded four inches apart in every direction so that it wasnt possible to land among them and not be injured one end of the carpet was attached to the floor dangling rather than falling onto the points below and preventing them from impaling me id have bled to death if i hadnt died instantly my arms ached as i strained to pull myself up but i tested the floor i thought how the hell did i get fooled the trapdoor must have been rigged to spring open only if a certain amount of weight was applied to it petey must have stepped over it when he passed through the archway i strained harder to pull myself up and managed to prop my elbows on the trapdoors edge slowly i squirmed into the parlor on my back on the floor i breathed deeply trying to steady myself i listened to the wind petey might come back any minute i thought i reached for the pistol and the broom which had flown from my hands when id fallen but caution instantly controlled me trying to subdue my toofast breathing i scanned the faded furniture the ceiling the corners nothing seemed to threaten me through the front windows i studied the lane leading into the windblown forest peteys truck didnt speed into view keep moving i told myself staying to the edge of the room i pushed a chair ahead of me wary of other traps to the right of the front windows an archway led to a corridor stairs went up on a landing beyond the front door another shotgun had been rigged as before a cord was attached to the trigger the cord looped back through two pulleys and connected to a hook on top of the door when the door was opened and someone stepped through the shotgun would blow the intruder in half it wouldnt have been difficult for petey to attach the cord to the hook as he pulled the door shut or for him to unhook the cord when he returned and opened the door just enough for him to reach his hand up for anyone who didnt suspect though death would have been instantaneous had i found all the traps straining my eyes i studied the corridor i fixed my gaze on a door beneath the stairway i was sure that it would take me down to the basement kate and jason were only a couple of hundred feet away the floor had no carpet it looked solid nonetheless i stayed to the edge of the hallway and inched along when i came to the door beneath the stairs i tested the knob it turned freely in my hand but another trap might be behind it so i pulled the flashlight from my belt gently opened the door an inch and scanned the light up and down looking for a cord the area beyond was totally dark warily opening the door a few inches farther i smelled something bitter like camphor mothballs i opened the door farther aimed the flashlight and saw coats and dresses on a rod a closet no furious i used the blunt end of the broom to prod among the clothes i tapped the floor the walls nothing sounded hollow where the hell was the entrance to the basement hurry i thought i remembered the previous night when id watched peteys silhouette through the window hed been cooking then his silhouette had disappeared id assumed that hed been eating in an area of the kitchen that was out of my view but what if hed taken the food to kate and jason in the kitchen how there wasnt a door to the basement a shock of understanding hit me trying not to let my eagerness make me careless i returned the way id come i paused only once to look through the front windows past the windswept shrubs and check if peteys truck was returning then i stepped over the open trapdoor between the parlor and the dining room rushing into the kitchen the pantry i tapped the walls behind the canned goods on the shelves they sounded solid i glanced down at the floor realized what petey had done and grabbed the workbench upon which the shotgun had been secured tugging it away i saw the outline of another trapdoor this one had a ring i pulled upward and stared down at wooden steps descending into darkness kate jason the names echoed back to me no one shouted in return i tilted the trapdoor back so that it rested against the shelves behind it i positioned the workbench so that if the trapdoor accidentally fell it would be stopped before it slammed down and possibly locked then i aimed my flashlight into the darkness saw a switch on a post about five steps down and tested the first step as i eased down to turn on the basement lights no i warned myself petey wouldnt boobytrap the ground floor and not do something to the basement as well id gotten this far because id put myself in his place i thought like him what would petey have done to protect the basement the broomstick remained in my hand i tilted it downward flicked the switch and stumbled back from an arc of electricity that shot from the switch blackening the stick the flash was blinding the force so great that it knocked the stick from my hand i felt a tingle in my palm where the current had started to reach me smoke rose from the fake switch smelling burned wires i aimed the flashlight again and went cautiously down a few more steps i eased my weight onto each of them always gripping one behind me for support in case a step broke away the lower i got the less i heard the wind i scanned the flashlight across the basement seeing boxes a handymans bench tools on the wall above it shelves of preserves a washing machine a dryer an oil furnace a laundry tub and a water heater a window above the laundry tub had been boarded over the walls and floor were old concrete the ceiling had pipes wires and joists exposed everything smelled of mold i eased lower and saw a switch on another post this one at the bottom reaching it i picked up the broomstick where it had fallen once more i flicked with the stick and this time the switch was real lights glowed in the basements ceiling dim lightssixtywatt bulbsbut nonetheless they made me squint kate jason again my shouts echoed again no muffled voices answered me i oriented myself the wall that faced the area behind the house was on my left there wasnt a door only a tall object like a bookshelf on which there were jars of preserved peaches and pears i studied it from various angles looking for another trap i stepped protectively to the left and pushed with the broomstick the shelves slid away i inched my head around the corner peering into the opening the tunnel was about fifteen feet long its concrete was smooth and newlooking petey had imitated the arrangement that orval dant had used with the difference that instead of a wooden ceiling petey had chosen concrete at the end was a metalcovered door it had a deadbolt lock but this one didnt have a knob that needed to be turned instead it had a slot for a key and i didnt have a doubt in the world that the door was locked i wanted to rush to it but i hesitated why had petey gone to the extra effort of building the tunnel instead of putting the cell directly next to the house the latter setup would have been quicker and easier had petey merely been imitating the arrangement that orval had used or did the tunnel contain an additional trap i studied the bare floor the walls and the ceiling unable to see a threat about to yell to kate and jason again i abruptly understood the purpose for the tunnel if a stranger came down to the basement kate and jason would be too far away to hear or be heard but how was i going to open the door noticing that its hinges were on the tunnel side i turned to the right toward the workbench i grabbed a hammer and a chisel and stopped a sound paralyzing me something dripped in the stillness of the basement the slight noise seemed magnified i focused on the laundry tub but its taps were secure no water leaked from them drip i turned trying to identify the direction from which the sound came drip drip steady relentless my attention focused beneath the stairs on a pipe projecting from the wall drip drip then i smelled it drip gasoline trickle gasoline was coming from the pipe spreading across the concrete floor the flow must have been activated when id pressed the fake switch on the stairs peteys final trap if all else failed when enough fuel emptied onto the floor a detonator would ignite it the house and the intruder the evidence against peteyeverything would be obliterated clutching the hammer and the chisel i raced into the tunnel my frenzied movements echoed as i tried the doorknob and confirmed that it was locked i held the chisel beneath the head of a hinge pin and hammered upward freeing it the pin clanged onto the floor i did the same to the two other pins and pulled at the hinges straining to free the door kate im here i pounded on the door jason its dad ill get you out but they didnt pound on the other side of the door i didnt hear any muffled shouts answering me the door wouldnt budge i stared at the key mechanism hoping that i could unscrew its plate and disassemble the lock but petey had drilled the heads off the screws i used the chisel and the hammer to pound at the concrete next to the lock chunks flew my arms ached as i pounded harder larger chunks fell away i worried about causing sparks that might detonate the fumes but i didnt have a choice i had to do something anything before the house exploded i hoped to expose the locks bolt but what i came to was a stout metal sleeve into which the bolt had been seated for all i knew the metal sleeve went several feet into the side of the wall it would take me all day to pound away that much concrete i ran back to the workbench and scanned the tools above it looking for a crowbar there wasnt one i swung toward a shovel and a hoe next to the bench looking for an ax with which i could try to chop through the metalcovered door there wasnt one the smell of the gasoline was stronger i saw a threefoot section of pipe on the floor probably left over from a trap i ignored it stared again at the tools above the workbench looked back at the pipe and grabbed it gagging on fumes i raced along the tunnel i used the chisel and the hammer to pound at the concrete next to the middle hinge again chunks flew my arms cramped ignoring the pain i hammered more fiercely against the chisel my aim missed i struck my fist screamed ignored the blood oozing from my knuckles and pounded the chisel with greater force when a hole opened i dropped the hammer and chisel rammed the pipe into the hole and levered with all my weight sweating i pushed relentlessly against the pipe suddenly the door budged i strained the gap widened i stumbled nearly falling as the door popped loose leaving me sufficient space to squeeze through please god let them be alive i prayed i lurched into a room the size of a garage a woman and a boy cowered straining to get away from me each had a fivefootlong chain that led from a shackle on a wrist to a metal ring secured to the wall kate jason they looked dazed the pupils of their eyes were unnaturally large black squeezing out the white around them i could think of only one thing that would do that gader had told me that one of lester dants numerous crimes had been drug dealing i looked down at something id knocked over when i broke in a waste can empty vials and used syringes had tumbled from it you son of a bitch you drugged them i inwardly screamed kate and jason kept cowering they wore the kind of clothes that i associated with going to church kate had dark pumps a kneelong modest blue dress and a matching ribbon in her hair jason had black oxfords black trousers and a white shirt topped with a bow tie their hair was meticulously combed with the notquitenatural look when someone else does the job their faces were pale with hollows under their eyes kate wore lipstick which was smeared the only furniture was a bed theyd been slumped on until the noises id made crashing into the room had terrified them kate its me its brad they cringed desperate to keep a distance from me jason its dad moaning the boy squirmed back to the limit of his chain theyd never seen me with a beard the drugs had so fogged their minds that they didnt recognize me all they knew was that the violence of my entrance made me a threat listen to me youre safe i returned to the tunnel for the hammer and chisel when i rushed toward kate and jason they thrust their arms over their heads to protect themselves you dont have to be afraid anymore their whimpers were obscured by the clang of the hammer against the chisel as i struck next to one of the metal rings embedded in the wall concrete flew the fumes from the gasoline hadnt yet reached the chamber for the moment the danger of sparks didnt worry me as i slammed harder at the ring and the concrete around it no longer whimpering kate and jason were speechless with terror suddenly the ring to which jason was anchored thumped onto the mattress i redirected the chisel toward the ring that held kate as i struck concrete above her head she trembled she reminded me of a dog that had been intimidated so often that it cowered at the sight of its owner my god thats what she thinks i realized i imagined the drugged haze through which she and jason must have been seeing me my beard was the most pronounced thing about my appearance peteys beard was the feature theyd have most noticed in the swirl of their halfconsciousness sweet jesus they thought i was petey in outrage i realized what had happened petey had tried to condition them to make kate call him brad and jason call him dadmore important to make them believe it hed drugged them until they didnt know who they were day after day hed persisted in the same routine determined to take away their will and resistance to mold them into the obedient worshipful wife and son of his fantasies he didnt want a wife and son who had minds of their own what he needed were puppets who acted out his delusions its me its really me i pounded the chisel against the wall its brad their eyes widened with greater terror jason im not who you think i am i really am your father i didnt have time to explain i had to get them outside before the fumes spread farther and the house exploded with one last frantic blow i knocked away the ring that held kate to the wall she and jason were too frightened to move i grabbed their chains and dragged them toward the gap in the doorway i squeezed into the tunnel and used their chains topull them through one at a time immediately i felt lightheaded realizing that the fumes were starting to suffocate me tugging kate and jason along the tunnel i was again reminded of dogs that refused to go with their master i reached the basement seeing smoke billow from the fake light switch that had almost electrocuted me the detonator when it burst into flame the house would blow up daylight gleamed through the open trapdoor youre almost free kate jason youll soon be out of here but as we started up the stairs jason gaped and jerked back he screamed above us a shadow loomed into view blocking part of the light then the light was blocked totally as petey slammed the trapdoor shut smoke billowed thicker from the fake light switch i coughed but couldnt clear my lungs a rumble above the trapdoor warned me that petey was sliding the heavy workbench onto it i drew my pistol and shot toward the noise as four bullet holes appeared in the trapdoor i realized in dismay that the muzzle flashes from my pistol might detonate the fumes my ears rang from the shots gasoline now covered most of the floor frantic i looked around for a way to get out above the laundry sink the boardedover window caught my attention i ran back for the hammer raced toward the laundry sink and pried the boards from the window it was the type that had to be pulled up on an angle and held in place by a hook in the ceiling when i opened it i heard the wind which had become even stronger since id entered the house feeling a gust hit my face i lifted jason he struggled as i pushed him through the opening i lifted kate shocked by how little she weighed the sight of the outdoors of freedom gave her some life with greater energy she squirmed through the windows opening desperate to get away from me any moment i feared a searing blast would rip me apart i climbed onto the sink and just as i shoved my chest through the opening the sink pulled away from the wall crashing under my weight i grabbed a branch on a shrub and dangled the branch bent i sank i clawed at the earth kept slipping back into the basement braced my elbows against each side of the window and stopped below me the concrete wall tore my jeans as i kneed against it struggling to squirm upward even with the wind at my face and the smoke coming past me through the window i smelled the gasoline i grabbed another branch and pulled myself hand over hand through the opening but the buckle on my gun belt wedged against the sill i tried to raise my hips working to ease the buckle over the sill i heard it scrape on the concrete i sucked in my stomach raised my hips as high as i could felt the buckle slip free and tugged forward harder inching through the opening my hips came through my thighs as soon as i was on my handstand knees i surged up adrenaline burned my muscles as i raced from the bushes at the side of the house i saw peteys truck which the boards over the window had prevented me from hearing when hed returned to the house i didnt see kate and jason but i was certain that even dazed theyd have known enough to run in the opposite direction from the truck i whirled to charge after them toward the back of the house to cross the clearing and reach the cover of the forest and found myself ten feet from petey who aimed a shotgun at my chest he trembled with rage i couldnt draw my pistol and shoot before he pulled the trigger even if i hit him my mm bullet might not kill him but with a shotgun at ten feet he was sure to blow my chest apart stop petey with my beard i couldnt be sure he recognized me its me its brad even before i shouted his eyes had narrowed he looked startled straining to see past my beard he realized who i was the wind buffeted us so hard i could barely hear him murmur brad listen to me did they tell you who lester was i shouted doing the only thing i could think of to distract him from shooting do you know why they took you lester he murmured did they tell you lester was orval and eunices only child smoke poured from the basement window moving away from it i had to keep distracting him did they tell you he died that they went crazy with grief the house would soon explode theyd already lost three children to stillbirths i kept my voice raised inching toward the trees the rest of the dants were dead eunice couldnt conceive any longer lester was their only chance of continuing the family line petey sighted along the shotguns barrel lester as smoke billowed i moved closer to the trees they were desperate to replace him but they couldnt do it in brockton that was too close to home they might have been recognized petey kept pace with me the shotgun aimed at my chest so they set out on the interstate driving from one town to another they waited for god to direct them to put a boy of the same age before them they tried one town after another they crossed from indiana into ohio they passed columbus they came to woodford i spoke faster more intensely well never know what made them leave the interstate and pick our town something must have seemed a sign from god as they drove this way and that they turned a corner and there you were all by yourself pedaling down a street that seemed deserted can you tell us how to get to the interstate petey said it with such bitterness do you believe in god do you believe in the end of the world the smoke worsened i tasted it as i neared the trees he moved with me his finger looking tighter on the shotgun they took you and they put you in that underground room and they told you your name was lester and they punished you if you didnt act like their son lester i thought i saw flames beyond the smoke at the basement window this my son was dead and is alive again he was lost and is found luke fifteen twentyfour petey said when you told me youd been molested i thought you meant sexually i took another step so did petey the wind gusted harder but you didnt mean sexually you meant molested in your mind in your soul they wanted you to be lester so much that they beat you and starved you they treated you like an animal until you didnt know who you were it was so awful that in the end you were ready to be anybody they wanted you to be as long as they didnt hurt you as long as they took away your bodily wastes and gave you something to eat they taught me the good book petey said the truth shall make you free john eight thirtytwo the truth is you can be free ill get help for you petey its not too late once the police understand why you did what you did theyll want you to get help too i promise you life can be better dont let orval and eunice destroy you again stop being what they made you into petey dont call me petey my voice broke i cant tell you how sorry i am i know that your life changed because of me that everything would have been different if i hadnt sent you home from that baseball game but damn it we were just kids how was i to know that the dants were going to grab you nobody could have known about them you were just my little brother tagging along i didnt mean for it to happen petey tears streamed down my face there wasnt a night since you disappeared that i didnt beg god to bring you back safe that i didnt plead for a second chance let me make it up to you petey please let me try to give you the life that orval and eunice took from you stop calling me petey youre right when you came to my house you asked me to call you peter but i didnt were not kids anymore youre peter no dont call me that either staring at the shotguns trigger i made a placating gesture okay whatever you want lester im not lester then i dont understand who are you brad the dark intensity in his eyes made clear how serious he was id ruined his life now hed stolen mine taking my wife and son hed convinced himself that he was also taking my identity in his mind he was me as the depths of his insanity became obvious my legs felt unsteady im so sorry god help you i murmured no his tone left no doubt that he was going to pull the trigger god help you the blast hurtled me into the bushes not from the shotgun the blast from the house as the building exploded the shock wave lifted me off my feet and threw me into the undergrowth wreckage flew chopping tree branches shredding leaves dimly i became aware enough to smell smoke and hear the crackle of flames in pain i slowly sat up i felt dizzy sick to my stomach the ringing in my ears was unbearable id been thrown into a hollow that was the only reason id survived the shrapnel from the blast chunks of smoking burning wreckage lay around me bushes were on fire the wind thrust the flames from tree to tree coughing from the smoke i staggered to my feet i stared around searching for petey i faced the burning crater of the house he wasnt on the ground where wed last stood he must have been thrown into the undergrowth the same as i had been flames crowded me kate and jason i had to find them as i stumbled deeper into the forest i prayed that theyd kept running that they were far enough away that the fire wouldnt reach them and that petey wouldnt hed do everything in his power to get them back unless he was dead unless the blast had killed him then where was his body after the explosion there was so little cover that i should have been able to see his corpse where was he the wind hurled smoke at me making me cough harder as i lurched through the forest while id been unconscious the fire had spread rapidly leaping from tree to tree bushes burst into flames i zigzagged trying to avoid flames on my right only to discover that a new section of the forest was suddenly afire on my left i wanted to shout kate jason but theyd been so afraid of me in the house that i doubted theyd answer me if anything id throw them into a greater panic on the off chance that they did answer my shouts petey would hear them would go to them plus if i shouted to kate and jason petey would hear me would know where i was the fire roared around me the smoke whirled past driven by the wind fighting for breath i stumbled into a clearing again the fire leapt into the trees ahead of me how far had kate and jason managed to go i remembered the stream that id followed into the forest if i could reach it if kate and jason could reach it we had a chance reach it how id been so distracted by my need to avoid the fire that id lost my bearings the same with kate and jason they might be fleeing in a circle i fumbled for the compass in my shirt pocket squinting in the smoke i aligned myself in a northwest direction the opposite of the southeast line that id used to approach the house i put the compass back in my shirt dodged a flaming branch falling toward me and ran toward untouched trees northwest of me the noise from the fire was filled with pops and cracks as wood ignited dry stumps exploded from the heat a huge chunk of bark and wood blew away from a tree on my right and i dove to the ground realizing that one of the blasts was from peteys shotgun i drew my pistol dismayed by how violently my hand shook in denver my instructor had warned that no matter how good a shooter was at target practice nothing prepared one for controlling a gun in a killorbekilled situation when fear took charge skill collapsed the fire swept closer i couldnt stay where i was but as soon as i moved petey would shoot again i thought of everything that kate and jason had suffered of everything that id been through to find them i thought of petey leaving me to die in the mountains fury compacted my muscles my hand stopped shaking i raced toward another tree a shotgun blast tore a chunk from it immediately i did what petey would have least expected charging back toward the flames toward the tree where id hidden i had a sense of where hed shot from a clump of bushes that i now put three bullets into smoke enveloped me i held my breath and used the smoke for cover rushing toward those bushes angrily putting three more bullets into them but when i crashed through what i found wasnt a body only an empty shotgun shell i crouched breathing hoarsely scanning the undergrowth for movement but everything was in motion as the heat from the flames added to the force of the wind the empty shotgun shell how many times had petey shot at me two that i knew of how many shells did a shotgun hold in the gun store where id taken lessons i recalled hearing that most held four in the magazine and one in the chamber peteys shirt pockets hadnt bulged from spare shotgun shells as far as i knew he had only three shots left my back felt so scorched that i had to rush toward farther cover staying low i reached more bushes took advantage of the smoke around me and raced toward another tree stump blam the top of the stump disintegrated the shocking pain in my left shoulder felt as if hornets had stung me at enormous speed i lurched back shooting as i fell i hit the ground hoping that what had struck me were chunks of wood from the stump but the blood on my shoulder warned me that id been struck by metal pellets the only reason that my arm hadnt been separated from my shoulder was that petey had shot from a distance in the confusion of the smoke and the flames his aim had been thrown off only part of the spray had hit me the wound throbbed i had trouble moving that arm but i had no trouble moving the rest of me i was so primed with fear and adrenaline that i rolled toward a fallen tree knowing that i didnt dare stay where id fallen the fire again scorched my back its winddriven smoke enveloped me but it had to be enveloping petey also he wouldnt be able to see me i pulled the compass from my shirt and checked it again straining not to cough and let petey know where i was i aligned the compass on a northwest route and shifted forward through the fastmoving haze i couldnt see more than five feet ahead of me prepared to shoot the instant i saw a threatening shadow i worked farther through the forest checking the compass frequently blood dripped from my left shoulder i felt lightheaded the fire was about to get ahead of me heat shoved me urging me to move faster i was so busy watching the blowing smoke for a sign of petey that i didnt pay attention to the ground the slope to the stream was about six feet deep id have fallen into it if a deer hadnt charged from the flames on my right it startled me crashing past me and down splashing through water then bounding up the opposite side i squirmed down to the water feeling cool air the stream was shallow i crossed it oblivious to my hiking boots and socks getting wet concentrating on where petey might be on my right farther along the stream a shadow moved amid the smoke i started to shoot but stifled the impulse realizing that the shadow might belong to kate as easily as to petey i kept aiming the smoke made my eyes water as i strained to see along the barrel i stared at the smoke waiting for the shadow to become more distinct the shadow disappeared whoever it was had climbed from the stream and continued through the forest keeping pace with it i struggled up the slope and passed through smoky undergrowth watching for the shadow to come into view again i kept thinking if it was kate wouldnt i have seen a smaller shadow with her jason not if he was on the other side of her i had to be certain before i pulled the trigger creeping farther through the trees i blinked tears from my smokeirritated eyes and stared toward the indistinct forest on my right something moved for an instant i caught a glimpse of peteys beard he raised his shotgun i pulled the trigger abruptly i was almost blinded as a gust of wind tossed flames overhead trees and bushes erupted into fire ahead of me feeling the explosion of heat singe my hair i stumbled backward and this time did lose my balance when i fell down the bank of the stream i landed on my wounded shoulder i strained not to cry out rolling down to the water coming to a painful stop it took all my effort to stand id dropped my compass i couldnt find it not that i could get any help from it now with the fire ahead and behind me with petey possibly on my right the only safe direction was to the left along the stream i had no idea if id hit him but if i hadnt hed need to take shelter in the stream which meant that hed stalk along it in my direction all i had to do was find a curve in the stream hide and ambush him i couldnt remember how many times id shot my pistol might have been almost empty trying to keep my hands steady i pressed a button on the side dropped the magazine grabbed the fifteenround spare from the pouch on my belt and slammed it into the grip ready to shoot again my vision grayed as the smoke thickened i fought for air realizing that the fire was sucking away oxygen the flames squeezed closer afraid that id pass out i worked along the stream trying to stay on the bank to avoid making noise in the water but loss of blood added to my dizziness i couldnt control where my hiking boots landed sometimes splashing in the water sometimes slipping through mud hot air seared my nostrils i rounded a curve its slope protecting me from the flames above me on my right i lurched around another curve and cool air struck my face id reached a section of the stream that wasnt yet bounded by fire the coolness was the most luxuriant thing id ever felt i sucked it into my lungs hoping to clear my thoughts to get rid of the spots that wavered in my vision as the fresh air took the gray from in front of my eyes i staggered to a halt at the sight of footprints in the mud two sets of them an adults a childs they were following the stream as i was kate jason i whirled toward urgent footsteps splashing through the stream behind me but as i aimed it wasnt petey but a panicked dog that scrambled into view it raced out of sight along the stream the air became hot again the flames drew closer i ran in the direction of the footprints a tree had fallen across the bank i ducked under it straightened on the other side and groaned as something heavy walloped across my forehead the blow sent me reeling back against the tree dazed i sank to my knees in the water blood trickled down my face i tried to clear my blurred vision her eyes frantic from the drugs kate stood over me a clublike branch raised to hit me again jason cowered behind her no kate i was appalled by how distant my weakened voice sounded dont its me you bastard i managed to raise my right arm before she struck me again the club whacked below my elbow deflecting the blow but the pain that shot through my arm made me fear that shed broken it my pistol thudded onto the bank no kate its really me brad brad kate shrieked and struck again with the club i dove to the right barely avoiding the blow it smashed into the stream she swung again i rolled as she kept swinging she gaped at something behind me i followed her gaze peteys face showed above the tree that spanned the stream his forehead was covered with soot his hair and beard were singed his shirt was blackened by smoke blood flowed from his left shoulder where id evidently hit him the last time id pulled the trigger his shotgun rested on the horizontal tree its barrel facing us jason backed away if you know whats good for you son dont take another step petey told jason i was on my back in the stream my right arm was useless probably broken from when kate had struck it my buckshotpunctured left arm was in similar agony but at least it was mobile sweating from the effort i groped for the knife on my belt jason kept backing away listen to your father petey said stay put jason opened his mouth in a silent wail then petey wailed as i rolled under the tree and plunged the hunting knife into his thigh the blade scraped bone when he lurched back his shotgun went off the pellets whistled past my head no afraid that the blast had hit kate and jason i stabbed peteys thigh again as his blood spurted over me i redirected my aim toward his side but he rammed down with the butt of his shotgun hitting my wounded shoulder i almost passed out able to do only one thing to throw my weight against his legs and bring him down with me into the stream i crawled onto him stabbing toward his face but he pushed me to the side and grabbed my throat choking me so hard that i feared my larynx would break smoke reached us the fire crackled nearer i plunged the knife into his wounded shoulder in agony he fell back landing where hed dropped his shotgun he grabbed it pumped out an empty cartridge and pulled the trigger i lurched back from the blast that would blow my chest apart but the shotgun made only a clicking sound it was empty roaring petey swung it like a club but loss of blood weakened him the blow glanced off my leg my left arm was in greater agony much less mobile as i thrust with the knife and missed a shot kicked up dirt we spun toward it kate had crawled beneath the trees wavering to her feet she held the pistol that id dropped doing her best to keep it steady she looked as if throughout her ordeal a small part of her mind had remained lucid enough to fantasize about getting even normally at close range there wasnt any trick to using the gun even though she knew nothing about pistols all she had to do was look down the barrel and pull the trigger but she was drugged and shed already missed once and now she mustered her concentration her eyes dark above her hollow cheeks the twin vision of her nightmaretwo peteys two bradsmust have threatened the little sanity she had left help me petey said i came here to save you shoot him she hesitated then turned the gun toward me please kate dont i said i watched her finger tighten on the trigger shoot him petey said i love you kate im your husband do what i tell you petey said she turned toward petey and shot him in the face she took a step closer pulled the trigger and this time missed so she stumbled closer until she was on top of him at pointblank range she shot him in the chest the next bullet burst his throat she didnt aim at those parts they just happened to be where the barrel wavered she shot and kept shooting too close not to hit him somewhere his shoulder his knees his groin riddling his body until all fifteen bullets in the magazine had been expended and the slide on top of the pistol stayed back tears rolled down her face i managed to stand but as i approached her wanting to hold her she staggered back in fright she raised the pistol again and pulled the trigger repeatedly nothing happened the gun was empty but if thered been any rounds left shed have killed me i tried to make a reassuring gesture its okay youre safe now im not going to hurt you but the dark frenzy in her eyes told me that she didnt believe me i wont touch you i said but please let me help you please i felt heat behind me i heard a crackling roar and looked over my shoulder at the fire we have to get out of here i took another step forward in response she backed away toward the tree across the stream jason i asked wheres jason my god was he shot as i stared frantically under the tree toward where id last seen jason kate scrambled under it trying to get away from me i lurched after her rising on the other side fearful that id see jasons body blown apart from peteys last shotgun blast i breathed out in relief when i found him standing next to the stream he threw a rock it struck my chest but i was far beyond pain all i wanted was to get him out of there its okay jason youve got nothing to be afraid of now i took a step toward him covered with blood singed by the fire i must have looked indistinguishable from petey he scrambled up the bank and into the forest off balance from my injuries i struggled after him heat and smoke almost succeeded in pushing me back as i stumbled through the underbrush i saw bright flickers within the smoke the heat intensified a tree exploded into flames a wall of fire reached bushes jason smoke clogged my throat i bent over coughing forced myself to straighten and veered past more trees the wind cleared the smoke for an instant ahead jason was blocked by the approaching fire he turned desperate to run from it then stopped when he saw me i must have been more threatening than another wall of fire he dodged to my left and raced toward an opening in the blaze as i leapt the wind hurled flames toward him i knocked him down an instant before a fiery gust flashed above our sprawled bodies with the remaining strength in my wounded arm i dragged him back from the flames he kicked and hit me then kate was hitting me let him go she screamed the three of us tumbled down the bank and landed in the water they kept hitting and kicking but i didnt resist their punches weakened finally they collapsed staring at me their gaunt chests rising and falling i love you i said they stared something slowly changed focus in their eyes as if they dimly remembered a time when those words had been familiar stay here theres something i have to do i managed to say as the fire approached the top of the bank i splashed water over me then i ducked under the tree that spanned the stream i came to where petey lay his body was almost totally covered with blood from the number of times hed been shot but that wasnt good enough hed come back once i needed to be absolutely certain that he was dead that he could never come back again not even in my nightmares i grabbed his feet but my injured arms had stiffened too much causing too much pain for me to drag him up the bank i tried as hard as i could but was about to give up when kates hands came into view i looked at her startled but she didnt say a word just helped me tug petey up the slope we threw him toward the fire his corpse burst into flames only then did we stumble back down to the stream at the bottom kate fell but she wouldnt let me touch her to help her get up keeping a wary distance from me she and jason ran epilogue the three of us were in a hospital for quite a while the police and the district attorney questioned me demanding to know why i hadnt let the authorities go after petey i did my best to tell them that events had overtaken me how could i explain that i was afraid the police would have gotten kate and jason killed instead of saving them despite my repeated denials they insisted that my motive had been rage that id been determined to get even with petey so i had to appear before a grand jury and the way my attorney explained it to me i could have been charged with what amounted to taking the law into my own hands but i doubt there was a person on the jury who after looking at my broken arm in a sling and the burns on my face didnt think that id gone through enough certainly kate and jason had gone through plenty their eyes had the haunted expression of war refugees it took three weeks before we were allowed to leave i paid someone to drive the volvo back to denver while kate jason and i flew home from columbus our friends welcomed us back they phoned they visited they had a party for us we thanked them but the truth was we were too traumatized to be sociable smiles and small talk were difficult to manage and as for large talk when we were asked details about what had happened we werent ready to discuss it yet after a while the newness of our return wore off the phone calls visits and invitations declined finally we were left to ourselves jason remained so silent that the parents of his friends didnt feel comfortable having him around their children for her part kate got nervous whenever she had to leave the house she finally gave up trying to do so the only good thing was as soon as i shaved my beard as soon as the drugs wore off and kate and jason distinguished me from petey they no longer considered me a threat although im always careful to let them see when im going to touch them ive tried to be honest with myself ive done my best to understand what happened hoping to adjust to it but sometimes i wonder if its possible to adjust to what petey lester did to us odd how i struggled so hard to deny that petey was lester and now i accept that the two were the same my brother died a long time ago because of me sometimes when kate and jason arent aware of it i study them trying to decide if theyre getting better without being obvious i try to see beyond their eyes i look in the mirror and try to see beyond my own do we carry darkness in us payne came over the other day a welcome visitor i asked him about his wife is she well what was the result of the biopsy the lump on her breast turned out to be a cyst thank god only then did i realize that id been holding my breath im glad to hear good things can happen i said in the backyard payne eased his weight onto the chaise lounge where petey had sat the previous year peering up at our bedroom window kate brought us two glasses of iced tea we pretended not to notice that her hands shook and the ice rattled thanks i said when i touched her shoulder she actually smiled payne watched her return to the house has she been seeing anyone a psychiatrist yes i said all three of us have is it doing any good my own guy has me writing a journal describing what happened and how i feel about it i talk to him about it once a week is it doing any good i shrugged he claims that it is but says that i dont have the objectivity to know it yet he also says that because the trauma we went through lasted a long time it isnt reasonable to expect to get over it quickly makes sense kate went into the supermarket all by herself today payne looked puzzled its a big step i explained she has trouble being near crowds and strangers what about you do you plan to go back to work im going to have to soon i answered our insurance doesnt cover all the medical expenses certainly not the legal expenses but how are you feeling are you ready to go back to work i sipped my iced tea and didnt answer when i was with the bureau i had to shoot somebody payne said kill him he concentrated on his glass i got shot in the process three months medical leave a lot of counseling i think i told you thats when i put on all this weight and left the bureau it took me a long time to feel normal again normals a complicated word i wonder if i can feel normal again in my previous life its like i was blundering around in a world of hurt but was too stupid to realize it and now i think kates right to be careful of whats going on around her anything can happen one moment i was standing on a ridge admiring the scenery the next moment my brother shoved me into a gorge cautions a virtue so ive learned you asked me if i planned to go back to work i am at work oh payne studied me taking care of my family its my job to love kate and jason as hard as i can to thank god for every moment i have with them to hold them and cherish them and do my damnedest to keep them safe paynes concentration
