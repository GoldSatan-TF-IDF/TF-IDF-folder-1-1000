michael palmer fatal prologue it had started with a sore throat nattie serwanga remembered the exact moment she had been having dinner with her husband eli when some green beans hurt her going down at the time the two of them were talking about whether nadine would be a better choice to name their daughter than kolette the discomfort was the beginning of a cold she thought nothing more but despite treatment from the doctors in the clinic the sore throat had gotten progressively worse now nine days after that first scratchy pain nattie knew she was sick really sick the pounding headache told her so so did the chills and the sweats and the fiery swelling in her throat that the antibiotics had done nothing to help and beginning at three this morning there was the cough across the raised glass counter the kids from the hospital daycare center were lined up for lunch chicken nuggets and spaghetti pudding for dessert hi nattie smattie me first nattie me first ugh not spanetti again winking at an adorable fouryearold named harold nattie forced a few drops of saliva past the burning in her throat and filled his plate a moment later without enough warning even to raise her hand she was jolted by a vicious racking cough the worst yet droplets of her saliva sprayed over the contents of the trays in front of her she stumbled back but caught herself before she actually fell each hack drove a sixinch spike into her brain damn she muttered regaining her equilibrium she was tough tough as nails one of her sisters liked to say but this infection was tough too instinctively she slid her hands beneath her apron and pressed them against her womb for a few horrible empty seconds there was nothing then she felt a sharp jab on her right side echoed immediately by one on the left despite the headache and the cough and the hot coals in her throat nattie serwanga smiled at forty married seven years she had begun to believe it was her sad destiny to remain childless eli who came from a family of ten children desperately wanted kids he had all but given up though and had begun talking about taking in foster children or even adopting then the miracle nattie are you okay supervisor peggy souza eyed her with concern natties smile this time was forced a piercing ache had materialized between her shoulder blades im im fine she managed its just a cold that doesnt want to dry up i been to my obstetrician twice he give you something first penicillin then something stronger she decided to leave out the part about sending her to an infections specialist if she wasnt better soon or all the questions about the trip she and eli had just taken to see his family in sierra leone you wanna go home nattie gestured to the crowd on the other side of the counter a number of nurses and doctors were now lined up behind the kids after the rush maybe the trip to africa had used up the last of her vacation she had been saving up her sick days to use in conjunction with maternity leave with any luck she would be able to work until the last week and then take almost three months off there was no way she could leave work just now well i tell you what peggy said why dont you wear one of these surgical masks until youre ready to leave that was some nasty coughin you were doin nattie turned so that peggy couldnt see her fumbling with the strings of the mask what in gods name is happening to me the next ten minutes were a blur of pain and poorly suppressed coughing still nattie managed to finish serving the children and even to make a dent in the staff each of whom she knew had almost no time at all for lunch now in addition to the unremitting pain she was experiencing spasms and fullness in her rectum please god take care of my baby dont let anything happen to her nattie nattie huh oh sorry peggy my mind just wandered you were just standing there starin off into space i think you need to stop for the day an nattie look over here at me what your eyes theyre all spotted with blood what are you talking about the white part of your eyes theres like patches of blood all over them nattie youd better get to a doctor right now a sudden strangulating tightness in her rectum made it impossible for nattie to speak panicked she nodded then hurried as best she could to the rest room the masked face staring back at her from the mirror looked monstrous from under her paper haircovering clumps of her ebony hair were plastered to the perspiration on her forehead below that the whites of her dull almost lifeless eyes were nearly obliterated by splashes of bright crimson she untied the top strings of her mask and let it flop over onto her chest the inner surface of the mask spattered with blood looked like some obscene piece of modern art another spasm from below a whitehot spear thrusting up inside her this is bad oh this is bad she hobbled into the stall her clothes were drenched with sweat a viselike cramp in her lower belly was followed immediately by explosive diarrhea heavy drops of perspiration fell from her forehead eli oh honey im so sick nattie struggled to her feet behind her in the bowl was a hideous mix of stool and curdled blood more blood all she could think of was the baby she tried again to feel the kicking in her womb but she was shaking so hard she couldnt tell eli would know what to do she thought he was always the calm one she fumbled in her pocket for some change to call him at work nothing the phone in peggys office she could call him from there lurching from side to side unbalanced by her pregnancy nattie braced herself against the wall and moved ahead sweat was pouring down her now stinging her eyes and dripping off her nose twice she was stopped by ribsnapping salvos of coughing her hand and the wall beyond it were speckled with crimson nattie nattie just lie down right there ill call the er jesus look at her peggys voice seemed to be echoing through a long tunnel my baby nattie sank to one knee as pain exploded in her head a white light bathed the inside of her eyes she felt her bowels and bladder give way at the moment her neck jerked back she knew she was falling but there was nothing she could do about it shes having a seizure call the er peggys words were the last thing nattie heard before a darkness mercifully washed away the pain chapter belinda west virginia matt this is laura in the ermatt yeah matt youre still asleep im not you are i can tell time zit twothirty matt please turn on a light and wake up theres been an accident at the mine matt rutledge groaned friggin mine he muttered dr butler has activated the disaster protocol team b is it tonight matt are you awake im awake im awake he pronounced hoarsely fumbling with the switch on his bedside lamp nine times seven is fiftysix the miami basketball team is the heat the fifth president okay okay i believe you from college through medical school and residency and now into his life as an internist it had always been a chore for matt to shut his mind down enough to fall asleep but not nearly the challenge of subsequently waking up laura williams knew this trait of his as well as any nurse having worked with him in the er of montgomery county regional hospital for two years before his decision to switch over to private practice she and all the other nurses had adopted the policy that dr matthew rutledge wasnt definitely awake until he could prove it beyond a reasonable doubt light on feet on the floor im up im up hold on for a second matt tossed the receiver onto the bed and pulled on a pair of worn jeans a can aerosols now tshirt and a light sweater was it a cavein he asked tucking the receiver beneath one ear he sensed a tightening in his gut at even saying the words i think so ambulances are out there but no ones been brought in here yet the man from the mine just got here though he says he thinks ten or twelve are injured man from the mine matt pulled on a pair of gym socks two toes the little one and the fourth poked through a hole in the left one he briefly considered a replacement then pushed the toes back in and went for his boots instead he called himself the safety officer something like that laura said tall black hair with a white streak up the front sort of like a giant skunk matt wanted to add but didnt exactly that would be elaine leblanc hes a very important person in mineville just ask him laura thanks im up and dressed and on my way great the first rescue unit wont be here for a little while so drive slowly i know i know motorcycle equals donorcycle he pulled on his boots i wont go over five i promise the rest of the team on their way in all except dr crook so far he hasnt answered his phone or his pager please let it stay that way matt thought robert dont ever call me bob crook was a carriage trade cardiologist one of the senior medical citizens in the multispecialty belinda medical group he had been the most vocal in opposition to matts move from the er into their practice ultimately though those who thought a wellliked belindabornandraised harvardtrained internist and er specialist might just help fill the desperate need for a primary care doc won out over crook whose main objection spoken was that matt was an arrogant weirdo who didnt dress or look like a doctor and unspoken that he had once turned down his daughters invitation to the prom well i should be there in ten minutes make it fifteen okay okay and matt yes nine times seven is sixtythree not fiftysix i knew that matt set the phone down pulled his dark brown hair back into a ponytail and secured it with a rubber band for as long as he and ginny had known each other he had worn his hair short not exactly a crew cut but almost and by her decree she was the only one allowed to barber him since her death he hadnt done more than trim his sideburns the stud in his right earlobe had followed a year or so later and the tattoo on his right deltoid a few months after that it was a masterful rendering done from a photograph of the whiteblossomed hawthorn tree in their yard ginnys favorite the fiveroom log cabin the two of them had designed together was perched on a bluff looking out across the sutherland valley at the allegheny mountains pulling on a denim windbreaker matt stepped out onto the broad porch where toward the end ginny had spent most of her time in fact only the tattoo artist in morgantown had kept him from having the porch etched permanently into his arm instead of the hawthorn tree i can dig the sentiment man but believe me the aesthetic is just bogus anytime matt began doubting his decision to come back to west virginia and of late those times were increasingly frequent he needed only to walk out the front door of the cabin this was ginnys kind of night there wasnt a single cloud in the newmoon sky directly overhead the eternal river of the milky way shimmered across the blackness the chilly latesummer air was as always tinged with a hint of smoke from the huge coal processing plant adjacent to the mine nevertheless it was still sweet and fragrant with the scents of lavender linden wild orchids wild roses st johns wort and hundreds of other kinds of blossoms country roads take me home to the place i belong matt looped around the cabin to his onecar garage and fired up his maroon harley electraglide in addition to the hog he had a cc kawasaki roadster and a cc honda dirt bike all of which he could pretty much maintain himself the harley was his choice for cruising and the jackrabbitquick roadster for those days when he wanted to live a bit more on the edge the honda in addition to being a thrill a second in the woods was invaluable in making house calls to a large portion of his practice inaccessible by any but the most primitive road as he rolled down the gravel drive to state highway matt started feeling the first rush of adrenaline at what the next few hours might hold this accident was hardly the first he had dealt with courtesy of the belinda mine although at ten to twelve injured it would be the biggest over the years there had been bruises gashes strains sprains and fractures too numerous to mention there had also been a few deaths but the only other time disaster team b had actually been called in proved to be a farce an underground train known as a maintrip had derailed deep in the mine twenty members of team b had milled around the er from two until three in the morning before word was received that instead of the thirty to forty casualties originally reported there were none however this new disaster matt sensed was the real deal the sixmile ride to the hospital was along a serpentine road for which the motorcycle seemed expressly created matt leaned into the familiar turns with a rhythm that had become second nature he wondered if this latest disaster was yet another monument to the belinda coal and coke companys cutting safety corners wherever possible despite the constant pressure for modernization and improved safety that he and a few other brave souls tried to keep on the mine owners little had changed bc ampc was persistently unwilling to do anything but the barest minimum to ensure the wellbeing of the miners it was that way with the massive conglomerate today just as it had been that april night twentytwo years ago when the ceiling of tunnel c the tunnel cutely nicknamed peggy sue caved in crushing to death three miners including shift foreman matthew rutledge sr chapter the er at the modern iobed montgomery county regional hospital had a patient capacity of twelve including rooms specially equipped for orthopedics and pediatrics as well as room the crash suite for major medical or surgical emergencies two surgeons and a gp were waiting by the nurses station when matt arrived but he knew there were at least two or three more clinicians around plus a radiologist in addition almost certainly poised over in the lab was hal sawyer the chief of pathology and matts uncle hal part mountain man part community activist part playboy all scholar was matts mothers brother his godfather and the major reason he had decided on a career in medicine over the twentytwo years since the cavein of tunnel c hal had been as close to a father as matt had matt hadnt been in the er more than a minute when a pickup screeched into the ambulance bay bearing the first casualty he waved off the other docs and accompanied two nurses to the truck if the miner muddy from a mix of limestone coal dust dirt and perspiration was any indication of the carnage in the mine it was going to be a long night his bloodied leg fairly effectively splinted between two boards had an obvious compound fracture of the femur a grotesque spike of bone protruded through a tear in his coveralls midway up his thigh matt followed the litter to the ortho room out of the corner of his eye he saw mine safety officer elaine leblanc dressed in pressed chinos and a hundreddollar shirt speaking to the driver of the pickup while making notes on a clipboard too late for matt to avoid eye contact leblanc turned toward him his face was pinched and pallid matt flashed on what the humorless mine officer might be thinking oh no here we go again another goddamn crusade by dr do little well go ahead and try causing us more trouble asshole no one pays any attention to you anyhow leblanc shook his head derisively and matt responded with a cheery thumbsup as long as matt continued his efforts to make bc ampc own up to its safety shortcomings and cornercutting they would be enemies brian oneil the orthopedist on team b reached the castroom door simultaneously with matt at sixthree oneil was two inches taller than matt was and a couple of years older he had added two or three dozen pounds to the hardnosed linebacker he had been at wvu but at forty he was still a hell of an athlete he was also a topnotch surgeon and matts closest friend on the medical staff you first matt said i take enough of a pounding from you under the hoop since when did gunner rutledge ever mix it up under the hoop youd need a map just to show you where under the hoop is get a line in please laura normal saline usual bloods type and crossmatch for six units portable films of his chest and leg as soon as dr gunner here has finished examining him give him seventyfive of demerol and twentyfive of vistaril im were on it laura williams replied unflappable as always you know pal laura and some of the other nurses were betting that youd sleep through this one they may still be right seeing you here on time makes me think i might be dreaming together they moved to the bedside and assisted the nurse in cutting away the young miners clothes he might have been nineteen or twenty with reddish hair and wide feline eyes his narrow face was etched with pain but he forced his lips tightly together and took the jostling to his shattered leg without a sound im dr oneil the orthopedist brian said this is dr rutledge hes a veterinarian but hes a damn fine one were going to take good care of you ththanks sir the young man managed im fenton robby fenton what in the heck happened down there robby oneil asked as matt began a rapid physical assessment it was darryl teague sir he he went berserk hes been actin a little tetched for a while but tonight he was operatin the cm an he jes went off you know what a cm is a continuous miner that monster machine that scoops up coal and puts it onto the conveyor belt matt said exactly twelve ton or more every minute you never cease to amaze me dr rutledge oneil said no wonder you dont date even though people tell me youre the prime catch in the region you scare all the women away with your vast knowledge dont pay any attention to him robby hes lucky hes a darn good bone doctor or no one would even talk to him go on well early on in the shift teague got into a shovin match with one of the guys alan riggs i dont know what it was about teagues been like that for a while pickin fights complainin that people were out to get him that sort of thing well a bunch of us broke it up between him and riggs then a little while later teague goes after riggs with the cm he runs right over him i mean right over him then he goes on an takes out maybe half a dozen supports thats when the roof caved in how are the rest of the guys we dont know yet robby youre the first arrival alans got to be dead you shoulda seen it blasted darryl teague i dont usually wish nobody no harm but i hope he got hurt but good dr rutledge we need you laura williams said from the doorway matt had been so mesmerized by robby fentons account that he had completely forgotten about the deluge that was about to hit now the er was in beehive mode six of the beds were occupied by miners in varying degrees of distress and pain technicians nurses and physicians were in constant movement but the chaos seemed organized and nothing looked out of control we dont need your internist skills right now laura said but we sure could use your er talent theres a lac in three a beauty ive ordered skull films but theyre going to take a while hes low on the triage totem pole matt stopped in the oncall room and quickly changed into scrubs he was on his way to room when elaine leblanc intercepted him a new yorker with a dense accent leblanc was a fit fifty just an inch or so shorter than matt and broader across the shoulders his thick jet hair was slicked straight back and held in place with something from a tube his trademark white stripe an inch and a half across glistened beneath the fluorescent overheads what did that kid in there tell you he asked nice of you to inquire after the lad elaine he has a compound fracture of his femur thats when the ol thighbone is sticking out through the skin he wont be pushing coal for you for a while back off rutledge what did he tell you matt met leblancs icy stare with one of his own the man was potentially dangerous of that matt had no doubt it was possible that before ginny died he had held his contempt for leblanc and bc ampc in better check but with her gone he simply didnt care a lifelong health nut and nonsmoker ginny had no family history of lung cancer she was only thirtythree when the diagnosis was made and her tumor was an unusual cell type the kind of unusual cell type that might might have been caused by some sort of toxin no one could deny that bc ampcs coal processing plant was awash in carcinogenic chemicals whether they were handling and disposing those toxins in a safe legal manner was another story matt had plenty of theories and some hearsay about illegal dumping or storage but no proof there was never any proof still he was certain that if there were shortcuts in any aspect of mine safety or toxic waste disposal the directors of bc ampc would choose to take them it had been that way when his father was killed and matt felt certain it remained that way today over the years he had kept up a steady stream of letters to msha the mine safety and health administration demanding investigations and spot inspections once two years ago they had actually responded to his demands by sending a man in nothing absolutely nothing except some minor maintenance log omissions now his credibility was at an alltime low the folks at the agency either refused to return his calls or when they did as much as laughed at the notion of acting on his information with another surprise intrusion despite his contempt for elaine leblanc matt could see no reason why the safety officer shouldnt know what had happened in his mine fucking teague leblanc said when matt had finished the account stupid fucking teague mickey shannon the miner matt had been sent in to suture was fiftyfour positively ancient for mine work in fact he actually remembered working the coal face with matts father good man real good man stayed one of the guys even after they made him a foreman a sharp chunk of rock from the tunnel roof had glanced off mickeys forehead right below the hairline threequarters of an inch higher would have meant a direct hit on his skull and his name might have been added to the list of fatal mine casualties kept on the wall of the grub pit bar and grill instead the rock had peeled a fiveinchwide flap down over the bridge of his nose and across his eyes im going to put some novocain in to numb this thing up matt said dont bother doc just sew me up an get on to someone who needs your help moren i do matt knew from experience that this was no false bravado mickey shannon and the rest of the miners had been dealing with physical punishment and pain nearly every day of their adult lives caring for them and folks like them was one of the main reasons he had returned home to do medicine it was the rugged scramble for every dollar help your neighbor even though you hardly ever have time to speak with him type of mountain people who made up much of his practice hey matt said you handle the mining ill handle the doctoring if you say so people round these parts speak real highly of you doc i been thinkin lately of gettin me a doctor and youre the one i uz gonna call do that matt said dreading what an x ray of the mans chest might reveal he numbed the margins of the huge wound with i percent xylocaine prepped the area with betadine clamped a set of sterile drapes around it and carefully lifted the flap back in place there was going to be a scar there always was when skin had to be sutured the question was whether to do a meticulous microscopic closure with tiny sutures that might pull out if tested by mickeys going back to work too soon or a quicker job using thicker suture material guaranteed to hold under almost any circumstance whats the deal with your qualifying to collect disability matt asked we get full salary so longs we have sick time available then its a month waitin period before the disability kicks in with a doctors note sayin the problem is workrelated we start collectin disability immediately with no loss of sick time but im shhhhhhh matt selected dissolving sutures for a careful layered closure and fine nylon for the actual skin then he donned magnifying goggles and a new pair of gloves mickeys lined weathered face showed every day of three decades in the mine but there was no way he was going to leave the er with anything but the thinnest of scars from this one youre out for two weeks matt said ill give you the note in fact make that three weeks and if you have any kind of a headache any kind at all well tack on a few weeks more twenty minutes later he was halfway done with a closure that would have satisfied a movie star when laura williams breathless called to him from the doorway matt dr easterly needs you right away in the crash suite youll have to finish in here later matt placed some salinesoaked gauze over shannons wound and set the sterile drapes aside then he stepped back from the table flexing some of the tightness from his neck mickey you hear that he asked dont worry about me whos he got to see miss a man named darryl teague laura replied some sort of heavy equipment fell over on him let im die mickey shannon snapped considering that every bed in the er was occupied and most of those patients were being attended to there was quite a crowd working in room one glance at the overhead monitor told matt why heart rate blood pressure oxygen saturation only percent jon lee the nurse working beside the gurney caught matts eye and made a brief thumbsdown sign it seemed as if mickey shannons and robby fentons prayers were being answered somewhere beyond the wall of technicians nurses and gp judy easterly darryl teague was on the verge of checking out whats up startled judy easterly swung around then came over to him not the most energized or enthusiastic of doctors under any circumstance she was currently in her seventh or eighth month of pregnancy and looked as if she would have chosen to be anyplace in the world at that moment other than where she was this is the guy who caused all this she whispered i know matt whispered back is he bleeding somewhere easterly thrust out her gravid belly and arched her back trying to relieve some tightness somewhere not that i can tell she replied still whispering he drove some piece of heavy equipment over two guys no one knows why one of thems dead the others up in the or right now and i dont think hes going to make it after he did that he knocked down some supports and the roof collapsed he was trapped beneath a load of rock the rescue guys said his bp was all right on the way in i think the triage nurse assigned him to me because he looked pretty good when he got here not anymore obvious fractures in addition to the usual sources of hidden blood loss the chest and abdominal cavities a fractured leg or even an arm in some cases could cause enough bleeding into muscle to throw a victim into shock none easterly said hes moving all extremities joe terry was just hanging around waiting for the or to be ready for his case so i had him put an arterial line in nicely done matt meant the compliment although it was also obvious that except for the arterial line easterly hadnt been nearly aggressive enough with a man this hurt at the moment she seemed close to tears you know she said if i had known i was going to end up with this sort of crunch in the very guy responsible for the disaster i would have stayed home listen judy why dont you go ahead home right now matt said youve got things under reasonable control here and it looks as if you and the kid could use some rest easterly started to protest then suddenly thanked him bloods are off for the usual labs plus six units she said rapidly i ordered a portable of his chest and abdomen i really appreciate this just name your kid after me matt said matthewina easterly said i think shed like that hey thanks good luck before matt could even respond she was gone it was just as well she clearly had other things on her mind and was already hovering between notmuchhelp and downright dangerous he glanced again at the monitor and moved into easterlys spot at the bedside across from jon lee then he stopped short staring down in disbelief at the man whose insane rage had just killed one and possibly two coworkers darryl teagues face was covered with fleshy lumps at least twenty of them some peasized but some quite a bit larger and one just in front of his left ear approximating a walnut almost certainly they were neurofibromas bundles of nerve tissue mixed with spindly fibrous cells cause unknown cure none known darryl teague was well on his way to becoming an elephant man even more startling to matt was that teague was the second case of such a condition he had seen in the past four or five months laura dr hal sawyer is part of our disaster team could you please call him in the lab and ask if he can come over as soon as possible youve got it matt quickly turned his attention to the miner teague was conscious and still breathing on his own but his skin was mottled and his lips were a grayish purple jon anything ordered for his pressure nothing yet doctor lees tone made it quite clear that he was grateful for the change in medical command hang some dopamine standard drip run it wide open until we see what happens get a catheter in him and keep his volume up laura williams returned dr sawyer will be over shortly she said matt peered up at the ekg monitor the size of the beats on the tracing appeared much smaller than normal he filed the information away for the moment and began an efficient exam teagues heart sounds were muffled and distant there was tenderness in the center of his sternum enough tenderness to cause the semicomatose man to cry out when the spot was pressed his belly was soft and not the least bit tender his lungs were clear legs arms unremarkable skull and scalp also normal except that there were a dozen or more neurofibromas hidden beneath teagues long strawlike dirty blond hair in short there was no evidence for bleeding anywhere so why was teague in shock the likely answer at the moment centered around trauma to the miners breastbone and beneath it his heart laura wheres dr crook he asked on his way in turns out his beeper was accidentally shut off and his phone wasnt working the sandersonville police went out to his place and woke him up sandersonville was twenty minutes from the hospital and crook was hardly the sort who would simply jump into a pair of sweats and race on in especially when there was no definite indication in any of the victims that a cardiologist would be needed dr rutledge lee gestured at the monitor prepare to intubate him jon anesthesia around in the or radiology same shes doing some sort of procedure with dr terry inwardly matt groaned he had intubated dozens or patients many of them critical so that was no problem but his ability to interpret an ultrasound was average at best in a lifeanddeath situation like this one he would want a radiologists opinion no problem he said get me a sevenpointfive tube please laura could we talk out there the nurse looked at him curiously of course she said jon just shout if you need me matt walked laura to the nurses station she was a straightlaced grandmother in her early fifties traditional in her approach to medicine and a damn fine nurse she was never comfortable with matts open style manner and dress she had said so on several occasions still over the years they had managed to coexist with few problems now he knew he was about to put their mutual respect to the test the commotion in the er seemed to have leveled off and the moaning from the injured miners was much less hows he doing elaine leblanc asked as they passed later matt said you talk to me before you do anything heroic you hear that that weirdo killed one and maybe two of my men sure dr god matt said ill be certain to consult with you he turned his back on leblanc and spoke softly to the nurse from what he could discern blood was building up between the lining of teagues heart and the heart muscle itself the resultant constriction of the heart muscle was keeping it from filling properly between each beat laura this guys got a pericardial tamponade how do you know thats what its got to be we need to stick a needle into it and drain the blood cant we wait for dr crook unless we can be sure hes going to be here in the next five minutes the answer is no what about some tests an ultrasound radiology is in the or i dont trust the tech or me to read one with certainty besides i dont think we have time this kid is going out maybe thats for the best laura said now dont let us get started on that matt said please get me a pericardial drainage kit matt i dont like this at all how many times have you done this procedure a few during my residency matt lied i can do it pressures not reading lee called out ekg is showing many extra beats please matt said heading back to room if youre ordering it ill be right there with the kit remember what i told you leblanc said as matt passed him matt knelt at the head of darryl teagues bed and skillfully slid a breathing tube down his throat and between his vocal cords the respiratory tech then hooked the tube to a breathing bag and oxygen and began to pump teagues chest expanded much more than it had been but his blood pressure only rose to nice intubation doctor hal sawyer stood just inside the doorway with his dark hair graying at the temples his carefully trimmed mustache his goldrimmed glasses and kneelength lab coat uncle hal looked as professorial as did any medical school dean in fact he did have a clinical teaching position at one of the medical schools but for the most part he stayed pretty close to belinda where he was chief of pathology there was one other fulltime pathologist as well as the montgomery county medical examiner hal was also erudite wellread and adventurous he seldom spoke up at hospital staff meetings but when he did people generally listened never married hal didnt seem to lack for company his latest girlfriend heidi was a pretty young thing he had met on some sort of rafting trip the gossipers in belinda went on about his personal life but he never seemed to care just as he didnt care when the rumors started going around some years ago that he was gay hal was very much his own man and matt credited him with fostering his own sense of independence hey hal matt said thanks for coming over this is the guy who went berserk in the mine and caused this nightmare people say hes been acting paranoid for months paranoid insanity coupled with diffuse neurofibromatosis of the face and scalp ring any bells just like that cliff diver exactly his name was rideout teddy rideout and where did he work as i recall hal said palpating the lumps he too was a miner he was most definitely that bc and c to be exact my my hal said some months ago matt had been cruising on his harley down a particularly winding mountain road when rideout sped past him on the inside traveling much faster than the road ahead would tolerate a minute or so later matt came upon the shattered guardrail and saw the car lying on its roof several hundred feet below rideout lay well beyond resuscitation his striking facial lumps were identical to teagues and subsequent discussion with his family revealed a history of rapidly progressive paranoia and irrational aggressive behavior at the mans autopsy matt wondered out loud to his uncle if rideout might be toxic from something at the mine hal had promised to run some extra tests which came back negative it was hals belief that the man was one of a kind a very unusual case but just a single fluke point on the graph of life well matt thought now heres dot number two ill see what i can dig up about mr rideout hal said i dont recall anything unusual in the autopsy except for those neurofibromas which were only of interest because of their numbers not their microscopic appearance heres the kit laura said setting the tray marked pericardiocentesis down on the stainlesssteel stand any sign of crook he could be here any minute are you sure you but hes not here now this guys bp is back down to zero hes firing extra beats i say we go suit yourself laura said coolly in fact matt had attempted pericardial taps a number of times as the last gasp maneuver in cardiac arrest patients who were about to die despite the most heroic resuscitative measures but never had the procedure located any unsuspected pericardial blood and never had any of the patients survived need any help hal offered will robert crook to stroll into the er right now matt said i just dont think we can wait beyond hal just a few feet outside the door matt could see elaine leblanc watching waiting im still not getting any pressure at all lee reported ventricular extra beats in pairs sometimes you just got to do what you got to do matt was thinking he attached a fourinchlong widebore cardiac needle to a cc syringe and hooked an alligator clamp to the base of it he would know he was wrong about there being pericardial blood only after he had driven the heavy needle through the tissuethin pericardial membrane and into the base of teagues heart the electrocardiogram would react immediately to the trauma and hopefully he would have time to stop and withdraw the needle before any major damage was done to the cardiac muscle hopefully but if he pierced the muscle and hit a coronary artery the resulting heart attack would give teague almost no chance at all matt forced the needle through the skin at the v formed by teagues left lower ribs and the tip of his sternum then he angled it toward his left shoulder keeping the pressure constant he advanced the needle through the diaphragm toward what he envisioned was the base of the heart slowly slowly lots of extra beats the nurse reported are you hitting his heart right now laura asked matt checked the monitor j sure hope not he thought no he said assuredly are you sure without warning the syringe filled with blood yes matt switched the threeway valve on the syringe to empty and injected its crimson contents into a small glass cup then he withdrew another cc of blood from teague and squirted it into a larger beaker how do you know youre not drawing blood directly from his heart laura asked the woman simply wasnt going to let up hal stepped forward ms williams he said calmly it looks very much like dr rutledge knows what he is about there is one way to tell right here where that needle tip is if that blood dr rutledge just removed was sitting in this mans pericardial space it probably wont clot if its directly from the ventricle of the heart it will how long will that take to know matt ignored the question and drew off another syringeful teagues condition remained unchanged to his left lee tried again to hear a pressure then shook his head gravely if hes in shock and you might be taking blood from his heart wont that make the situation even worse laura asked back off matt wanted to scream the nurse was quite obviously protecting herself against robert crooks certain onslaught i tried to reason with him dr crook really i did matt slid a thin plastic catheter through the needle and into what he hoped was the pericardial space then carefully he withdrew the needle and fixed the catheter in place with a single suture through the skin of teagues chest blood oozed from the catheter opening and soaked an expanding stain into the sterile drape for several seconds there was nothing but a tense silence pressures still zero lee reported at the moment robert crook charged into the room a rotund ruddyfaced man crook had dense sandygray brows that always looked to matt like giant woolly caterpillars about to do battle along the margin of his left jaw were several fresh clots from where he had nicked himself shaving as well as a tiny bloodstained flake of tissue paper his response to the emergency at mcrh had clearly been to charge into the bathroom and break out his razor and shaving mug rutledge whats going on he demanded matt shrugged he lost his blood pressure and i couldnt figure out why i decided he had a pericardial tamponade so i tapped him you tapped him still no pressure lee called out be sure the dopamine is open all the way matt ordered it is did you see pericardial fluid on his echo crook asked ignoring the sterile field and the thin catheter in order to listen with his stethoscope i wasnt able to get an echo no time crook erupted jesus christ how can you be sure youve stuck that needle into his pericardial space and not into his friggin heart i did what i thought was right matt responded as steadily as he could manage i did what i thought was needed and i did it the best i could the best you could rutledge youre not a doctor youre a goddamn cowboy a loose cannon and i want you to know that i fully intend to report your actions to wait the nurse cried out i hear a pressure its loud and clear at sixty no now its eighty its eighty at that moment darryl teague lifted one arm and turned his head chapter mornin kim matt said to the efficient empathetic clerk of the icu good morning doctor was the chilly reply matt considered confronting the woman kim west had always been at least cordial to him if not downright friendly but there was no sense in singling out her rudeness the belinda coal and coke company was the lifeblood of the valley in one way or another all of montgomery county was linked to it over the three days since he saved the life of darryl teague the coolness toward him on the streets of belinda had grown increasingly unpleasant teague had never been a favorite son of the town and now two young men were dead because of him and because of matt he wasnt the gas station scottys diner the dry cleaner wherever he went there were whispers and tension even in the hospital where people should have known better about the choices doctors should and should not be making within hours of the incident in the er robert crook had sent a memo to the entire hospital staff decrying matts behavior and judgment he even speculated that poor technique in doing the pericardial aspiration had placed the man in as much jeopardy as had the accident itself teague was officially crooks patient and the cardiologist had gone out of his way to involve an internist other than matt in his care still matt had made it a point to visit teague twice a day since the disaster helping to save a persons life forged a connection only those who had been in that situation could completely understand ignoring the distasteful glare from one of the older nurses a miners mother matt recalled he went directly to room the lights were out save for a dim fluorescent over the bed teague his monstrously deformed face battered and bruised lay on his back breathing shallowly and irregularly on a ventilator he was unconscious as he had been since shortly after his transfer up from the er from what matt could tell there was no decent explanation for his lapse into a coma initially blunt head trauma was the likely suspect and that certainly remained a possibility still there had been no order for an mri or ct scan or even for a consultation with the neurologist robert crook certainly wasnt going to win any doctor of the year award for his attention to this case although he might well receive a good citizen medal from the townsfolk matt stood in the gloom looking down at darryl teague what happened to you darryl he asked silently what did you and teddy rideout inhale what did you drink what did you rub onto your skin matt took teagues wrist and checked his pulse which was quite strong the torn vessel that had caused the nearly lethal cardiac tamponade had clotted and the narrow drain which had been placed under the pericardial membrane had been removed now to all intents teagues mysterious coma was all that was standing between him and a transfer out of mcrh probably to some prison hospital matt did a brief neurological check nothing alarming no focal signs that would suggest a slowly increasing hemorrhage between the skull and brain he reached up and gently touched the hard fleshy lump above teagues left eyebrow then the one on his chin had the man ever bothered to see a doctor for this bizarre condition or did his rapidly progressive mental illness prevent him from acting rationally whats the deal darryl matt whispered come on wake up and tell me whats the deal he picked up the bedside phone hesitated then called the pathology lab in seconds his uncle was on the line hal howre you doing well i dont have half the town wanting to tar and feather me for just doing my job if thats what you mean theres a nurse right outside wholl be happy to smear the first glob on me listen hal im here in teagues icu cubicle you may already know this but hes been in a coma since right after he was moved up here from the er im wondering if someones medicating him why first if then why is there any way you could have one of your techs draw an extra tube and run a drug screen on it without telling crook thats the idea i would draw it myself but there would be hell to pay if a nurse walked in on me while i was doing it ill do it nephew but i expect a pouch of premium tobacco next christmas no more ties you sure i think i still have three or four left in my closet im sure okay no more ties thanks unk matts office occupied the first floor of a shingled old twofamily just off main street near the center of town he parked his harley by the garage in back and entered through the rear door the moment he stepped inside he could hear an animated exchange coming from his waiting room the voice a womans was strident and shrill responding to her evenly civilly as always was mae borden his office manager and receptionist now mrs goodwin mae was saying im not trying to convince you not to switch doctors but i do think you owe it to your husband to think things through matt stopped just short of the door to his office and leaned against the wall in the hallway charlies the one who made me come the woman said hes very upset about what happened in the mine you mean dr rutledge saving that boys life yes the two men teague killed were friends a charlies an the mines been closed for three days now because a the damage teague did down there thats money outta everyones pockets i understand tell me something mrs goodwin if your husband had been the one driving that equipment that night would you have wanted dr rutledge to do all he could well i i suppose i would and has dr rutledge always given you two the best of care a course he has and you want to switch doctors well i mrs goodwin supposin i keep your records here until charlie comes in and speaks with me or better still with dr rutledge im not supposed to say this but i know for a fact that the two of you are among his favorite patients hed hate to lose you well the truth is id hate to lose him too so mrs borden i was really hopin youd talk me outta this ill tell charlie ifn he wants to go through with it hes got t come in an face dr rutledge hisself i suspect hell be relieved you didnt do it i think he will too thank you oh thank you so much matt heard the front door open and shut its okay matthew mae called out shes gone you can come in here now matt entered the modest waiting area and kissed his office manager on the cheek i have some eskimos i want to sell refrigerators to he said i think youre just the woman for the job no thanks i cant stand the cold bless you for saving my practice oh its not been that bad mae replied in her melodic alabama drawl six attempted defections so far only three successful ones mae had been matts office manager since the day he entered practice she was in her fifties but her silver hair and conservative manner and dress added a decade to that over the years the two of them had become bound by their differences as well as by a total devotion to the practice and their patients in addition to making the best pot of coffee in town mae was a wizard at squeezing in any patient who needed to be seen and at adjusting a bill for anyone who couldnt pay im afraid this teague business has made me a few enemies around town mae matt said correction sir people in town like you and respect the kind of doctor you are many of them sympathize with you because of the losses youve endured but theyre losing patience since you came back here to practice your attempts to get the mine fined or even shut down for safety violations have already rankled a whole bunch of people its made you an irritant in some quarters and the butt of jokes in others saving darryl teague has merely pushed the envelope mae come on now stop mincing words what do you really think mae smiled in spite of herself very funny she said but its not so funny when people wont come to see the best doctor in the valley because they think hes always crusading to take away their livelihood im not crusading to take away anyones livelihood its just that matthew open your eyes mae cut in ever since ginny died youve had blinders on you were already writing letters to the mine safety people and trying to make every injury in the mine a federal case after she passed away you just havent let up and what have you got to show for it nothing ahha matt said now thats where youre wrong he raced into his office and returned with a stack of magenta paper i have these to show for it fresh from the copy store he set the sheets on maes counter and passed one over wanted information on illegal toxic waste dumping or storage at any mine in montgomery county reward for information leading to msha or epa action complete confidentiality guaranteed remember its your health the healthy mines coalition lord mae groaned healthy mines coalition i thought that sounded better than matthew rutledge md matthew when are you going to see the light you cant hurt these people they have more money than we could ever dream of and more influence in high places than they need to brush off a fly like you going against them you can only hurt yourself mae ginny died of a type of cancer that only shows up one in a million times in female nonsmokers her age now along comes two cases of a totally unusual syndrome in two men who both just happen to be miners how can you not believe that bc and c is responsible do you have any idea how many barrels of toxic petrochemicals they generate converting coal into fertilizers or paint or especially coke where are they if nothing else matt had done his homework the production of coke the derivative of coal that was essential to the production of iron and ultimately steel was to his mind a major culprit with enough plant space equipment and technology certain types of coal could be utilized nearly percent but various byproducts of production creosotes tars pitches and many other hydrochemicals if not generated in sufficient quantities to be commercially valuable had to be disposed of safely or else stored it was in this area that matt believed the powers at bc ampc were cutting their most dangerous corners shaking her head more in frustration than disapproval mae handed the fliers back to him you have five minutes before jim kinchley she said i sent him over to the lab for routine bloods and an ekg perfect mae dont worry well do fine mae smiled thinly and returned to her business matt repaired to his office and began working his way through the pile of lab reports and charts on his desk as usual mae made sense he was thinking when was the last time one of his letters to the editor had actually been published and what about the abortive town meeting he had held where there were only seven attendees including his mother uncle and two homeless people who were clearly there for the coffee and cookies he looked up just as a scarlet tanager alighted on a branch of the white oak outside his window for a minute maybe even longer the magnificently colored little songbird perched there motionless looking it seemed directly at him ginny the bird remained fixed in its spot ginny is that you from the doorway mae borden cleared her throat discreetly matthew are you okay huh oh sure im fine he glanced back at the tree but the tanager was gone you were thinking about your wife werent you no i mean yes yes i was i thought so you know mae its been almost four years and the feelings havent really changed inside me at all if anything i miss her more than ever first its a cloud that reminds me of her then a scene in the woods or the way a woman on the sidewalk looks from behind just now it was a bird a tanager only this time it didnt just remind me of her mae i had this powerful feeling it was her no matter how hard i try i cant seem to get my brain around how long forever is i keep thinking that some directors going to walk into the room clap his hands and announce that this scene is over and we get to move on to the next the one where shes waiting at home to tell me about her day with the kids at school mae crossed the room and set her hand on his shoulder you have every right to hold fast to the memories of her she said so long as they dont blot out the life you have left to live with your dad gone and your mother bless her soul getting more and more sick and the hours you spend working here and in the hospital and now this mine thing i wonder sometimes how you do it the trick is to have those memories remind you not of what life was but of how wonderful it can be again if youd allow it i hear you i hope you do mae walked around to the corner of the desk and picked up the stack of magenta fliers you going to throw those away matt asked no she said her tone and expression bittersweet im going to put them up all around town who knows as she left matts office the phone was ringing through his open door he heard her answer it dr rutledges office when any idea why ill tell him right away thank you thank you for calling she set the receiver down and moments later appeared at the doorway matthew that was janice in the icu darryl teague just had a sudden cardiac arrest they tried resuscitating him but nothing worked hes dead chapter it was the second straight day of unremitting rain nikki solari hated running in this kind of weather but today she was considering doing it anyway it had been more than a week since her roommate and close friend kathy wilson had stormed from their south boston flat a week without so much as a word to her or to their mutual friends the police had been surprisingly little help nikki had filled out the appropriate forms and brought in some photographs but so far nothing miss solari try to relax im sure your friend will turn up its doctor solari and why are you so sure thats the way it is with cases like this everyone worries and the missing person just shows up well this missing person is an incredibly talented musician who would never leave her band in the lurch which she has she is a wonderfully dependable friend who would never do anything to upset me which she has and she is an extremely compassionate and kind woman who would never say anything abusive to anyone yet before she disappeared she had become abusive to everyone doctor solari tell me something honestly were you and miss wilson lovers oh christ nikki desperately needed to wrest the worry from her brain if only for a while and the only ways she had ever been able to do so were running making music and performing autopsies it was eleven in the morning one more hour until lunch she could go out and splash through a few miles then she stood by the window of her office watching the cars creep down albany street past the modern building that was the headquarters of the chief medical examiner and his staff this was her third year as an associate in me josef kellers office she was fascinated by the work and absolutely adored the man but the past week had been hell she glanced over at her desk there were reports to be read dictations to do and several boxes of slides to review but the concentration just wasnt there hey there beautiful youve got a case without waiting for an invitation brad cummings strode into the office divorced with a couple of kids cummings was the deputy chief medical examiner he was athletic urbane and in the eyes of perhaps every woman in the city except nikki handsome she found him smug selfabsorbed and way too pretty quite possibly the absolute antithesis of what she was looking for in a man wheres dr keller she asked away until one that means im the boss until then so i get to say who gets what case and you get this tubber this what sixtysixyearold guy had a coronary getting into his jacuzzi smacked his head on the side and went for the eternal swim hes just eight months postbypass surgery i spoke to his doctor who said he was on mucho cardiac meds and undoubtedly had an mi so hes really just a view you dont have to cut on him at all and that means we have time to go have lunch at that place on newbury street ive been telling you about brad i dont want to go out with you but i thought you broke up with that drip you were dating correction that drip broke up with me and im not interested in starting up with another one she digs me i can tell at the best of times nikki had precious little patience for the man brad you have more than enough scalps hanging on your lodge pole without mine and im sure there are plenty more where those came from well keep getting along fine so long as you keep things on a business or collegial basis but i promise you brad call me beautiful again or sweets or honey or babe or anything other than nikki or dr solari and ill write you up and hand it over to dr keller clear hey easy does it nikki could tell that he stopped himself at the last possible instant from adding babe im going to get started on the new case she said i told you this is a straightforward view no scalpel required just eyeball him and sign off if its all the same to you ill make that decision after ive seen the guy nikki didnt add that there wasnt a chance in the world she would pass on this case regardless of how openandshut it was here was the perfect opportunity to get her mind off of kathy for a few hours without getting soaked on the streets of boston suit yourself cummings said three days what three days thats how long the dudes been in the water hes a little um bloated sure you dont want to just view and then skidoo have a good lunch brad nikki changed into scrubs and located the remains of roger belanger on the center of three stainlesssteel tables in autopsy suite the daughter of an italian and an irishwoman she could easily trace her thick black hair and wide some said sensuous mouth to her father and her fair skin seagreen eyes slender frame and caustic wit to her mom at her fathers urging she had tried to follow his rather large footsteps into surgery but after a year of residency she switched to pathology realizing that her desire to have a life outside of medicine was precluded by spending most of it in the or or on rounds not once had she regretted her decision belanger was hardly the most unsightly corpse nikki had ever examined but neither was he at all pleasant to look at overweight and nearly eggbald he was extremely bloated and discolored with purplish marbling of his skin his flaccid limbs were well past rigor mortis the white scar from his bypass ran the length of his breastbone goodbye for now kath she thought as she began to focus in on the details of the body ill let you back in in two hours no matter how obvious a case is joe keller had reminded her on more than one occasion no matter how apparently openandshut you must make no assumptions process is everything if you stick to process step by step you will seldom have to explain having missed something step one read over as much information as you can lay your hands on about the subject step two inspect every millimeter of the skin nikki used the footactivated dictation system as she went there is a wellhealed threeinch scar in the right lower abdominal quadrant possibly from an appendectomy a teninch scar less than a year old down the midanterior chest a teninch scar of about the same age on the inner right thigh probably from harvesting a vein for his bypass and a wellhealed twoinch scar just below the left patella probably from the repair of a laceration many years ago there is a single contusion just above and behind the right ear with discoloration and some swelling but no depression of the bone beneath there is a nickelsized abrasion just beneath the right mandible that nikki peered at the innocentlooking scrape it was the only place on belangers waterlogged body where skin was actually scraped off she put on a pair of magnifying goggles and illuminated the area with a gooseneck lamp the abrasion was actually a perfect hexagon and in the center of the shape were ten tiny bruises perfectly forming the letter h she photographed the area then proceeded with her meticulous examination process is everything an hour later she had accomplished two major things she had in fact managed temporarily to drive her concerns for kathy wilson from her mind and she had come within one final step of proving that roger belanger had been murdered she stripped off her gloves grabbed the boston yellow pages and made a call minutes later she paged brad cummings jesus he said the dishes clinking in the background this pager goes off so infrequently it scared the heck out of me you almost done we were just waiting for our flans nikki didnt want to go anywhere near who we was i need you to pick something up for me and come back to the office brad but no buts no flans just go to mulvaneys pool and patio on route right after the mall you know where that is yes theyll have a package waiting in your name eleven ninetyfive plus tax ill pay you back hurry for the next fortyfive minutes nikki finished collecting her specimens and waited inexorably her concerns for her friend reemerged the two of them met almost three years ago at a folk club in cambridge nikki had been a classical violinist from age three when her father enrolled her in a suzuki method class she played in chambermusic groups right through college and medical school when time allowed and was reasonably satisfied with what she got from her music that is until she heard kathy wilson and the lost bluegrass ramblers play kathy sang lead and played strings mandolin guitar and bass with astounding deftness and heart nikki had heard bluegrass before but in truth she had never paid much attention to it that night the ramblers and kathy in particular brought her an exhilaration that had long ago vanished from the music she played and listened to after the performance she waited by the dressing room door i dont collect autographs she said once kathy had emerged but i wanted to tell you that i love your voice and your energy jes doin what comes naturally you play the fiddle professionally hardly how did you youve got a fiddlers mark right there under your jaw nikki knew the reddishbrown mark and the small lump beneath it caused by longterm pressure from her violins chin rest it became permanent sometime during college she said i play mostly chamber music eyes and necks thats how i judge a person eyes and necks an yours tell me you care a lot about people an about music half an hour later nikki was drinking beer with the band and sharing intimate details with kathy about her laughable lack of judgment when it came to choosing men a week after that kathy gave her a lesson in bluegrass over the two years that followed nikki developed into a reasonably proficient bluegrass musician good enough to sit in with the group when they werent touring girl youre capable of hittin on all cylinders when you put your mind and soul to it kathy said but you gotta learn how to shut out the extraneous especially all them folks who want a piece of you do that an youll feel your feet start floatin off the ground when you play from day one being around kathy was an adventure in spontaneity nikki had friends close good friends from college and before and two from medical school but from their earliest times together often talking and giggling from the end of a show until breakfast kathy and she were sisters ive had it with men kathy moaned after she and her bassist boyfriend had broken up for the third and last time pass the beer nuts is all theyre about that and apologizing for leaving the toilet seat up again but only after youve gone for another unexpected dip the night of that conversation a year ago they decided kathy would move into nikkis secondfloor flat in south boston the deal was onequarter rent and utilities for kathy plus weekly lessons for nikki kathy had been religious about giving them too when she and the band werent on tour she was a treasure absolutely irrepressible and in love with life in general and her music in particular not at all shy about grading every man nikki dated she once told a lawyer he simply wasnt interested enough in anything but himself and his bmw to have designs on her friend they were in a gritty club one of kathys and nikkis favorites and the man was fidgeting uncomfortably as if battling the desire to wash down the furniture and probably some of the patrons as well often outspoken when she was sober kathy had consumed perhaps a beer or so too many give it up counselor she said suddenly as nikki sat watching in stunned silence i know this woman heres beautiful an i know shes smart an i know shed look great at your office christmas party to say nothin of in your bed but i am the guardian of her chastity and im tellin you what shes too damn nice to say there aint no set of car keys you can produce is gonna get her to where you want her to be not highly educated in any traditional book sense kathy was a patient listener wildly funny when she wanted to be and always philosophical in an earthy homespun way the perfect roommate at least until the mood swings began it might have been four or five months ago when the sleeplessness started two three four in the morning she would be pacing the apartment or walking the streets then a day or two or even three would go by without her coming back to the apartment at all soon after her meltdowns began at home and with the band rages that could neither be predicted nor controlled nikki begged her to see a doctor and even arranged for several appointments none of which kathy kept finally maybe six or seven weeks ago odd lumps began appearing on her face the first two just above her eyebrows then one by her ear and another on her cheek she wouldnt let nikki touch them or even talk about them until ten days ago in a rare totally lucid moment she sank onto a chair in the kitchen buried her face in her hands and sobbed nikki whats happening to me where has my mind gone where has my music gone why are they doing this to me her sobbing became uncontrollable nikki held her tightly and felt the fear and confusion in her body beneath her hair she could feel more lumps solid rather than cystic slightly movable not tender that she could tell lymph nodes some weird kind of firm cyst neurofibromas it was impossible to tell nikki begged her to come with her to the er finally kathy agreed to see nikkis doctor the next day but at the appointment time she was nowhere to be found she came back to the apartment once more that nikki knew of then vanished again nikki how are you doing dr josef keller had entered the autopsy suite and now stood beside the bloated corpse of roger belanger nikki had covered the open thorax and abdominal cavities with moist towels keller a german jew whose family had fled the holocaust was a year or two from retirement but was still vibrant curious and energetic still the strain of overseeing a department responsible for the evaluation of more than fifty thousand deaths statewide each year was taking its toll he limped from arthritis in his hip and had a back condition that made it painful to bend over the cadavers for long im glad youre here nikki said this is an interesting case i thought this man had a coronary keller replied with still the hint of an accent well i think he was murdered murdered have you been watching reruns of that pathologist show um what was his name quincy nope i may be wrong but here look at this first nikki showed him the bizarre abrasion beneath belangers chin a ring keller asked immediately on top of things as usual i think so with diamond studs forming the initial exactly theres more nikki handed over the otoscope the tool used by physicians to examine the ear canal and drum more often than not she had found residents and even boardcertified pathologists omitting this part of the postmortem exam process keller took his time murmuring to himself as he examined belangers ears by turning the large violet head from one side to the other and back and inserting the otoscope into the external ear canal ruptured with flakes of dried blood he said finally both eardrums were ruptured shortly before his death i havent been to see his jacuzzi nikki said but i would bet it isnt at least five feet deep five feet the minimum depth where the pressure on the drums if not equalized could cause rupture you are postulating that this man did not drown in his tub i am i think he drowned all right but i think someone he was swimming with someone with the initial h on his ring in diamond studs dragged him underwater by the throat maybe to the bottom of a pool and then brought him home and put him in the tub an argument perhaps and the water in his lungs and stomach im waiting for home is the hunter home from the kill oh hi joe its home from the hill brad nikki said did you pick up the package i did what do you need chlorine test strips for i think your tubber as you so quaintly put it actually drowned in a pool but then how did murdered you are exceedingly sharp nikki said no wonder they named you brad she dipped one of the strips into the water from belangers stomach in seconds the tiny indicator square had turned faint purple i am most impressed keller said i shall call our friends at the station house and let them know this is quite fascinating quite fascinating indeed he limped back to his office good thing i insisted you do a full autopsy on this guy brad said nikki glared at the man but honestly couldnt tell if he was being serious the overhead speaker kept her from finding out dr solari are you still in there yes ruth im here theres an outside call for you im going to transfer it seconds later the wall phone rang brad held his ground as she passed forcing her to squeeze between him and belangers autopsy table grow up she said she digs me brad said this time nikki ignored him pathology this is dr solari nikki nikki felt her heart stop kath where are you honey are you all right kathy wilsons voice was that of a small child nikki im so cold theyre after me and im so cold there were traffic noises in the background now a car horn she was calling from a pay phone kathy stay calm im going to help you youre going to be all right why are they trying to kill me nik why am i so cold hey what gives brad cummings asked nikki snapped a finger against her lips then waved him out of the room get out she mouthed okay okay you know youre really very touchy today you must be having your out this time she shouted the word pouting theatrically cummings left kathy listen just tell me where you are and ill come right over and get you kath youre just like all the others nikki you want my music to stop is that why theyre after me because they want my music to stop her singsong voice was haunting and vague nikki imagined her on some street corner huddled at a pay phone kiosk in the pouring rain she cast about for some way to alert the police and maybe have this call traced kathy she tried look around and tell me what you see nikki nikki nikki you sent them didnt you you sent them to silence my music ill get you for this nikki ill get you if its the last thing i do i love you kathy youre my friend i would never do anything to hurt you in your heart you know that honey youre not thinking clearly right now youve got to come home let me help you help me kathy just tell me what to do there was a prolonged silence kathy nikki waited for another thirty seconds before slowly setting the receiver in its cradle then making no attempt to deal with the cadaver of roger belanger she burst into tears and raced from the room chapter it was a gray blustery day a day totally befitting a funeral matt was one of just twelve mourners at the graveside service for darryl teague the other eleven were relatives of one sort or another all of whom lived in the hills north of town the irony was hardly lost on matt that in clear view of the dreary overgrown cemetery were the tall hills that housed the bc ampc mine but the day held another irony it wasnt until he stepped off his harley and approached the rectangular pit that he realized this was the first funeral he had been to in nearly four years the last one was his wifes matt recalled that day with painful clarity the crowd the limousines the flowerbedecked hearse bearing what remained of the woman he had all too happily pledged to love until death did them part only death hadnt ended his love for her not at all the illkept cemetery bordered by an irregular row of shrubs was at the center of a broad rolling treeless field teagues grave on the far west side was marked by a hastily erected roughcut chunk of marble with the initials dt crudely chiseled into it nothing more virginia mclaren rutledge beloved daughter sister and teacher beloved wife of matthew rutledge matt stopped by his mothers house three or four times a week but he visited ginnys grave nearly every day often leaving a leaf or sprig of her hawthorn tree sometimes a flower sometimes he would stay only a few minutes but others he would sit for an hour or more by her stone reading or just staring off across the valley each visit seemed to strengthen the bond he felt with the only woman save his mother he had ever truly loved of his friends and family only mae borden knew how often he went to the saints and angels cemetery matthew she had said several times in one way or another we all miss her and love her but we love you too it is time for you to pick up the pieces and move on you have room in your heart for ginny and for someone new i know she wouldnt have wanted you to spend your life this way matt would respond with a shrug or a grunted acknowledgment and head off there was no sense in discussing something that simply wasnt going to happen the gaunt preacher performing the ceremony for darryl teague had little to say to his credit he made no attempt to lie he called darryl a carefree playful child who had grown away from god and had become an angry and troubled young man at the time of his death he read some bible passages and issued appropriate words of consolation to darryls parents and sister god works in mysterious ways he said as four men grasped heavy ropes and prepared to lower the plain pine box into the gaping maw in the earth god works in mysterious ways there were rumblings around the hospital that matt was the last person known to have been in teagues room before his heart stopped irretrievably but no one could come up with a sensible explanation for why he might have saved the mans life one day and taken it just a few days later so natural causes became the consensus around town hal sawyers autopsy contributed little to solving the mystery as matt suspected teagues cracked sternum was the cause of the torn vessel that had resulted in his nearfatal tamponade beneath that fracture the heart muscle was bruised it was certainly the sort of injury that could have caused electrical instability and irregular rhythms in his heart hal signed the man out as a fatal arrhythmia secondary to a cardiac contusion secondary to accidental blunt chest trauma the lumps over teagues face and head were nothing more than neurofibromas the brain itself was grossly normal leaving hal with no immediate explanation for teagues coma full toxicology studies would not be available for another week or two but a preliminary screen had shown none of the depressants matt had wondered about a sharp gust of wind whipped across the field swirling dust around the small assembly of mourners who were singing a hymn matt vaguely remembered from his youth he found his thoughts drifting to his father bc ampc had been found blameless in the cavein that killed matthew rutledge sr but matt only fifteen then had heard rumors of safety funds diverted corners cut and even men paid off we will close our service with the twentythird psalm pallbearers may lower the casket as we recite the lord is my shepherd i shall not want no one except matt had even suggested that ginnys bizarre cancer was tied to the mine you yourself said that there are several hundred of these types of lung cancers around the country every year bc ampc president armand stevenson had said to him and with each of those cases i am sure theres a factory close by or a lab of some sort or even a mine i know youre frustrated dr rutledge your wife has just died i know youre angry and want to blame us well bc and c is not to blame i repeat the company is not to blame for your wifes death any more than it was to blame for your fathers he restoreth my soul matt watched as the casket was slowly lowered down onto the floor of the grave someone from the mine killed you darryl didnt they why what did you know had you stayed alive what could your body have told the world about them yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death matt forced his careening thoughts aside and joined the others in the final lines of the psalm when the service was over he accepted heartfelt thanks from teagues family for having tried to save his life then took a long slow walk out toward the hills and back ginny would have wanted him to keep pushing for answers now she was joined by darryl teague and teddy rideout their conditions were different but maybe the toxins responsible were different too well dont worry gin he thought sooner or later one way or another were going to nail them the one way or another clearly did not include the offering of a reward matt had printed three hundred of the magenta fliers mae had posted half of them around belinda and he had tacked up the other half in the adjacent towns within twentyfour hours nearly all of them were gone there had not been one response so much for the healthy mines coalition another battle lost matt thought but not the war not the goddamn war he swung the harley around and headed back to his office patients were waiting as it turned out there was a message waiting for him as well a message from armand stevenson requesting that matt come to the mine offices to meet with him and some of those in the company responsible for health and safety mae was smiling as she passed the note over yes matt exclaimed pumping his fist i thought you might be interested in going so i cleared you for tomorrow afternoon she said youre due out there at one it seems a bit presumptuous of you to assume i was interested in going he said i know i know mae replied matt kissed her on the cheek and settled in his office to await his first patient of the day not a minute later his uncle called hey hal we are officially off dead center im going out to the mine tomorrow to meet with stevenson i know thats why im calling what do you mean i just ran into your friend robert crook he told me stevenson had invited you out there crooks going to be there too as the head of the physician advisory committee for health and safety any idea what they want none but im calling to urge you to keep your cool no matter what you mean you think i shouldnt tell them up front that they killed my father and are probably responsible for my wifes death as well and now theyre poisoning miners something like that matt youve got a reputation with those people as a hothead try not to give them any reason to fire back at you not to worry im going to be just like mr rogers oh its a beautiful day in the neighborhood a beautiful day for a neighbor would you be mine see im practicing up seriously matt those people hold all the cards in this community i should think by now you would have figured that out i just want you to go easy have them view you as a responsible man ill do my best hal i promise listen thanks for calling give heidi a hug for me and dont worry responsible is my middle name at twelvethirty the following afternoon matt placed his two overstuffed bc ampc files into a gym bag strapped it onto the harley and headed west out of town hal only wanted what was best for him but he was a worrier this meeting was perhaps the first real break he had gotten he wasnt about to screw things up next to medicine and motorcycles the thing matt knew most about in the world was coal he had learned about it at the knee of his father and later on the internet and in the library he knew that the belinda coal and coke company and indeed the town itself owed its existence to a huge deposit of semibituminous coal first discovered in deep within the tall hills west of the town semibituminous coal also called smokeless coal was found at only three sites in the state smokeless coal was relatively free of impurities making it the choice for generating steam and also for producing coke the founders of bc ampc had the foresight to construct coking and chemical plants near the mine as well as a rail spur to speed their products wherever they needed to go the entire bc ampc operation was located on a vast dusty plateau and was completely surrounded by several miles of ninefoottall chainlink fence much of it topped with barbed wire matt had been to the mine just once since his fathers death on a guided tour he and ginny took shortly after he started work in the er today he was an anticipated guest the uniformed guard at the visitors gate greeted him by name before he could introduce himself and directed him to the sparkling twostory cedar and glass headquarters elaine leblancs assistant carmella cassetta was waiting for him in the carpeted reception area a former coalface miner herself she was attractive in a hardfeatured way and had married one of the execs in the company over the years matt and she had met on a few occasions and had gotten along reasonably well matt its so good to see you she said warmly extending her hand he tried unsuccessfully to read something into her being the one chosen to greet him he gestured at the spectacular sixfootsquare photos of bc ampc scenes historic and modern that adorned the lobby walls thanks this is quite the building it makes a good first impression we do a lot of business here national and international well we should hurry on over to the conference room theyre waiting for you i think youll be very excited with what they have to say you mean theyre going to let me live im looking forward to whatever it is as they neared the door to the conference room an elderly black woman approached from the other direction pushing a linencovered cart with coffee and danish theyll only be four agnes carmella said i wont be joining them matt thought he detected a pout in her voice at the prospect agnes drew back a few steps as carmella knocked once motioned matt and agnes in and left three men were waiting at the far end of a glossy mahogany table that had seating for twenty or so elaine leblanc robert crook and armand stevenson the ceo of the entire company stevenson was fiveseven if that with thinning sandy hair and very quick engaging blue eyes that remained fixed on matt from the moment he stepped into the room bc ampc was one of the largest privately owned companies in the state and stevenson was something of a legend for the aggressive tactics he used to keep every component of the empire profitable after peering curiously at the gym bag leblanc greeted matt with a single pulse of a handshake then released him as if trying to avoid a communicable disease his tense expression had matt wondering if whatever was about to transpire was not of his choosing crook avoided a handshake altogether substituting instead a curt nod a grunt that might have been matts name and a momentary clash of his caterpillar brows armand stevenson on the other hand was smiling cordial and very much in charge of the proceedings please sit down matthew if i may call you that he said after his offer of something stronger than coffee was declined mattll do and armand for me we appreciate your being able to come out at such short notice matt i understand your father worked here he was a shift foreman and he died in an accident an explosion yes is that where your hard feelings toward the mine and our company stem from stevenson was firing straight from the hip no wasted motion matt reminded himself that people like stevenson didnt become gazillionaires by not knowing what they were doing perhaps thats true he replied some of the things i was told by my fathers friends and coworkers led me to believe that the explosion and cavein that killed him might have been preventable remember i was only fifteen at the time plenty of what i went through at age fifteen still influences my life stevenson said sipping at his perrier how long has it been since you returned home to practice matt wanted to demand he get to the point but remembered his uncles caveat besides stevenson hardly seemed like the sort one could push around about six years he said realizing that his inquisitor undoubtedly knew the answers to all the questions he was asking if the point of these preliminary questions was to put him at ease they failed miserably stevenson opened his briefcase and set a thick file on the table matt these correspondences are all from you to msha the department of labor the epa senator alexander senator brooks or representative delahanty he slid the file across but matt held his palm out to indicate that wasnt necessary i have copies myself he said patting the gym bag at one time or another without to the best of my information ever setting foot in the mine you have accused us of substandard ventilation antiquated and dangerous equipment working hours in excess of the collective bargaining agreement with the umw toxic emissions from our processing plant toxic waste dumping illegal waste disposal and just about every other violation imaginable short of not enough toilet paper in our rest rooms actually i think one of the miners i speak to from time to time did complain about that as well stevensons laugh seemed genuine and now youre posting notices and offering rewards he went on well as i know better than anyone your charges and allegations are groundless and as you know better than anyone all this paper youve generated hasnt amounted to more than a spit in the ocean then why am i here elaine the head of mine safety and healths attempt at a smile lacked any semblance of warmth he cleared his throat and took a gulp of water whatever he was about to share wasnt coming easily well matt he managed finally as armand said you havent been the least bit successful in goading msha or the epa or any of the others youve contacted to run an inspection on bc and c other than the routine ones they always do but that doesnt mean you havent been a pebble in our shoe we have wasted a fair amount of time responding to your allegations and in fact we have invited the msha people here two or three times just to prove were on the upandup but all that has taken up valuable time so doc crook here made a suggestion matt glanced sideways at crook and saw nothing other than disdain and maybe even a hint of despair whatever was about to be laid out was armand stevensons doing not crooks or leblancs thats right crook muttered so leblanc went on were pleased to be able to offer you a position on our health advisory board that way you can be right up close to the action here and you can see for yourself how we do things youll be required to attend meetings every four months and of course to submit your concerns for the whole committee to evaluate rather than the vigilante way youve been doing it so far the stipend for being on the committee is a nice round fifty thousand a year fifty thousand matt wasnt sure whether he had merely thought the words or shouted them out given the limitations imposed by managed care and the socioeconomic status of his patients he still wasnt earning much over that annually of course stevenson added proudly the money will be paid to you in such a way absolutely legal i assure you that you will incur little or no tax burden matt was speechless he knew a bribe when he heard one but this was bribe with a capital b money had never been a big deal for him if it had he would have been much more adept at generating it as things stood he was managing okay but fifty thousand a year extra would enable him to start some sort of retirement fund as well as enable him to give more to those causes he supported i thanks but no thanks he suddenly heard himself saying i appreciate your offer really i do but i find my hands are more useful when theyre not tied down youre a fool rutledge crook blurted out i tried to tell them that but they wouldnt listen a troublemaker and a fool stevenson glowered at the cardiologist then made one last attempt to save face perhaps youd like to think over our offer for a few days he said his smile now tightlipped his eyes darkened matt shook his head what i want is free rein to bring in a group of my choosing to inspect conditions in the plant and the mine including a review of your records of how and where every drop of toxic waste is disposed of what i want is for you to step back and stop paying off whoever you do at msha and epa youre out of your mind leblanc shot out no youre out of your mind matt could feel the blood rushing into his face he usually had a fairly long fuse but at the end of it was an explosive temper youre out of your mind to think that any decent doctor he punctuated the words with a glare at crook would turn his back on cases like darryl teague and teddy rideout tell me dr rutledge stevenson asked now clearly peeved is it your wifes death that makes you so vindictive do you blame us for her as well matt went off like a roman candle as a matter of fact i do he shouted youre damn right i do lung cancer you should try living with someone whos dying of it sometime yes i blame you i blame you for every single thing thats bad and sick around here youre a sleazebag leblanc and you crook christ how can you call yourself a doctor when you turn your back on death and pain screw you screw you all and your goddamn bribe armand stevenson must have pressed a button beneath the table because in seconds two mammoth security men in bc ampcmonogrammed sport coats and ties were in the room stevensons order was a nod of the head one of the behemoths took hold of matts arm let go of me jerk matt screamed he wrenched away and grabbed his gym bag touch me again and youd better have a spare set of nuts in spite of himself the guard checked out matts heavy motorcycle boots armand stevenson saved him from having to find a way around them follow him outside and make sure hes off the property he said youve made your choice doctor now youll have to deal with the consequences youre threatening to take jobs away from folks that sort of thing isnt looked on very kindly around here not kindly at all now get out chapter ellen kroft knelt beside her granddaughter and held the girl tightly by her shoulders trying to force even a moment of eye contact of connection of any kind grandma loves you lucy she said carefully enunciating every word as she would to a threeyearold have a wonderful day at school the girl now nearly eight contorted her face into something of a grimace then twisted her neck so that she was looking upward past ellen at the sky not a word nearly five years of expensive schooling at the best specialneeds facility around and there still were almost never any words lucy goosey are you ready for school the teacher of lucys small class at the remlinger institute in alexandria virginia was named gayle she was in her twenties and new to the school but she had the youthful exuberance upbeat demeanor and saintly patience required for a life of trying to reach and teach severely autistic children gayle held out her hand lucys head kept swinging rhythmically from side to side like the switching of a horses tail she neither avoided the proffered hand nor reached for it only if it were something spinning flashing or brightly colored would she have reacted eight years old it had been five years since the diagnosis of profound autism was made on the girl and nearly four since ellen began bringing her to school so that her daughter beth could get to work come on lucy gayle sang leading her off say goodbye to grandma say goodbye to grandma ellen laughed to herself sardonically there had been a time when lucy kroftgarland could do just that well not anymore she turned and was opening the door of her sixyearold taurus when gayle cried out lucy her back arched inward to an extent that seemed anatomically impossible was on the lawn in the throes of a violent grand mal seizure quickly but with businesslike calm ellen reached in the glove compartment of her car withdrew four wooden tongue depressors bound together at the end with adhesive tape and then hurried over lucys teeth were snapping together like a jackhammer threatening damage to her lips and tongue saliva was frothing out of the corner of her mouth what should i do gayle asked ive seen some of the children have seizures but never lucy well i have ellen said rolling her grandchild onto her side so that should she vomit she wouldnt aspirate her stomach contents next she squeezed her thumb and third finger forcefully into the angle of the childs jaw bit by bit the pressure overcame the spasm in lucys muscles a small gap opened up between her teeth and ellen expertly inserted the makeshift tongue blade device with one hand holding the blades in place and the other maintaining lucy on her side she nodded to gayle that matters were under control should i have mr donnegan call nineoneone gayle asked no dear lucy will be fine we just need a little time here ill go get mr donnegan anyway do that the violent seizure had largely abated when the headmaster arrived ellen was sitting on the grass lucys head cradled in her lap the girl was unconscious now post ictal the doctors called the condition ellen checked that lucy hadnt soiled or wet herself then looked up at the headmaster and shrugged should we send for an ambulance he asked shell be fine in twenty minutes this hasnt happened for a while her medication may have to be tweaked if its okay with you id just as soon she stay in school if possible just leave us right here for a bit if shes not up and about in twenty minutes ill take her home but shes better off here with the other children much better donnegan looked for a moment as if he was going to object but instead reached down and patted ellen on the shoulder whatever you say mrs kroft he said you know this kid best ellen sat on the newly mowed lawn staring off at nothing in particular rocking lucy gently in her arms and making no attempt to stem the steady flow of tears from her own eyes minutes later the girl began to come around ellen slid behind the wheel of the taurus and headed north in moments in spite of herself she was reliving the horrible sequence of phone calls that had signaled the start of it all mom somethings wrong with lucy i took her to the pediatrician this morning he said she was in terrific shape fiftieth percentile in height and weight way ahead of most threeyearolds in speech and handeye coordination then he gave her two shots a dpt and an mmr that was about eight hours ago now shes screaming mom her temperature is oneohthreeandahalf and she wont stop screaming no matter what what should i do i called the doctor he says not to worry lots of kids get irritable after their vaccinations just give her tylenol mom im frightened really frightened shes not screaming anymore lout shes completely out of it her eyes keep rolling hack into her head and she doesnt respond to anything i say nothing shes like limp dick is getting the car right now were going to bring her to the emergency room theyre going to keep lucy in the hospital they dont know whats wrong with her maybe a seizure of some sort the doctor says mommy its bad im so scared its bad i know it is oh jesus what am i going to do my baby what am i going to do beths panicked words echoed in ellens thoughts as they did almost every school day after dropoff with effort she forced them to the background there were other things to focus on this day most notably a strategy meeting across the potomac at the headquarters of pave parents advocating vaccine education driving by rote ellen headed up the george washington parkway toward the teddy roosevelt bridge and dc now a trim silverhaired sixtythree she still recalled all too vividly the day just before her fiftyfifth birthday when she went according to her husband at least from being goodlooking to being a damn finelooking woman for your age a year and a half later howard had left their twentynineyear marriage and run off to be with a thirtysomething cocktail waitress he had met during an engineering convention in vegas at the time it was as if her life on cruising speed had hit a brick wall she accepted an early retirement package from the middle school where she was teaching science and then effectively pulled down the shades of her existence shutting herself in and her friends out ironically it was the tragedy surrounding lucy that pulled her back into the world she had always been a positive upbeat person but howards hurtful and unexpected departure coupled with the end of lucys life as a vibrant healthy child had been a onetwo punch that threatened to send her spiraling to the bottom of a valium bottle with the help of unrelenting friends and a godsend of a therapist she gradually opened the blinds again and began putting one foot in front of the other now working out at the gym several times a week intimately involved in her granddaughters life doing volunteer work at pave and functioning as the lone consumer representative on the blue ribbon federal panel evaluating the experimental supervaccine omnivax she was running on all cylinders ellen lucked into a parking space not half a block from pave headquarters for a few years after its inception in the mideighties pave had been a true grassroots organization run from the kitchen tables of its two founders cheri sanderson and sally lynch both of whom were convinced that their children had been irreparably damaged by vaccinations one family at a time the two mothers discovered they were not alone and now through vision patience and hard work pave had become a major force with interest and even some support up to the highest levels of congress in addition to tens of thousands of supporting members the words research education and choice emblazoned on their logo expressed the agencys goals we are not a bunch of carrie nations charging into immunization centers with axes cheri had explained during ellens first volunteerorientation session but we are tough when we have to be we will not stop until the powers that be recognize the need for research on the immediate and longterm effects of vaccines as well as the critical need for public education and ultimately parental choice when it comes to vaccinating our children pave had its vehement detractors in the scientific pediatric infectious disease and political arenas but with each passing year morbidity statistics clinical disasters wellattended pavesponsored scientific conferences and parents who experienced what they felt certain was a causeeffect relationship between vaccinations and their childrens disabilities added to the organizations influence membership and war chest in the early nineties the now taxexempt corporation moved its extensive library dozens of drawers of case files sevenperson staff and cadre of committed volunteers to the second floor of a brownstone on th street between dupont circle and adamsmorgan following the disaster with lucy ellen had begun to send in modest donations later she took the intensive workshop for volunteers conducted by cheri and became qualified to man the phones then a year or so after that word was passed on to pave of the establishment of a consumer seat alongside the scientists and physicians on the federal commission evaluating omnivax ellen was told by cheri and sally that as a retired middle school science teacher without a track record of militancy and confrontation on the vaccine issue she would be the perfect person for the job ultimately the powers at the fda agreed ellen suspected that those who offered her the appointment were certain either that she would remain relatively silent or that the scientists and physicians on the panel could easily preempt her views if they had to not that it mattered she was only one vote out of twentythree and support for the megavaccine and its thirty components was overwhelming from the start even if she opposed the project which in fact she did it was clear from the first meeting of the committee that the final tally would stand at twentytwo to one the door to the pave offices opened into a crowded work area with half a dozen desks all manned at the moment as ellen stepped into the room the staff on hand rose as one and applauded she did her best to wave them all back to their seats then smiled goodnaturedly and bowed over the past twoplus years they had all received frequent briefings of the omnivax sessions and at times verbatim transcripts they had all heard stories of how armed with epidemiological and research data she had painstakingly accumulated as well as affidavits from experts supporting the pave positions she had stood up to some of the leading proponents of expanding the scope of immunizations and as often as not she seemed to have held her own please please she said thats almost enough applause you there a little louder please much better now those of you who desire to and have washed themselves according to my protocol may come forward kneel and kiss my ring hey where you been sally lynch called out from the doorway a little trouble with lucy at school ellen replied nothing serious well cheris late too for a change shell be here in a few minutes unless she isnt she says she has big news for us in her midforties sally tall darkhaired and businesslike was more introspective and far less flamboyant than her codirector it was a perfect match one working behind the scenes the other in front of the cameras yet both possessing a high degree of intelligence compassion and drive if sally had a shortcoming it was her extreme intensity which sometimes clouded her judgment and at other times overwhelmed her patience but that ferocious commitment was understandable within hours of receiving his routine vaccination shot her sixmonthold son ian developed a temperature of over had a seizure and died just like that sallys office was as well organized and neat as cheri sandersons was cluttered on one wall was a professionally made threefootsquare multicolored graph showing that the number of autistic children seeking state services in california more than doubled in the eighties and nearly quadrupled in the nineties the other walls were covered with dozens of framed photographs most of them of autistic children whose condition their parents were certain was caused by vaccinations one of the photos an eightbyten directly behind sallys desk was of lucy tucked into the corner of the frame was a heartbreaking snapshot of the girl on a swing taken a few weeks before her catastrophic transformation coffee sally offered no thanks im already buzzed so in a few more days its over sally said referring to the impending commission vote on omnivax the subject of this mornings meeting of the three of them so i hear any headway you mean in changing votes what do you think sally slammed her fist on the desk gosh but this whole omnivax business is frustrating she said look at this ellen look its a research report put out by congress congress vaccine controversies can you imagine at last theyre asking questions all of a sudden they care here check this out all the drug manufacturers are being required by the fda and epa to remove mercury from their childhood vaccines do you know how many millions of kids got shot up before anyone even thought to take a look at the mercury situation here look dpt and polio vaccines modified rotavirus antidiarrhea vaccine recalled because of infant bowel injury and deaths hepatitis b vaccine being reexamined ellen the omnivax forces cant be allowed to win ellen sighed and stared out the window nothing sally was showing her now was news to her her small study at home was overflowing with notebooks textbooks xeroxed articles and computer printouts over the past twoplus years she had transformed herself from a concerned grandma to an expert on vaccinations and vaccines true there had been some victories like the mercury removal and the rotavirus vaccine recall but there was also an impressive regiment of respected and renowned scientists and pediatricians who were armed with data valid or flawed who could say showing the number of lives to be saved by each and every one of the vaccines slated for inclusion in omnivax thousands upon thousands of lives sally ellen said finally you and i both know the power and influence of those pushing this thing the deans of medical schools professors of pediatrics to say nothing of the president and his wife hey wazzapnin cheri sanderson bounced into the room a cup of coffee in one hand a bulging leather portfolio in the other fivethree if that cheri was a kinetic ball of energy and optimism ellen tells me the votes going to be twentytwo to one sally said what did you expect cheri replied these people were handpicked because they were going to vote yes hell the pharmaceutical giants finance many of their labs how would you expect them to vote youve done great ellen you stood your ground and presented our issues as well as anyone could have thanks im a little disappointed i havent had more of an impact but like you said the deck was stacked from the beginning so whats this news you have cheri paused dramatically the news is according to this press release from her office the antichrist of sensible vaccine thought lynette marquand herself will be addressing the nation from the fda on the day of the final panel debate on omnivax nice timing ellen said the final vote is scheduled for two days after that meeting first lady lynette marquand and secretary of health and human services dr lara bolton were the heavyweight champions of mass vaccinations four years ago lynettes husband jim had narrowly won a bitter hardfought election now with just a few months to go he was in a dogfight again neck and neck with the man he had beaten by only two points and just a dozen electoral votes one of his campaign promises the one with the greatest likelihood of coming to fruition unscathed was the development and distribution of a supervaccine the vaccine omnivax was to be given to infants early in life and eventually mandated for everyone containing up to thirty different antigens killed or modified viruses and bacteria it would be given as a shot for now and orally as soon as research already well under way permitted it the immune systems of the recipients would learn to make antibodies against the various germs so that should they encounter any of them in the future their defenses would be primed and ready to fight them off editorials had equated jim marquands bold pronouncement with the john kennedy promise to put a man on the moon now in this arena at least he was looking good what subtle timing ellen said lynette marquand is out stumping for her husband who is getting boatloads of pac money from the pharmaceutical industry and like cheri said a lot of these doctors and professors on your panel owe their careers to vaccine research grants from various drug manufacturers sally added so cheri asked do we have any bombshell ellen can explode at that session if lynettes media people do their jobs as well as they have so far there should be a gaggle and a half of reporters covering the show i dont know what to say ellen replied week after week month after month ive been searching for holes in what the committee is proposing breaking down every component of omnivax looking for some kind of scientifically valid study that would confirm that one of the thirty vaccines was flawed or even the opposite if one of the components was flawless she gestured to the graph behind sallys desk i cant even find any hard data that prove vaccinations contribute to the increase in autism increased awareness one expert tells me misdiagnosis chimes in another environmental factors pipes up someone else anecdotal poohpoohs a professor she calmed herself before continuing when i first joined the committee my teeth were bared and i was ready to chew them all apart for what they have and have not done i still want to do that believe me i do but therere so few scientific studies even on our side nothing about this whole vaccination business is clearcut except that we need to know more much more in the meantime the other side is going to win this particular battle and omnivax is about to leap into our culture you and cheri and everyone associated with pave including me have got to resolve to keep on fighting for the scientific truth whatever that is sally looked clearly frustrated all this time all your studying and you havent turned up anything about any of the components of omnivax she asked im still working on it ellen replied honest i am she felt the chill in sallys expression and hoped the woman couldnt tell that in fact she was holding back some information she believed that neither sally nor cheri could be trusted to remain silent until rudy petersons work on their behalf was further along especially with omnivax about to be approved rudy had been sifting through information on the supervaccine components for well over a year now without turning up anything damning there was however clinical data on one of the components that he felt was limited in scope and obtained by research that was a decade old and possibly shaky in design that component was lasaject a vaccine against the virus responsible for causing deadly lassa fever rudy was steadfast in maintaining that the data might still support the conclusions that the vaccine was safe he needed more time time during which the vaccines manufacturer was unaware of his investigation ellen felt certain that this wasnt the moment to tell the aggressive directors of pave that while there was no immediate chance of defeating omnivax there was lingering hope at least of denting it chapter look officer i don t want to be a pest but this woman is really ill and shes running around the city somewhere certain that some people are trying to kill her are you sure word is out maam i promise you this is the fourth day youve called everyone here knows about kathy wilson we have every car and every officer on the street looking out for her well call you as soon as we find her four days had passed since kathys call and not another word from her until just now when nikki returned home from the office there was a rambling message from her on their answering machine but no hint on caller id as to the origin of the call the disjointed vitriolic message was terrifying as much for its tone as its content kathy wilson was clearly insane joe keller continued to be as comforting as possible under the circumstances without being patronizing as the police continued to be he was as nikki would have expected fascinated with the rapid development of what he assumed from her description were neurofibromas twice he began a tutorial teaching session with her on the differential diagnosis of the condition but when it was apparent she was hearing only a fraction of what he was saying he set his marker down nikki paced restlessly about their twobedroom flat using a remote to change the fivedisc cd player from mahler to carly simon to miles davis to either of the two bluegrass ramblers cds and back every flat surface in the apartment seemed to hold a halfempty cup of tea or coffee more than once she had to battle back the urge to go out and buy a pack of merits her brand when she quit smoking more than ten years ago the living room was strewn with textbooks each open to some aspect of either neurofibromas or acute paranoia outside a steady rain had let up some but the wind was howling nikki flipped to the mahler again a powerful recording of his symphony no and then knelt down by one of her medical textbooks tuberous sclerosis von recklinghausens disease sturgeweber syndrome von hippellindau syndrome the arcane collection of diseases that included neurofibromas were for the most part the result of genetic mutations on any one of several different chromosomes all of them were accompanied by some sort of brain dysfunction either by way of cancers or the actual growth of neurofibromas in the central nervous system the best nikki could come up with was that kathy wilson had some sort of variant of von recklinghausens disease the most common of the conditions reportedly occurring in one out of every individuals von recklinghausens disease outcome fatal sometimes within a few years from diagnosis treatment none the jangle of the phone startled her kathy she exclaimed as she scrambled across her pathology text and snatched up the receiver nikki joe keller here oh hi thanks for calling no word yet every time the phone rings i jump out of my skin thinking its her for a few seconds there was an uncomfortable silence nikki listen dear keller said finally kathy wilson isnt going to be calling nikki sank back against the sofa a veil of disbelief already descending over her mind oh no she said im sorry to have to tell you this over the phone i couldnt think of a way to trick you into coming in so i could tell you in person nikki kathys dead she was run down by a truck on washington street about an hour ago her bodys here now no no no joe i she left a message here just a few hours ago oh this is terrible nikki you tried your best i could have done something i should have said something different when we last spoke nikki youve done everything you could do i know you have from the looks of her fibromas i would say kathy was in for a rapidly progressive illness visits to doctors and most likely premature death if the reports on her behavior immediately before she died are true this accident may actually have been a manifestation of her disease running its course what happened i dont know completely yet but i will the police will be by any minute i heard that she was in a bar disrupting the place the security people escorted her out and she suddenly broke away and raced directly into the street the driver of the truck said he never even had a chance to put on his brakes oh god nikki i know this is hard but can you come in to identify her nikki swiped at her tears with her sleeve off and on over the past week she had feared even expected the worst now it had happened ill be there in ten minutes she said babies beaten and shaken to death total body burns shotgun blasts to the face longterm submersions accidents of almost every imaginable kind over her years in the coroners office nikki had encountered them all but nothing prepared her for the horrible anguish of seeing kathy wilsons battered corpse stretched out on the stainlesssteel table right next to the one where roger belanger had been autopsied just days before from several feet away it appeared from the unnatural angle of her head as if her neck had been broken above the sheet that covered her body her pale face with its features already deformed by the multiple lumps was surprisingly spared but there was a trickle of drying blood wending down from the corner of her mouth a mouth that would never sing again feeling as if her chest were being compressed in a vise nikki stepped forward and gingerly pulled back the sheet the police or the autopsy technician had stripped away kathys clothes like nikki kathy was a runner although she was broader across the shoulders than nikki and more heavily muscled in fact the two of them ran together when their schedules permitted now kathys body looked frail and bony it had clearly taken a highspeed highimpact hit from the left her arm was ripped nearly off at the shoulder and the entire chest wall on that side was caved in it was a blessing of minuscule proportions but given the angle of her head and the likelihood of her aorta being sheared by the blow to her chest death had probably been instantaneous for a few moments the sound of kathys mandolin filled nikkis head it was the soaring looping breathtaking solo from nik the quick a piece kathy had written for her and recorded on the bands second album thank god for the cds a part of kathy wilson would live on as long as her music did nikki set the sheet back gently then bent down and kissed her friend on the forehead im done joe she managed she led keller back to his office and sank down in the chair across from him you should have heard her play and sing joe people would be standing and cheering when she finished screaming for more eightyyearolds would be up in the aisle dancing she was dazzling thanks to the recording you gave me i can truthfully say i agree with you hers is not music i am used to but it is music i enjoy im pleased to hear that joe if its possible could you do the post dont let brad cummings near her i was intending to keller replied in fact i will probably do it tonight over the years since the death of his wife keller had become married to his job he could be found in the office at almost any hour weekend or not hunched over his microscope asking questions of cells and their groupings and far more often than not receiving the answers it was hardly unusual for him to spend the night in the oncall suite and joe yes i have one other favor to ask of you even if it appears completely normal will you do her brain keller looked at her quizzically even if i see no problem you still want me to dissect fix and stain her brain unlike most other tissues the brain required specialized timeconsuming and expensive fixation and staining the microscopic examination could not be performed for days sometimes as long as two weeks because of the cost unless there was specific evidence of an anatomic brain problem on gross examination the microscopic part of the autopsy was never done please do it no matter what nikki said do whatever special stains you can think of to look for toxins she became insane joe she kept talking about people trying to kill her in just a few months she went from being one of the most creative enchanting centered women who ever lived to being a paranoid lunatic frightened that even i was out to get her how can i say no to you thanks joe urn i dont want to make this day any more difficult for you than it has already been but nobody has notified her family yet i expected you would want me to do that both her parents are alive kathy hasnt been that close to them in recent years but they were in touch and when she could she booked the band to play near there where is she from nikki fished out her tattered address book from her bag shes from a coal town in appalachia i have the number and address there the place is called belinda belinda west virginia chapter the phone had rung several times before matt snatched up the nearest of the four alarm clocks he had spaced progressively farther from the bed with the clock disengaged and clutched to his chest he was working his way back into a rightsidedown fetal tuck when he realized the ringing was persisting hlo dr rutledge its jeannie putnam in the er thats nice dr rutledge are you awake im awake im awake how long have you been working at the hospital jeannie three months why dont ever believe me when i say im awake but are you yes matt switched on the bedside lamp to be sure only im not on call i know but a man just came into the er and said his brother keeps passing out hes outside in their truck but he wont come in unless youre here to see him the one who came in said he didnt have to tell us his name youd know who they were dr rutledge matt held the alarm clock beneath the light threefifteen he groaned and stretched a dozen aching places on his body cried out in protest he had finished signout rounds at seven in the evening then raced over to the gym at the y for his mens c ampa basketball league c ampa for contusions and abrasions he had about a minute to warm up before he and a bunch of thirtytofiftyyearolds began two and a half hours of fullcourt battle matt had retained some skills from his days as captain of the high school team but most of the combatants had lost whatever finesse they once had and had replaced it with a mix of brute force and agerelated clumsiness if it werent for the socalled referees they chipped in to hire there was no way the er wouldnt be flooded every monday and thursday im awake im awake he said again just stunned jeannie the men who are there would probably be two of the slocumb brothers oh my it sounds like youve heard of them some im recently from philadelphia i thought maybe people were making up an appalachia story just to shock me how many brothers are there four the one who came into the er is he where you can see him no he went back out to the truck dr rutledge he smells something awful he may not think so do you remember if he has any teeth what teeth does he have any just a couple in the front i think well that would be lewis tell him to allow you to bring his brother into the er and begin to take care of him or else im going to turn right around when i get there and go home be firm each of the slocumb brothers is more stubborn than the next the only chance you have is to stand up to them they respect anyone with guts oh ive got guts jeannie said its permanently losing my sense of smell im concerned about please get his bp and pulse lying sitting and if he looks like he can tolerate it standing okay ekg and routine labs if you can charm them into allowing it also have the lab type and crossmatch for three units and be ready to crossmatch for three more you think hes bleeding no idea but they would never come to the er unless there was something very much the matter they make their own moonshine in this hideous still behind their house i wonder if maybe the whiskey has eaten away the lining of his stomach ill get right on it youre awake right the odds favor it matt replied hauling himself out of bed ill be there in fifteen minutes the pounding behind his eyes had him trying to remember how many beers he had downed with the guys after the game not that many he decided given how easily he had been awakened certainly not too many to deal with whichever slocumb was slumped on the front seat of the truck the slocumb brothers kyle lyle lewis and frank were all in their fifties or early sixties they lived together as they had since birth on their combination junkyard and farm a hundred acres or so located about eight rugged densely wooded miles north of town their mother who died decades ago was perhaps the only woman who had ever set foot on the spread not once in matts long relationship with them had the slocumbs mentioned their father matt had heard of the freak brothers from his early childhood rumors about the reclusive slocumbs ranged from bizarre to perverse to downright frightening like most children in the area matt had been forbidden to go anywhere near their place he was ten years old when some of the older boys dared him to try to get a little league contribution from them none of the boys were willing to go any closer than the parallel dirt ruts to the farm that cut off from the narrow highway one of them told matt the place was just a little ways up the road in fact it was more than three miles matt alternately rode and walked his bike the whole way at the door of the ramshackle house he hesitated clutching the donation can so tightly he thought he might crush it then he took the sort of deep calming breath he would one day use just before driving a largebore needle into a young miners chest and knocked twenty minutes later he was on the dirt road again in his basket was a sausage sandwich on homemade bread on his wrist was a bracelet forged out of bent horseshoe nails and in the donation can were two crumpled oilstained dollar bills before a day had passed the whole town had some version or other of the story matts father docked him two weeks allowance for disobedience and forbade him from going near the place again from that time on matt kept his monthly visits to the farm a secret since returning to belinda from his residency he went out there every so often to do some doctoring or just to catch up there was very little if anything he had learned about the four men over the years that he didnt like although none of them would qualify as a prizewinning conversationalist and he knew for a fact that there was a whole new generation of kids who were being forbidden by their parents from going near the freak brothers the slocumbs most definitely preferred it that way matt threw on his favorite pair of denims and a plaid work shirt and pulled on his boots there was no chance he would be returning to the cabin before his workday began in earnest the envelope was lying on the floor by the front door matt had actually stepped on it before he noticed it it was a plain white envelope darkened in spots with grime and grease dr rutlege was printed in pencil on the front in a labored hand given the shape matt was in after the rugged basketball games and the postmortem at woodys tavern the envelope might have been there when he got home he flipped on some lights in the living room and tore it open drrutlege you are rite theres poyzon barryed in the mountin find it thru the tunel in the cleft giv the reward to them as needs it signed a caring frend the uneven scrawl was similar to the writing of many mountain people mixed uppercase letters with lower with phonetic spelling and no consistent attention to punctuation regardless of who wrote it they were clearly on the right side his side his heart pounding matt put the note back in its envelope and stuffed it into his jeans quite possibly this was the break he had been working for the tunnel in the cleft matt had lived in the area much of his life and still had no idea what the line referred to but whoever wrote the note knew and so without a doubt others did too buoyed by the turn of events matt jumped on his harley and raced down the hill toward the hospital he rolled his motorcycle to a stop next to the brightly lit emergency entrance and dropped the kickstand the slocumbs battered ford pickup parked nearby was empty for no particular reason matt guessed the one who had been passing out was kyle the most outgoing and obstinate of the eccentric slocumb quartet jeannie putnam wearing a set of maroon scrubs and a surgical mask was waiting for him in the surprisingly busy er she was a tall woman in her late twenties with a good grasp of emergency medicine and an obvious empathy for the patients were grateful for your coming in like this she said which brother is it kyle and you were right about the other one it is lewis labs off kyle drew the line at getting any tests until you were here to order them lord but i changed his mind she added with a wink i even got him to put on a johnny hes really sort of cute you should see the room the four of them sleep in cute isnt the first adjective that would come to mind but i am glad you appreciate some of his charm what did you order the usual cbc chem plus the crossmatch tell me again why you ordered it matt shrugged and shook his head i dont know kyles never had any medical problem that ive had to deal with something you said about his passing out then waking up sounded like low blood pressure so i thought maybe he was bleeding internally if you have made the correct diagnosis over the phone at three am i would consider you very spooky you wouldnt be the first matt said looking absolutely ridiculous in a paisleyprint johnny grizzled kyle slocumb the youngest of the brothers nodded his approval as matt walked through the door lewis slocumb who seldom spoke a word he didnt have to was seated in the corner half asleep matt went straight to the bedside and began his examination as he asked questions so kyle whats the deal skin pale palm creases pale nail beds pale jeannie might be right about his being spooky he thought anemia of some sort was already at the head of the list of possibilities ah got up ta take me a piss an got all dizzy doc lewis says ah passed out but he tends ta zaggeration any pains pulse thin rapid jes the usual you drinking much of that rotgut you guys make out there betty soft maybe a little protective muscle tightening over the stomach a course ah am but sos the rest a the boys your stool any unusual color my what your stool your bowel movements my what your shit kyle your shit oh that how should ah know nobody in their right mind ud ever look down thet outhouse hole whazza story doc lewis asked i dont know lewis maybe low blood youll fix him up ill fix him up lewis matt did an efficient but detailed physical exam that showed a significant drop in blood pressure when kyle sat up low blood volume low blood count anemia now it was time to look for a source of blood loss starting with the most likely matt pulled on a rubber glove whazzat fer kyle asked i think you can guess kyle roll over face the wall and pull your knees up toward your chest i need to see if youre bleeding inside kyle did as he was asked but the moment matts gloved finger touched his anus he shrieked stiffened his legs out and began bellowing over and over again like a wounded beast the staff two nurses and the er doc came charging into the room ah dint think he uz gonna lak thet lewis drawled well why in the hell didnt you say something matt replied much louder than he had intended jeannie putnam and the two others stood at the doorway transfixed matt his gloved finger pointing skyward like a fan at some bizarre sporting event proclaiming his team was number one smiled at them sheepishly i dont think i waited long enough for kyle to agree to this procedure apparently its a touchy area for him apparently jeannie said urn dr rutledge can we be of any help well actually you can be sure that blood you sent is crossmatched for six units and you can tell the lab we really need his hematocrit is he bleeding internally thats my guess guess id be a bit more certain if i could get some stool to test for blood kyle how about if i go up there with a little qtip nope look kyle its threethirty in the morning and youre sick and i have to know why now either you let me do the procedure i want to do or i promise you im going home and back to bed what kyle and jeannie exclaimed in unison ya wouldnt leave me doc kyle said oh but i would believe me i would dr ellis here can take care of you for now and in the morning theyll find you another doctor that is provided youre still alive in the morning now whats it going to be for half a minute there was only silence then slowly kyle rolled back to face the wall and drew his knees up darn but yer an ornery summabitch doctor he said yuz ornery as a kid an ya jes got worse since then ill be gentle kyle matt replied by sixthirty the impending crisis surrounding kyle slocumb was over the hardwon rectal exam disclosed black stool that tested positive for blood perhaps cowed by the procedure kyle put up little resistance to swallowing a thin plastic tube which matt slid up one nostril and down the back of his throat into his stomach years of smoking potent homegrown cigarettes had done in his gag reflex making the often difficult insertion a snap the stomach contents aspirated through the tube were old blood coffee grounds in appearance and some streaks of fresh bright red blood as well transfusions had quickly replaced the lost blood and circulating volume so that by the time kyle was wheeled into the gi suite for an examination through gastroenterologist ed tanguays scope he had recovered his color and stabilized his blood pressure so thets it lewis slocumb said as he and matt walked together out of the er the dewy morning air was fragrant just about matt replied well keep our fingers crossed that all dr tanguay finds is some gastritis thats like inflammation of the stomach lining if its a little ulcer thatll probably be okay too but ifn he got cancer hes finished not necessarily we can cure stomach cancer with surgery but lets not go there until we hear what dr tanguay finds were lucky he could do kyle so quickly ifn thet doctor sez ol kyle has to stay overnight ah think hed jes leave i was thinking he ought to stay anyway just to get some medicine for his stomach and maybe another transfusion ah tell ya ifn he kin walk theys no way hell stay i got him to let me do that exam lewis i can talk him into staying lewis slocumb turned and looked up at matt the sharpness in his bluegreen eyes was belied by the rest of his weathered scruffy face wer different matthew he said its a way we done chose fer ourselves an it don mean nothin ta us thet mos folks think wer crazy or sick or evil thet is til we cross the line inta their world it aint nothin we enjoy doin blieve me it aint kyle an me crossed thet line this mornin now we want ta cross back as quick as possible so yew make thet happen doc an well take our chances our kind the mountain folk unnerstand thet so longs ya don hurt no one ya kin be whoever ya want mos people down here in town aint none too pleasant ta us an thet goes fer yer hospital too matt was so astonished he could barely reply lewis slocumb hadnt called him anything other than doc since his return with his md he had also just spoken more words than matt could ever remember okay he managed ill do what i can to get kyle out of here but if i think hes in danger youre going to have to sign him out against my advice well do thet an donchew worry none we aint gonna sue ya no matter what he guffawed coughed and spat matt gazed east at the flush of morning sunlight brightening the sky from behind the hills as he did so he slipped his hands in his pockets and connected with the envelope hey lewis tell me what you make of this he said handing it over he felt pretty certain that all of the slocumbs could read to some degree or another don make nothin of it lewis said you mean you dont know what the guy who wrote this note is talking about you dont know where the cleft is lewis scuffed at the ground with the toe of his worn highcuts ah mot know then agin ah mot not lewis i just saved your brothers life and ive been coming out to the farm to check on you guys for years this note is very important to me it has to do with the mine ah know what it has ta do with ya really got a burr up yer butt fer thet ol mine i have good reasons matt said suddenly exasperated my father and my wife for two a couple of dead miners for two more lewis ah preciate what ya done fer kyle in there ah surely do so its really thet important ta ya it is i put out notices offering a reward for information about illegal chemical waste dumping by the mine and this note was slid under my door lewis scuffed thoughtfully covering up the gouges he had made in the sand so whars the big news he asked finally what do you mean ah mean theys lotsa folks livin in the woods what knows bout the cleft an the tunnel and even bout the crap the mine people keep inside matts pulse began to race what do you mean crap he asked chemicals jes like ya sed barrels of em hot damn lewis can you take me there lewis sighed inside the mountain ah spose ah kin when when ya thinkin yall be done with kyle i dont know maybe late this afternoon then well talk late this afternoon but you know about this poison the note talks about ah know and youll take me to see it firsthand ah spect ah will but ah caint say rot now its sorta up ta m brothers too lewis surely you knew ive been trying to get something on bc and c why havent you said something to me about this before we lak ya doc but we lak eatin too whats that supposed to mean it means stevenson an them people at the mine bin paying us ta keep quiet bout what we know i dont understand what connection do they have with you lewis rubbed at his chin then sighed again per a time we done hauled the stuff in thar fer em he said chapter for two and a half years nearly all of the omnivax commission meetings had been held in one or the other of the two main conference rooms located on the third floor of the parkman building fda headquarters in rockville maryland when lynette marquand made her speech later in the day the sliding partition between the rooms would be open allowing seating for the press the omnivax panel the first ladys staff and those hundred or so dignitaries who had managed to procure invitations for the moment though the partition was closed so that the commission could hold its meeting in private from what ellen knew this gathering was probably the last one before the session to vote formal approval for the distribution and general use of the supervaccine she scanned the first room as she passed by television camera crews were preparing to beam marquands message to the world and several secret service agents were carefully inspecting the walls podium and beneath the chairs most of the omnivax commission members were already in the other room mingling in twos and threes a few were settling down in front of their computergenerated cardboard place cards at the gleaming football fieldsized cherry conference table most of the members were men and all of the members except for ellen held either an md degree a phd or in a number of instances both beneath their names were printed their titles specialties and agencies ellens identified her simply as ellen kroft ms consumer within weeks following ellens first meeting cheri and sallygave her a detailed briefing on each and every one of the other members of the panel including where appropriate the sources of their research funds and any known stock holdings in the pharmaceutical industry ellen was stunned at how much information the two housewives had amassed they were serious bigtime players in this game and the worldwide impact they had made in a relatively short time reflected that she was also astonished at the extent and complexity of the connections between the members of the committee and the drug industry if cheri and sallys information was accurate and nothing had come to light to make her think otherwise too many of them had some sort of link of those in the room only a few took notice of ellen with a smile or a nod by and large as usual she was ignored moments after she took her place at what would have been about the tenyard line dr george poulos director of the institute for vaccine development took his seat directly to her right poulos one of those with dual degrees was a darkly handsome man with classic greek features he was always elegantly dressed and today possibly in honor of the occasion wore a crimson handkerchief tucked neatly in the breast pocket of his suit coat somewhere in a file folder in ellens study the dossier sally and cheri had generated on him reported that he was a highly regarded clinician researcher and businessman as well as a bigtime supporter of president jim marquand he could be swayed on some issues but only if he thought making a concession would improve his position unpredictable and generally not to be trusted it read looked like a hero when he helped halt the experimental combined chicken pox and mmr vaccine testing in south america in the mids after deaths and immune suppression in a number of female babies but turned his back six months later when slightly altered versions of the vaccine were used the last line in the report read simply drives a red porsche turbo so ellen he said gesturing vaguely at those assembling in the elegant room you have come a long way from teaching middleschool science ellen stifled a number of retorts ranging from quick and very funny to downright nasty and offensive it certainly has been an experience she settled on and how does it feel to have worked hand in hand with such an accomplished group of scientists it certainly has been an experience she said again backing up her attempt at humor with what she hoped was a warm grin are you excited about the first ladys visit oh very lynette and i are old friends i consulted for her on the vaccination section of her book citizen pioneers omnivax is her baby so to speak so it seems and after we vote she will be sharing that baby with the nation and maybe the world is that why the vote was moved up perhaps with the outcome foregone many people in very high places would like this to be a done deal as soon as possible ellen felt her composure begin to shrivel i wish i agreed with them she said have you seen how many letters from parents and grandparents have been written to congressmen protesting that omnivax hasnt been studied long enough or how many oped pieces have been published warning against moving ahead with this project too prematurely why even i have been getting letters and email five or ten a day for the past few months there are very strong feelings about this project among the public tree huggers poulos said with undisguised scorn this is only one of a dozen issues they write about and write about i assure you the vast majority of americans are totally behind this project theyre just not the ones who write letters ellen had never felt too comfortable around poulos but now she was beginning to feel a legitimate dislike i still think were moving way too fast on this thing she replied there are unanswered questions specifically ellen cautioned herself not to be drawn into a discussion of lasaject until rudy had completed his research she had purposely refrained from discussing with sally and cheri the work he was doing bringing it up now with a company man like poulos would be reckless and dumb lasaject a vaccine against the horrible hemorrhagic disease lassa fever was one of the last components to be voted for inclusion in omnivax endemic to the west african country of sierra leone lassa fever had been appearing in the us with increasing frequency over the past few years specifically she replied the question of why the current administration is putting pressure on us to approve this vaccine when there are so many unanswered questions and so many consumers who would like to see it scaled down or shelved altogether there i said it and im glad ellen was continuing to research the disease even as rudy was analyzing the clinical data accumulated for the vaccine lassa fever caused by a virus similar to the deadly ebola virus showed up in chicago and milwaukee a decade ago rapidly causing more than two dozen deaths with the possibility of a major epidemic looming columbia pharmaceuticals a marylandbased company quickly developed and successfully tested a vaccine but then as suddenly as they began the lassa cases petered out the potential for an epidemic vanished and impending mandatory vaccination with lasaject was tabled indefinitely by the fda for its hard work columbia was left holding a very expensive bag their subsequent attempts to market the vaccine in sierra leone were thwarted by political unrest and an economy that was one of the weakest in africa the world health organization simply refused to send its people into an area so volatile so for seven years the attenuated virus comprising the vaccine languished in the incubators of its creator poulos eyed her disdainfully you started out so well on this commission he said im sorry to have become a disappointment to you at that moment the chairman of the committee rich steinman a professor at georgetown gaveled the committee meeting to order well poulos said turning his attention away from her and toward the professor there are millions and millions of people out there who are going to sleep a whole lot better knowing omnivax has rendered them and their children safe from a multitude of infectious diseases well george ellen replied it wont be because i voted for it professor richard steinman looking as puffed as a pigeon beamed out at the assembled crowd and indeed at the world the partition between the two large conference rooms had been opened and the conference table moved aside allowing seating for or so behind steinman on a low stage sat various political and scientific dignitaries as well as half a dozen of the more prominent members of the select federal commission on omnivax including george poulos ellen was seated toward one side of the first row sandwiched between the head of the committee on infectious diseases of the american academy of pediatrics and the woman directing the centers for disease controls committee on immunization practices several rows behind her politicking until the last possible moment sat cheri sanderson as ellen anticipated the meeting of the select commission that preceded this session had been little more than a pep rally scientists and physicians verbally patting one another on the back and celebrating that their work was almost done richard steinman set the date for the closed ballot vote on the groups recommendation and then went around the table for remarks there was virtually nothing substantive brought up ellen had no urge to add to the merriment by suggesting that there was still time for the entire gang to reconsider their votes she gave passing thought to a simple thank you for bearing with my incessant questions and for teaching me so much over the past almost three years but she knew her superego was too well developed to allow it instead when her turn came with a final internal warning to be brief she took a sip of water praying that no one noticed her hands were shaking and rose to face the group everyone who has spoken thus far has expressed what a positive experience it has been serving on this panel she said in fact in many ways it has been a positive experience for me too please know that i have tried my best not to be too disruptive or contrary as we sifted through mountains of scientific and clinical data and reports but i am the consumer representative on this panel and despite knowing that our vote on omnivax is a formality i would feel remiss if i did not make one final plea on behalf of that group it is far more difficult to stop a vaccination freight train once it has built a head of steam than it would be to keep it in the station until the clinical evidence supporting its safety and efficacy is overwhelming omnivax has only been followed in test subjects for six months or so and many of its components have not been studied over an extended period either i know i have expressed my concerns in this area before but i still remain uneasy about articles i have read anecdotal i grant you hinting at an association between an increase in the number of vaccinations we give our children and an increase in immunemediated diseases such as diabetes asthma and multiple sclerosis to say nothing of the skyrocketing increase in conditions like add and autism i can see a number of you itching to leap to your feet and refute my statement with your data well if i have learned nothing else over the years we have worked together i have learned how malleable statistics can be the same data can be served up in any number of ways sort of like chicken there had been reasonably warm laughter from some around the table but ellen could tell by many expressions that she had already prattled on too long so she had concluded no longer at all nervous while this will be our last meeting before we vote i do intend to keep a close eye on omnivax over the weeks months and years ahead and perhaps sometime soon i can have all of you over to my place for dinner chicken dinner of course gradually ellens attention drifted back from replaying her remarks in the final commission meeting to the business at hand steinman flushed with the significance of the moment finished introducing the most important of the luminaries then he paused surveying the audience and now ladies and gentlemen he trumpeted finally it gives me great pleasure to introduce the woman who has spearheaded this project with her caring and vision the author of the landmark books prevention is the strongest medicine and citizen pioneers the first lady of the united states mrs lynette lowry marquand the standing ovation lasted more than a minute marquand dressed in a simple but stunning beige suit motioned for all to be seated then for fully fifteen silent seconds she stood there surveying the audience and gazing into the cameras emphasizing the significance of the occasion she waited until the drama of silence was at its peak before she spoke ladies and gentlemen distinguished scientists and healers members of the press citizens of this country and the world it gives me great great pleasure to introduce to you the real star of these proceedings she hesitated just a beat then whirled theatrically and tugged on a long tasseled gold cord releasing a threefootwide scroll that unraveled from the ceiling printed boldly on the scroll beginning with diphtheria and proceeding down to japanese encephalitis was a list of the thirty diseases that were about to be prevented if not eradicated by omnivax third from the bottom of the list just after cholera and before shigellosis was lassa fever again there was tumultuous applause in a dynamic wellcrafted speech the first lady went down the list one by one saying just enough about each condition to personalize it for the audience and to have every parent across the country sighing in relief that their children would be spared its horrible consequences ellen was impressed with the woman even though she had voted against her husband in the last election and intended to do so again in this one still with the end of almost three years of hard work at hand and with rudy still doing his research unaware that the vote had been moved up she had trouble keeping her mind on the speech in fact she was so distracted that she very nearly missed the words from lynette marquand that would change her life forever the president secretary bolton and i marquand was saying are fully aware that there are those who are opposed to this project nothing of lasting value is ever accomplished without conflicting opinions and controversy we are also aware of those who have tried to politicize this endeavor speaking for my husband and myself i can say that is the last thing we wish to do that is why the selection of the commission evaluating omnivax was done with such care in your programs is a list of the members of this commission and a few of the qualifications of each im sure youll agree that this is quite a remarkable independent and trustworthy team and i want to take this opportunity to thank dr steinman and each and every one of them for their hard work and devotion to this project marquand gestured to those commission members seated behind her and also to those in the front row then she made them stand up as a group and led the audience in an enthusiastic round of applause it was only as ellen was settling back into her seat that her attention returned fully to the proceedings for nearly three years marquand went on every single member of this august panel of worldrenowned experts has studied omnivax in detail from every angle i have been briefed regularly on their progress soon they will be voting on whether or not to approve its distribution for general use i promise you the american public that if even one just one of the twentythree members of this commission votes against the release of omnivax we will hold up our inoculation program for as long as it takes to resolve any and all misgivings the pronouncement enunciated as energetically as any campaign rhetoric was greeted with an immediate boisterous standing ovation ellen sat dumbfounded staring up at the first lady until she realized that all the others in the hall were on their feet slowly somewhat unsteadily she rose and brought her hands together it was then she noticed that from his place just behind and to the right of lynette marquand george poulos was staring directly down at her chapter more keyed up than he had been in years matt rolled the kawasaki out of his garage his cc honda was better in the woods and the harley was without peer cruising the roads but the kawasaki had the power to carry two and the suspension to handle most of what the offroad trails had to offer it was a cc vulcan ebony and silver with a fourstroke fivespeed vtwin engine and it was to the harley what a corvette was to a lexus sedan it was after one in the morning there was a chill in the air dampened by a fine mist the darkness was a good omen matt noted as he eased his bike down his gravel drive and onto the twolane road somewhere beyond those dense clouds was a nearly full moon this would be his second trip today out to the slocumbs farm the first was around four when he rode out to check on kyle after the youngest of the brothers had adamantly refused to allow the gastroenterologist to perform another rectal exam it took some time for matt to convince the specialist that it was still worth proceeding with a gastroscopy the exam showed pretty much what matt had expected hemorrhagic gastritis an erosive inflammation of the lining of kyles stomach it was hardly the worst case of the condition he had ever seen though so when kyles vital signs and blood count had stabilized he reluctantly agreed to discharge him on medication to block the production of acid and antacids to soothe the damaged tissue there was also a strict prohibition on alcohol of any kind but especially the homebrewed proof rotgut produced by the brothers still surprisingly as far as matt could tell kyle had followed every one of his orders and was actually doing quite well keeping his engine noise to a minimum matt slowly made his way along the last quarter mile of rutted road to the slocumb farmhouse lewis was waiting on the porch a grizzled sinewy man in his early sixties he was wearing denim overalls a tattered black wvu sweatshirt work boots and a black watch cap he had blackened his face and hands with some sort of greasepaint here he said holding out a small jar of the stuff lemme smear some a this on yer face what is it its black lewis said ugh it smells like lewis put some on yer hands too i dont believe i let you do this matt said are you expecting trouble is that why were dressing up like farmer commandos don rotly know what ta expect the people what run thet mine aint survived the way they have by bein stupid ya bring everthin ah ast ya to matt patted his backpack rope hunting knife camera flashlights flares a compass and some jars for bringing out samples ifn we get thet close lewis muttered youre a cheery one lewis just snorted and mounted the passenger seat of the kawasaki go thet way he said motioning to a muddy track that ran straight through the pitchblack field behind the house this isnt really a dirt bike you know matt said its not built for driving through cow shit either theys a path out there lewis said goodsize shortcut jes keep on goin straight following the bikes slashing high beam they jounced across the field and into the woods for nearly twenty minutes they rode in silence following what might have been an old logging road it was difficult going with two but lewis was a surprisingly good passenger he stayed centered and relaxed in his seat and didnt try to help by leaning into turns the tarblack woods were eerie once a gigantic owl probably a great horned swooped through the high beam not ten feet ahead of them the specter nearly stopped matts heart cold a little chick lewis chuckled as best matt could guess they were traveling due west paralleling the tall hills that housed the mine on the other side he expected the narrow track to vanish any moment but it continued straight as a ruler through the dense forest the mist was making it difficult to see through his plexiglas visor so he hooked his helmet to the handlebar you sure you know where youre going he asked over his shoulder oh ah know how much longer wer here cut the light matt did as he was told instantly the ebony night enfolded them lewis held a finger to his lips for several minutes they sat in what seemed to be a small clearing and listened from here on out we whisper lewis said ah don know ifn the mines got people out herer not but ah wouldn be supprised their security men are the nastiest summabitches yad ever wanna meet tell me about it how far is the cleft a ways that motorbike a yourn aint exactly sneaky quiet matt pulled the bike off into the woods and secured it to a tree then he took his compass out of his jeans pocket and checked it with a penlight which directions your farm back thar southeast matt noted maybe five miles we go thet way lewis said motioning along the track they walked for ten minutes about half a mile from somewhere to the right they had begun to hear running water overlaying it were the noises of insects and peepers and the occasional call of an owl the forest at night wheres that stream go matt asked it cuts down inta the hill rot whar wer headed runs unnergroun fer quite a ways then comes out in the valley wheres it come from runs past the farm thas all ah know ready ready lewis indicated a spot up ahead matt could make out a change in the darkness but little else moments later he realized the change in shading was the steep side of a rocky hill from their right the stream perhaps eight feet wide raced into an opening in the rock theys a bunch a ways inta the caves lewis said but this uns the cleft an thats what yer mystry man writ its also the one aint likely ta be watched don seem lak nobodys about but wed best keep it down jes the same they stepped into the stream and ducked beneath a ledge to enter the hill through an opening that was about five feet high and three feet wide the cleft the water churned and deepened to their knees as it rolled through with them then broke sharply to the right and over a foothigh drop to a long dark pool lak ah done said this is jes one a the ways inta the hill lewis whispered they caint brang the barrels in by this way though too narrah with too many dropoffs then how some a tother paths are wider else they jes haul em back through the mine this tunnel goes all the way through the hill to the mine it does jes thet downhill all the way the mine entrance is way below whar we are the storage caves plumb in the middle lewis how long has it been since you worked for the mine well we aint done none for ten year or more im surprised they let you live knowing what you do oh they considered sendin men out all rot but then they got smart an sent money instead theyve been bribing you for ten years ah spose ya could say that yes lewis you know im going to close that dump down if it takes the rest of my life ah know well i dont know how much money you guys will lose when your payments stop but i want to tell you how much i appreciate your doing this ya bin good ta us lewis said simply matt panned his flash over the tunnel ahead the walls ceiling and floor appeared to narrow like a corridor in alice in wonderland how low and narrow does this get he whispered ya kin make it through lewis said jes dont take no deep breaths he snickered lewis i dont know how to tell you this but i i have trouble with tight enclosed places always have i get like panicky in them now whar in the hell did a wes verginny boy come up with their ya gonna make it jes fine doc theys only a few places whar yer gonna have ta crawl an squeeze through jesus matt muttered its bin a while since ah bin in here so wed best move slowly taint the tight places ya got ta worry about its the dropoffs keeping their lights fixed on the damp stone floor the two of them headed steadily downward into the mountain the sound of running or falling water was a constant at times seeming quite close at times echoing through a side tunnel twice they had to press against a wall and walk sideways along the edge of a precipice once matt deliberately kicked some pebbles into the dark maw the splash was barely audible ah don thank y wanna fall down thar lewis said the narrow tunnel took a number of turns and matt began to wonder if they would have trouble making their way out again but lewis seemed to be moving with confidence through the stale heavy air once an especially low tight passage forced him to his knees matt could not get down low enough and had to negotiate ten or twelve feet wriggling along on his belly marine style his pulse instantly began pounding he found himself thinking about cave hunters and wondering how they could possibly experience anything but terror traversing narrow slits in rock with no hope of being able to kneel turn around or even roll over and no certainty that the way wouldnt suddenly end the notion made him queasy and tightened the muscles between his shoulder blades shortly after they were able to stand the tunnel widened and began to receive broad tributaries from the left the air became less oppressively heavy thar lewis whispered pointing down one such tunnel thets one a the ways we brung the barrels in hauled em on dollies we did who does it now matt asked beats me per all ah know they done stopped i dont think so wait do you smell that ah do the cave wer after aint too far ahead the odor was of chemicals sweet pungent and slightly nauseating gasoline toluene matt tried to pin it down but couldnt with certainty gotcha he thought the frustrating years of trying to show the public what sort of morality was running belinda coal and coke were about to bear fruit in addition to the chemical smell the sound of rushing water was again echoing off the damp stone walls to their left just beyond where lewis was standing matt could make out a small river bursting through a wide rent in the rock his flashlight beam reflected off the dark water and lit the open space beyond overhead the ceiling sloped upward the organic odor was now intense whatever sorts of chemicals were up ahead certainly werent well contained lewis he whispered is this it rot thar lewis said waving his light ahead then cutting it off for nearly a minute the two men stood together in the darkness the sound of the rushing river filled the cavern which matt now sensed was quite vast go easy an move right lewis ordered no more light til wer sure we got no compny i can see them lewis matt said excitedly i can see the barrels looming ahead filling only a fraction of the chamber were two huge pyramids of oil drums twenty feet across at the base and ten feet high a third stack was just taking shape beyond the barrels almost degrees from the tunnel through which they had entered was another wider access probably coming from the mine a pale film of light filtering in from somewhere deep in that tunnel was what was backlighting the barrels they remained pressed against the chamber wall still some distance from the barrels lewis switched on his flash which was considerably more powerful than matts and handed it over the sight in front of them brought a knot of anger and sadness to matts chest many of the oil drums appeared to be in decent shape but some of them were corroded several of those six or seven that he could see from where they stood had emptied onto the stone floor not ten yards behind the stacks a broad stream was rippling through the cavern headed in the general direction of the mine it was impossible to believe the toxins werent passing through major work areas and from there into the environment son of a bitch he murmured wed best move quickly lewis i have no idea what these fumes are doing to our lungs or brains aint nothin that kin mess my brain up moren it already is lewis replied punctuating the remark with a raspy laugh matt slipped off his backpack knelt down and opened it he removed his camera and took a half a dozen flash shots then he extracted a plastic bag with specimen collection bottles in it and took several tentative steps toward the barrels he was about six feet away from them when floodlights mounted high on the walls snapped on illuminating most of the cavern with midday brightness matt caught a glimpse of gas masks and zipup coveralls hanging from a rack nearby instinctively he dropped onto the damp floor just as two security men entered from the other tunnel their exact words were lost in the echoes of churning water but he could tell they were laughing and joking one of them keyed a security check box mounted on the rock wall quickly matt scrambled on all fours toward lewis who was pressed back against the wall in a pocket of shadow hurry lewis whispered urgently moving as quickly as he dared matt was just a few feet from the shadows when one of the guards spotted him shit tommy look over there matt could see the man drawing his gun run lewis cried already racing toward the tunnel matt followed do you think we should just tell them who we are and that we dont want any trouble he asked as they ran they aint intrested in nothin but makin sure we dont leave this cave alive lewis answered truss me on thet at that instant gunfire erupted from behind them and bullets ricocheted off the rocks jesus matt cried hunching down he had left his backpack and camera behind but by sheer providence still held on to lewiss flashlight he passed the light to lewis and following the beam they plunged into the gloom of the passageway initially lewis moved with surprising speed and agility quickly though his age and years of smoking took hold by the time they reached the first narrowing of the tunnel he was gasping matt knew he could have moved much faster alone but even if he had known the tunnels there was no way he would have left the man behind he cursed himself for impetuously putting them in such a spot he could have waited maybe tried to go to the authorities with the mysterious note more gunshots it seemed to matt that there was no way they were going to outrun their pursuers but lewis had other ideas they made a sharp righthand turn then dropped down into a series of backscraping crawls that matt didnt remember from the trip in the pounding in his chest and tightness in his throat intensified as it always did when he was in a confined space he forced himself to keep crawling ahead suddenly he was thinking about his father what had it been like for him those last seconds after the cavein did he have time to be afraid would he have been afraid even if he did did the explosion kill him instantly or was it the crush of rock bullets continued to ping off the rock walls and crack into the stone beneath them then abruptly the shooting stopped this way lewis called back cutting his light they caint see us no more thas why theys stopped shootin he broke into a spasm of coughing but hesitated only a few seconds and pushed on you know where we are matt asked les put it this way ah know whar ah am he laughed moistly and again began coughing lewis are you okay matt asked the older man didnt answer instead he dropped to his belly and wriggled through a ragged tenfootlong crevice not more than a foot and a half high and two feet wide he was grunting loudly but moving ahead gamely matt closed his eyes and followed along the narrow passage fearing that at any moment he was going to pass out throw up or simply get stuck and go insane two feet of extra headroom at the end of the crevice brought him the same sort of relief as the cessation of a dentists drilling after what seemed like an eternity on their hands and knees or bellies the ceiling sloped upward the air began to taste fresher lewis rose to his feet rather shakily and his head and shoulders disappeared into the ceiling matt crawled over to him tilted his head back and felt a fine rain on his face about eight feet past lewiss shoulders up a narrow chute he could see the lighter shade of blackness that was the sky kin ya climb out thet lewis asked whispering again if i dont get stuck i believe i can kin ya boos me up i think so im going to put my head between your legs and stand up just dont punch me for getting fresh lewis missed matts tepid humor because he was coughing again ya sure bout this he asked when he had caught his breath ah aint no flyweight ya know if it means getting out of here i could lift an elephant just rest your hands on the top of my head and as soon as you can grab someplace to pull yourself up go ahead once im standing ill push your feet up ready okay one two three lewis couldnt have weighed more than tops matt had more than enough push in his legs to stand up steadying lewis by holding his sides then his feet lewis groaned cried out softly and then pulled himself up the chute and out of the hole quick an be real quiet he whispered down matt looked up and this time feared he might not have the strength or purchase on the wet rock to pull himself out as he was scanning the walls he became aware that his right hand was wet and sticky he sniffed his palm and tried to see it although he really didnt have to try too hard he had been involved with enough severe crunches in the er to know the feel and scent of blood he braced his back and shoulders against one side of the chute reached overhead until his fingers curled over some rock then brought his knees up until he could wedge himself in place inch by inch he worked his back up the rock until he could pull his knees up and repeat the maneuver finally he felt the toe of his boot push down on a minute ledge of rock a moment later lewis grabbed him by the collar and helped him out they were on a hillside amidst dense trees twenty feet below them two men with flashlights were searching along the base of the slope the guards must have radioed for help im telling you one of them was saying if they make it out at all itll be through one of the places down that way we aint doing anyone any good looking around here the second man scanned the side of the hill missing their prostrate quarry by no more than a foot then the two of them moved on matt who had been holding his breath moved over to lewis who lay quite still on the sodden leafcovered ground breathing heavily youre bleeding from someplace matt said tell me somethin ah don know lewis replied grunting the words and stifling a cough ifn ya check m left side rot between m ribs ah think yewll find a bullet hole chapter ten minutes passed in absolute silence and darkness before matt dared to switch on the flashlight lewis lay still facedown breathing shallowly as matt examined him the left side of his overalls sweatshirt and the tattered t beneath it were soaked with blood a bullet hole the entry wound matt surmised was next to lewiss shoulder blade at about the level of the sixth rib blood was still oozing from it albeit slowly gingerly careful to keep the flash shielded beneath the bloody shirts as much as possible he rolled lewis onto his right side using his own shirtsleeve matt mopped some of the blood away he sighed in relief when he spotted the exit wound just to the left of the nipple mentally he drew a line between the two holes if the path of the bullet was true it passed directly through the upper lobe of lewiss left lung the larger of the two lobes on that side but he knew from experience with any number of shootings that depending on the caliber of the bullet and many other factors a straight path through the body was often not the case he had seen a lowcaliber shot to the chest where the bullet entered near the spine and exited next to the breastbone without ever passing through the chest at all it had traveled instead halfway around the torso in the muscle just beneath the skin in another case the victim an elderly shopkeeper shot while thwarting a holdup had no symptoms except shoulder pain and numbness in his little finger the entry wound was in the left upper arm but there was no exit wound and no bullet in the shoulder or arm on x ray eventually the slug was found inside the mans stomach having ricocheted down between ribs and lung puncturing the lung four times before piercing the diaphragm and finally the stomach wall matt set his hands on lewiss back and tried unsuccessfully to determine if the left lung was expanded then he put his ear near the entry wound and listened for breath sounds it was simply too awkward a situation to tell lewis hows your breathing he asked checking the pulses in lewiss arms and neck which were all strong and steady be better ifn ah could have me one a them cigarettes in ma back pocket lewis grunted as he spoke and stopped twice to cough theyd be soaked everythings soaked matt said aching at what he had caused to happen to his old friend ah put em in a baggie matches too why am i not surprised listen lewis as soon as were away from here ill give you one promise matt cut the light what do you think we should do right now not stay here thets fer certain can you walk if i help matt guessed that fifteen minutes or more had passed since lewis was hit by one of the wildly ricocheting bullets over that time they had traveled quite a ways through narrow low winding tunnels the man might be in his sixties and slight of frame but he was an absolute bull ah kin try lewis said carefully as silently as they could manage they inched their way down the hill sliding on their backsides at the bottom they waited again listening finally matt slipped his arm around lewiss waist and helped him first to his feet then across the narrow clearing between the hill and the woods from somewhere in the distance they could hear voices but the threat of discovery at least imminent discovery was gone by the time they had gone fifty yards into the forest it was clear that lewis was not going to be able to make it back to the motorcycle now breathing more rapidly he sank down against the base of a pine tree don this jes friggin beat all he said punctuating the observation with an abbreviated burst of coughing ah spent two year in nam without gettin a scratch now this you look like youre having more trouble catching your breath ahll be okay lewis ive got to get you to the hospital exceptin ah aint goin again he was coughing only this time he couldnt keep himself from crying out in pain matt checked his wounds which were almost clotted and his pulses which still seemed fairly strong listen he said youve got to stay here while i go and get my bike then ill take you to the hospital myself lewiss eyes flashed zare somethin wrong with yer hearin boy ah sayed ah werent goin ta no hospital theys a chance them mine guards don know who they uz shootin at but havin me show up ta the hospital with a damn bullet hole in me would be lak a death sentence an probly one fer you too he ran out of breath before he could say any more look matt said let me go and get the bike if i can find it then well talk ah done all the talkin ah need to lewis said folding his arms across his chest as best he could manage he gave directions to the path they had taken to get to the cleft matt took the flashlight and compass and prepared to set out first though he knelt beside slocumb lewis im really really sorry for whats happened to you he said i wish it were me instead well ah sure as shit don lewis twanged ma brothersd kill me in a lambs heartbeat ifn they thunk ah let ya get shot yer our doctor ill be back soon matt said you stay put ah uz plannin on doin that lewis replied with his senses on red alert matt skirted the hill giving it and the men searching its base a wide berth he had never navigated by compass and after a time he abandoned the attempt as too difficult and uncertain it was now after four it seemed likely that the new day would bring an intensified search for them in the dark it was impossible to appreciate whether or not lewis was well concealed spurred by the thought that he might not be matt sped up stumbling more than once on thick exposed roots using the flashlight was still chancy but after he tripped and lurched headfirst into a juniper bush he decided it was a chance worth taking with a rough notion of where the hill was he plunged on searching for the small clearing where the kawasaki vulcan was chained getting to the motorcycle was requiring implicit faith in lewiss directions and a hell of a lot of luck but not nearly as much luck as he was going to need to get the fivehundredpound bike back through the dense forest locating the vulcan turned out to be surprisingly easy the key was maintaining a notion of where he was relative to the hills and keeping on until he hit the stream then he made a cautious right turn onto a narrow path and carefully inspected the woods until he spotted the bike matt unlocked the machine and pushed it twenty feet or so over the uneven ground roots stopped him short and even small rocks threw him off balance he had estimated half a mile from the clearing where he had chained the motorcycle to the base of the hill there was a chance that the damp heavy air would swallow the noise of the engine provided he didnt go too close to the men who were searching for them but even if he managed to ride the bike through the forest to a spot equidistant to where lewis was waiting he would have to turn to the right and head back toward the hills where the guards were patrolling were there any choices one possibility was to ignore lewiss wishes and get the police and rescue squad involved immediately beyond trespassing in an area that wasnt even posted they had really done nothing wrong and whether their actions were lawful or not their findings clearly showed the mine was guilty of storing and dumping toxic waste still involving the belinda police felt chancy at best there was little sympathy for any of the slocumbs in the official quarters of town and it was well known that police chief bill grimes was tightly connected with armand stevenson perhaps it would be worth contacting his uncle he thought now hal was tight with grimes as he was with most of those in town matt knew that if he didnt get help and something serious happened to lewis he would forever have trouble living with himself but he would also have trouble living with himself if he betrayed the mans trust it was my clinical judgment lewis well screw yer clinical jedgment boy you jes signed our death warrant his stomach churning like a rock polisher matt checked the direction of the hill using his compass started the engine and swung the bike west into the dense forest so much for clinical judgment bushwhacking through heavy brush on a moonless night aboard a fivehundredpound motorcycle built for the street was as challenging as running a disaster drill in the er and a hell of a lot more dangerous keeping his feet off the rests and his legs out straight for balance matt weaved between trees and under lowhanging branches all the time trying desperately to keep from revving the engine too much brambles whipped across his visor and gouged his chin and lips once the vulcan skidded sideways on a thick root and fell over matt barely managed to keep his leg from being pinned underneath it or fried on the exhaust pipe five minutes ten surely the engine noise had attracted attention by now they probably had fourwheel atvs and were already after the sound fifteen it seemed like time to turn right toward the hill hang on lewis matt checked the compass then cut the headlight and instead used the flashlight to illuminate the way if they hadnt heard the growl of the cc engine by now they would soon half a mile out half a mile back he checked the odometer every couple of minutes as well as the compass so far so good when he reached fourtenths of a mile he stopped and cut the engine immediately he was enfolded in a heavy silence he waited a minute to let his senses adjust somewhere in the distance he thought he could hear voices he had left lewis about seventyfive yards from the hill a bit less than a tenth of a mile it was time to search on foot matt leaned the bike against a tree and cautiously moved forward the mens voices were clearer now coming from somewhere to the right he still couldnt make out any words but the tone seemed urgent lewis he whispered loudly lewis its me he moved another ten yards toward the hill from somewhere far to his right he heard a whining highpitched engine noise probably an atv lewis where are you he felt as if he was the right distance from the base of the hill but there was no way of knowing whether he had ridden too far before turning right or not far enough there was also the possibility that lewis was either captured or worse beyond responding the whining engine seemed closer now and matt sensed himself beginning to panic he cursed and called out to lewis again this time in a nearnormal voice suddenly he was grabbed from behind and hauled to the ground he landed heavily but keeping his wits he spun away from his assailant and whirled preparing to be hit lewis knelt beside him a finger to his lips per a damn doctor ya aint so bright sometimes he said pausing every few words to catch his breath they aint so far away now thet they wount hear ya ifn you bellered much louder n thet even over the racket a thet damn honda theyre ridin how do you know that they uz here two of em not tweny feet thet way dang near run me over the bikes fifty yards from here can you make it jes gimme a hand an ah kin this suckers startin ta bother me lewiss bravado could not mask his obvious pain and shortness of breath again matt slipped his arm around his waist this time it seemed as if he was leaning on him more hospital matt asked hopefully ahd go ta hell first by the time they reached the vulcan lewis was coughing again this isnt going to be easy matt said helping him to straddle the passenger seat the bike didnt do that well navigating through these woods then youd best move quickly thet thang theyre drivins made fer these woods can you handle it jes crank er up an go brother lewis said he set his right hand on matts shoulder and grasped his shirt holding his left arm in tightly to splint his chest matt had constructed emergency kits in the saddlebags of both the harley and the vulcan but this wasnt the time to play doctor he hit the starter and began slowly retracing the route he had taken in from the path within seconds they heard an increase in the engine noise behind them and to the left there was no way they were going to sneak off bust it lewis ordered don worry none abot me ahll manage head thet way itll be shorter matt switched on the high beams and set his foot on the gearshift he had never tested the kawasaki off road at any speed but now was the time with a slight twist of the accelerator the vulcan shot forward into the heavy brush the next quarter mile was as terrifying as anything matt had ever done on a motorcycle he drove between twenty and thirty paying attention only to the larger trees the dense undergrowth he simply plowed through the vulcan bounced mercilessly over roots and rocks several times he felt as if lewis was about to be thrown but somehow the man managed to regain his grasp and hold on branches snapped across matts visor and ripped at skin that was already lashed raw more than once they went airborne landing with just enough momentum to remain upright then after a series of vicious jolts that had matt close to laying the bike down they broke free of the forest and onto the path headed away from the hills matt decelerated momentarily there was no sound other than the steady thrum of his engine you okay he asked jes get me back to the farm lewis grunted an all thank ya not ta take me fer no sunday drives agin just minutes after their arrival at the farm lewiss brothers were in action kyle wheeled matts motorcycle back to the barn removed the firstaid kit from the saddlebag and then concealed the bike beneath a tarp frank helped matt bring lewis to a tattered couch in the large cluttered living room above them a balustrade ran along the secondfloor hallway fronting several doors matt watched as lyle opened a closet there and began removing all manner of rifles shotguns and even two semiautomatic weapons whats he doing matt asked them mine peoples pretty crafty bastards frank said matteroffactly gesturing up at the arsenal we don lak ta tek no chances matt used a pair of shears to cut off lewiss bloodsoaked shirts kyle returned and set the firstaid kit down by the sofa then he went to the kitchen and brought out an unlabeled jar half filled with some sort of thick pungent beigecolored goo he rubbed the paste over lewiss face and wiped off the equally pungent black beneath his camouflage lewis was pale and tightlipped he looked at matt and read his thoughts no hospital he rasped matt worked his stethoscope into place around his neck and knelt beside lewis please get me a pan of fairly warm water he said put some soap in it if you have some dishwashing soap would be best a clean towel too the bullet holes not at all helped by the jarring ride out of the forest were nearly clotted now although blood was oozing from the edge of the exit wound matt set his hands on lewiss back and watched them as lewis inhaled the right side definitely moved more than the left listening with the scope confirmed what he suspected a large portion of lewiss punctured lung had collapsed he slipped a bp cuff around lewiss right arm and inflated it to occlude the brachial artery that ran beneath the crook of his elbow listening over the artery with his scope he slowly deflated the cuff until he heard blood begin pulsing through the vessel the sound marked the top number of lewiss blood pressure which was equivalent to the force needed to raise a column of mercury millimeters could have been worse much worse lewis he said your lung has collapsed the only way i can inflate it is by putting a tube into your chest and the only place i can do that is the hospital lewis shook his head grimly and looked away all right all right matt said ill do what i can frank theres a small room upstairs with a bed in it i want that room cleaned out and i want the cleanest sheets you have put on the bed and also two pillows with clean covers on them got that gimme ten minutes frank said theres more im going to need a pair of needlenose pliers got one and a plastic tube like the kind you use to siphon gas got thet too good and finally im going to need a rubber glove from the firstaid kit he groaned darn it never mind i took the gloves out and put them in my backpack listen for what i want to put together a condom would be even better you know a rubber can one of you hurry into town and get me a pack of three there was a momentary silence then lyle said simply i got a couple here matt looked from brother to brother as lyle went to their bedroom and returned with two trojans if the slocumbs thought there was anything unusual about the revelation their bland expressions hid it well smiling toothlessly proudly lyle handed over the two condoms the foil wrappers were crumpled but intact i dont want to know matt said to no one in particular i dont want to know while matt waited he allowed kyle to swab goo on his back ouch that stuff stings looks lak ya may be needin ta get ya a new razor doc kyle said as soon as the upstairs room was ready lewis was moved there his breathing was more labored now and his color was clearly duskier matt had read about the emergency chest tube insertion in a manual of field emergency measures that he kept on the tank in his bathroom most of the methods described by the former vietnam corpsman were imaginative some like the emergency thoracotomy tube insertion he was about to perform were downright spectacular the key to the procedure was the condom once it was unraveled and the tip was cut off he would use tape to attach the base of it to the end of the siphon tube that protruded from the chest the collapsed latex tube would then function as a perfect oneway valve allowing air to escape from the lung cavity without allowing any to get in cutting the fingers off a rubber glove might have worked but probably not as well and not nearly as colorfully the sheets on the upstairs bed a faded floral print were surprisingly clean and smelled that way ten minutes of boiling had removed the gasoline and any other contaminants from the sixfootlong quarterinchwide siphon tube and the needlenose pliers the firstaid kit was a comprehensive one that included a magnifying visor suture material powerful injectable antibiotics and the local anesthetic xylocaine matt cleansed the bullet holes packed them with antibiotic cream and dressed them then he used xylocaine to numb a spot just below and lateral to the exit wound lewis he said im going to numb this the best i can but its still going to hurt more er less then bein shot good point matt used a scalpel blade to stab a hole in the numbed skin then he cut the tip of the siphon tube to a point deep breath lewis then hold it and get ready for me to push he said okay now clamping the pointed end of the tube as tightly as he could in the needlenose pliers he jammed the pliers in until he felt them hit rib then he slid them beneath the rib through the intercostal muscle and drove them into the space created when the lung collapsed lewis sweat dripping from his forehead briefly cried out in pain then lay still matt withdrew the pliers leaving the tube in place for several seconds all was quiet then the condom began to flutter as air under some force rushed through it eyes closed lewis lay there breathing evenly utterly exhausted matt waited several silent minutes then listened to his chest the lung wasnt fully reinflated yet but there were breath sounds where none had been a short while ago he wondered how many others had ever actually used one of the techniques from the field manual someday provided lewis and he made it through this ordeal alive he was going to write a letter to the author once he had threaded ten inches of tubing into lewiss chest matt sutured the tube in place and dressed the opening he listened again more breath sounds more expanded lung well frank asked matt gave lewis a highdose injection of antibiotic well he replied aware of the tinge of astonishment in his own voice the doggone thing appears to have worked at least for the moment ill sneak some oxygen and other stuff that i need out of the hospital and come back as soon as i can ya done good doc frank said lewiss color improved almost instantly he opened his eyes ah knowed we uz smart ta give ya thet money when ya come knockin on our door fer yer baseball team we get you shot we fix you up matt said thats our motto he was still overwhelmed that a technique he learned reading in the john had quite possibly saved a mans life what would the gang at harvard have to say about this one hey doc lyle said yes ifn you aint gonna be usin thet other rubber kin i have it back lynette marquand prided herself on being as she phrased it precise punctual and predictable in the appropriate company she would with a wink add passionate to the mix five days a week when not on vacation she was up at am and in her east wing office at five on saturday she slept until six and on sunday until seven unless her husband had need of her affection before breakfast and church this predawn wednesday morning a rainy one in dc she had only one name written in her appointment book dr lara bolton lynette had at best lukewarm feelings toward almost every one of her husbands cabinet appointments but bolton was an exception sixfootone and black the secretary of health and human services had been depicted by more than one political cartoonist as a stork and with her clipped boston accent was an easy mark for the saturday night live impressionists but her brilliant mind and political savvy made her a frequent visitor to both lynettes office and the oval office in the west wing bolton as usual dressed in a crisp navy suit knocked and entered lynettes office at precisely fivefifteen well lara lynette said after the secretary had poured a cup of decaf from a carafe my staff is lighter by one you did the right thing janine brady has been in this game for a long time she knows better than to assure you a vote will be unanimous without checking and rechecking so where do we stand now well it appears ellen kroft does have serious misgivings about omnivax damn shes the consumer representative on the panel so theres no way any of the pharmaceutical grant providers can put any pressure on her was one of my people consulted before she was appointed i hate to say it but it was janine brady wait though i was consulted too lynette kroft seemed absolutely harmless a token offered up by the people at pave if she was more militant we never would have approved her appointment no one expected anything like this so our man poulos on the committee tells me hes dealing with the problem hes optimistic something can be worked out is it worth my meeting with her you can try but ive learned that she contributed fifty dollars to harrisons campaign last election and upped it to seventyfive this time oh thats just terrific were three points down in the latest polls jim is counting heavily on omnivax to eliminate that and here is a harrison supporter threatening to screw up the whole thing if kroft remains on this path were getting prepared to make the whole thing look political being as she is a known harrison backer that isnt going to give us back those three points i know what about our plans for the first inoculation i think were there lynette we have two women here in dc due to deliver at the right time so that their babies will be four days old when were ready both attend the neighborhood health center in anacostia both are anxious to have their kids be the first to receive omnivax uneventful pregnancies no problems do we know the sex of the babies bolton grinned mrs first lady you said you wanted a girl whichever mama we choose we got you a girl itll be great theater lara theres three points in this mark my words there are maybe more maybe more the secretary echoed chapter nikkis drive from boston to belinda west virginia was a somber introspective one filled with music countrywestern jazz classical and all manner of bluegrass in addition to kathy wilsons two albums

especially on mandolin which she played as well as anyone nikki had ever heard a chief selling point for nikkis saturn had been its sound system which was surprisingly potent in all ranges she drove

possession a gibson f mandolin built she was proud to tell anyone who would listen whether or not they knew mandolins by lloyd loar the day like the one before was sparkling and not too warm nikki had spent the night in a best western just outside of harrisburg pennsylvania and had left the motel early enough that morning to make belinda with an hour or so to spare before the memorial service between the music and her reflections on the life and death of kathy wilson hundreds of miles had passed virtually unnoticed the autopsy joe keller had performed on kathy revealed disappointingly little her brain at least on gross examination appeared normal no tumors no old strokes no vascular malformations or occlusions no scars in short no explanation for the pervasive psychological transformation that had ultimately taken her life the microscopic sections of her brain would be ready to be read as soon as today or tomorrow but nikki wasnt expecting anything from that or in fact from the detailed toxicology examination of her blood tongueincheek medical wisdom had it that internists knew everything but did nothing surgeons knew nothing but did everything and pathologists knew everything but a day too late in kathys case the old saw couldnt have been further from fact what they would be left with even after a most exhausting postmortem examination were questions questions with precious few answers even the striking neurofibromas had revealed little joes initial impression of the lumps that covered kathys face and scalp was that they were fairly typical examples of the condition cause unknown except for the likelihood they were due to some sort of mutation or other genetic factor he had assured nikki that he wasnt giving up and would be calling some other pathologists for advice as well as trying some special staining techniques but for the moment at least the questions that remained unanswered were like unfulfilled promises nikki rolled the window down halfway and breathed in the fragrant appalachian air she had traveled some in the us a rafting trip down the colorado through the grand canyon mountainbike tours of bryce zion and yosemite national parks plus a week here and there in places like new orleans san francisco and chicago but this was her first time in west virginia even viewed from the highway it was a stunningly wild and beautiful place the forests were dense and lush and largely unspoiled countless streams and broader rivers wound under the roadway roiling off through prolonged stretches of whitewater or meandering through the intensely deep green canopy toward distant dusky mountains waterfalls that would have been a major attraction in many places were simply there driving through this country it was easy for her to understand the passion for the natural earth in much of kathys music the sign on route read belinda miles as planned she would be there an hour or so before the service she could have flown and rented a car as the band had done but even though she would have to turn around and drive right back to boston in order to avoid unnecessarily taking vacation time and worse being indebted to brad cummings for coverage she wanted the extended time alone to listen to the music and reflect on the choices she had made in her own life her decision to attend medical school while it seemed to be proving the right one for her was based on nothing more profound than the desire to emulate her father likewise the decision to become a surgeon if there was a single turning point in her life and her sense of herself it was leaving surgery for pathology at last she was no longer choosing paths merely because others were urging her to travel that way breaking her engagement to joe dimare a man everyone including her parents and many friends deemed the perfect catch and perfect for her underscored her evolution it happened a year after completing her pathology residency a year or so after that she was dropping out of chambermusic groups and begging kathy wilson to teach her bluegrass at its most placid her existence like almost everyone elses was unpredictable and frangible illness accident errors in judgment errors in choices they were all out there like boulders in a rapidly flowing river along with the challenges of love work and relationships the most she could do she was finally learning was to keep searching her own soul for who she was and what she wanted to be fearless in making decisions and to try to make every day matter the prim white baptist church was filling up when nikki arrived she was wearing a black linen pants suit with a sleeveless silver silk blouse but the day was already nearing eighty and the crowd was dressed informally enough so that she carried the jacket over her arm kathys band greeted her warmly as did kathys parents sam a dairy farmer and kit who made and sold quilts they were severe taciturn country people their faces weary from the hardness of their lives and even more so now from the death of their only child kathy had spoken of them with love and admiration despite the differences in temperament and philosophy that had strained their relationship over the years nikki was surprised when kit asked her to walk with them along a dirt road that led past the church and through a broad untended field when she had called them after the postmortem exam beyond some indirect questions as to whether or not kathy was drinking or taking drugs when she was killed neither parent seemed interested in any of the details of her health or the findings of the autopsy maybe the shock was too much for any clear thinking but nikki still saw no reason to answer questions they hadnt asked they quickly made up their minds in favor of cremation and a memorial service and that was that now nikki shuffled along between them unable to fully fathom their loss we thank you for comin down kit said in a voice that was eerily like kathys i miss her terribly nikki said she was a year younger than me and i was the one who had spent my life in the big city but she was so wise and so tuned in to life that i sometimes thought of her as an older sister i understand even when she was real young she was sometimes like that for me too when i was first getting to know her i played classical violin i asked her if she could turn me into a bluegrass fiddle player she said she would see it wasnt that easy a decision she picked me up the next evening and drove me way out into the country to this huge field then she set out a blanket brought out some horribletasting apple whiskey in a flask and a portable cd player we stayed up way past dawn listening to one bluegrass performer after another and sipping that horrible stuff until it tasted like honey in the morning i was so badly bitten by mosquitoes that i could barely move she didnt have a bite on her turns out she was swathed in bug repellent she wanted to see if i got immersed enough in the music that i didnt notice i was being eaten alive the next day she gave me my first lesson goodness but she could play we know kit said we know sometimes the lords ways are hidden from us until we are ready to understand and accept them she guided her husband and nikki back around toward the church where nikki could see the crowd continuing to build then asked nikki sam and i want to know kathy had the most beautiful face an angels face did the accident what i mean is kit she was beautiful at the end too nikki said willing away countless unpleasant images two bones in her neck separated thats why she died nothing else her face was completely spared thank god sam muttered she always insisted on cremation ifn anything ever happened ta her so we felt we had ta do it nikki accompanied kathys parents into the sanctuary and sat beside them during the service they had asked her over the phone to speak at the service rather than deliver memories of her friend which she simply wasnt sure she was strong enough to do nikki had chosen to read some of kathys poetry along with the words to two songs whose melodies kathy had not yet written she had to stop several times to compose herself but there was a strength and unabashed faith in the room that made anything she said or did feel right the service lasted less than an hour and was so poignant with hymns readings recollections two cuts from kathys cds and a song by some friends and the band that few eyes were dry by the time it was over the reception in the social hall adjacent to the church was much more of a celebration of kathys life and music than a memorial with her band at the core musicians came played for a time went and came back again most of them were amateurs yet all of them amazingly talented someone would name a tune or simply start playing and instantly the others would join in nikki changed into jeans and sneakers and brought her fiddle in from the car she was still pretty much of a greenhorn by comparison to most of the others but she managed to sit in on the jam for half an hour or so without disgracing herself and played a lick in foggy mountain breakdown that actually earned applause from the banjo player finally mopping her brow with a handkerchief she kept in her case for just that purpose she took a break and headed for the punch bowl here a man said from her right let me get you a cup alcoholfree or supercharged he was somewhere in his forties and goodlooking in a broadshouldered straitlaced sort of way with razorcut sandy hair a muscular build and dark gray eyes that were too small for nikkis taste he was wearing a white dress shirt and a black string tie with a large turquoise stone mounted on the slide his mountain twang sounded far less pronounced than that of the others she had met and his manner and speech had her guessing that he was college educated oh no alcohol please she said ive got a long drive ahead of me this afternoon in that case i must absolutely insist you stay away from the hightest stuff for one thing i think i know whose still it was brewed in and for another im chief of police here in belinda bill grimes he extended his hand and nikki took it his grip was confident nikki solari pleased to meet you that was a very moving reading you did kathy was a wonderful writer her words are important to a lot of folks kit told me youre a doctor im a pathologist by trade but a musician by passion kathy was in the process of transforming me from a violinist into a fiddle player i was listening shes done a fine job of that thanks im not in her class but then again not many are i didnt grow up in these parts but i heard her daddy taught her music and that since she was a child people flocked to wherever she was playing folks around here sort of took it personally when she left nikki smiled at the notion i can believe that she said her death shocked us all dr solari if the whole thing is still too raw for you to talk about i certainly understand but as a cop and a friend of the family im curious to know as much as i can about how it happened talking about things helps me deal with them even if theyre very painful things like this and its fine to call me nikki bill for me i get chief so much its like taken over as my name the policeman had an easy reassuring manner carrying their drinks they left the crowd and walked over to a solitary bench set alongside a massive willow the sun was beginning its move to the west and off in the distance the lush hills seemed phosphorescent nikki had never been much of a visual artist but if she were the colors of west virginia would be nirvana so youre a pathologist grimes said when they had settled down at either end of the bench i work for the mes office interesting our me was here at the service but he left a while ago tall thin sort of dignified guy wearin a grayish suit im afraid i havent been noticing much of anything today nikki said thats understandable well hes a pathologist just like you doc sawyers his name hal sawyer nice guy real smart too not just concerning medical things either about kathy well her death was actually handled by our office my boss josef keller the chief medical examiner for the state did the post he find anything out of the ordinary drugs alcohol nothing like that how much do you know about what was going on with kathy before her accident grimes shook his head all i know is that she was run over by a car it was a truck she ran out of a bar and into the street the poor driver never even had the chance to hit his brakes but you said she wasnt drinking her blood alcohol level was zero toxic screen at least the preliminary panel weve gotten back so far was totally negative she was insane bill absolutely insane she had been slipping into a horrible paranoia for months before she died thought there were people out to kill her i kept trying to get her help but the more i tried the further she withdrew from me did you speak with her family i called them once about four weeks before kathy was killed but they were just bewildered and also sounded angry at kathy for having drifted away from them they couldnt understand what they could do to help her if i was a doctor and i couldnt do anything the wilsons are good people grimes said but simple and very set in their ways kathy was their only kid they never thought she should have left i know so that was it she just went crazy just about as i said she was convinced at the end that men were after her trying to kill her i think she was trying to get away from them when she died is it possible she was right not that i could see so the autopsy your boss did didnt show anything else nothing we werent already aware of there was one other thing that was pretty unusual about her though something i didnt see any reason to share with her parents over a number of months before she died coinciding to some extent with the development of her madness her face was becoming disfigured by these lumps neurofibromas we call them neurofibromas grimes said the word slowly as if committing it to his vocabulary cause unknown except maybe bad genetics or a mutation that sort of thing possibly a virus by any chance did you ever see the movie the elephant maw fraid not but i think i know what youre talking about well in its worst form her condition would be like that and it was getting there she was pretty deformed at the end no telling what she would have looked like had she lived nikki glanced up at the sun and then checked her watch you really plannin on leaving today grimes asked im on call for my office tomorrow night so i have to be back by then im one of the worlds least reliable nighttime drivers so i plan on going as far as new york then the rest of the way in the morning id like to play just a little bit longer though before i take off there are a couple of kathys pieces id like to try with the gang i sure wish you could stay grimes said with invitation in his voice and expression thanks for the thought she said not at all threatened by the police chiefs tone but im locked into getting home she stood why dont you come in and let us play something for you do you have any favorites you havent heard im not much of a bluegrass expert grimes replied although i do enjoy the music tell me something he said as he walked her back to the social hall why did you decide not to tell the wilsons about kathys neurofibromas i didnt see any reason to tell them over the phone then after i met them in person here i still wasnt sure i wanted to then they told me kit asked if kathys face had been battered in the accident the poor dears had enough trouble getting their minds around her deranged mental state it seemed cruel to tell them her face was deformed as well besides the microscopic examination of her brain and the neurofibromas isnt done yet if it shows anything to explain what happened i plan to share that news with them if it doesnt provide any explanation ill have to decide if its worth telling them at all as you know kathys an only child so theres no need to worry about some evil gene working its way through her family if i were in your position i dont think id mention it to the wilsons either grimes said nothing to gain nothing to gain nikki echoed well he said when they reached the social hall im sorry to have met you under these circumstances but im certainly glad to have met you same here who knows maybe well see each other again you never can tell if i find myself headed back this way for any reason ill call you at the station do that and ill call you at the coroners office if i find myself in boston id like that she said and nikki if anything does turn up on those microscopic slides you spoke about please let me know nikki picked up her fiddle and gently rubbed it down with a cloth ill do that bill she said taking her seat among the musicians who were currently between numbers since you dont have a request ill pick one weve been playing some alison krauss she was kathys idol mine too the smart distinguishedlooking medical examiner she had never gotten to meet might have left but few others had people were gathered around the buffet table and scattered across the dance floor arm in arm waiting for the next tune kathy would have approved and probably would have insisted on adding a keg of bud to the celebration of her life nikki closed her eyes and let the music fill her mind and her body a few hours ago she was a total stranger in belinda now because of kathy and the gift of bluegrass she was connected to the town and the forests and the mountains and the water in ways that would endure as long as she did it was nearing threethirty nikki helped transfer kathys things into the wilsons dodge ram pickup after everything was set in place she reached into the trunk of the saturn and brought out the case containing kathys exquisite mandolin here she said handing it over to sam chief grimes told me you taught kathy to play only fer a couple a weeks he replied taking the instrument out and cradling it in his huge hands a soft wistful expression on his face after thet she begun teachin me he ran his thickjointed thumb over the strings which nikki had tuned before loading the instrument into the trunk then he took one of the picks from the case and played a brief riff of remarkable clarity and some technical difficulty that was great nikki said no wonder kathy was so good its in her blood here sam said placing the instrument back in its case and passing it back to her i want you ta have it but i from beyond where sam was standing kit stopped her short with a definitive shake of her head sams got arthritis pretty good she said wed both be happy knowin kathys instrument is with you nothing in either of kathys parents faces encouraged debate i may come back for a lesson on it she said youd be welcome ifn ya did sam managed his eyes moist nikki set the instrument on the front seat embraced the wilsons then headed down the arching church driveway toward the road north at the outskirts of belinda she paused and gazed back through the rear window down the length of main street it really was a lovely town gentle earnest people beautiful countryside and an appealing pace of life she ached to think she would never get to know the place with her friend she turned north retracing her route onto the narrow twolane road that would bring her to route the road snaking through dense forest was deserted just as it had been on the trip into town nikki pulled on a blue red sox cap to control her hair and opened the moon roof and her window sunlight filtered through the tops of the trees dappling the pavement as she rounded a tight turn she saw a car pulled over at an angle on the narrow shoulder a man in jeans and a yellow t lay facedown on the road a heavyset man in a dark suit knelt beside him nikkis immediate assessment of the scene was that the man had struck a pedestrian he looked up as she approached then stood and waved to her nikki pulled over scanning the ground around the victim for blood the man in his thirties and obviously distressed hurried to her window i i didnt see him i came around the corner and there he was do you have a cell phone is he breathing i i think so nikki stepped from the car and hurried to the motionless man expecting the worst no blood no obvious injuries there was a slight rise and fall of his chest he was most definitely breathing she had no intention of rolling him over without stabilizing his neck she knelt down next to him peered at his face and reached across to check his pulse at that instant he rolled over and at the same moment the large man standing behind her grabbed her roughly by the hair and clamped a cloth over her nose and mouth it was soaked with a substance she knew well from the lab chloroform beddybye doc he said chapter during her one year of surgical residency before the switch to pathology nikki had earned the nickname cube because of her absolute coolness and composure in the face of even the direst medical emergencies she never could fully explain what seemed to be an inborn trait but once she did check her pulse seconds after saving a patient by performing an emergency tracheotomy fiftyeight i guess im just a very logical person she once told a medical friend by way of explanation and a very positive one too once a situation begins critical or otherwise all i focus on is what i have to do almost never on what will happen if i screw up the whiff of chloroform gave nikki three seconds before the obese man in the business suit clamped the cloth over her mouth as with emergencies in the hospital her reactions over those precious seconds seemed reflex but were in fact the product of a number of rapidfire observations and deductions chloroform take in a sharp breath and hold it quick purposeful movements by the socalled victim its a trap beddybye doc he knows who i am this is no random mugging trying to beg to talk them out of whatever theyre going to do would be hopeless three times in her life nikki had taken selfdefense courses for women she came away from each of them frustrated embarrassed and a little frightened by how much she had already forgotten but there were three recurring rules the courses had permanently impressed on her brain do something quickly go for the testicles the nose or the knee and as soon as possible run still on her knees her back to the massive assailant nikki drew her fist up in front of her eyes and jackhammered her elbow back into the mans groin with all the force she could muster air exploded from his lungs he grunted released her stumbled backward briefly and dropped onto his butt like a sack of grain thrown from a truck the chloroformsoaked washcloth flew off to one side the railthin man in the yellow tshirt was scrambling to his feet but nikki was quicker to hers she kicked him viciously under the chin as he was coming up snapping his teeth together and sending him sprawling backward then she whirled and sprinted across the road into the forest get her verne the larger man shouted speaking without the mountain twang nikki had become used to over the day for chrissakes just shoot the bitch shit larry she broke my tooth she broke my fucking tooth in half nikki was several paces inside the trees when she dared checking over her shoulder larry mr business suit was wobbly but upright he had shed his jacket revealing a torso the size of a volkswagen sun sparkled off his expansive white dress shirt highlighting a shoulder holster on the left and dark sweat stains beneath his hamhock arms verne also on his feet seemed less dazed he had pulled a snubnosed pistol out of the front of his waistband and was starting across the road after her still rubbing his jaw he fired once but nikki was charging ahead into the brush and had no idea if the shot was even close these men know who i am and are trying to kill me her mind screamed move just move terrified and bewildered she raced ahead trying to get a sense of her situation and to formulate some sort of plan on her side of the ledger she was in far better shape than larry and probably as fit as verne also she was running for her life her disadvantages were obvious two men with guns knowing the area angry as hornets and determined to kill her not good still she could feel herself maintaining some composure and continuing to fight the urge to panic cut in over there she heard verne call out if i dont get her first shes going to run out of real estate in a hurry just dont let her backtrack nikki held her hands in front of her eyes to keep from being blinded by slashing branches the town was several miles to her left to her right from what she could remember was nothing until the main highway maybe ten miles away verne sounded concerned about her doubling back between them so that might be what she should do she quickly rejected the notion the chances of getting caught by one of them while heading back toward the road seemed too great especially when there was no guarantee even if she made it that a car would come it had to be straight ahead searching for a place to hide until dark then she could make her way back into belinda a plan however thin decided upon she flattened herself behind the thick trunk of a tree and listened verne wasnt that far behind she could hear him speaking it took a while before she realized that he wasnt speaking he was singing singing to her in a twisted haunting childs voice come out come out wherever you are allee allee in free come on little lady theres no place to go her focus on verne was interrupted by a gunshot from off to her left the bullet slammed into the tree where she was hiding what in the hellre you doing verne called out shes right there jerk larry responded right behind that tree give it up doc theres no place you can go there was a second shot then a third but nikki was already sprinting ahead weaving through trees and leaping over brush the huge killer had moved much quicker than she would have imagined him capable of underestimating him was a mistake she wouldnt make again the trees and dense undergrowth were both her ally and her enemy concealing her to some degree but at the same time tearing at her face and arms threatening to trip her or blind her and always keeping her from getting up much of a head of steam why are you doing this to me why nikki wanted to stop and scream out the question but these were men with orders not answers instead she plunged ahead splashing into a shallow stream and trying for a few dozen yards to sprint down the center of it there had to be somewhere to hide or else a path where she could accelerate and put some distance between her and the men she slipped on wet stones once then again finally she abandoned her efforts and scrambled up the muddy bank shes in the brook verne called out no there she is on the other side this way this way two more gunshots cracked off one of them snapped a branch right next to nikkis face unless she could get some space to use her speed she was going to be shot she cut to her right running low to make herself less of a target and to prevent the bushes from getting a straighton whip at her eyes it was late summer and the forest floor offered no collections of dead leaves large enough to hide her she was gasping for air now struggling to maintain her pace but she knew she was slowing down a voice inside began telling her to huddle on the ground behind a tree and simply pray they overlooked her what other chance did she have she knelt on one knee and remained motionless as she tried to regain her wind for ten seconds fifteen all was quiet could she possibly have outdistanced them that much in such a short time the question was answered moments later by the breaking of a stick and some bushes rustling at least one of them was near very near she was gripped by fear now out of ideas again her internal voice warned her to stay put and take her chances her instincts urged otherwise she sprang up and again began running crashing through the dense brush this way over here verne cried out nikki burst through some bushes and stopped short she was standing in bright sunlight at the upper border of a rock ledge stretching out before her was a lake nestled in a bowl of verdant forest the ledge sloped slightly downward for about ten yards to a sheer dropoff fifteen feet above the waters surface in the distance she could barely make out a couple of boats this is what verne had meant when he said she would soon run out of room her composure was completely gone now cube no longer existed she was trapped and going to die and all she could think of to do was scream she sensed both killers pinching in on her running from them was no longer an option the only move she could fix on was the lake to dive in fully clothed and hope she wasnt a fish in a rain barrel at the instant she turned to charge down the granite slope there was a gunshot then another the second bullet grazed the side of her skull just above her ear stunned she spun and fell heavily her head struck the rock with dazing force helpless and barely conscious she rolled down the incline and off the ledge she hit the surface of the lake face first aware only of the cold water enveloping her and the fact that she couldnt seem to move in any purposeful way the fall had driven most of the air from her lungs and as soon as she entered the water she began drifting downward within ten seconds she had settled on the stony bottom for a few moments she was aware and consumed with the horror of her situation then as blackness and peace closed in around her she took a breath chapter it was after ten in the morning when matt finally felt comfortable leaving lewis with his brothers frank seemed naturally to assume the role of chief caregiver and compared to lyle and kyle he was matts oddson choice for the job matt gave him a set of woundcare instructions and general observations to make begged him to bring lewis into the hospital if there was any change for the worse and promised to return as soon as his workload permitted then he revved up the vulcan and headed back toward his place to shower change and call mae dr rutledge i was just about to send the police out to your house she said sorry i went for a long ride last night and ended up sleeping under the stars there were no stars last night sir mae replied in a syrupy drawl no need to waste the truth on me im your biggest fan and im going to believe whatever you say thats just as well mae believe me everything okay no everything is not okay you are on backup for the er today and theyve been trying to reach you for an hour lord pardon i said ill call them right away the nurse said something about a fiftyyearold man from hawleyville with diarrhea and a fever and no doctor hes in luck i was voted the feverdiarrhea prize at harvard is the office okay the office is fine are you what are you some kind of witch there are those who might say so anything i can do not at the moment just keep the afternoon as light as possible ill do my best matt called the er and gave several holding orders diagnostic and therapeutic on a farmer who sounded as if he might have contracted a bacterial infection in his intestine possibly salmonella or shigella then he stripped in his bedroom kicked his filthy clothes under a chair and basted himself in a shower as hot as he could stand the scratches and nicks on his face werent as bad as hed anticipated but it took several minutes of scrubbing before he realized that the blackness enveloping his eyes had nothing to do with lewiss camouflage potion and wasnt going to wash away as he was toweling off he glanced over at the book on the toilet tank manual of medical and surgical field emergencies it would probably be a lifetime before he ever needed to perform one of the procedures again still he briefly flipped through the pages and then moved the book to the more prestigious location on his bedside table the farmer with fever and diarrhea was dehydrated and in moderate abdominal discomfort matt evaluated him wrote a set of orders and dictated his lengthy admission note he was praying for an easy day but that was simply not happening twenty minutes later a ninetyyearold woman arrived by ambulance sent in from one of the nursing homes with a dense stroke unable to move her right side or speak it was a medical and ethical nightmare and of course her primarycare doc was on vacation matt wondered about the wisdom of treating her at all he stood at her bedside cradling her gnarled hand in his looking into her glazedover eyes but receiving no definite message his mother was much younger than this woman and wasnt nearly at this point yet but her alzheimers was advancing steadily and before too many more years he would be facing constant questions of what was cruel treatment and what was not but today was today for his mother just as it was for this poor woman sighing he picked up her chart and wrote orders for hydration diagnostic studies and a stat neurology consult he would need more information about her much more before he put on his long white robes and began playing god by the time he had completed his second lengthy admission dictation of the day seen several scheduled appointments in the office and made rounds on his three other hospitalized patients the afternoon was fading back in the er he consulted a list he had compiled of equipment and medications to be appropriated from the hospital for lewis he had just put together a real chest tube and drainage system when an ambulance emt who had been drinking coffee in the lounge hurried out to him his name was gary lydon he was earnest babyfaced and not much more than twenty dr rutledge he said breathlessly dispatch just radioed the police just got a call from a motorist on wells road apparently some kids just dove down and pulled a woman up from the bottom of crystal lake they were fishing beneath niles ledge when she tumbled off it from right above them and just sank shes alive so they say kirsten langham the second emt joined them she had a bit more experience than gary but was still fairly green it wasnt like rescue to put together such a team matt accompanied the pair out to their ambulance how long was she under he asked dispatch didnt say theres a problem though what rick wise is the paramedic on this shift and hes off on harlan road picking up a motorcyclist if this woman needs to be intubated neither me nor kirsten is certified to do it crystal lake near wells road matt estimated that by the time the two emts got the woman out of the woods into the ambulance and back to the hospital a half an hour would have passed maybe even more if she needed a breathing tube and unless she was wideawake and talking sensibly she did it should be done as soon as they reached her hang on for just a minute he said im going with you bless you doc gary said ill save you a seat up front no i want to be in back to check the equipment kirstenll help you ill drive matt raced into the er told the nurses where hed be and then hustled into the rear cabin of the ambulance the return trip to the slocumbs farm was just going to have to wait hopefully lewis was still stable if not frank slocumb had better have the courage and good sense to bring him in siren blaring the ride to the spot on wells road took ten minutes an empty belinda pd blackandwhite was parked on the soft shoulder flashers on gary lydon drove past the cruiser before pulling over beside a narrow trail that matt knew led into niles ledge he had prepared the large plastic crash case with all the equipment he might need to intubate hauling the case he raced through the woods sensing a powerful unpleasant feeling of deja vu what lewis and he had been through already seemed like a year ago after a quarter of a mile the winding track split one path to the top of the ledge and one down to the water take the right fork he hollered on the off chance that the emts hadnt grown up in the area we hear you gary called back the scene under the massive ledge was impressive several fishing skiffs had tied up along the shore and their occupants had joined two uniformed policemen and two teenage boys crystal lake was long and fairly large the ledge situated in a broad cove near the south end was difficult to reach but offered diving into fifteen feet of water and around it some decent fishing as well the two boys still wearing their waterlogged jeans but no shirts or shoes stood off to the side a policeman knelt beside a supine woman alternately giving her a mouthtomouth breath and pausing to watch her take an occasional shallow breath on her own these boys here are heroes doc the standing policeman said proudly they saved her but whats left matt wondered as he knelt beside the other cop officer gibbons sir the young policeman said i think weve met before whats the story matt asked already into his examination the woman thin white in her thirties was unconscious and breathing ineffectually her dark hair was matted to her forehead her lips were purple the officer was right to keep breathing for her and matt told him to continue her pupils were midposition but did not react to a flash from his penlight either the result of a technically limited exam or a very grim sign she wore jeans sneakers and a black tshirt with a wavy musical scale on the front and had a raw bruise and abrasion just above her left eye there was also a long laceration more of a gouge along the hairline just above her right temple the emts arrived and matt instructed them to begin breathing her with a bag as soon as they could these boys were fishin here the standing officer said when suddenly this lady came plungin off the ledge from up above them one of them percy newleys boy harris swears he heard something like a gunshot just before she flew past him and into the water did they get her up on the first try matt asked listening to her chest with his stethoscope as he was speaking excuse me percys boy and his friend did they haul her up on the first dive the officers sheepish expression said that he had just grasped the significance of the question he clearly hadnt asked harris how many tries did it take for you to pull this woman off the bottom two michael tried first then we did it together we hauled her up by the hair thank you matt said already preparing for an intubation he estimated the submersion time at two minutes and hoped he wasnt giving the boys too much credit meanwhile gary was setting the triangular cup of the breathing bag in place over the womans mouth and nose while kirsten was inserting an iv after the breathing tube was in place the cup would be set aside and the bag connected directly to the tube normal saline kirsten asked exactly matt said youre all doing great thanks to these heroes and the good mouthtomouth technique they did this ladys going to make it but she still needs our help im going to put a breathing tube in so we can get some concentrated oxygen into her lungs lets put her on the stretcher gary and lift her up id rather work with a little elevation than stretched out on my belly with her flat on the ground in the hospital the anesthesiologists were the royalty of intubation having honed their skills hundreds of times in the operating room during one of his residency electives matt had chosen anesthesia and tubed dozens of cases under their guidance over the years that followed he had multiple reasons to be grateful for every one of those opportunities the main rule he had learned was that if the caregiver performing the procedure wasnt absolutely comfortable physically and mentally the chances of a failed intubation were greatly increased the most common disasters were intubating the esophagus instead of the trachea thereby filling the stomach with air tearing the tissues of the throat and causing bleeding which made subsequent attempts that much more difficult damaging the vocal cords by forcing the tube down without adequate visualization and finally inserting the tube too deeply and occluding one of the two main bronchial tubes matt now did what had been taught to him and what subsequently he had taught to many students and paramedics he took an extra few seconds to position his new patient and compose himself before proceeding with the woman on her back on the stretcher he tilted her head slightly downward straightening her neck gary lydon knelt beside him to hold her head steady in that position physically settled on one knee and as confident as he could be given the circumstances matt slid a curved lighted laryngoscope blade along the womans tongue and pulled the blade straight up toward her chin all he could see was lake water welling up from her lungs trouble maybe big trouble in the er there would have been suction to clear her airway not here a blind thrust with the semirigid tube was possible but treacherous doing so had to be a last resort easy now easy the womans color remained poor brain cells were being compromised every second soon they would begin to die come on rutledge stay cool and dont panic you can do this you can do this matt took a deep calming breath grasped the handle of the scope tighter and pulled the blade upward another eighth of an inch the move nudged the victims tongue out of the way even more and lifted her epiglottis the flap that protected the lungs from aspirating food or drink the slight adjustment caused the pool of water to recede just enough to expose the two silvery halfmoons of her vocal cords yes matt smoothly slid the tube between the cords were in he said trying for some matteroffactness but missing badly there was audible relief from both emts and the police nice going one of them said matt used a large syringe to blow up the balloon fixed around the end of the tube sealing it in place and preventing air from escaping around it kirsten langham quickly attached the black latex bag to the tube and connected it to oxygen in seconds the mottled duskiness of the womans complexion began to improve she was almost certainly going to make it how much of her brain would make it too remained to be seen matt handled the breathing bag as the troupe awkwardly retraced their steps pushing the stretcher along the path back to the ambulance while the woman was being lifted into the back matt took the two teens aside you guys did one heck of a job in all likelihood you saved this womans life lucky we was there one of them said ill say youre harris im michael hes harris got it two things first tell me again you were fishing and she fell into the water right in front of you yes and sank she might of stayed on the top for a second or two michael said but otherwise thats the way it happened i got down ta her but i couldnt get a grip afore i ran out of breath then we did it together an brought her up by the hair two minutes minimum matt estimated again four maximum depending on when they started breathing for her and how well they did it and you did mouthtomouth harris did i screamed for help harris did you hold her nose closed i did sir and i tipped her head back too where did you learn how to do mouthtomouth they taught us in health sir we used a dummy to practice well we sure are glad you were paying attention in that class matt said now about those gunshots they werent shots michael said they were too soft they were branches cracking probably maybe a car backfirin out ta the road were too gunshots harris insisted michael im telling you pistols dont sound the same as backfirin there were two shots maybe three ready gary called out from the rear of the ambulance kirstens going to bag her with you ill drive you guys did great matt said again lots of people doctors included sometimes think they saved someones life when the truth is they might not have take it from me you two really did it he jumped into the ambulance and waved to the boys as gary closed the door then he took a seat on the bench opposite from the emt and for the first time took a careful look at the woman who had come so close to dying beneath niles ledge she was still unconscious the swelling above her left eye was pronounced and beginning to discolor but to matts touch there was no evidence for a depressed skull fracture beneath the bruise the linear gouge above her right temple certainly could have been from a gunshot there were also scratches on her cheeks and chin similar to those matt had sustained just half a day ago it wasnt a stretch to imagine her terrified charging through the dense woods with someone shooting at her he separated her eyelids and used his penlight to check her pupils response to light again this time the results were different pupils are both reacting he announced to the emt great kirsten said her oxygen sat is ninetyseven decent enough i cant say why but she just doesnt seem that deep to me i know what you mean shes sort of begun chewing on the tube a little matt brushed her sodden hair from her forehead her face distorted some by the breathing tube still had a peaceful gentle quality to it pale unlined brow high cheekbones wide almondshaped eyes he lifted her limp hand and set it on his her fingers were long and slender nails cut short if there was polish on them it was clear there was a gold claddagh friendship ring two hands supporting a heart on her right fourth finger and a single gold bangle on her left wrist no other jewelry her palms were soft without a hint of callus but there was a fullness to the muscles matt imagined the hands playing piano or writing or throwing clay pots something manual and artistic come on you he urged silently wake up the mobile mri facility that served the region was currently in its twomonth rotation at hastings hospital twentyfive miles away montgomery county though did have a ct scanner which for blunt head trauma was nearly as definitive matt radioed ahead and asked that the room be reserved in one hour he also asked the nursing supervisor to call the belinda police department and request that an officer come down to the er to begin investigation of a possible shooting and also to try and determine the identity of their patient he wondered as he rang off whether or not the powers at bc ampc had filed any complaint with the police against him patient saved doctor arrested the sort of news a small town loves the er crew was waiting for them as they backed into the ambulance bay for the next fifteen minutes matt was a secondary player the nurses and respiratory technologist became the major caregivers while the phlebotomist from the lab and the tech from radiology spearheaded the gathering of diagnostic information their comatose jane doe was lifted from the stretcher to an er bed stripped down and covered in a johnny and a sheet her iv and monitor lines were quickly transferred to hospital equipment a catheter was placed in her bladder to keep close track of hydration and urinary output and she was hooked up to a ventilator next a portable chest x ray and skull film were taken finally the crew stepped aside and matt resumed his position at the bedside this time his examination would be more detailed including the critical visualization by ophthalmoscope of the retinas in the back of jane does eyes he was relieved to see pulsation in the veins there as well as a sharpness to the margins of the optic nerves loss of either would be a grave sign indicating significant brain swelling from trauma andor prolonged lack of oxygen so dr rutledge i understand you called grimes matt turned slowly to face the belinda police chief the two of them had had some conflicts over the years usually surrounding some action or other matt was running against bc ampc matt also complained more than once of being harassed with tickets parking and speeding grimes was exmilitary and kept the town on a pretty short leash a displaced northerner with some sort of degree in criminal justice he had adopted something of a mountain accent he was divorced with a kid in florida someplace that matt heard he never saw their contrast in styles alone would have strained their relationship but grimess connection with armand stevenson and the other directors of the mine all but sealed their enmity over the years the police chief had appointed himself as a oneman watchdog committee to step in whenever matt didnt have an appropriate permit or was posting notices against a town ordinance matt suspected grimes or his lackeys were behind the disappearance of most if not all of the magenta fliers i just asked for a policeman matt said not the policeman youre a very important person to us grimes replied smiling civilly what do you have matt gestured to his patient at the sight of her grimess lips tightened noticeably this woman plunged off niles ledge and into the lake matt said one of the two kids who rescued her said he heard several shots the other kid doesnt think so shes got a big bruise over her eye that may be why shes unconscious but she also has a scalp wound that could be from a gunshot im legally required to report any possible shooting thanks for telling me that doctor from time to time i forget some of the laws how long was she underwater i estimate two minutes minimum four maximum she had no id so in addition to reporting the possible bullet wound i hoped maybe you could find out who she is grimes stepped forward set his hands on the bed rail and gazed down at the woman her name is nikki solari he said flatly she drove down from boston to attend kathy wilsons memorial service earlier today i spent some time talking with her there wilson was her roommate you know who she was i know about her and ive heard some of her music but i didnt know her personally well she was hit by a truck in boston died instantly i heard something about it from hal sawyer apparently he knew the family and kathy yeah he was at the service well this woman played fiddle in kathy wilsons bluegrass band matt decided that playing fiddle was close enough to pianist he was mentally patting himself on the back for astutely concluding that nikki solaris hands were those of an artist when grimes added she only played music as a hobby shes actually a pathologist a coroner up in boston spends her time working up to her elbows in gore and guts matt immediately stopped the patting what do you think about that wound above her ear he asked grimes studied it i guess it could be from a bullet he said but it could just as easily be from something else like a broken branch well well find out for sure when she wakes up grimes suddenly whirled to face him you just make sure that she does he snapped chapter much of what i write here of my infection with the lassa virus and my miraculous recovery i gleaned from conversations with those who cared for me during my thirtyday hospitalization i use their accounts because i was delirious for much of the time and remember almost nothing the words were those of dr suzanne oconnor a missionary physician she was working in the central nigerian city of jos in the spring of when a patient lila gombazu crazed with fever clawed through her rubber gloves and broke the skin on the back of her hand cloistered in one corner of the library of medicine at the nih ellen kroft read oconnors harrowing account with a dry mouth and an unpleasant fullness in her chest the poor woman who scratched through my glove went into convulsions the next day in spite of the most heroic measures we could muster she began hemorrhaging from her nose womb and rectum and died horribly crying out at the end for her children two of whom she had no way of knowing were already showing symptoms of the disease twelve days after my encounter with lila my good health and the crush of work caring for our patients had driven the incident to the back of my mind that day a monday i mentioned to one of the nurses that i had a stuffy nose and scratchy throat and thought i might be coming down with the flu tuesday was more of the same although the discomfort in my throat was steadily worsening i couldnt possibly take time off from my work though the hospital was filled to capacity and then some i put myself on a high dose of penicillin and tried to force fluids past the inflammation and the raw white sores that now dotted my palate and pharynx on wednesday i was making rounds on our patients when i was seized with uncontrollable shivering and profound weakness perspiration soaked my clothing as if i were standing in a thunderstorm my temperature at that moment as taken by one of the nurses was degrees fahrenheit within an hour i was a patient in my own hospital moaning piteously from the pain in my muscles and joints unable to take fluids because of the gaping deep ulcers in my throat and soiling myself and my bed with uncontrollable diarrhea the next morning i was delirious my temperature had risen to despite vigorous efforts to keep it down for days i am told i lay unconscious unable to take nourishment or fluids oozing red blood from my rectum and coughing up blood as well from the beginning the diagnosis of lassa fever was strongly suspected my associate dr janet pickford made valiant efforts to fly experts from the cdc to nigeria along with serum from a woman who had recovered from the disease and had circulating antibodies against it unfortunately the government of nigeria angry about having the disease named for the village of lassa located along the nigerian border with cameroon delayed issuing visas to anyone involved with my case finally those state documents were approved and on the tenth day of my illness i received an infusion of the womans convalescent serum by then i had required more than a dozen blood transfusions and had been delirious or in a coma for almost the whole time i had lost nearly thirty pounds from a frame that was slender to begin with and was a mass of bruises and sores my urine and stool were bloody as was the mucus from my chest incredibly within just two days of receiving the serum my condition began to improve a miracle everyone said gradually the hideous ulcers in my mouth began to heal and i was able to take nourishment over the next two weeks i regained much of my strength as well as my will to live what i did not completely regain was my hearing which was lost to the virus in both ears and which has only returned slightly in my right i would wish the illness of lassa fever on no one and pray that with time a cure or vaccine for this most terrible hemorrhagic virus might be found ellen closed the book called closer than you think infectious diseases in a shrinking world and sank down in her chair staring across the library at nothing in particular sixtyone that was how many cases of lassa fever had been reported in the us over the past couple of years sixtyone and counting not that it mattered to ellen whether the cases were here or in africa but for the time being at least omnivax was going to be administered here and the lasaject component of the supervaccine was she had come to believe the weak link in the chain now a day after a very sobering highly charged meeting at the office of dr richard steinman she wasnt so sure lynette marquands startling pledge that if even one of the vaccine panels twentythree experts expressed misgivings release of omnivax would be put on hold until those problems could be satisfactorily addressed had hit her life like a wrecking ball following the pronouncement ellen had done her best to continue with business as usual but that state of existence had proven highly elusive less than a day after marquands speech steinman had requested that she meet with him at his office at georgetown when she arrived she found the renowned physician and scientist waiting for her along with george poulos on the corner of steinmans desk was a copy of the days washington post a headline on the front page proclaimed first lady promises to rethink omnivax if panel vote is not unanimous the article which ellen had read did not mention her by name but did say that debate among members of the select commission on omnivax would continue until the vote to be held in just three days steinman who had a certain amount of charm and warmth was nevertheless extremely formal and even after nearly three years addressed all of the commission members by their title well mrs kroft steinman began i appreciate your coming up here to meet with me i hope you dont mind my having taken the liberty of inviting dr poulos to join us no problem ellen said still smarting some from the exchange with poulos at the final commission meeting after mrs marquands speech i um felt it was essential to review our conversation with dr steinman poulos said i felt that in view of the first ladys promise to the nation he should know that the final vote might not be unanimous i suppose i would have done the same thing in your position she said somewhat coolly mrs kroft steinman said i confess i was somewhat taken aback to learn that at least before mrs marquands speech you were planning to vote against the implementation of omnivax over the years we have been meeting together i felt that you honored your mandate as a consumer on our committee quite admirably by questioning issues until you understood them and always being prepared for our sessions i wondered from time to time if you might vote against approval when yours was only one ballot of twentythree but now that your vote can effectively stop the entire omnivax program i thought if it is all right with you that we might review together what is at stake of all those on the omnivax panel steinman was the one ellen respected the most he had guided every session evenhandedly and had always been patient and encouraging when she began one of her excuse me but as a nonphysician i was wondering if questions i am open to any input or point of view she said despite what dr poulos may have told you poulos tried unsuccessfully to inject some warmth into his grin i admit that right or wrong i do recall your saying something to the effect that you didnt plan on voting in favor of approval the man was right but holding most of the high cards ellen didnt feel it necessary to respond steinman passed two computergenerated pages to her i know how you feel about statistics mrs kroft as malleable as chicken i believe you said but you still must acknowledge that often in science statistics are all we have i understand this is a distillation of material we have discussed in great detail in our meetings it is in short our estimate of the lives that will be saved by omnivax over one five and ten years broken down disease by disease please believe me when i say that this summary was put together by statisticians who are as unbiased in their opinions as it is possible to be ellen scanned the list which was as steinman said a summary of precisely what was at stake measles was included as well as the other vaccines now legally a part of every childs immunizations but with or without those vaccines the number of lives to be saved was staggering the oneyear figure for lassa fever was which seemed in keeping with the statistics she knew by five years however the death toll would be over eight thousand and in ten nearly fifty thousand ellen gazed out the window thinking about lucy and the hundreds of other tragedies represented in the files and photos of pave those were real fleshandblood lives not statistics then there were the myriad cases of adhd learning disabilities asthma diabetes multiple sclerosis sudden death aspergers syndrome and other forms of autism whose possible link to their childhood shots still begged investigation ill think about this she said slipping the data into her briefcase ellen look at those numbers poulos blurted out dont you see what these numbers mean yes i see doctor ellen countered i see perfectly but do you see what its like to have the life of a perfectly happy healthy child suddenly ruined or snuffed out altogether by something that was done to her by her physician george please steinman said discarding formality mrs kroft we do understand that believe me we do riskbenefit ratio is the bedrock on which all medical treatment is built and not one of us would deny that there are some immediate adverse consequences of immunizations for some children all we can ask of you is that you do exactly as you have said you would think things over but i feel i must underscore all that is at stake here and i do appreciate that dr steinman ellen said standing to indicate that she had heard enough especially from george poulos i wont make any pronouncements about what im going to do but i do promise to consider all the issues i hope thats enough for the time being it will have to be steinman had concluded ellen had left steinmans office in something of a daze why in the hell had lynette marquand done this to her things were fine when she believed that her vote would make a statement now that her vote could halt the project altogether the pressure was immense she left georgetown and spent much of the rest of that day in bethesda at the nih library now after a second day of research it was time to discuss matters with cheri and sally at pave prior to making a final decision as to which way she was going to vote whatever that decision ultimately was suzanne oconnors gripping account of her battle with lassa fever would be a strongly considered factor lost in thought she gathered up her things and headed out to her car following marquands speech it was certainly expected that she would speak personally with cheri and sally yet she had kept putting off that meeting cheri sanderson however hadnt waited too long before calling her she was hardly a fool and ellens uncertainty however minimal still resonated loud and clear this is big stuff now ellen she had said over the phone id be lying if i said that it wasnt important for us suddenly to be on center stage and that you are in a position to put us there a mile into the drive ellen used her cell phone to call rudy peterson here rudy its me she said imagining him sitting at his desk on the second floor of his cabin well greetings are you going to be famous you mean am i going to vote against omnivax that would certainly put you on the oprah show i suppose it might i met with the head of the committee yesterday and now im on my way to speak with the moms at pave and i dont know anymore rudy do you have any information on lasaject that might help me out im waiting for a call from a friend of mine at the cdc all i can tell you at the moment is that the preliminary research on the vaccine was a bit sloppy in its design and severely limited in its scope but as i said before there are some other things that may be going on thats what this call from arnie whitman at the cdc is all about so when will you know anything maybe later today maybe tomorrow in the meantime all i can tell you is that the vaccine seems okay if not squeakyclean whens the vote the day after tomorrow i dont know all i can say is ill keep in touch thanks rudy any plans to come by these parts as soon as this vote is over i love it up there and goodness knows ill need the rest good enough ill keep the kettle boilin for ya ellen set the phone down rudy wasnt going to be the answer at least not on this round he wasnt unlike her last visit to the pave brownstone this time ellen could find no parking space reluctantly she pulled into an for the first halfhour lot three blocks away there were problems with vaccines that the government and scientific community werent addressing pure and simple she had absolutely no doubt that lives were being lost and destroyed because of the immediate and longrange complications of immunizations but she also had no doubt that vaccines prevented a great deal of suffering and death there was no standing ovation this time when ellen stepped into the offices of pave no silliness suddenly her valiant quixotic stand on behalf of issues in which they all believed had turned serious ellen recalled the delightful book and movie the mouse that roared in which a minuscule country with an army of two dozen or so archers wages war against america their plan is to quickly lose in order to reap the traditional harvest of postdefeat reparations from the american victors except that they win now what no one but no one had expected to be in a position to defeat omnivax even temporarily all pave wanted was a platform on which to take one more baby step forward to get concerns about vaccine safety presented to the world and ellen had certainly come through for them in that regard now what hey comes the conquering hero cheri sanderson bounded from her office and exchanged hugs with ellen if im so conquering ellen responded how come i feel like theres a lemon lodged in my throat i understand john kennedy got physically ill right before he called khrushchev and told him to turn the missiles around or else come on in coffee tea no thanks sally not here cheris cluttered office featured framed articles chronicling the remarkable ascendance of pave as well as mounting public recognition that vaccinations were not as warm fuzzy and uncontroversial as the powers that be would have everyone believe shes spending the day with her husband shes been getting a little emotional lately about this omnivax business and i think shes been a little hard on him i can understand i know what shes been through with what happened to her son so today its just going to be you and me quite a spot lynette put you in huh ellen stared down at her hands this woman no more than fivetwo or three was a giant chosen perhaps by god to overcome massive odds in order to make a difference over the past decade and a half she had spent thousands of hours cajoling writing researching debating flattering decrying begging consoling sobbing in order to help the world right what she believed was a most serious wrong she had fought beside mothers whose children were being hauled away from them because they refused to have them vaccinated she had sat before specially appointed masters at the us court of federal claims holding hands with parents who had just received a piddling sum to care for their vaccineinjured child the legally declared maximum according to the national childhood vaccine injury act of or worse no compensation at all ellen gazed up at one of the framed quotes it was from a wisconsin mother whose son whose dream was horribly irreparably damaged the government forces us to give our children these vaccines it read and then when something goes wrong too had youre on your own look ellen said finally unable to couch the words im sorry for seeming so reserved but you have no idea what ive been listening to for the past three years and whos been saying it these men and women are not monsters or criminals or killers theyre physicians and scientists and intellectuals they really believe in what they are doing to ellens surprise there was no kneejerk rebuttal from cheri her expression which sometimes had the hardness of a diamond was soft and sad i know they are she said gently i wont argue the fact ellen went on that many of them get research money from the pharmaceutical companies but does that necessarily make them wrong for every graph i produced they produced a dozen for every question i asked they offered incredibly logical supported answers for every expert i quoted they brought in ten with qualifications just as sterling when i thought my vote was going to be a token a polite request for continued debate on the issue that was one thing i never wanted to be the epicenter of this controversy i never wanted to be the linchpin cheri pushed back from her desk then walked behind ellen and embraced her resting her cheek on ellens hair there was nothing phony in the gesture nothing patronizing look she said returning to her seat im not going to say this isnt important to us but i will say it isnt everything its a battle not the whole war there were more than five hundred in attendance at the vaccine conference we ran this year five hundred from all over the world professors pediatricians scientists parents philosophers there will be more at the next one the press and congress are beginning to see that we are not hysterical radicals being led around by our bitterness hormones and emotions devoid of logic unwilling to listen to reason ellen youve done a wonderful job more so than any of us had the right to expect youve made sally and me and all the others out there proud youve already helped thousands of parents know that their opinions matter if you vote against omnivax you and i both know youre headed for a feeding frenzy in the media and maybe even the cover of newsweek and time wed be naive to think otherwise if you vote for it life settles back down for you and youll still be welcome to resume your spot on the volunteer phone but i promise you either way pro or con nothing will change in our determination to have a true longterm scientific evaluation of immunizations nothing will change in our crusade for informed parental choice nothing will change in our commitment to find the middle ground that is safest for all people ellen could tell by cheris expression that she wasnt playing any head games even though she had the reputation in some quarters of being a master at it my mind is nearly made up as to what im going to do ellen said but until i am absolutely certain id like to keep things to myself thats okay cheri replied it would sure be nice to know as soon as you do and i certainly hope you deliver a blow for us i intend to do whats right ellen added hoping cheri might read that things were likely to go her way thats all any of us have ever asked of you cheri said as ellen walked out past sallys open office door she peered in at the photos adorning the walls and paused a moment to look at one in particular ellens home an expanded sevenroom cape in glenside maryland southeast of dc was the one she and howard had bought shortly after their marriage if this is the only place we ever live ill be perfectly happy he had said at the time sure on the way home ellen stopped at the local superette for some eggs and milk she loved omelets of all kinds and with what there was in the crisper she would be able to create a goldmedal winner physically and mentally she was spent as exhausted as she could ever remember being as she was fishing out her wallet for the cashier she glanced over at the magazine rack both time and newsweek were there imagine her face on the covers today buying eggs and milk at kims korner tomorrow her face around the world was she ready what do you think howie expect to see your new bride on a magazine cover anytime soon barmaid monthly ellen set her groceries on the front seat chastising herself for her pettiness most of the time she managed to keep her anger and hurt in decent check it didnt feel good at all when she had a slip the supervaccine was too much too fast she thought of the horrible arithmetic steinman had presented to her lives lost or ruined if she voted for the drug versus lives lost or ruined if she voted against it based on the current level of knowledge of vaccines it was really no contest but that was precisely the main point for which cheri and sally and the others were crusading an increase in our level of knowledge ellen pulled into the garage and brought her bundle in through the kitchen door despite the unpleasant association with howard she really did love the place from her window herbgarden to the huge oak in the backyard to the pesky squirrels to the small balcony off her bedroom where she often sat and watched the first sunlight of the day filter through the trees it was really a very lovely ellen set down her package and sniffed the air had someone been smoking in the house one of howards pet peeves with her was her overdeveloped sense of smell and one of her pet peeves was cigarette smoke in any form still sniffing curiously she walked down the short hallway to the living room then she cried out and stumbled backward clutching her chest to keep her heart from exploding sitting calmly in the easy chair next to the fireplace was a large powerfully built man he was dressed expensively in a gray suit and black shirt open collar no tie and ornately stitched cowboy boots his head square as a block of granite was topped by thick jetblack hair combed straight back and held in place with some product that glistened his hard narrow eyes looked as black as his hair and his wide mouth was accentuated by a short thick scar that ran from the center of his upper lip to the base of his nose possibly the result of surgery to repair a harelip golly im sorry to have startled you mrs kroft he said with a pleasant gravelly voice and the cheerful easygoing manner of a usedcar salesman please have a seat have a seat ellen remained fixed where she was there was no evidence the huge intruder had smoked in her house yet the reek of cigarettes was definitely coming from him she debated running but in truth she didnt have the sense that she was in any immediate danger the man had already gotten into her home if he had wanted to harm her he wouldnt have been waiting placidly in her living room who are you what do you want she demanded the man smiled patiently who i am doesnt matter what i want at the moment is for you to sit down over here he motioned to the sofa next to his chair ellen hesitated then took a breath and did as he demanded at close range his eyes were more than dark they were frighteningly cold his thick heavyknuckled fingers rested in his lap curled around a large manila envelope the little finger of his left hand bore a gold ring with a squarecut diamond that must have been three carats or more now ellen said what are you doing here i represent a group that is very interested in getting omnivax into circulation as soon as possible that is all you need to know so what has that got to do with me his expression tightened ellen thought she saw a brief tic at the corner of his mouth still he managed a patronizing grin mrs kroft he said his tone still chillingly calm i have neither the time nor the patience for games both you and i know the significance of the unfortunate promise lynette marquand made to the world and and i have it on good authority that you are the only person who might force her to honor that pledge who do you work for the president the drug people who the huge man sighed impatiently and ignored the questions mrs kroft i am going to have to insist on your word not to block the planned release of omnivax what do you have in that envelope she asked bribe money oh i have no intention of trying to bribe you mrs kroft there was something chilling in the way he said the words he passed over the envelope ellen opened it removed the photographs it contained and gasped inside were half a dozen sharp professional quality blackandwhite eightbyten snapshots of lucy lucy heading into school hand in hand with gayle in the playground at home in the yard even asleep in her bedroom you wouldnt dare harm this child ellen rasped the man simply looked across at her placidly she wanted to leap up and claw the smugness off his face i will do whatever it is i have to do he replied firmly look at me and dont doubt me for a second if you do you and you alone will be responsible for the consequences the people i work for have given this matter utmost priority if you disappoint us in any way i promise you that your granddaughter will simply disappear forever what happens to her after she vanishes you dont even want to speculate about and depending on how angry my employers are that may well only be the beginning her anger muted by the sheer arrogance of the monster next to her ellen could only glare at him do i make myself clear he asked do i for the first time he raised his voice yyes ellen managed you can go to the police if you want but i promise you two things number one we will find out and number two they will be able to do nothing to prevent what i have promised you will happen clear yes good we have an understanding then yes she said again now perilously close to tears wonderful the man said standing stretched upward his full length with his broad shoulders and massive head the killer was daunting as calmly as he might pick up the morning paper he leaned down and retrieved the envelope and photographs the cigarette stench of him at such close range had ellen close to vomiting he then took a cell phone from his pocket flipped it open and dialed a number with one button push were all set he said simply seconds later a car pulled up outside i thank you for your hospitality mrs kroft he said and your family i am sure thanks you for your levelheaded decision making theres no need to show me out he closed the drapes to the picture window and with a final grin left ellen raced to the window and stuck her head between the drapes hoping to pick up the license plate number but the car a nondescript sedan was already rolling off down the street chapter matt seldom awoke remembering a dream and even less often was aware he was dreaming while one was still in progress but this time at some level of his mind he did know he was at once a participant and observer legitimately terrified yet strangely detached and analytical it was a huge gila monster orange scales glinting in patchy sunlight the venomous lizard tall as a building was swaying through a dense forest its thick tail knocking over trees its stubby legs crushing everything in its path its black tongue snapped out like a whip shearing the tops off pine trees again and again it slammed itself against a rocky hillside sending boulders hammering down close to where matt was standing all at once there were men with guns indistinct shadows firing continuously burying shot after shot into the lizard the gila reared up on its hind legs balancing on its tail searching for the source of its pain more men more guns more shots more flashes more bellowing and now blood spewing from a hundred wounds along its flank the massive orange and black head swayed from one side to the other powerful jaws opening and closing on nothing but air noooo matt heard himself scream no more mortally injured the beast toppled over roaring at its killers flailing out with its front claws ripping at matts arm again and again it was then he sensed he had awakened his eyes opened a slit the clawing against his arm persisted then he became aware that it was nothing more malevolent than a hand scratching at his elbow he was in a chair in a glassenclosed cubicle in the icu dr nikki solaris cubicle he realized slumped to one side he had been asleep his head resting half on his shoulder half on the bed the touch that had awakened him from his bizarre nightmare was solaris through the glass julie bellet one of the night nurses waved to him smiling the wall clock behind her read fivethirty matts thoughts quickly cleared the stiffness in his neck suggested he had not moved for some time his patient arms restrained with leather straps was silently imploring him through the gloom her eyes were wide with fear and confusion the polystyrene tube he had slid between her vocal cords was still in place the bedside ventilator attached to it whirred and hissed as it forced air into her lungs with every breath julie bellet stepped into the room hi there she said youve been out for almost three hours but you looked so peaceful that none of us had the heart to wake you up i um was a little tired he managed i guess its time to ditch the decaf and go back to super he grinned sheepishly and turned back to solari he knew from the accounts of many who had woken up on a ventilator that having a halfinch tube down the back of their throat and into their trachea was as unpleasant and frightening a sensation as any they had ever experienced especially with their hands lashed down as well he switched on the overhead fluorescents dr solari sorry about falling asleep like that its been a tough couple of days im matt rutledge your doctor do you understand nikki nodded her eyes still fixed on his face good he said youre in montgomery county regional hospital in belinda west virginia the tube is in because you nearly drowned in a lake yesterday youve been unconscious for more than twelve hours nikki ignoring the throbbing in her temples moved her hand as far as the restraint allowed and pointed desperately back at her face the tube get it out please get it out its choking me nikki prayed her doctor understood matt rutledge was probably a few years older than she was with a kind rugged face his dark hair was pulled back into a ponytail that came down just over the collar of his shirt i know you want that tube out this instant he said i know its awful but please please try your best to relax and breathe easily do you think you need some medicine to help you do that good give me a signal if you change your mind about that the vents on assist so all you have to do is breathe i promise ill get the tube out as soon as i can first i need to get a film and check your blood gases if i loosen the straps on your wrists do you promise youll keep them away from the tube nikki nodded the nurse who was in the doorway came over introduced herself and undid the restraints nikki she said the balloon on your tube is still blown up please dont try and pull it out it can damage your vocal cords if you do okay nikki forced herself to nod the tube felt like a garden hose in her throat intellectually she knew what it was and what it was doing for her but at some uncontrollable primal level she was positive she was choking she closed her eyes as her doctor listened to her heart and lungs examined her belly and checked the pulses in her arms and feet then he had her open her eyes and checked them with an ophthalmoscope his manner was reassuring and his touch gentle from what she could tell he seemed to know what he was doing she settled back into her pillow and forced herself to breathe more slowly piece by piece the events on the highway and in the woods floated into place why the question burned in her thoughts why things sound good matt said im going to write some orders and splash some water on my face then ill be back after he had gone the nurse julie straightened the sheets and wiped off nikkis face and hands youre going to be fine she said dr rutledge may not look like a med school professor but trust me hes a really great doctor the best in this hospital i understand youre from boston well he grew up here but he trained at harvard he actually rode out to the lake with the ambulance and put that tube in you out there nikki nodded that she understood and made a weak thumbsup sign doctor just before the fat guy in the business suit had attacked her he had called her doc who could have told him that the two men werent out to rob her or even to rape her they were going to kill her why matt returned to nikki solaris bedside after washing shaving and gathering the things he had appropriated for lewis slocumb the hours of sleep had served him well and at least for the moment he felt sharp and focused yesterday he had planned to return to the slocumbs farm to replace the juryrigged chest tube after just a few hours of work in the hospital now nearly a full day had gone by well he reminded himself he could only do what he could do and hope that frank slocumb had the sense to drag his brother into the hospital if he was in trouble solari looked alert and a bit more animated her x ray had showed no pneumonia and her blood gases were excellent it was time to keep his promise and remove the tube hopefully then the questions surrounding the events at crystal lake would be answered one mystery that had already been answered was the bizarre dream in which matt had been immersed on the top of solaris left foot was a tattoo orange and black of a gila monster matt had noticed it during his initial exam but was far too engrossed in trying to save her life to give it much thought the woman with the elegant longfingered hands who hed guessed might be a potter had turned out to be a coroner and the coroner who played bluegrass music had an orange and black gila monster tattooed on her foot as popular as tattoos had become in the general public they were still not that common among middleoftheroad med students and doctors was she offbeat enough to be into drugs in some way he wondered maybe dealing is that why she was being chased through the woods near niles ledge matt considered the possibility as he prepared to remove the breathing tube from her throat he also pictured his own tattoo injected into his arm as a constant permanent reminder of love and loss no he decided glancing up at nikki solaris expressive eyes whatever the significance of the odd tattoo it had nothing to do with drugs the technique for removing the endotracheal tube was as straightforward as the potential complications of the procedure were lifethreatening suction out the trachea deflate the balloon have the patient attempt to cough and pull out the tube simple lurking in the shadows however was the specter of a reactive spasm of the larynx severe enough to shut off the airway and tight enough to make reinsertion of a breathing tube near impossible matt had never actually performed an emergency tracheotomy but he had the equipment to do so near at hand at that moment there was nothing in the world he wanted to do less dr solari were all set he said nikki nodded and gave him a weak aokay the woman was tough he was thinking whatever else she was she was tough good he said i know this next part isnt pleasant but weve got to do it suction please julie the nurse snaked a small suction catheter down beyond the tip of the tube into nikkis trachea nikki reacted to the intrusion with violent coughing tears overflowing her eyes and running down her cheeks im really sorry matt said deflating the balloon on the tube lets get this part over with just take a breath and cough nikki did as he asked a slight tug and just like that the tube was out the nurse moved to suction out nikkis mouth and throat but nikki pushed her hand away bless you nikki croaked the nurse slipped a clear polystyrene mask over nikkis mouth and nose for a minute then another no one spoke as nikki took long grateful draughts of humidified oxygenenriched air her blood oxygen level as measured by the oximeter clipped around her fingertip remained good and her cardiac monitor pattern steady there was no significant laryngeal spasm you all right matt asked finally ugh that was just awful nikki said hardly the way to greet a new patient where i come from doctors usually start by asking who their insurance company is lights in the icu cubicle were dimmed once again the nurses had gone off to prepare for another admission an admission who would probably be given nikkis room haltingly dozing off every few minutes nikki shared the story of the faked accident on the roadway the chloroform the gunshots and the subsequent chase through the forest she had no recollection whatsoever of the events immediately surrounding her plunge into crystal lake the frightening account was totally engaging to matt but no more so than the woman who was sharing it exhausted and clearly dealing with a headache dizziness and other effects of a concussion nikki she insisted he call her that had a spirit intelligence and wry humor that even her compromising condition could not diminish he had questions dozens of them and undoubtedly grimes would as well but for the moment he had no desire to deal with the man soon after she was persistently awake he would call the station for now he sat quietly and waited while she rested he was actually surprised to realize he was studying her face why did it appeal to him so there was little if anything about it that was reminiscent of the woman he had loved for so much of his life if ginny was beach sand and midday sun nikki was more moonlight and the still dark water of a lake at night ginnys mouth was innocent and childlike nikkis full and sensual over the years since ginnys death he had from time to time been with one woman or another but never had he been drawn to any of them this way he felt awkward strange and a little disloyal what was he doing contrasting and comparing this woman with ginny have those memories remind you of how wonderful life can he again isnt that what mae had said to him at that moment the voice that bothered him with such things reminded him that he was her physician romantic involvement by a doctor with his or her patient was prohibited not only by the hippocratic oath but by most states legislatures as well for too many docs such involvement ended up being a shortcut to grocery clerkdom hey there still here she asked dreamily i um may have dozed off again i aced nap oneohone in med school tops in my class me too i was slated to be a surgeon but they booted me out after i fell asleep at the operating table i can picture you toppling face first into an open abdomen nikki tell me why did all this happen to you i have no idea but those men knew who i was im sure of that could they have been after drugs anythings possible i suppose but from what i recall i think they were after me pure and simple i think i heard them say each others names but i cant remember matt rose from his chair ill be back he said where are you going to call the police chief grimes will want to know youre awake and until we know what this is all about i want a guard next to your door nikki rubbed at her eyes i think i spent some time with the police chief you did he told me from what i remember he was very friendly that explains it matt said flashing on grimess totally inappropriate thinly veiled threat in the er what nothing nikki we havent contacted your family just give me the numbers and ill call your husband or parents or anyone else you want my dads recovering from a small stroke my mom gets hysterical at the sight of a robin eating a worm and the candidates to be my husband are still out there fighting one another to the death for my favor since im probably going to make it why dont we just not upset anyone oh except my job i was supposed to be at work matt wrote down the number ill be back he announced in a woeful schwarzenegger accent youre very nice she said he started to reply then realized she was out again breathing evenly and deeply when matt explained what he wanted the desk officer at the belinda police station patched him through to bill grimes has she told you what happened grimes asked i havent asked her much i wanted to call you first dont tell me youve gone sensible on me very funny she did say it was two men one real fat in a business suit one athletic ring any bells maybe she also said they were shooting at her so that was a bullet wound by her ear i would say so ill have someone over there within the hour grimes said and ill be by later to speak with her just go easy matt said wanting instead to tell him to just stay the hell away from her shes got a fairly severe concussion how long do you think shell be in the hospital i dont know for sure a couple of days maybe im going to have the neurologist see her and maybe get an mri if he thinks it might tell us anything more than the emergency ct scan we did fair enough one of the guys will be over there shortly round the clock okay rutledge how about you just do your business and let me do mine nancy matt said to the nursing supervisor are you sure you cant keep dr solari in the unit any longer matt you know id walk over hot coals for you nancy catlett said but we have four criticals in the unit right now and a postop abdominal aneurysm repair due up soon theres just no way i can justify keeping a patient whos awake and alert even one of yours in that case a private room that depends on her insurance just find one for her were going to have a guard posted outside the door i want only people essential to her care going in there if she needs a specific order ill write it if her plan still wont cover the private i will well now i dont think well need to go that far catlett said but if thats the way you care for all your patients im switching doctors to you my hmo is terrible about paying for private rooms matt made quick rounds on the patients he had in the hospital and then brought the chest tube insertion kit drainage system intravenous bags antibiotics and other purloined equipment to his motorcycle thoughts of nikki solari and questions surrounding the assault on her had now bivouacked in his mind making it difficult to concentrate on much else when he returned to the unit the nurses reported that nikki had been asleep since he left drifting back out again immediately after each of the two neuro checks they had done still the moment he stepped through the doorway she moaned contentedly and opened her eyes welcome back she said yawning how did you know i was here sometimes i just know things hows your headache did you ever see riverdance ouch i can have them give you some tylenol but id rather stay away from anything stronger tylenol will be fine im tough you dont have to convince me of that the police guard is all set you were right about bill grimes he feels very protective toward you i hope he can get to the bottom of this she said hes a pretty good cop when lie wants to e listen ive got a house call to make but im going to wait around the icu until the guard gets here you just go ahead and sleep right now thats the most therapeutic thing you could do in a minute right now im wide awake can you sit for a little while i sort of feel like dorothy when she looked out the window and discovered she wasnt in kansas anymore id much rather talk with you than write progress notes thanks the nurses tell me you trained at harvard i did my residency in medicine at white memorial im impressed i wasnt accepted for their surgical program surgery i did a year of surg at metropolitan then switched to pathology i wanted my patients to lie really really still when i was operating on them where did you live when you were there beacon hill the poorer part at the bottom i liked boston pretty much but my heart has always been here in the mountains i couldnt wait to get back thats not hard to understand its very beautiful here when youre not being chased by a pair of crazed killers it is can i ask you something sure its about your tattoo what about it she asked with a slightly defensive edge to her voice oh nothing i just wanted you to know that i run into gila monster tattoos on the top of doctors feet all the time around here nikkis eyes narrowed are you making fun of me they asked matt leapt in to save the situation uhoh im sorry he said sounding flip when i shouldnt is one of my less desirable talents it gets me into more hot water than a boiled lobster mea culpa he pushed up his sleeve to reveal his own tattoo im into hawthorn trees myself nikkis expression softened sometime youre going to owe me a story she said well lets see i had the tattoo put on a few years ago some of my musician friends were getting them and i decided i wanted one too i picked the dorsum of my foot so that i could see it whenever i wanted to but i could also hide it whenever i wanted i might have thought of some other location if i had known how much that one was going to kill its actually only half gila monster the front half is a salamander many of our doctors choose that variation he commented in spite of himself her eyes laughed no problems this time i once saw the combination on a clay pot at a navajo reservation in arizona she went on and after the artist explained it to me i ended up adopting the creation as sort of my totem the salamander is shy porous vulnerable weak and secretive the gila is fearless compact warriorlike determined and so tenacious that when it grasps something with its thick jaws one must often cut its head off to get it to let go matt flashed on the horrible death of the beast in his dream and shuddered he had never been one to reject the mystical or supernatural beginning with dreams and this one was bothering him more every second was the unsettling scenario merely replaying a version of the events recently past or was it a vision of things yet to be i can see how those two men on the highway got more than they bargained for he said there was no response nikkis eyes were closed again her brain muffled by exhaustion and the physiology of her concussion the lingering effects of blunt head trauma were absolutely unpredictable and potentially devastating matt had seen professional athletes forced to the sidelines permanently and others intellectually sound initially with no visible changes on their mris become significantly impaired over just a few days silently he prayed for nikki solari and the music that she made with and without her violin he stood and before he turned away impulsively reached out to touch her hand at the last moment he pulled back the gesture would be perfectly innocent and natural with nearly all of his patients but not he had to admit with this one chapter with three quick raps dr richard steinman gaveled to order the final meeting of the select commission on omnivax the scene outside the closeddoor session was nothing like the throng of reporters and photographers that had covered lynette marquands speech but the media was still well represented the drama of the first ladys promise to go back to the drawing board with omnivax if even one member of the august panel voted against it coupled with the political and medical implications of the project had kept interest high around the elegant conference room twentytwo physicians and scientists stopped their conversations and solemnly took their seats behind their name cards around the massive table one place remained conspicuously empty that of consumer representative ellen kroft i would like to take this opportunity steinman began to thank each and every one of you for nearly three years of outstanding deeply committed effort which will culminate in this mornings vote you have done a great service to your country to the medical community and ultimately to the people of the world the agenda for this meeting is that you will individually be given the chance to make some final remarks on whatever subject you choose relative to the work we have been doing after that we will go around the table and each will vote yea or nay for the purpose of the first ladys promise to the american people an abstention will not be viewed as a negative vote he paused looking as if he had just swallowed an underchewed chunk of meat before we go any further he said after clearing his throat and composing himself there is a statement i have been asked to read to you it was delivered to me earlier this morning with a note stating that copies of it are being sent to the washington post and the new york times as well as to all four major tv networks and cnn it is from mrs ellen kroft who will not be here today im sorry there wasnt time to provide each of you a copy but one will be distributed to you by the time our session is over i have been asked by mrs kroft to read her statement to you in its entirety there was a stirring in the room and an exchange of glances some expressions were curious some unabashedly disdainful seated next to ellen krofts empty chair george poulos fixed his neutral gaze steadily on steinman there being no objections then steinman said i shall proceed he again cleared his throat then adjusted his glasses esteemed colleagues as the lone consumer representative on the omnivax commission i have approached my responsibilities not as the scientist andor physician that all of you are but as a mother and grandmother from the day of our first meeting i established three mandates for myself the first was to learn as much as i was able about the process by which vaccines are developed tested approved and later on evaluated once they are in general use the second was to acquaint myself in depth with the components of omnivax their production individual characteristics and interactions one with another and finally to speak with a cross section of fathers and mothers in a number of communities recording their hopes and yes their fears about vaccinations in general and omnivax in particular i would like to address these tasks in that order there are many including most of you the first family and hhs secretary lara bolton who believe that one of the primary benchmarks of progress in a civilized society is how thoroughly its citizens are protected against infectious diseases as you know but others may not since nineteenforty the number of required vaccine doses for our children has risen from three doses of dpt to forty doses of twelve different vaccines and now with omnivax while the number of shots will drop impressively the number of vaccines administered will more than double omnivax certainly seems like one giant leap for mankind but will there be negative consequences the gold standard for any new drug investigation is the double blind study in which the subject population is divided into two groups equal in as many demographic and medical parameters as possible the larger the study population the better so long as the characteristics of each group are equivalent one of the groups then receives the drug being evaluated and the other a placebo the study becomes double blind when neither the patient nor the treating physician knows who is getting what the longer the evaluation is continued the more reliable its results in fact many new drug studies have been conducted over a decade or more my research has shown that not once has a vaccine any vaccine been evaluated by a prolonged double blind study the pharmaceutical houses are powerful and fund much of the drug research done at our universities and medical centers they also have polished highly effective public relations offices that have on a number of occasions set out to convince the general public that we cannot afford to deprive the placebo group of the lifesaving benefits of a vaccine while waiting until a statistically meaningful double blind study can be completed has this shortcut in scientific process hurt us in any concrete medical way that i cannot answer with any certainty what i can say is that as vaccination rates have climbed there has been an alarming increase in the incidence of a number of socalled immunemediated diseases and conditions such as asthma allergies and juvenile diabetes as well as others autism add and other learning disabilities whose classification as immunemediated remains to be established is there a connection do vaccinations in some instances disrupt the normal development of the bodys immune system until longterm double blind studies are performed on those vaccines we may never know here steinman paused for some water and to make eye contact with those on his committee several of them rolled their eyes in exasperation at being forced to listen to the shopworn simplistic revelations of the one member of their panel with no research credentials i can see what youre thinking steinman said but i am going to finish mrs krofts statement she has done us all a great service by deciding to abstain from this vote in our laboratories and clinics we are powerful and influential but in the court of public opinion the consumer representative has more clout than almost any of us when this meeting is over and our vote has been taken we are each going to have to respond publicly to the issues she is raising any questions just get it over and lets vote one of the pediatricians groused thank you mel steinman said that is just what i intend to do he straightened his glasses and took another drink and what about omnivax mrs kroft goes on first let me say how impressed i am with the research and medical technology that has gone into the development of this amazing product but once again i must ask where is the double blind study where is the longterm evaluation once a drug or vaccine is released the cdc and fda rely on a postmarketing evaluation system of physician adverse reaction report forms studies have shown that only a small percentage of doctors have ever filled out such a form despite knowing or sensing that many conditions they have encountered may be vaccine or medicationrelated some are too busy or simply cant put their hands on a form at the moment they need one those who fill out such forms generally do so only when the suspected reaction occurs within a short time after the medication is taken and more often than not is spectacular i would be remiss not to point out that there is no evidence at this juncture that omnivax has caused problems in preliminary test subjects of a magnitude that even remotely approaches the mortality of the diseases it is preventing but i would also be remiss not to point out that omnivax is only as strong as its least extensively evaluated component thirty vaccines no double blind research but also no obvious major adverse effects for me those three facts make the decision on omnivax a tough call that brings me to my final task that of being a true consumer representative parents are frightened that government agencies and the pharmaceutical industry are keeping information on vaccine side effects from them those parents who wish to decline vaccinating their children are prosecuted sometimes even when they can show that doing so violates their basic religious beliefs this shouldnt be happening in america wherever i go parents are clamoring for three things information research and choice so where does that leave us we have a remarkable product that will unquestionably save lives we have a basic essential research design that has been skipped over just as it has for every other vaccine or vaccine combination we have ever used we have parents wanting more information and more control over what is injected into their childrens bodies after reviewing all these facets and issues i have decided i can neither wholeheartedly endorse omnivax nor vote to deprive the american public of its lifesaving gifts i therefore have decided to abstain from the final vote on its approval i wish my colleagues on the commission all the best and thank them for their forbearance and education over these past thirtytwo months richard steinman set his glasses aside around the room expressions clearly said that none of the participants were the least bit moved by what ellen had written after several silent seconds george poulos raised his hand and spoke i would like to move at this time that we dispense with the final comments and proceed right to a vote second a weary voice called out objections steinman asked okay then george suppose we start with you i vote yea at the moment of the historic vote ellen was a hundred miles to the north of the fda building driving in no particular hurry through the lush landscape of marylands catoctin mountains headed for the cabin of rudy peterson two hours before that she had picked up lucy at her home and driven the child to a small wooded park bisected by a gently flowing stream there she led her to a bench and sat beside her holding her close rocking in synchrony with her not far away on a small playground half a dozen children were playing on the swings and jungle gym lucys gentle scent scrubbed and clean was no different from those kids ellen thought her hair her skin her beautiful eyes all were perfectly normal yet here she was as different from those children as if she had come from another planet ellen scanned about wondering if she and lucy were being followed and observed the notion made her queasy there was no obvious candidate that she could see but that meant nothing the people up against her were professionals im going to find that man honey ellen whispered softly im going to find that man and im going to find out who hired him and im going to hurt them im going to hurt them like they have never been hurt in their lives for fifteen minutes they sat there ellens tears dampening her granddaughters hair the children had all raced off to class the playground was empty lucy rocking less than usual stared vaguely off in that direction i love you baby ellen said finally helping the girl to her feet and back toward the car come on lets get going gayle is waiting for you at school at eleven ellen was just a few miles from rudys cabin she flipped on the radio and found a staticfilled news broadcast just in time to catch the report from rockville in the unanimous vote promised by first lady lynette marquand general use of the omnivax multivaccine had been approved in just a few days she would be present at a washington dc neighborhood health center as secretary of health and human services dr lara bolton administered the first injection of the drug after that inoculation with omnivax would be required for all newborns and eventually for all older children as well let the games begin ellen thought bitterly she felt anxious but keyed up as well there really had been no choice for her she had done what she had to do if she had plowed forward with a negative vote on omnivax and something had happened to lucy she would simply have been unable to go on there was no mention in the news report that ellen had abstained from voting rather the focus of what she heard of the report was the political implications of the marquand administration keeping a pledge made to the american public perhaps over the next day or so she thought her statement would get some press perhaps not it really didnt matter her hands tightened on the wheel as her minds eye pictured the arrogant thug sitting so calmly in her living room reeking of cigarette smoke the bastard had done his job well he had convinced her that if he so wished it none of her loved ones would be safe and there really wasnt a damn thing she could do about it what she hoped he did not know was that he had only won the first round she had thrown a light jab in the form of her press release but she felt certain her statement was nothing that would bring reprisals now she had to find a way to strike a more substantial blow ideally a mortal one in addition to protecting lucy by allowing the vote to proceed she had bought the time needed for rudy peterson to complete his work she cut off the main road onto an unmarked gravel drive that cut through a meadow festooned with wildflowers sunlight glinted off the colors the sound of insects and scent of late summer filled the air at the end of the drive nestled in a young wood was rudys roughhewn cabin rudy had been howards college roommate and later best man at their wedding he was for many years a biostatistician at the fda before he was prematurely nudged into retirement by reorganization but that hardly told the story of the man despite his longterm friendship with her husband ellen had always thought of rudy peterson as the antihoward where howard was handsome and dashing rudy was introspective philosophical and hardly the physical specimen women would chase after howards humor was slapstick and ridicule rudys droll and subtle with just a pinch of cynicism howard had turned out to be more flash than substance rudy continued to be a steady loyal friend who had never said a strongly negative word about his former roommate in fact he was the only one of their predivorce acquaintances who had managed to maintain a relationship with both of them ellen parked behind rudys ancient pickup surveyed the house then walked around to the back there was no sense looking for him inside on a day like this a narrow wellworn dirt path wound from the small backyard through the woods to rudys pond it was a neat little pond five acres he had said fed by mountain streams and stocked with trout and bass by a company who made a business of doing that rudy in his rowboat was out there in the middle gazing up at the hills pausing now and then for a cast he was wearing his trademark tom sawyer style straw hat even at this distance ellen could smell the cherry tobacco from his pipe according to a wellrun study from scotland he had told her one pipeful a day of cherrywood tobacco added healthy years of life whereas two or more pipefuls were responsible for minus she sat down in the shade on the shore but it wasnt long before he spotted her and waved ahoy he called out be right in ellen watched as he reeled in shipped his rod and rowed toward her as soon as he had been let go by the fda rudy had closed up his apartment in rockville and moved out to the cabin fulltime never married he had a brother and a niece and nephew some good friends and passions for carpentry and classical piano which he played better than most still ellen always worried that he spent too much time alone and she made it a point to call once a week or so and to drive out for an overnight every few months bearing enough homecooked food to last a few weeks since her appointment to the select commission on omnivax the calls and visits to her friend had been more frequent rudy tied up on the trim little dock and then exchanged kisses on the cheek he had a round boyish face that looked as if it had yet to feel a razor the hair on his head was completely gone save for a silver monks fringe ellen and others felt he bore enough resemblance to actor gavin macleod to call him captain he had responded by painting the love boat on the stern of his skiff where are the fish she asked i throw them back by this time of the season most of them know me by my first name they bite on the hook just to come up and visit once in a while one of them will mess himself up enough that ill have to bring him home and make a meal of him its good to see you she put her arm around his shoulders as they walked back to the cabin so he asked after fixing two cups of tea how did the vote go did you throw a monkey wrench into their machine ellen had spoken to him after lynette marquands promise but not since the visit from the man with the harelip scar i didnt go in for the vote rudys eyebrows arched just a bit so he said i assume our friendly neighborhood vaccine is now the law of the land twentytwo to nothing with one abstention with one abstention the first dose is scheduled to be given in a few days the first of millions tens of millions thank you she corrected glumly its not ready he said she brightened up you have proof not exactly but as i told you before were closing in on something tell me rudy looked at her kindly then shook his head you first he said im a patient man but theres a hole the size of georgia in the middle of this conversation im sorry rudy i know how worried you used to get about me after howard left i wanted to tell you what caused me to abstain without having you get too upset i just couldnt figure out how now thats what i call one hell of an interestpiquer ellen smiled ironically i suppose it is she said im sorry you know me the queen of worrying about people worrying rudy the day before yesterday a man broke into my house and was waiting for me when i got home he was huge and reeked of cigarette smoke and had a thick scar right here above his lip he sat there smiling while he produced pictures of lucy at school in the yard even one in her bedroom and implied that she would be kidnapped and killed in a horrible way if i cast the vote that sent omnivax back to the drawing board rudy exhaled whistling softly im sad to say im not that surprised this big daddy vaccine means a lot of things and a lot of money to a lot of people you can describe the bastard of course but what does that accomplish its a start he was so damn sure of himself rudy he just sat there smirking knowing there wasnt a single thing i could do except listen he said that if i went to the police they would be able to do nothing and he would find out ellen felt herself beginning to unravel she bit on her lip and brushed some tears away with the back of her hand hes probably right on both accounts rudy said im really sick that this happened to you he reached over and awkwardly patted her hand was there anything else you remember after he finished threatening lucy he made a call from his cell phone and a car pulled up he walked out of the house as calmly as any doortodoor salesman and drove off just like that i tried to get the license number of the car but it was gone too quickly did he say anything at all that gave a hint as to who had hired him ellen shook her head i dont think so he said he was employed by someone who wished to get omnivax into circulation as soon as possible i asked if he worked for president marquand or the drug companies but he brushed that off i wonder rudy said my moneys on someone on the manufacturing end of all this from what i know about lynette marquand i doubt shes capable of hiring someone like this but i cant speak for her staff or her husbands for that matter wait he said employers plural i remember that distinctly well heres some paper id like you to write down every single thing you can remember about the man his appearance clothes mannerisms phrases he said everything what goodll that do i dont really know yet but as my granny used to say it couldnt hurt maybe something you forgot will pop into your mind maybe i want to find him rudy i want to find him and and hurt him i close my eyes at night and theres his hideous face leering at me i wake up in the middle of dreams soaked in sweat early this morning i actually got sick i wanted so much to go to the police but after what he said i just couldnt easy does it el ill help you if hes out there well find him but first get the facts down on paper you know me i need data let me get you some more tea while you do that then youll tell me whats been going on with you then ill tell you rudy said rudys study was the small second floor of the cabin once an attic the skylights beamed cathedral ceiling knotty pine paneling and floortoceiling bookshelves helped make the room as comfortable as the man occupying much of the space was a large oak desk bearing a computer and other sophisticated electronics a reading area with two worn leather easy chairs and a shared ottoman took up the rest by the lone window a telescope looked out across the yard toward the pond after she had finished writing down what she remembered of the welldressed wellspoken killer ellen kicked her shoes off and settled into one of the easy chairs rudy took the other as he stretched his legs onto the ottoman his bare foot brushed against hers he quickly pulled it away and muttered an apology his expression a strange mix of embarrassment and and what ellen wondered then she noticed the heightened color in his cheeks so she asked as he replaced his foot on the ottoman a respectable distance from hers well you know the problem ive been encountering trying to check up on this omnivax it isnt that there are any incriminating research data there arent its that for a project this massive there aint that much data at all and as a statistician i like playing around with piles and piles of data almost as much as i like fishin the megavaccine has been fieldtested but not in any controlled way and the components have all been tested individually and in some combinations though not in any controlled way either every piece of this lummox of a vaccine seems to work just fine but only as far as its been evaluated i have no doubt that omnivax protects people against every infection they say it does i hear a but coming on but if this were a new arthritis medicine or birthcontrol pill there is no way it would have been approved for general use on numbers this scant to the best of my knowledge there has never been a tightly controlled double blind study of a vaccine to the best of my knowledge that is correct physicians and the pharmaceutical industry and some of my dear old friends at the cdc and fda would rather take the chance there are no problems with a vaccine than risk depriving the public of protection against even one a them goldurn microbial buggers go on well like i think i told you i decided to focus what little time and resources we had on examining the weakest links in the omnivax chain so i weeded through the blocks of data available on each of the less common disorders what i call the fringe players and like i mentioned this vaccine against lassa fever heads that list its relatively new so are the outbreaks of infection it was created to protect us against it was approved for general use by the fda about ten years ago from a statistical point of view my statistical point of view at least it was rushed into use too soon they were afraid a major epidemic was brewing here in the states i know only it didnt happen at least not then it didnt well there are no major problems with the vaccine that i can tell but it sure hasnt been tracked very thoroughly i already know about that ellen said hoping her tone didnt reflect her deep disappointment thats what you have rudy took her reaction in though and for a few seconds he just sat there then shook his head and grinned proudly nope he said as a matter of fact it isnt what i have at all i made some calls one of them was to an old pal from the cdc i used to do projects with his names arnold whitman and hes an epidemiologist and a microbiologist arnies been looking at these outbreaks of lassa fever for us on the qt if he gets caught mucking around in someone elses territory it could be his job anyhow what he found may be nothing but arnie doesnt think so and arnie is very high on my list of very smart people who arent wrong about science a hell of a lot you should be on that list ellen said oh i am seriously listen to this the incubation period for lassa fever from exposure to symptoms is seven to fourteen days twentyone days tops eighteen of the cases in the us appear to have brought the infection in with them from africa the rest of the cases are believed to have caught the virus from those eighteen given the known incubation period it seems as if every one of the eighteen cases became infected on or about the very day they left africa for the us weird more than weird my friend this is the stuff my statistics were born to make sense of and guess what they cant precisely they cant make sense of those eighteen cases all becoming infected as they are about to leave for the us because somethings wrong but what that is the conundrum i cant say at least not yet but wait theres more in the countries where it occurs frequently lassa fever has a clearcut seasonal predominance for the months of january and february in fact heres a little graph i put together with cases that occurred three years ago which i got from a sierra leone health ministry report via my pal arnie impressive ellen said not overwhelming but the januaryfebruary pattern the textbooks write about is certainly there now look at our eighteen cases ellen held the second graph next to the first there was only one case in january none in february most of the rest were in the summer and your statistics say rudy pressed an imaginary buzzer adding the sound effect once again the numbers say that somethings wrong and need i remind you that these are my numbers and my numbers never lie from what i can tell in the months of may june and july you have a much greater chance of catching lassa fever by flying to the us than you do by staying in africa what do we do with this information we try and turn it into a working hypothesis he replied a scenario that fits and explains the data we need to come up with some facts starting where i would say starting at the sierra leone embassy in dc a friend of mine in the state department tells me they have access to a passenger manifest of every flight out of their country plus id be interested in how many americans got lassa fever in africa as opposed to after they came home i believe you could get that information from the sierra leoneans as well data i crave data ellen jumped up and threw her arms around rudys neck i knew youd come through rudy youve been just the best friend in the world to me thats not exactly the hardest thing ive ever had to do he said looking away chapter code blue icu code blue icu matt was on medsurg writing orders regarding nikkis transfer to a private room when the code call sounded there was little doubt in his mind that the subject of the code was the sixtysomething woodsman who had taken her bed matt had passed him in the corridor as he was being brought into the unit and had noticed the pallor around his mouth and slight mottling of his skin suggesting that his heart was not pumping effectively matt raced to the unit arriving simultaneously with two nurses and the respiratory therapist although he didnt regret the decision to switch from the onepatientafteranother approach in the er to the more intense indepth relationships of primary care he remained something of a hybrid and the intense action surrounding a code blue or multiple trauma still brought a welcome rush he was in the room before he realized that the cardiologist at the mans bedside was robert crook matt hadnt seen his nemesis at all since the illfated meeting at bc ampc crook greeted his arrival with a scowl and a derisive shake of his head need help matt asked with accentuated cheeriness i think i have enough crook grumbled from behind him nurse julie bellet vehemently shook her head and mouthed the word stay why dont i hang around just in case suit yourself get ready to shock at four hundred joules please one twentyfive should e enough matt was thinking bellet looked over at him imploringly but all he could do was shrug the was definitely overkill but not a serious enough breach to go to war with crook over the cardiologist plowed ahead setting the defibrillator paddles against the mans chest clear ready shock julie bellet depressed the button delivering joules of electricity through the woodsmans chest almost immediately the chaotic spikes of fibrillation were replaced by a rapid regular rhythm okay crook said in a purposefully matteroffact tone hes now in a nice supraventricular tachycardia lets give him a milligram of propranolol iv no matts mind screamed wrong diagnosis wrong treatment he moved forward next to crook robert he said softly enough so that most of those in the room werent even aware he was speaking thats v tach im certain of it xylocaine not propranolol crook glared at him a milligram of propranolol iv he ordered again make that two give it slowly damn matt thought unsuccessfully trying to avoid julie bellets desperate gaze as she and another nurse responded slowly clearly stalling war was about to break out robert he whispered again get some xylocaine in him and you might be able to keep him from fibrillating crooks sideways look was if anything more piercing than before ill thank you to at that instant with a flurry of ineffective beats the woodsmans unstable ventricular tachycardia rhythm degenerated into immediately lifethreatening ventricular fibrillation four hundred joules crook ordered pointedly looking away from matt get a hundred of xylocaine into him also lets hold off on the propranolol for now at that moment the resuscitation which should have been straightforward and successful could easily have gone either way fortunately a power greater than any in the room decided it simply wasnt the old woodsmans time the electrical countershock was followed by the xylocaine he should have gotten in the first place which was then followed by another shock and suddenly there they were a decent monitor pattern and a functional blood pressure nicely done matt said there was no response from robert crook in minutes the patients cardiac situation had stabilized his color had improved and his pressure rose and remained constant crook motioned matt to one side of the cubicle where he could whisper without being overheard take a word to the wise he said harshly and think about finding another place to practice someplace far away from here but i like it here matt said i grew up here i always thought id grow old here well you can damn well grow old someplace else that is if you want to grow old youve stepped over the line rutledge i dont know what youre talking about people are going to get hurt and i wont be a bit surprised if youre one of them are you threatening m dr crook julie bellet was pointing to the monitor screen where some irregular beats had appeared another fifty of xylocaine iv crook blustered he turned back to matt you didnt fool anyone he said matt suddenly reached out and grabbed the man by his tie and shirt in such a way that crooks back screened the move from view of the nurses neither do you he rasped dont ever threaten me again stunned his cheeks flushed with crimson crook pulled away and adjusting his shirt and tie returned to the bedside matt couldnt remember physically assaulting anyone in his adult life stupid absolutely stupid it was dumb luck that no one saw what he did fists clenched he whirled and without so much as a glance backward left the icu crook clearly knew about their penetration of the toxic dump matt was thinking but was the warning from armand stevenson or was the cardiologist overstepping the bounds of his position with bc ampc and exactly what did he mean by people are going to get hurt what people the slocumbs matt hurried to nikkis room to see if the police guard had shown up he had been away from lewis slocumb and his brothers way too long already he arrived at the room just as officer tarvis lyons came lumbering down the hall lyons had been matts classmate at montgomery regional high school tarviss unofficial nickname tar pits referred to the speed with which he did just about everything matts surprise that tarvis had made it to graduation at all let alone without a police record was nothing compared to his shock when he returned home after his residency to find lyons was on the force it was hard to believe anyone would entrust the man with a pair of handcuffs let alone a service revolver hey ledge wazzapnin lyons said using matts high school nickname his voice was an octave higher than one would have expected from his bulk grimes sent you matt hoped he hadnt emphasized the you as much as he feared he had i was off today that means im available for overtime the big ot the chief says theres a babe that needs watchin grimes called dr solari a babe urn i cant remember exactly shes a doctor tarvis thats like twelve years of education after high school i think shes earned something a little more respectful from you than babe grimes coming over he said hell be by soon to talk with her do exactly what he says thats what he said what he said to wait and do exactly what he says matt sighed listen post yourself out here make sure you or one of the nurses knows anyone who comes in to see her i have to leave the hospital for a few hours ill be on my beeper just call the hospital operator if you have any questions and shell find me im all over it ledge lyons said you still playin hoops i still play at it not much left of the shot though or the legs for that matter you always were a great shot ledge thank you for remembering tarvis keep a close eye on dr solari matt stood by the doorway and let his eyes adjust to the dimly lit room nikki was asleep breathing sonorously through her oxygen mask concerned by what crook had said he was anxious to get out to the slocumbs farm he hurried to the nurses station and wrote an order for a neuro check every thirty minutes for two hours then every hour after that for five hours a final glance at tarvis lyons who was pulling a chair out from a deserted room and he raced off to his motorcycle the ride out to the farm seemed interminable once again all the guilt matt felt about putting lewis slocumb in harms way welled to the surface crook was a jerk but he was right he had stepped over the line maybe it would be better just to let the whole thing drop forget about the toxic dump and admit that he was no more of a match for belinda coal and coke and their selfserving policies than his father had been then he pictured the horribly deformed faces of darryl teague and teddy rideout how many others like them would there be how many were there already no he decided as he pulled up in front of the farmhouse he wasnt going to back off no matter what he would just be careful not to place anyone else in danger on the altar of his crusade just as lewis had been waiting for him on the porch for their trip to the mine frank was there now he was leaning against a railing a potentlooking shotgun cradled loosely in his arms matt wondered in passing if they somehow knew he was coming hows he doing matt asked hes had a doggone mizrable time of it mosly from the pain in is shoulder but hes still alive an cussin thats a good sign frank im really sorry it took me so long to get back here the hospital got incredibly busy i couldnt get away before now we knowed youd be back soons ya could not a hint of irritation or entitlement these men tough as nails were used to taking life as it came and to giving their friends every benefit of the doubt lewis wearing tattered jeans and nothing from the waist up was in the upstairs room propped by two pillows in a straightbacked oak armchair his color was surprisingly good the bandage around his upper chest was bloodsoaked but that was to be expected the drainage system was intact and the gauze he had wrapped loosely about the end of the condom was soaked with dried and drying blood clearly the apparatus was functioning quite well frank slocumb and his brothers had proven to be quite capable nurses the room was surprisingly clean and the linens looked as if they might have been washed since he was last there the three men stood proudly and respectfully to one side of the room as he worked your brothers have done well by you lewis matt said listening with his stethoscope and noting that breath sounds extended to all fields of both lungs they knowed whatd happn to em ifn they dint am ah gonna live frank said you were too ornery to die and he was right matt put an iv rig together and asked for a heavy wire to be hung from the roughhewn ceiling as a hook in less than two minutes lyle had nailed in precisely what was needed matt hung up the small plastic sack filled with powerful antibiotic and started the medication running into lewiss arm thisll help make sure theres no infection he said what bout this here contraption lewis asked motioning to the siphon tube well matt replied incredible as it may seem it appears that this here contraption has saved your life no doubt about it he was thinking a letter to the author of field emergencies was definitely in order now the way i see it weve got three choices leave it in pull it out or change it you want us ta vote frank asked the four brothers whooped at his humor which had sailed over matts head fits all the same ta ya doc lewis said ahd jes a soon ya dint go stickin no more stuff in ma chest ah dint have the heart ta tell ya but them pliers ya jammed in thar last time hurt lak hell out of respect for matt the three standing brothers kept their guffaws to a minimum okay lewis matt said im going to leave things as they are the problem is if i take the tube out too soon the lung might collapse again and if i leave it in too long infection might set in but listen guys if he starts to get sick with infection fever cough pain pus redness spreading through the skin around the hole anything like that cut the stitch and just pull the tube out immediately got that got it frank said ya done a fine job doc matt took the bandages down cleaned the wound and then redressed it listen he said ive got to talk to you all about something else i think the people at the mine know it was me who was in that waste dump of theirs im not sure they know that it was lewis that was with me but i wanted to warn you this jerk at the hospital crook is on the board he made it sound like someone was going to be hurt or killed because of what i did and that their blood was going to be on my hands lyle and kyle exchanged sly looks what matt asked whats with you two this time it was lewis who spoke they knowed it uz me doc were sure a thet contrary ta what lots a folks round here thank we got us some frands about good uns too we hear thangs well what are you guys going to do to protect yourselves again the brothers exchanged knowing looks we kin tak care a ourselves lyle said blieve me we can matt gathered his things and then motioned the three brothers out of the room lewis you want me to help you back to bed he asked ah kin manage fahn maself but ifn its okay with the doctor ahll stay in this here chair a bit longer im glad youre doing so well i still feel really bad about what happened i dont know what frank and the boys keep smiling and smirking about but im really worried that those bastards from the mine are going to come after you ma brothers wuznt zakly smirkin doc its jes that a loud repetitive warning buzzer cut him off immediately there were heavybooted footsteps across the wood floors downstairs and up the staircase as well scuse me doc lewis said standing unhooking his iv from its makeshift hanger and dragging his chair out to the hall we got us some compny matt hurried along behind him shutting off the flow valve to prevent blood from backing up into the iv tubing the footsteps he had heard were the three brothers moving through their house as if they had drilled for this moment many times someone had already shut the alarm off kyle raced up the stairs and slid a sixfoot by threefoot sheet of metal between where lewis had positioned himself and the railing then he opened the upstairs hall closet and again began unloading their weapons onto the hallway floor this time matt noted half a dozen shotguns a number of handguns several sophisticated rifles with highpowered sights and two semiautomatic weapons kyle left two shotguns a heavy pistol and a rifle with lewis then set a black metal box with a keypad and several switches onto lewiss lap next he began lowering weapons through the balustrade to lyle stunned at the size and scope of their arsenal matt could only stand behind lewis and watch how many lewis called down ah thank four was the reply from frank looks lak ol lonnie tuggles one of em ah never did lak him much cameras matt thought incredulous somewhere in the trees out there the legendary backwoods hick slocumb brothers had set up a warning system and surveillance cameras frank he said loudly my harleys outside do you want me to move it doc dya thank wed let anythin happn ta thet beeyewteeful machine a yourn its off safe inna barn lewis did you know these men were coming we heard they mot be jesus matt muttered some hermits you guys are hey listen be careful he cried out i dont want any of you getting hurt or me for that matter aint us ya got ta worry bout doc lewis said firmly now ya go on inta thet room behind us an keep yer nose down jes in case theys stupider than we thank matt did as he was ordered and dropped to his knees just inside the partially open door a few feet behind lewis the eldest slocumb all sixtytwo or three years of him just sat there with his makeshift chest tube still draining blood through the condom his iv bag lying on the floor next to him his right hand cradling the pistol and his left resting on the black box here they be frank said two still inna car two sneakin round back on foot jes stay cool boys lewis ordered no happy fangers no one says nothin but frank at that moment there were three sharp raps on the front door its open frank called out lemme see both yer hands as ya come in from his vantage point looking around the metal plate and through the railing matt could just see the door as it swung back the large bc ampc security guard who had escorted him from the meeting with armand stevenson took one step inside he was maybe sixthree with a shaved head that sat on his shoulders like a basketball matt couldnt see frank but imagined him across the living room his shotgun resting lazily in the crook of his arm lonnie frank said frank listen we dont want any trouble but we been sent out here to do a job you know how it is an whut jobd thet be two men trespassed onto mine property the other night we think one of them was dr rutledge from in town so an we think the other was one of you brothers now whut meks ya thank that look frank weve known each other a long time dont bullshit me and i wont bullshit you mr leblanc from the mine wants to meet with whichever one of you it was and also with that doctor he says they may have been exposed to a dangerous chemical and that theyll be in some kind of danger if they dont do the right thing lonnie you go tell mr leblanc thet ya tried yer best but no one here even knowed whut yuz talkin bout frank wherere lewis and the others aint ma word good nuff matt risked peeking through the railing again just as lonnie tuggle pulled a gun from his waistband frank one of the two men who trespassed got hisself shot there was blood on the stones inside the mine it wasnt the doctor now where is lewis lewis is rot here lewis said moving forward and resting his gun hand on the railing now its time fer ya ta go you look a bit under the weather lewis tuggle said you wouldnt by any chance have taken a bullet recently every muscle in matts body was tensed there was going to be a firefight he just knew it he started inching through the doorway toward the shotguns on the floor beside lewis if things opened up there was no way he wouldnt be fighting on the slocumbs side stay there lewis whispered harshly over his shoulder matt sank down to the floor i was told to bring you back with me lewis i cant leave without you ya can an ya will lessn ya want ta leave here feet first i have men with me one of thems got a gun on frank right now ah see im lyle said from down below he best be a darn fast shot ta get frank an void takin one a these here bullets in the haid same goes fer you kyle said stepping onto the balcony from the room at the end of the hall ten feet down from lewis lewis quickly punched in some numbers on the keypad of the black box this is a warning lonnie he said pressing the firing button the windowrattling explosion from the broad dirt courtyard outside was enough to cause tuggle to whirl in that instant frank was across the room his shotgun against the back of the huge mans head drop the gun drop it now lonnie reluctantly tuggle did as he was ordered thet bang were bout ten feet behind yer car lewis called down the nex onell be unner it an the nex buckshot from this gunll be in yer brain frank added now yev got ten seconds ta git yer boys an git outta here tell im ta set his revolver down afore he moves do it cork tuggle ordered tuggle motioned to the man behind frank and in a moment he came into matts view cowed and weaponless the two of them backed out of the front door and called to the other pair youre going to regret this frank tuggle said you aint the only one who can blow things up you gotta git tus ferce lonnie an you aint done so good at thet do us all a favor an don tra it we don git much pleasure outta killin helpless critters tell ol leclair tweren none a us out at the mine the doctor neither ifn anythin happns ta him yer the one were gonna blame got thet ah said got thet yeah yeah i got it matt listened to the car depart and then straightened up and crossed over to lewis i cant believe you have this place mined he said ah had me an adventrous spell back in the lat sixties anjoined the army lewis replied i remember you telling me about that well what ah may not a tole ya was ah signed up mostly cause ah wanted ta learn how ta blow thangs up iz in demolitions in nam come in handy from time to time blowin up stumps an such plus nobody gits near to this here place lessn we want em to or away from it either it seems you guys never cease to amaze me gimme a hand back ta bed doc lewis said picking up his intravenous bag and chest tube allis excitement has me a mot tuckered any benefit matt had accrued from his nap at nikkis bedside was gone his eyes burning with fatigue he gazed up wistfully at the turnoff to his house as he pointed the harley back toward the hospital he would make rounds and then sign out to whoever was taking over coverage after that bed it was still possible the bc ampc thugs might come after him but besides being careful there wasnt anything he could do about it except run which he wasnt going to do the slocumbs had made their point and made it well come after us again only if trying to get us is worth dying for as for the toxic dump there was no way to predict what armand stevenson and the other powers at the mine were going to do the only thing that was certain at the moment was that because of an anonymous note from a barely educated local who didnt want acknowledgment or even a reward his long struggle against bc ampc had been vindicated the doctors parking lot was nearly filled just fifteen years old the hospital now boasted specialists in every area of internal medicine and most of the surgical specialties as well it pained him to give bc ampc kudos for anything but in fact the company was largely responsible for the continued growth of the place he found a space close to the ambulance bay and locked the harley then he crossed the er and headed up the stairs to medsurg not too surprisingly tarvis lyons was dozing in his seat by the door to nikkis room his chin resting on his chest something matts footsteps on the tile or perhaps a breeze down the hallway roused the policeman just before matt reached him hey ledge wazzapnin he said everything okay yep your lady got off just like clockwork got off where matt asked feeling a sudden chill for the mri you ordered lyons said clearly bewildered matt raced to the doorway nikkis bed was empty and had been made awaiting a return matt doubted would be happening tarvis he said his pulse hammering i didnt order an mri chapter it was right there in the physician s orders section of nikkis chart right below the order matt had written for neuro checks mri at hastings hospital ptnt to go by ambulance to dr rutledge to telephone order someone had called the ward secretary using matts name and had ordered that nikki be transported by ambulance for an mri at hastings hospital quickly matt called the radiologist there he was not at all surprised to learn that at his request nikki had been inserted into their mri schedule as an emergency her appointment was for thirty minutes ago but as of yet she hadnt shown up tarvis lyons looking nonplussed and bereft was waiting by the doorway to nikkis room i screwed up didnt i he said just tell me what happened you and chief grimes both said not to let no one into the room unless i knew who they were well if i dont know the stith brothers i dont know anyone the stith brothers marty and gerald they drive for gold cross ambulance martys parttime with the fire department too theyre regulars on saturdays at snookys just like me so first the nurse came and told me you had ordered an mri and the ambulance was coming then a little while later the stiths showed up and took her i had no idea i wasnt supposed to let her go matt rubbed at his eyes who in the hell could have engineered this it had to be someone who knew the hospital and how things were done a doctor a nurse he snatched up the phone and called the operator hi its dr rutledge could you please get me gold cross ambulance right away doctor gold cross mary speaking mary its dr matt rutledge at the hospital would you please radio the ambulance thats taking nikki solari from montgomery county to hastings hospital what do you want me to tell them tell them to turn around and get back here as soon as possible dont take the patient to hastings matt tapped his foot and fidgeted with the light cord but he knew what was coming dr rutledge the dispatcher said this is very strange i cant seem to raise them maybe theyre in the hospital already they each have portable units that kick in as soon as they leave the ambulance ill check on the trouble do you want me to keep trying the radio yeah sure matt said keep trying at that instant tarvis lyonss radio crackled to life lyons tarvis its chief grimes shit lyons whispered yes chief i told you not to let that woman out of your sight i dont remember you sayin tarvis give me that matt snapped snatching the radio away chief its matt rutledge someone using my name called in an order to have nikki taken to hastings for an mri she never arrived and the gold cross people cant raise the ambulance on the radio thats because the drivers have been ducttaped to a tree in the woods off highway they just got brought in here nikki solaris not with them damn im coming right over listen dont bother ill be over to matt handed the radio back to lyons tarvis he said if the chief calls back tell him i didnt hear what he said and im on my way over the police station standard redbrick issue with an attached garage and jail in back was situated as far on the east end of town as the hospital was on the west matt rode the harley over searching his mind for a hint as to who could have engineered nikkis abduction and why whoever it was had to have been watching him to know he had left the hospital if only nikki had shared a theory any theory as to why the two men were waiting for her in the first place the patrolman on the station desk phoned grimes and then with a shake of his head motioned matt toward a bank of folding chairs through the open blinds on the interior picture window in grimess spacious office matt could see the chief talking to the two ambulance drivers the stith brothers both freckled and redhaired seemed to be talking at once matt had never spoken more than a few words to either of them but that contact was enough for him to know that neither man was going to win the nobel prize for rocket science grimess righthand man a hardnosed sergeant named steve valenti faced the drivers from a seat beside the desk his eyes narrowed as if probing their account for inconsistencies as matt approached the office door grimes caught his eye and held up a hand for him to wait a moment then after a few words with valenti he motioned him in even before grimes spoke it was clear from his expression that he held matt somehow responsible for what had happened rutledge i warned you to be careful with that woman i didnt do anything except go on a house call matt replied flatly i also told you to stay at the hospital well i dont handle being told what to do thats why i went to med school whats with you anyway did solari say something kind to you at the funeral is that whats going on dont push me rutledge dont go ordering me around grimes hey hi guys hi dr rutledge the stiths said in unison were sorry about this im sure there was nothing you could have done about it no there wasnt we got a flat on one of the bastards drove up and gerald grimes snapped weve already covered all this its dr rutledges turn to answer some questions listen why dont you two wait outside ill call you back when i need you again heads down the brothers shuffled from the office valenti closed the door behind them and took his seat again this time the probing eyesnarrowed stare was fixed on matt so grimes began you say you never ordered any mri on nikki solari but the ambulance people say they saw the order it was a telephone order called in by someone other than me not you but using your name thats right matt felt the warmth building in his face historically the first sign that some sort of eruption was imminent grimess snide supercilious tone was pushing a number of hardtoreach buttons so where were you while all this was going on i was making a house call to who i dont talk about my patients to anyone its unethical and you of course are mr ethics so while you were caring for a victim of a brutal attempted murder you decided it was the perfect time to make a house call back off grimes matt warned the red warmth creeping up a few degrees i had been with her for more than twelve hours when i left the hospital she was reasonably stable and i had other people to attend to besides if you had sent someone else out other than that lump tarvis lyons they might have thought to have me paged to check on what was going on since i didnt say anything about ordering an mri i dont know what in the hell is going on rutledge but i cant shake the sense that youre right in the middle of it matt pointedly ignored the remark what happened anyway he asked sounds like the same two men who went after her before if at first valenti interjected sounding like ed mcmahon one of them probably shot out a tire on the ambulance then both of them pulled silenced revolvers on the drivers the whole thing took two minutes at the most dark sedan is all we can get out of the stiths you know who the men are do you jesus rutledge how could you go and let this happen to that woman grimes instead of trying your best to connect me to what happened why dont you have every man on your socalled force out there looking for her you tend to your friggin business rutledge and ill tend i know i know you did that one before just dont go on any more house calls until we have this business cleared up got that okay okay i got it good now scram tell lyons to get on over here grimes turned his back on matt steve lets get an apb out on dr nikki solari valenti picked up a clipboard out grimes said matt slowly gathered up his denim jacket and keys and headed for the door white female thirtysix years old grimes dictated to valenti thirtyfour matt said over his shoulder out make that thirtyfour mediumlength dark hair fiveseven slender build may be wearing surgical scrubs green dammit rutledge okay green surgical scrubs now get out of here what a dick grimes muttered loud enough to be easily heard from where matt was matt left the office the door swung nearly closed but remained slightly ajar he turned to finish the job then realized that neither policeman had noticed instead he lingered off to one side where it was easy for him to overhear the ongoing conversation so valenti asked is the jerk right did she come on to you none of your business grimes replied with a sly smile rollins was at the funeral service said the girl was looking pretty interested in you so maybe she was i got enough goin on around here believe me i do come on now lets get this over with marks or scars valenti asked how should i know grimes replied wait i do know one get this shes got this weird tattoo on the top of her foot some sort of lizard can you believe that top of her foot huh women dont go around showin me the top of their feet they wouldnt show you their face either if they didnt have to what kind of lizard an orange one how in the hell am i supposed to know what kind matt who had turned toward the exit stopped still nikki had been wearing sneakers when he intubated her at crystal lake how did grimes know about the tattoo he had been there at the er but as far as matt could remember nikki was covered up by the time he arrived and stayed that way could someone on the staff have mentioned it to him possible but doubtful he had no trouble believing that grimes had come on to nikki in some way but he hadnt even considered that she might have flirted with him immediately he discarded the notion the reason grimes knew about the gila monster wasnt because nikki had shown him bewildered matt headed out to his bike the only logical explanation he could come up with was that nikki was wearing some sort of strapped shoe at the memorial service as he approached the hospital still another explanation occurred to him the possibility that grimes was with nikki after she had been abducted tarvis lyons looking balefully about was still at his post by the doorway to nikkis empty room any word he asked nope shes gone shit is the chief pissed at me he wants to see you over at the station shit ledge you gotta tell grimes i didnt do anything wrong without responding matt went to the small closet in the room nikkis clothes were hanging up to dry rather than being stuffed in the usual plastic bag her sneakers were there too new balance a fairly new pair still damp she must have been wearing hospital slippers when the stith brothers wheeled her away they could have easily fallen off or been removed during or after her abduction if grimes was involved in the kidnapping that would certainly explain his choosing tarvis to guard the room nikki had jeans sneakers and a tshirt on when she went into the lake but it was unlikely they were the clothes she wore to the service her car had probably been towed or driven to the station more than likely her clothing and possessions had been catalogued and examined they had to be in the evidence room if her shoes were closed on top he could rule out the possibility that grimes had seen the tattoo beneath any straps he returned to the policeman tarvis he said you want me to tell grimes this wasnt your fault i need you to ledge ive had some trouble lately and in that case i need a favor from you lyons brightened name it ledge when she was loony from her concussion dr solari started babbling on about what she was really doing down here it seems she runs a business up north where lady doctors provide you know services to highroller men who have big bucks to spend services sex tarvis she runs a prostitution ring where the women are all doctors holy and she has a book a black book with the names of all her clients and all the women doctors in boston new york and around here who work for her she really is a babe lyons said wistfully his imagination clearly running as far amuck as it was capable of thats what they were after her for that book exactly grimes didnt mention it so i dont think he has it yet if we can find it youll be a hero he bent over and spoke mantoman plus youll know which lady doctors in these parts give the best exams he punctuated the remark with a nudge what do you want me to do can you get me into the evidence room i have a card we all do i just have to swipe it well then what are we waiting for lyons had driven his battered greasestained wrangler to the hospital matt followed him back toward the station but cut off a block from the building parked the harley and met him by the basement door in back so how many lady doctors are in this book lyons asked dont know dozens ill bet when it comes to admitting women students the med schools often insist on brains and looks ooee lyons said swiping the electronic lock and opening the solid oak door theres an electronic record of whoever swipes in so i gotta sign the ledger there were ten large plastic baskets but only two of them held evidence both were labeled solari the book is small matt said rummaging through the first basket it may be able to fit in the heel of a shoe not these shoes lyons was holding up a pair of black flats plain closed top no straps so much for an accidental sighting of the tattoo so these are the little mice who set off the evidence room warning light grimes and steve valenti stood shoulder to shoulder in the doorway matt felt his heart freeze tarvis you jerk oh hi matt said too brightly i asked tarvis here to show me nikkis things we thought we might find something that would suggest who might have done this or why i guess he forgot there was a warning light and did you grimes asked did i what did you find any undiscovered clues matts pulse now had gone from standstill to jackhammer never an adept liar he was having great difficulty maintaining eye contact with the policeman it was clear from the mans tone that he didnt believe a word of what matt was saying off to one side valenti appraised the situation his face an unfathomable mask oh no matt stammered no actually we didnt find anything at least i didnt how about you tarvis lyons looked as if he had been shot with a blowgun nothing chief he managed finally i um hope you dont mind my bringing the doctor down here why would i ever mind that tarvis i always thought it was stupid for us to take all these precautions just to lock up a bunch of evidence matt could feel the wheels spinning in grimess head searching for an explanation any explanation as to what he and lyons were doing in the evidence room finally he exchanged glances with valenti who merely shook his head okay rutledge grimes said i dont know what in the hell youre doing here but i dont think im going to find out from you mark me well though this is the last time im kicking you out of my station house next time youll be begging us to let you go go easy on tarvis matt said i asked him to let me in here so i could look at dr solaris things ramrod straight chin up he strode past grimes and valenti and down the corridor to the stairs half expecting to hear a shot and feel a bullet smack into his spine what he heard instead was grimes saying tarvis get the fuck upstairs to my office and lyons replying i can explain everything chief chapter matt spent the hours following his clash with bill grimes consumed by dread for the life of nikki solari he was bone weary from a dearth of any healthy sleep but over his years of training and medical practice he had developed internal techniques for coping with that sort of exhaustion what he was much less adept at dealing with than the lack of sleep was the lack of answers he felt like a marionette dancing to the commands of some deranged puppeteer but who right now the only viable candidate was grimes but why him and how was he able to pull together the elements of nikkis abduction from the hospital so quickly and smoothly this is dr rutledge calling ive scheduled dr solari for an emergency mri and arranged for immediate ambulance transport smooth matt had two patients in the hospital one of them an elderly diabetic recovering from an arterial bypass to her leg was in the room across the hall from nikkis he was on the way in to see her when he stopped and using the phone at nikkis bedside called information and got the number for kit and samuel wilson kit answered on the first ring first of all matt said after establishing that she knew who he was i want to tell you how sorry i am about your daughter thank you the service yestiddy made everyone that knew kathy feel jes a little better im glad mrs wilson im calling about nikki solari nikki what about her i guess you havent heard i hate to be the bearer of bad news with all you have been going through please what about nikki shortly after she left the church yesterday two men ambushed her on wells road she got away from them but nearly drowned in crystal lake in the process oh my god wheres she now she all right im afraid we dont know where she is right now mrs wilson someone not me called in an order in my name sending her to hastings hospital for an mri then they kidnapped her from the ambulance on the way oh my god how awful whyd anyone do such a thing thats what im trying to find out can you remember anything from yesterday that might help us figure out what happened anyone she spoke to not that i kin recall she read at the service then played music most a the afternoon she never left the churchyard cept ta walk a spell with sam an me she did speak with chief grimes for a time on the bench under the big willa cross the churchyard oh dear this is jes terrible news nikki and our daughter were very close kathy was teachin her ta play the fiddle matt had heard what he needed to mrs wilson he said now anxious to go please call me if you or your husband think of anything anything at all that might help us figure this out i promise to keep you posted i begged her ta stay with us kit wilson said matt wandered out to his bike lost in thought over the significance of what he had just learned kit wilsons information certainly suggested that although they might have spoken at some length nikki and grimes were never in a place where she would have taken off her shoes assuming that and knowing her feet remained covered when grimes came to the er what was left he must have seen the distinctive tattoo after she was abducted from the ambulance no other conclusion fit the facts also supporting that theory was something kit wilson did not say specifically that she already knew about nikki the news took her completely by surprise twentyfour hours had passed since the woman was nearly killed and grimes hadnt bothered questioning the wilsons true he had been at the service and could have made his own observations there but he should certainly have wanted to know if nikki had said anything to kit or her husband or if they knew of any reason why someone might have wanted to harm her the man was smarmy but he was hardly dumb the only explanation matt could think of for him not bothering to call the wilsons was that he already knew what had happened at an unobtrusive pace matt cruised through the lengthening shadows along oak street parallel to main heading across town toward the police station bill grimess love of flashy cars was commonly known as was his latest trophy a fireenginered dodge viper earlier in the afternoon matt had noticed it parked in the staff lot behind the station from the corner of oak and waverly matt could see that it was still there he backed up his bike until he could just see the car then rested it on its stand and took out his tool kit just for appearances twice over the next hour while he was puttering around the engine patients of his stopped to offer him a hand two cruisers left the lot and later a minivan dusk settled in the strain of staying fixed on the viper only added to matts burgeoning fatigue finally just as he was considering packing it in for the night grimes came striding through the gloom to his car matt stowed the tool kit mounted the harley and waited until the door of the viper had closed before punching the electric starter the powerful engine rumbled to life his pulse racing he felt instantly energized and alert grimes was single and could have been headed home or on a date or out for dinner but without any better options matt was determined to play this one out instead of turning left toward main the viper lights on swung right directly toward the corner where matt was waiting he had only time to pull on his helmet and lower his face before the car sped past no more than thirty feet away his harley was as wellknown around town as the viper and grimes was certainly a keen enough policeman to have noticed him clearly he was distracted matts tension increased a notch grimes lived south of town on the banks of the belinda river now in addition to being preoccupied he was driving north into the hills this wasnt a purposeless evening jaunt matt stayed as far back as he dared the waning evening initially provided enough light for him to see but with his headlight off he had serious doubts any oncoming drivers could see him fortunately for nearly ten minutes there were none the roughly paved road angled steeply upward it was one matt had ridden when he was much younger but rarely since then to the best of his recollection it turned into gravel then dirt and eventually petered out in the forest its final incarnation was as a narrow heavily rooted trail favored by dirt bikers shadows from the dense woods brought the night on prematurely the lights of the viper were still fairly easy to spot in the distance but the soft shoulders were invisible and posed a constant threat matt didnt dare flick on his lights or take his eyes off his quarry from time to time on one side or the other a rusted mailbox or a rutted dual path marked the entrance to a dwelling that could have been fifty feet into the forest or five miles it was into one of those driveways that grimes suddenly turned had matt been looking down at the road he would have missed the move completely but as it was there was a brief jounce of the taillights just before they began moving at right angles to the road by the time matt reached the drive where he thought grimes had turned the lights were gone helmet off he rolled cautiously through the ebony forest though he was keeping the rpms down his engine noise still reverberated like heavy equipment had grimes stopped had he set up an ambush somewhere up ahead matt cut the engine and listened nothing for a time he tried pushing the heavy bike ahead finally realizing he really had no choice he hit the starter and rumbled forward his legs stretched out off the pegs for balance the kawasaki would have been a little quieter and easier to maneuver at slow speed but he had needed the storage capacity of the hog for all the drugs and equipment he had brought out to the slocumbs for five minutes he rolled on every fiber tensed against a voice an attack or a gunshot then flickering through the trees up ahead he saw light he turned the harley around and with some difficulty backed it into the woods far enough so it seemed undetectable from the road then he cut off some pine boughs with his swiss army knife and laid them across the chrome of the handlebars gas cap wheels and engine cautiously he advanced up the road the viper was parked alongside a land rover in front of a dilapidated cabin the cabin roughhewn with a small porch and chimney occupied the center of a clearing that was surprisingly large maybe four or five times the footprint of the structure itself two windows both illuminated faced the driveway and there were more on the side staying within the tree line matt made his way around to the side of the cabin a shredded screen hung off one of the two windows and several panes of the other appeared to be missing he held his breath and tried unsuccessfully to make out the voices from inside then on his hands and knees he ventured out from his cover and across forty feet of dirt and pine needles flattening his back against the wall of cabin painstakingly he rolled over onto his knees again and pushed himself up so that he could just peer inside initially he could see nothing other than the denimshirted back of a massive man from beyond the man he could hear bill grimess distinctive pseudotwang i know what youre telling me dear doctor he was saying but i dont know if youre telling me the truth ive told you all i know nikki said her voice weary and hoarse if you dont believe me thats your problem correction my friend thats your problem the huge man moved aside and matt dropped beneath the window when he inched up again he was looking into a grungy bedroom no more than ten feet square the ceiling was unfinished pine and the walls unadorned the gargantuan was still obstructing the view of the doorway where the chief was standing but now matt could see nikki she was unbound dressed in green hospital scrubs lying supine eyes closed on the bare mattress of a metal frame bed two pillows without covers were bunched under her head and a grimy sheet was thrown over her legs she looked gray and uncomfortable and absolutely spent but he could see no evidence she had been beaten i want to go over this one more time grimes was saying starting with the funeral who did you talk to there besides me well matt heard a scraping to his right moments before a man appeared he was tall and wiry wearing a cowboy hat and boots a pistol was jammed beneath his broad belt at the small of his back matt dropped to his belly and forced himself against the cement foundation of the house he was still in plain sight though no more than twenty feet away the man tapped out a cigarette and lit it with a kitchen match he struck on his zipper the smoke instantly wafted to where matt lay in the shadow of the house desperately his mind sorted through possible responses should he be spotted none of them made any sense the smoker took a few paces away from the house tilted his head back and blew a cloud up toward the dark sky above the clearing matt steeled himself the angle between them had changed now as soon as the man turned back toward the cabin door it would be over matt prepared to bolt into the trees as soon as he was spotted at that moment from the woods beyond the cowboy and to his right there was the crunching of brush and rustling of branches seconds later a small whitetailed doe burst through the undergrowth and loped across the clearing not fifteen feet away the man took several steps in pursuit at the same time fumbling for his gun larry the cowboy hollered larry get out here quick matt could hear the huge man thump onto the porch what what biggest fuckin deer yew ever saw jes ran by close enough to lick the snot offa my nose if my gun hadnt got stuck in my belt wed be eatin venison right now verne you are just a total jerk larry said with essentially no mountain accent get on in here the chief wants you to drive him to town an back you an me are gonna stay here tonight with the bitch we need some coffee an toilet paper an shit to eat the chief has some stuff he wants to get from the station too stuff thatll make her sing like a canary now get in here matt held his breath until the two had disappeared into the cabin then scrambled back to the safety of the forest grimes and vernethecowboy would be taking a ride to town and back the trip would be twenty minutes each way maybe twentyfive allowing for time in the store during those forty or so minutes he had to find a way to overpower a man the size of a bus and get a barely conscious woman onto her feet secured on the harley and away to safety he regretted now that he had rejected the notion of stashing one of the slocumbs many pistols in his saddlebag but in truth he had never felt comfortable around guns of any kind and he feared that this ineptness coupled with his unpredictable temper was a recipe for disaster he tried playing out a scenario wherein he somehow drew larry outside then knocked him out with a piece of wood or a wrench from his tool kit the chances of actually disabling the beast with anything less potent than a hammer seemed slim and there wasnt one in his tool kit what then grimes and verne were crossing the porch headed toward the land rover when matt began considering the saddlebags on his bike the two large side bags and the carryall mounted behind the passenger seat were loaded with among other things drugs his wellstocked housecall and emergency pharmacy hastily augmented by a variety of medications purloined for possible use on lewis slocumb matt suspected that he wasnt beyond killing a person to save his own life or that of someone close to him but he also knew it wouldnt happen easily and the internal consequences would be severe besides the only drug he could count on to kill larry was a muscle paralyzer like curare or anectine and he wasnt at all sure he had packed any he needed something with a rapid onset that could be given intramuscularly and would disable larry without killing him then he had to find a way to get it into the brute without being torn apart verne started up the rover and flicked on the headlights as soon as they were headed down the drive matt switched his timex to timer mode and began the countdown forty minutes ticking off the features of the drug he needed he raced back to the bike located his penlight and rummaged furiously through the medications in the carryall discarding one after another into the woods thirtyeight minutes calm down he shrieked to himself just cool it he stared down at the vial he had actually been about to throw away and caught his breath ketamine mgc ketamine a first cousin of pcp and nitrous oxide was used preoperatively to induce a state called dissociative anesthesia dreamy helplessness matt had tossed it in with the other meds just in case lewis required any kind of minor surgical procedure from what he remembered given intramuscularly the drug had a very rapid onset the usual dose was loomg but of course larry was no usual specimen the vial held loccs a total of mg was a thousand enough to bring down such a beast or was it enough to do even more than that there was only one way to find out matt fished out a locc syringe twisted a largebore inchandahalflong needle onto the end and drew up every drop in the vial if there was any chance for the drug to work it would have to be injected into muscle not into fat where the circulation was minimal and absorption would be ineffectively slow larry was like a planet that was covered percent with fat matt selected the occipital muscle at the base of the skull and mentally played through how he was going to get the needle in and the plunger depressed without getting himself killed he checked the time again thirtyfour minutes before verne and grimes would be back the issue now was how to get larry outside without having him on red alert with a gun in his hand fire verne had carelessly tossed his butt aside when the deer dashed past him larrys first thought upon smelling smoke now would be to blame the man he had just called a jerk at least that was what matt was counting on he took a book of matches from the carryall then reached deeper down and removed one of the two flares he carried and a box of gauze pads to use for kindling next he made his way back to the woods opposite the cabin cautiously with agonizing slowness he hauled several armfuls of brush across to the corner of the porch pausing for a few seconds he chanced looking through the window larry a bolstered revolver tucked under his massive left arm had settled onto a slatbacked chair at the foot of the bed nikki lay on her back sleeping deeply her right hand twitching rhythmically every few seconds another time check showed nineteen minutes matt chose the viper for cover with any luck larrys back would be to him when he made his move if not matt had reason to believe hed be dead before he had injected even a drop of the ketamine he knelt by the brush and jammed the paperwrapped gauze pads into place next he lit the paper in several places and made certain it was blazing just in case he inserted the flare unlit setting it off at this point might be too much noise keeping low the syringe tucked in his right hand matt raced around to the far side of the viper flattened out and watched underneath the car as the brush pile began ever so slowly to burn come on baby burn for crying out loud burn one twig caught then another he should have chanced the noise of packing the brush down a little or maybe even set the flare off the twigs were taking way too long to catch fourteen minutes he hoped the odor and sound of the fire would be enough to get larry outside failing that plan b was simply to make some sort of nonspecific noise and hope for the best it was a plan with little chance of success and a potentially lethal downside but time was running out he was preparing to make some sound when he smelled smoke risking a peek over the hood of the viper he saw that the cardboard box from the gauze pads had caught and branches all around it were going up there was crackling from the pile now too okay tubby wake up and smell the bonfire what the larry clomped across the porch down the single step to the fire and began kicking at it with the toe of his shoe fucking verne matt heard him say holding the syringe like a dagger with his thumb on the plunger matt got some purchase for his back leg against a root and sprang ahead at that instant the flare ignited with a burst of light and heat that sent larry stumbling backward several steps holding one arm up to shield his eyes he was two or three inches taller but matt had his move planned he leapt from several feet away slamming against larrys back and hooking his left arm around his throat simultaneously he jammed the needle to the hilt at the base of the giants skull and an instant after that pressed down the plunger larry who had staggered forward only a step from the force of matts assault bellowed and swung around with the power of a steam shovel before the ketamine load could be fully delivered matt and the syringe were sent flying nostrils flared eyes wide with surprise and fury larry charged matt rolled over once then again but he wasnt quick enough to avoid being kicked in the belly the hulk was winding up again when matt made an awkward half somersault and scrambled to his feet larry lunged for him but missed short he was fumbling for his gun when matt took off zigzagging down the drive in an effort to make himself less of a target there was a shot then another but they sounded strangely far away matt kept pounding ahead into the protection of the darkness but he was reluctant to get too far from the cabin he checked over his shoulder larry had broken off his pursuit and was standing at least fifty yards back hollering something matt couldnt make out but probably could have guessed the stopwatch was at thirtyfive minutes now only five minutes or so remained before grimes was expected back the harley was just a few yards away if larry decided to come after him again he might not get the bike uncovered and started before he was in range still it seemed worth a try he had blown things bigtime there was little chance now to get past goliath to nikki the only option that made any sense was to race into town and try to get help but by the time he returned if he returned she would certainly be gone and grimes larry and cowboy verne would have bullets marked for him what a screwup he threw aside enough branches to expose the ignition then jumped aboard and burst through the brush onto the driveway prepared to dodge gunfire instead he saw larry standing motionless right where he had been a hotair balloon silhouetted against the light from the cabin matt stopped the bike and watched as in slow motion the behemoth crossstepped gracelessly from one side to the other then flapped his arms in the air once and collapsed wary of a trap but feeling there was room to speed past the man and around the cabin matt rolled up to where he lay the whale was beached his head lolling impotently from side to side the snubnosed revolver lay a few feet away his eyes fixed on larry matt bent over picked it up and dropped it into the carryall sweet dreams he said knowing that fearsome nightmares often accompanied the awakening from ketamine sleep sweet dreams he slipped the clutch and spewed a rooster tail of dirt as he sped to the cabin the brush was still burning in fact a corner of the structure was smoldering and beginning to flame his stopwatch was passing fortyfour minutes as he raced inside hey you time to wake up he said taking nikkis hand in his and gently cradling her head nikki blinked dreamily and actually smiled up at him before suddenly remembering where she was matt its grimes he i know listen weve got to get out of here grimesll be back any moment can you walk okay im a little wobbly and my head is still pounding but i think i can walk hurry then ill help my bike is outside bike motorcycle please she let him pull her upright then used his arm for balance sit up in front of me until im sure you can hold on he said just keep your feet right here away from the engine or youll be burned hold on to my arms or the handlebars ready ready how did you ill explain everything after were out of here headlight off matt accelerated he slowed briefly as they passed larry is he dead nikki asked i dont think so hes taking a voyage on the good ship ketamine matt its them ahead the dirt drive swung sharply to their right through the trees they could see headlights bobbing toward them matt waited until the approaching high beams were just about to reach them then he threw on his own high beam and accelerated before a startled verne could react the motorcycle had sped past matt caught enough of a glimpse of bill grimes in the passenger seat to see his recognition through the rearview of the bike he saw the land rover make a rapid twopart uturn hold on tight nikki he said this isnt going to be easy chapter matt sped down the dirt drive with some confidence the land rover was far better on the ruts than his street bike but at the end of the drive he could make a right turn and head to the wooded trail at the end of the road the harley certainly wasnt equipped for offroad riding but from what he remembered the trail was too rugged and narrow for a car of any kind even the one pursuing them duck down a little bit and the windshield will keep things out of your eyes he cried out the small windscreen was sloped to deflect air and bugs up and over the head of the driver and anyone on the passenger seat their arrangement though with nikki in front placed her face directly in the jet stream she hunched over as he suggested and continued to be a perfect passenger flowing with the turns of the bike rather than trying to help matt make them happen and keeping her exposed feet and ankles away from the scalding exhaust system as they neared the end of the drive matt risked a peek over his shoulder verne and grimes were still a ways back but it appeared as if they had made up some ground hang on tight he yelled as the end of the long driveway suddenly appeared he downshifted and just managed to lean through the ninetydegree right turn without sending the bike skidding out from under them when he was a teen he had done some dirtbike racing and even a little motocross but the kids he topped in geometry and english at school consistently trounced him on the track now what skills he did have were about to be sorely put to the test they were on a sixhundredpound touring machine headed toward the woods he added just a bit of throttle and engine screaming they shot forward moments later he saw the high beams of the land rover dance against the trees as it too turned onto the road after half a mile or so the pavement turned to gravel then to uneven rocky dirt the shocks on the harley were more sluggish than those of an offroad machine and matt had to slow a bit to keep the two of them from being bucked off you okay he hollered nikki nodded and ducked her head even farther down beneath the windscreen the night was too cool and breezy for her to be comfortable in a set of scrubs her hands clutched his forearms with some strength but he doubted she would be able to hang on tightly enough to remain aboard the passenger seat you bastard grimes matt was thinking holding her in place if its the last thing i do youre going to pay for this he scanned ahead looking for the expected trail they had already gone farther than he remembered instead of narrowing though the roadway actually seemed to widen and become more smoothly graded just then his high beam reflected brightly off the white of a billboardsized sign up ahead featuring artwork depicting happy boaters fishermen swimmers tennis players golfers and barbecuers coming soon shady lake manor estates a gated planned community washaw west virginia the place to be in the eastern mountains building lots going fast reserve yours now planned community so much for the narrow dirtbike trails they had just cruised through the forest that matt had anticipated would separate them from grimes and his henchman in fact they were out of belinda entirely and into the next town trouble the lots of shady lake manor estates might have been going fast but the landscaping and construction still had a long way to go the land had been clearcut but at the moment the place to be in the eastern mountains consisted of a maze of interconnected dirt streets demarcating large dirt lots there was no lighting and very little in the way of heavy equipment and matt wondered if the project might have gone under he hoped so to his way of thinking such communities gouged the landscape as much as any strip mine but while there was little in the way of construction paraphernalia throughout shady lake manor what there was everywhere were signs street signs directional arrow signs futurehomeof signs lotnumber signs a sign by a broad shallow foundation hole that read clubhouse another nearby that boasted central pool well mr and mrs jones that number stuck in the mud over there may not look like much at the moment but there was no question verne was gaining on them now less than fifty yards separated them there was virtually no terrain over which the land rover didnt have a heavy advantage in fact the situation at the moment was so onesided that matt actually had a vivid image of grimes laughing at them matt scanned ahead for some way to put more distance between them the land rover was way too close to consider trying to search out a place to hide the only hope he could see was to work toward the far side of shady lake manor by making sharp unpredictable turns and hope that they could find the opening to a narrow track and escape into the woods he tried cutting across some lots and hit a steep slope of firm packed dirt that sent the harley airborne the landing was anything but smooth nikki cried out as her head snapped forward against the windshield behind them verne took the same jump with ease back on one of the streets matt sped onto rolling sparsely treed land that was probably a golf course in the making they were bouncing viciously now matt did his best to avoid the major pits and rises but they were moving too fast for him to do much in the way of prevention then up ahead his headlight glinted off a vast uniform darkness before he could completely analyze the situation they were airborne again sailing over the edge of what was one day to be shady lake sit up straight and hang on he screamed just as nikki did so the bike landed with surprising gentleness on the side of a steep embankment maybe twentyfive feet high at the bottom of the slope as far as matt could see was water what there was of the lake could have been six inches deep or six feet there was no way to tell they were out of control speeding and skidding downward toward the smooth blackness but matt had been riding motorcycles of one kind or another for most of his life by staying upright using his outstretched feet and delicately playing the front and rear brakes he was able to skid the harley into a righthand turn and onto a stony rim just a foot or so from the water nicely done he thought he cut the lights and braked to a stop nikki sighed loudly straightened up and sank back against him he quickly stripped his jacket off and helped her get it on i knew id hate this she groaned what are you talking about this is my first time on a motorcycle now i know why i said no thanks so many times but this isnt exactly rutledge high up and behind them verne had pulled to a stop at the rim the twin beams of the land rover knifed out over the huge crater against the bright night sky matt could make out grimess silhouette standing hands on hips on the edge of the embankment what matt yelled up using the light from the rover to scan the nearly empty lake the sides as far as he could see were too steep to ride back up but he sensed he was viewing only a small portion of the excavation the lake bed itself was lined with threeor fourinch stones extending up a foot or so beyond where they were standing if the water wasnt too deep and if the stones covered the entire bottom it was possible they could ride across big ifs and ride across to what theres no way out of there except on foot matt come up and lets talk sounds good to me youve always been an upstanding trustworthy guy just turn off those lights and well be right up rutledge my man has a rifle and hes a damn good shot come out of there now and i can keep you from getting killed just how do you plan on doing that he asked buying a little time nikki he whispered howre you holding up my kidneys are still bouncing and my heart hasnt slowed down from that little ride down the cliff but at least im not thinking about my headache anymore where are we matt was pleased to hear her humor and if anything her voice sounded stronger were in disneyland a year or two before mickey arrives he replied listen if you can handle it im going to try and motor around the lake just in case the slope gets any less someplace and we can drive out can you hang on would it be easier if i was on the back not if you fall off i can do it keep your feet on those rests at all times if you hit the exhaust with your bare tootsies youre going to need smaller shoes rutledge this is your last chance okay were coming were coming matt called out buying time nikki you all set is there something i should be holding on to those railings beside your seat or else me she slipped her arms around his waist squeezed tightly and pressed her cheek against his back go she said matt squinted through the darkness to gauge how far ahead he could see in order to skirt the waters edge without turning on his headlight then he picked up a stone and threw it across the water as far as he could along with a splash he heard the distinct click of rock hitting rock that far out at least the water was very shallow rutledge matt shifted into first and gunned the harley ahead if there was a rifle crack from overhead he didnt hear it ten twenty thirty mph the magnificent bike surged forward over the stones over his shoulder he could see that the rover had backed up and was now paralleling them overhead a short distance back the darkness made speed difficult and matt finally gave in and switched on his light for a short while the lake while not quite as vast as he had thought was an oval maybe half a mile long and a quarter mile across if in fact it had actually been a shady lake there might have been some trees overhead to slow up or even detour verne and grimes but as things stood they were having no trouble racing along twenty or thirty feet above them the engine noise from the harley reverberated off the water and the steep walls making it impossible to tell if they were being fired on or not it was then that matt spotted the opening up ahead it was a massive corrugated steel tunnel built through the embankment on their right the opening was about six feet across and the floor was three feet or so above the stony track where they were riding from the way it was positioned it had to have been constructed to empty the lake he judged that there was enough of a slope up to the floor so that they could make it over the edge and inside provided they came at it headon through the water if the depth at the center of the lake was greater than a foot though they probably wouldnt make it across on the harley matt thought about looping out into the lake and then back toward the tunnel but that would still leave grimes and verne directly above them riding across from the other side made more sense provided of course they made it he switched on the high beam of the harley checked the odometer as they passed the tunnel and accelerated again the shifting stones made it challenging to keep the bike upright thirty felt barely controllable but he pushed the bike to thirtyfive overhead the land rover kept pace nikki continued to be the perfect passenger holding on tightly yet staying relaxed enough not to affect matts delicate balancing act the woman was tough to their right the embankment continued steep and high the slim hope that there would be a gentler slope at the end of the lake vanished if anything the grade was even sharper as they passed the hairpin end and sped down the other side matt watched the odometer until he was at the point directly across the lake from the tunnel then he cut off his headlight and made a sharp lefthand turn into the water if nikki was startled at the move she hid it well matt plowed ahead as fast as he dared the water probably from recent heavy rains was six or so inches deep and the stony bottom was identical to the track on which they had been riding if the depth increased much passage would probably be impossible if they stalled and couldnt get restarted matt had decided to leave the bike where it was and try to make it to the tunnel on foot come on baby he urged you can do this through his rearview he could see the lights of the rover shining directly out over the lake confusion at last he thought smiling come on bike they were at least at the center of the lake now and the depth was holding if he could keep the harley upright while maintaining his speed slow enough to prevent water from splashing up into the electrical system they were going to make it across his fear now was that even though he entered the water at the right spot he hadnt held a straight enough line during the crossing behind them the land rover was on the move again continuing around the lake toward the spot where they had started with luck neither verne nor grimes knew anything about the tunnel if that was the case in matts perfect scenario he nikki and the harley would vanish like something straight out of siegfried and roy he waited as long as he dared then flicked on the headlight they were no more than fifty yards from shore and the tunnel was there just twenty feet or so to the right hang on tight he hollered over his shoulder the arms around him tightened a notch he swung right straightening the path to the opening and called on the harley for some more speed engine screaming they exploded out of the water up the low bank and hurtled into the tunnel the corrugated steel ceiling flashed past less than a foot above their heads the bike jounced viciously over the floor ahead there was only darkness ten yards twenty fifty matt slowed the end of the tunnel was just ahead he cut the light and rolled out into a dry streambed that sloped gently downhill braking to a stop he checked behind them the metal tunnel was built into concrete with a massive metal door that was gratefully open all the way it seemed that shady lake was something of an engineering marvel a reservoir that provided recreation and a source of water for the pools and golf course it wasnt clear where the water to fill the lake would be diverted from maybe thats why the construction had stalled matt mused smiling lights off they cautiously followed the streambed through the rolling outline of what one day was to have been the golf course behind them toward the lake there was only darkness how are we doing nikki asked softly her cheek still pressed against matts back well i think were going to make it out of this place he said mopping sweat from his forehead with his sleeve the question now is where to from here boston she said firmly take us to boston chapter with one eye on the rearview mirror matt rode the nearly dry streambed into the forest where it merged with a running brook he paralleled the brook for nearly a mile before they heard traffic noises the twolane road was one matt didnt know well and in fact they headed south for several minutes before he realized his misjudgment and turned around by then despite wearing matts jacket nikkis teeth were chattering he offered his socks to cover her bare feet but she insisted he push on until he was certain they were out of danger she was absolutely beat but hung on gamely for almost twenty miles more until matt felt it was reasonably safe to stop at a target store they picked up a hairbrush some toiletries and clothes for both of them and sneakers for nikki and at the sunoco station next door they got gas and a road map from there they found a back road that paralleled the highway and headed north a few miles past the target store they spotted a railroad car diner dropped it seemed in the middle of no place nikki had changed at the store into jeans and a flannel hunting shirt with a red bandanna tied loosely around her neck her lips were dry and cracked and there was a lattice of healing scratches across her face dark shadows enveloped her eyes still there was a gentle beauty and intelligence about her that matt found totally appealing the few occasions over the past year that he had been with a woman he had been so totally disinterested and distracted that at times he was actually embarrassed to the point of apologizing the fullness in his throat and his keenness to learn more about nikki solari were as threatening as they were exciting as bewildering as they were pleasant his memories of ginny were no less vivid than they ever had been but over just two days he knew that something inside him had changed is it that enough time has passed he wondered or is it this one woman you all right he asked im not ready for the obits if thats what you mean but i might be a candidate for the comics this is totally unreal matt weve got to go to the police or or the fbi isnt kidnapping a federal offense it is yes he replied i have no idea what it would be like trying to bring charges against a police chief even as two physicians sharing the same story despite losing to us tonight grimes is far from dumb hes a killer and now hes desperate im sure hell come up with some sort of countercharges like maybe i kidnapped you and then brainwashed you with drugs or something weirder things have happened what else can we do i dont know for the moment i really want to move against the mine before they have a chance to empty that dump now that theyve lost both of us that might be the direction they go in if we suddenly get embroiled in charges and countercharges with grimes and some police department or fbi office i think we might end up losing besides once we come out into the open grimes has another shot at us both i guess i understand so then now what i dont know connect with some family or friends or or maybe a lawyer tell them what happened form some kind of strategy then maybe go see the police id really like to come up with some approach to dealing with the mine people before we make any other move okay im not sure i agree but i am sure you just saved my life for now we do it your way starting with my boss great and then maybe my uncle hal sawyer the pathologist some way somehow well get to the police i promise nikki ordered black coffee and anything that was greasy and hot matt went for the chili after the waitress had left nikki shared the stunning details of kathy wilsons illness and death her condition was all grimes wanted to know about she said he never explained why all he kept asking was who else knows about her who else knows about her it was astonishing for matt to hear the description of kathys facial nodules and mental deterioration nikki could just as easily have been speaking of darryl teague or teddy rideout but there was a problem kathy wilson had never worked at or near any facility of the belinda coal and coke company and had left home to follow her destiny in music nearly nine years ago are you sure she hasnt been back to belinda since she left matt asked maybe before she and i met she had or maybe for a day or two here and there when she and the band were on the road but nothing extended i dont believe so and what did you tell grimes at the church i cant seem to remember the details of anything he and i spoke about thats understandable with the sort of concussion you suffered it could be weeks or months before you recall some recent things or even never up at that that cabin he just kept hammering away at the same thing asking who else knew about kathys condition besides me he seemed especially interested in what i had told you ill bet he was it was matts turn to share what he knew including his illfated trip into the mountain with lewis and his subsequent treatment of lewiss collapsed lung when he finished nikki merely shook her head and shrugged it doesnt sound like any toxic syndrome i know of she said but i suppose its possible what could it be then three people from the same town with such a bizarre syndrome coupled with a nearby toxic waste dump that has a river running right through it maybe youre right nikki said pensively maybe the groundwater is contaminated from the dump and maybe kathy somehow did get exposed the gun on the wall is certainly smoking but it all still sounds a little shaky to me if she really never worked at the mine groundwater contaminations got to be it im curious what did the pathology of those two miners brains show my uncle hal sawyer is the me and actually did the posts he reported that the lumps were standard issue neurofibromas and that both mens brains were grossly normal so he didnt bother doing a microscopic i dont blame him she said but a number of devastating centralnervoussystem conditions have brains that look fairly or totally normal on gross inspection maybe well learn something from kathys microscopic you did one my boss joe keller did i insisted on it ive never done well with loose ends even tiny ones ill be anxious to hear what he found maybe he can order some sort of toxicology on the tissue im still certain the mine is at the bottom of all this youll get no argument from me nikki said draining the last of her second cup besides who am i to question the clinical acumen of a doctor who saves his patients lives with unrolled condoms the starlight motel in red wolf pennsylvania was just the sort of place matt hoped to find it was a momandpop operation far from any main drag room was on the second floor in the rear overlooking a small pond he gathered their things and helped nikki up the stairs the room held the must of years of service plus a hint of smoke nikki went into the bathroom and emerged wearing a pair of thin sweats and a championlogo t bracing herself against the wall she pulled down one side of the bedcovers and crumpled onto her side breathing heavily here lift up your tongue matt said i want to check your temperature sleep i need to sleep i know one more minute matt slipped the digital thermometer beneath her tongue he brought up his stethoscope and listened to her chest and back a few crackles suggesting some lowgrade pneumonia but nothing that needed immediate attention hop in she said weakly you saved my life twice in two days that means you dont have to sleep on the floor ill try not to kick too much he shut off the lamp but some light filtered through the gauzy curtains he rolled onto his back next to her and pulled the sheet and thin blanket over both of them you know he went on ive been trying to figure out how kathy might have gotten exposed to the toxins from the mine it seems possible that she might have been in the wrong place at the time of a particularly dense spill maybe the two other cases were there at exactly that time too do you think thats possible nikki her eyes were closed her respirations raspy but even she had hung on as long and as hard as she could matt turned onto his side facing her for a time he studied her face in the dim glow breathing in the scent of her good night pal he whispered finally i promise next time we go to a nice quiet museum here comes another contraction okay hon you know what to do im okay im okay donny i got this one no sweat no sweat i got it her friends and family had told her how hard it was going to be how painful the nurse in charge of the birthing class had begun the class on labor and delivery by saying whoever named labor had clearly been through it sherrie cleary now in her ninth hour of serious labor just focused her thoughts on all the doomsayers and naysayers and smiled sure the contractions hurt sometimes they hurt like hell but pain was just that she told herself over and over again nothing more and she was still hanging in there at twentysix this was her first baby and she was most definitely not going to be her last her husband don had gotten a nice raise at the body shop and thanks to an uneventful pregnancy she had been able to waitress until just three weeks ago they were still living in the anacostia projects but the people from fannie mae were optimistic that before long they would qualify for a mortgage could anyone blame her for wanting more kids margie briscoe the midwife breezed into the birthing room checked the baby monitor and then came to the bedside looks great she said how you doing sher i can handle the contractions at least so far but i am getting a little impatient you wouldnt be normal if you werent here let me check you just relax and let your knees flop apart perfect youre stretched out nicely too because of all that preparation you

worse than the others no wait oh lord make that a lot worse oh margie set her hands on the volleyballsized rock that was sherries contracting uterus and watched as the monitor screen showed nothing more than the expected slowing of the fetal heart rate one minute two three sherrie groaned and gasped continuously i dont know if i can wait wait its getting a little better its going away oh gosh the contraction will be right back margie exclaimed because its happening little donelle is on her way don will you poke your head out the door please and tell sue its time sherrie im just going to do

the muscled physique and stoicism of a longshoreman was openly weeping as the nurse took his daughter wrapped her and brought her up to rest on sherrie who was beaming like the midday sun tears streaming down her cheeks i told you she said to everyone and no one in particular i told you it was going to be incredible three hours later when the nurse sue came into her room sherrie was dozing but still smiling her husband sitting off to her right was gazing in awe into the bassinet at the perfection that was their child sherrie hon wake up sue gushed you have a visitor a very special visitor here im going to wipe your face with a cool cloth good are you awake im awake whats going on mr cleary how about you are you awake sure whos here id tell you but i think youre going to have to see for yourself she went quickly to the door and called out into the hallway theyre ready for you now the wife of the president of the united states unaccompanied strode calmly into the room and crossed directly to sherries side sherries and dons expressions made it clear no introduction was necessary mrs cleary she said just the same im lynette marquand congratulations on your beautiful daughter you too mr cleary thank you sherrie managed thank you this is such a surprise well its a pleasure for me to be here on such a joyous occasion lynette said mr cleary mrs cleary i have some wonderful news for you chapter the sierra leone embassy in dc was on th street not far from the pave offices once a stately town house it had fallen into fairly impressive disrepair the drapes and carpeting were tawdry and the airconditioning consisted of scattered window units some of which did not appear to be working ellen had been in embassies before canada mexico and france there was absolutely nothing in any of those facilities that was as outdated as anything in this one she had arrived on time but it was clear from the torpor of the young man behind the reception desk that she would be seen by his excellency andrew strawbridge when it happened the waiting area six nondescript straightback wooden chairs and three end tables was devoid of any reading material save several copies of an ancient propaganda pamphlet extolling the virtues of sierra leone and a dogeared copy of time it was just as well the ambassador wasnt ready to see her ellen thought she needed time to compose herself and regain her focus at the moment there was someone displacing both lassa fever and omnivax from her mind namely rudy peterson as she had done any number of times ellen had slept over in the guest room of rudys cabin she was anxious about the lassa fever revelations he had shared with her and also the meeting with strawbridge after a few hours of fitful sleep she climbed out of bed pulled on the terrycloth robe rudy had put out for her brewed some coffee and brought her notes up to his secondfloor study it was not yet fourthirty in the morning she was searching for a pen in the top righthand drawer of his desk when she spied the envelope it was on the very bottom of a pile of papers and would have escaped her notice except that her name and address were on it written in rudys precise hand there was also a stamp pasted in the upper right corner but not postage enough to get the envelope mailed ellen wondered correctly as it turned out if perhaps the letter had been written some time ago when rates were less she slipped the envelope back in the drawer and for the next half hour tried to convince herself not to retrieve it she had always been a curious sort probably more so than most and she had an affinity for gossip that often embarrassed her given her makeup this discovery was a tough one to resist and at nearly five in the morning she wasnt as detached and analytical as she was capable of being over those thirty minutes her rationalizations became increasingly lame if rudy hadnt meant for her to see it why had he left it in his desk where she might well come across it if he was agonizing over whether or not to mail it wouldnt she be saving him anguish as absurd and flawed as her reasoning was she still managed bit by bit to bury her common sense beneath it almost before she realized she had actually done it the envelope was open in her hands her resolve not to read the contents lasted only seconds dear ellen i suppose the best thing i can do is just get this part out of the way first i love you i have since the day howie first brought you into our dorm room and introduced us its been four years now since he left your home and here i am as much in love with you as ever knowing you have never felt that way about me what to do as you know i dated a fair amount over the years following our first meeting i slept with some of those women and even tried to get serious with a couple of them but i always knew i wasnt being fair to them then a few years before he broke up your marriage howie started telling me in our mantoman talks that he wasnt being faithful to you i wanted to tell you then what he was doing and how i had always felt about you but it just seemed i dont know wrong with that painful knowledge and my feelings for you i still couldnt stop being his best friend for that im ashamed well now howies been gone for quite a while and i see the way youve bounced back you tell me about all youve been doing and even about dates youve been on that has hurt im right here i want to shout right under your nose and ive loved you for thirtyfive years i probably wont send this letter but maybe i will either way i think its great that you have accepted the position on that vaccine commission and that you have asked me to assist with some research i promise to do everything in my power to help you become an expert in the field i wish i were a little more colorful and charismatic and a little less shy but hey i am who i am and i dont regret the path my life has taken one bit i just thought maybe it was time that you knew your devoted friend rudy ellen looked up from the frayed patch she had been studying on the oriental rug in the embassys waiting area and realized that andrew strawbridges attache was smiling over at her soon he said in a velvety english accent ambassador strawbridge will be with you shortly thank you im fine to wait the letter was still in her purse rudy had gotten up around six and without realizing she was upstairs in the study went out to the backyard where he did twenty minutes of tai chi fairly advanced tai chi from what she could tell she knew he practiced the beautifully controlled martial art and from time to time had watched him work out alone in his yard she had never thought of asking to join him and true to his reserved nature he had never pushed the possibility on her this morning though she studied him as he practiced later on during a breakfast of mushroom and brie crepes that he had cooked to perfection she learned that he taught tai chi classes in a nearby community hall several times she came close to bringing up the letter and admitting what she had done but each time she pulled back when they embraced as she was preparing to leave for dc as they had done hundreds of times over the years it was as if they were touching for the first time why didnt you just put the darn thing in the mail when you were supposed to she was thinking as she drove off mrs kroft mrs kroft im andrew strawbridge the ambassador said his voice rich and melodic startled out of her reverie a second time ellen leapt awkwardly to her feet mumbled an apology and took the ambassadors hand he was a short slight dapper man with warm deepbrown eyes and rich black skin his face was slightly pocked from what she assumed was a childhood infection thank you for coming out to greet me personally she said leightons already gotten out of his chair once he replied winking i didnt want to tax him the truth is i came out myself because your call yesterday intrigued me and i was anxious to meet you thank you you said you were on the commission that recently approved the supervaccine i was only i didnt end up voting for or against its approval i abstained sometimes abstention is a very powerful statement he said he led her into a spacious mahoganypaneled office with a conference table and a wall of wellstocked bookshelves a framed green white and bluestriped flag hung behind the expansive desk the other two walls featured the usual photos of diplomats and dignitaries shaking hands with each other as well as a large framed map of sierra leone coffee tea he asked i joke about leighton but he is excellent help for me and he brews a superb cup of coffee ellen pictured the small armies of employees manning the other embassies she had visited in that case ill have mine black she said leighton black coffee for mrs kroft please the usual for me he left the door ajar and motioned her to a seat across the desk so now you have come to talk with me about a vaccine yes against lassa fever strawbridge sighed a touchy subject with us im afraid mrs kroft i dont understand the company that developed lasaject about ten years ago is columbia pharmaceuticals located not far from here i know that from all we can tell the vaccine is very effective do you agree yes and no ellen said the vaccine was tested in a very small group of people in your country and did seem to be protective but for some reason the testing was stopped the vaccine was evaluated later on in a larger group here in the states strawbridge nodded knowingly and chewed on his lower lip ellen sensed he was debating how much of the truth to tell her unfortunately he said finally at the time columbia was trying to evaluate lasaject our country was in a certain amount of how should i say turmoil they chose to pull their people out and test their vaccine elsewhere thats the testing i mentioned that was done here but instead of measuring protection against lassa fever they measured protective antibody levels stimulated by the vaccine columbians report to our food and drug administration states that the inoculations did very well in that regard im very happy for them strawbridge said sarcastically alas not one person in my country has benefited from their research im sure it comes as no surprise for you to hear that sierra leone is hardly a wealthy country the two people at the head of columbia a woman virologist and another doctor came to freetown and met with our health ministry regrettably they could not find how should i say common financial ground to initiate a mass vaccination program im sorry i read that the world health organization was reluctant to get involved until the political unrest was resolved strawbridges dark eyes blazed then just as quickly softened unfortunately there has been some discord in our country he said but not enough to deprive millions of a medical breakthrough im sorry ellen was embarrassed to find herself at that moment thinking about rudy how much more comfortable she would be feeling if he were there with her how foolish she had been to open his letter to her why in the hell hadnt he ever spoken up so the ambassador was saying when you called you presented me with two tasks i know what i was asking might be difficult strawbridge smiled patiently we may not be able to afford columbia pharmaceuticals exorbitant rates for their vaccine he said but gratefully we can afford computers your first question had to do with the number of cases of lassa fever that have occurred in americans over the last three years yes well i am not allowed to give you the names because of my nations rules on medical confidentiality but i can tell you that over the past three years there have been six cases of lassa fever in americans in sierra leone two of whom died thats all six three of those were hospital workers six cases in americans in three years in a country where lassa fever was endemic eighteen cases in three years in americans flying back from west africa curiouser and curiouser ellen said alices adventures in wonderland by lewis carroll strawbridge exclaimed it is one of my favorite books mine too well your excellency for the past week or so thats precisely where i feel like ive been wonderland mrs kroft are you at some point going to tell me what this is all about ellen felt herself blush ambassador strawbridge im truly sorry for seeming so oblique i beg you to be patient with me im investigating some loose ends surrounding the lasaject vaccine thats as much as i feel comfortable sharing right now is there something wrong with the vaccine no i have no reason to think so you will keep me posted as soon as i have any firm information ellen held her breath as the diplomat pondered his situation in that case he said finally let us move on to your second request the passenger manifests rudys contact at the cdc had obtained the flight each american lassa fever victim had taken getting back to the states ten of them had flown from freetown to london on sierra national air and from london to various cities in the us the other eight had flown ghana air from freetown to accra ghana and then directly to baltimore their hope was that the passenger manifests might provide a recurring name maybe indicating a carrier of the disease you know strawbridge said we diplomats are taught never to give away something for nothing if i hand over these documents i do have a request of my own yes ever since they chose to hang on to their vaccine until we could meet their price demands my government has been very disappointed with the people at columbia pharmaceuticals if there is any way you uncover that we might how should i say make life more difficult for them i would like your word that you will let me know ellen sat on a sunlit bench in dupont circle cradling her cell phone in her lap and following one passing couple after another andrew strawbridge had come through not only with the passenger manifests of the sierra national flights but with those of ghana air as well the next logical step would be to interview some of the few surviving lassa fever victims she had enough of a credit line on her visa to make any necessary flights since the confrontation in her living room with the monster who threatened her grandchild she had been consumed with finding a way to bring the production and distribution of omnivax to a halt without endangering lucy or anyone else in her family the mans huge head soulless eyes and hallmark scar burned in her mind somehow she was going to find him she was going to find him and when she did she would also find the means to destroy him in as painful a way as possible surprisingly to her over the days since he appeared in her living room with his smugness and his threats she had realized in her heart that she was perfectly capable of killing such a man but in the meantime she would take whatever chances were necessary to bring down those who had hired him the problem was that suddenly she didnt want to do it alone over the years since howards departure she had managed to hold her vulnerability and loneliness in check reading rudys letter had changed things suddenly she felt uncertain and frightened the last thing she needed at this point was to lose her incisiveness to dilute in any way the hatred that was driving her but that was exactly what appeared to be happening the first of the cases on the list rudy had obtained did not answer the phone and had no machine or service a man answered ellens second call and assured her that yes his wife had survived her terrible illness and yes they would be happy to meet with ellen after his wife returned home from work next ellen called information and jotted down the number of united airlines then barely realizing what she was doing she dialed rudys cabin hello rudy hi its me calling from the big city he asked with a makebelieve twang dupont circle howd ya make out six cases in three years rudy thats the sum total of all the americans infected with lassa in sierra leone six three were hospital workers rudy whistled i dont think i need my degree in statistics to know that aint very many compared with those who got infected on those airplane flights he said i think not strawbridge gave me the manifests too all eighteen of them ive already contacted one of the patients from your list she lives outside of chicago going to go see her i want to well i say go for it rudy yes i i want you to come with me hey thats very nice of you when are you going today this afternoon oh shoot im really sorry el but i have a class to teach and a private lesson im afraid tomorrows tight too i have this family of russian immigrants that i teach english grammar and reading to i might be able to change them to another day if i can get ahold of them but they dont have a phone and ellen watched a couple snuggling on a bench across from hers and felt a knot in her chest no no please dont change your plans she managed ill be fine ill fly in and back and drive out to the cabin late tonight or first thing in the morning youre right rudy said you will do fine whos the woman where does she live she lives in evanston her names serwanga nattie serwanga chapter the massive killer moved across the floor with surprising stealth and closed in on nikki as she slept her eyes opened a slit but it was too late before she could make a sound his huge fleshy palm clamped over her mouth his knee ground into the small of her back increasing pressure on her spine until she knew it was going to crack in two please no please stop her mind screamed i dont want to be paralyzed paralyzing her was clearly only part of what the man had in mind he had tried to kill her before and botched it he was not going to miss again his moon face puffed into a lurid smile as he hooked his fingers beneath her chin and pulled her head back his knee was pressing straight through her body nikki awoke lost and totally disoriented clawing at her pillow the air in the strange room felt thick and stagnant then as she was forcing herself to calm down she heard the steady breathing of the man lying next to her startled she sat up on the side of the bed trying to ignore the land mines exploding behind her eyes the sight of matt rutledge sleeping deeply his face peaceful and unlined brushed aside the last of what had been a series of exquisitely vivid and frightening nightmares a piece at a time some of the events of the night just past drifted into place the man lying there her doctor had saved her from certain torture and probable death just rode in on his motorcycle and saved her life she wondered how much her managedcare insurance carrier allowed for that service the postagestamp room featured a bed that was probably rented out as a queen but looked smaller and a fanback white wicker chair in addition there was a small threedrawer bureau with some clothes neatly folded on top nikki padded to the tiny bathroom washed her face with cold water then brushed her teeth and hair with brandnew supplies that seemed to be waiting there for her her arms were a mass of bruises from ivs blood drawing and god only knew what else there was a thick tender scab an inch or two long just above her right ear she felt certain she knew what had caused it but with her thoughts careening about like bumper cars she just couldnt seem to get her mind around anything specific she returned to the bedroom settled onto the wicker chair and dropped her feet heavily onto the bed the impact was enough to visibly jar matt but he lay there undisturbed his half smile suggesting that whatever his current dream it was far removed from those that had been tormenting her he had kicked the sheet aside and lay there in a pair of sweat pants naked from the hips up he had the full waist and broad shoulders of an athlete past his prime but managing to keep up she had never been particularly drawn to men who wore their hair in a ponytail but his seemed to fit his rugged features well all in all he was not hollywood handsome but he was damn attractive in most of the physical ways that mattered to her and he had just saved her life she knelt by the bed and studied the tattoo on his deltoid it was what had he said a hawthorn tree about two inches high beautifully rendered as far as she could tell because of her own unusual tattoo she always paid attention to them on others a tree was a first there was a story there she was certain of that she brought her face up so that her eyes were just a few inches from his she felt his breath and expected him to react in some way to her closeness nothing he continued his sleep and judging from his peaceful expression his dream as well the clock radio on the bureau read seventhirty which more or less corresponded to the light filtering through the curtains it seemed like waking her new roommate was going to take nothing short of a frontal assault but not just yet she shifted back onto the chair and sorted through what she could remember of the strange and deadly events since her departure from boston one thing and maybe only one was clear kathy wilson was at the center of whatever was going on she was one of at least three people from belinda with a bizarre terrifying inexorably lethal syndrome matt was certain that a toxic exposure was responsible for the unusual constellation of signs and symptoms his theory made as much sense as anything did especially backed up by his discovery of largescale toxic waste storage in a cave near the belinda mine but what was kathys connection with the mine and why did the chief of police send men to kill nikki and subsequently become obsessed with finding out whom she had spoken to about kathys condition at the moment she didnt have the wisp of an answer to any of her own questions but knowing joe keller as she did if there was a clue in the anatomy of kathys nervous system he would find it there was a phone on the bureau with a note taped to it that local calls were free and longdistance calls had to be collect or credit card holding her breath she dialed collect and placed a call to what she hoped her disrupted memory had held on to as joe kellers direct line if the clock radio was correct her boss would have been at the office for an hour already possibly two sipping his thick black coffee and working out anatomic and biochemical puzzles bless you she muttered when his voice came on the line and accepted the prompt to say yes joe im all right she said quickly thank god people have been very worried about you we even called the police nikki started to explain that a chief of police was in fact responsible for her trouble but quickly stopped herself there would be time im on my way home right now i should be there by late tonight excellent joe ive had some trouble in west virginia related to my friend kathy the one you autopsied what sort of trouble there are two other cases down here that looked and acted exactly like hers neurofibromas and progressive paranoid insanity well now that is something keller said you see your instincts were absolutely correct in this case i am looking at the slides of miss wilsons brain right now she has unmistakable spongiform encephalopathy spongiform encephalopathy nikki caught her breath the degenerative transmittable ultimately fatal nervoussystem disease had a number of forms including a syndrome called creutzfeldtjakob disease kuru once found in the braineating cannibals of new guinea fatal familial insomnia and bovine spongiform encephalopathy also known as bse or more commonly mad cow disease excitedly nikki stretched out and kicked matt firmly on the sole of his foot he bunched his pillow beneath his head and pulled his foot away she kicked him again even more forcefully this time with her heel against his calf he moaned and began to stir go on joe she said knowing better than to ask if he was sure this is quite incredible you say there are two other cases where you are in the town where kathy grew up yes one final kick and it was clear matt had at last ascended to a higher plane of wakefulness if he hadnt taken some sort of drug he was a candidate for the guinness book of records her clients in the coroners office were easier to rouse and these other cases keller asked they had spongiform encephalopathy also i dont know their brains appeared normal on gross exam so the microscopic wasnt done se was caused by germs known as prions infectious protein particles capable of reproducing themselves without dna or rna one of the characteristics of se was that despite an often spectacular clinical picture the brain looked grossly normal until sections of it were examined under the microscope where diffuse spongelike holes could be seen another characteristic was that the incubation period of the disease was often a decade or more during which time the victim might well be infectious to others did these cases of yours also have neurofibromas keller asked matt was awake now pawing sleep from his eyes and looking over at her quizzically she put a finger to her lips and motioned that she would fill him in momentarily yes both of them from what i have been told there was nothing unusual about them on microscopic well maybe and maybe not keller said i tried a number of stains and stain combinations on them and found an approach that clearly distinguishes these lesions from the reference neurofibromas in my library keller the evercurious keller the intellectual nikki smiled just picturing her boss he was forever playing with stains and with his departments powerful electron microscope his library in addition to the hundreds of texts included hundreds probably even thousands of unstained specimens from every organ and countless disease states each carefully catalogued evidently among those unstained tissues were some runofthemill neurofibromas the reference specimens spongiform encephalopathy with unusual neurofibromas the belinda syndrome nikki speculated or maybe rutledgesolari disease joe listen well be home between ten and twelve tonight i should be here then if you are great but if not well see you tomorrow morning we a doctor from down here saved my life two or three times recently hes got more than a passing interest in this syndrome he thinks its due to a secret industrial dump spilling toxic waste into his towns groundwater given what we know about prion infections keller said i really dont see how well well talk about it when we get there thanks joe im so relieved you are okay keller said oh by the way the police had no trouble finding the man who killed your drowning victim roger belanger his name was halliday that was what the h was for they were friends and business associates the police believe they fought about money halliday invited him over to his place to make up he wrote a check and the two of them had a few drinks once halliday got him into his pool he got his hands around belangers throat and dragged him to the bottom process nikki said exactly keller concurred by the time nikki set the receiver down matt had pulled on a new blue sweatshirt with yale blockprinted on the front mornin she said mornin yourself she motioned at the sweatshirt did you go there no but while you were trying on things in that target store last night i bought some stuff for me this was one they had in my size believe it or not i remember well sort of where did you go to school good ol wvu the mountaineers that was the only college we could afford turned out to be a great place nikki felt certain she recalled a nurse telling her that matt had gone to harvard med yet he didnt feel that minor factoid was worth tossing in she gave him high marks for modesty as if he needed any more high marks after what he had done for her you sleep soundly she said people have noticed that from time to time yes if you have trouble walking today its from me kicking you to wake you up the nurses at the hospital quiz me when they call to be certain im awake they dont know that ive mutated so that i can now answer most of their questions even the complex mathematical ones in my sleep do you remember much of last night unfortunately i think i do i hope i thanked you enough for rescuing me the way you did i have a thing against losing patients so what was that call all about i phoned my boss joe keller to tell him i was alive and well and to see if anything had turned up in kathys microscopic and youre not going to believe this matt kathy had spongiform encephalopathy joes absolutely certain of that and believe me hes like never wrong matt sank back onto the bed incredulous he was hardly an expert on the various versions but he was keeping up on the condition in the medical literature at least as much as his cramped schedule would allow prion disease yes nikki said quick point of interest most people pronounce it pryon the way you do but stanley prusiner who won the nobel prize for describing the beasties pronounces it preeon i heard him speak a year or so ago preeon it is this is incredible do you think my two cases had se as well how can i not well what in the hell what about the neurofibromas anything special about those apparently there was joe keller is sort of a stain freak he might try a dozen different staining techniques on a piece of tissue just to see what shows up he tells me kathys facial lesions take up this one obscure stain differently from the usual elephant man type of fibromas i just dont get it neither do i but listen matt the way i see it maybe youre still on the right track before we jump to any conclusions lets go up to boston and see what joe has to show us give me a few minutes to get put together and were off only as far as the nearest ihop though i have this sudden insatiable craving for pancakes drenched with maple syrup ihop she wants matt mumbled as he headed to the bathroom first she lays prions on me then she wants ihop what kind of a woman is this anyway nikki was impressed with his attempt at cheeriness but she knew joe kellers revelation had stung from what matt had told her last night he was determined to expose the directors of the belinda mining corporation for all the shortcuts they had taken over the years and all the people they had harmed along the way the bizarre cases were just the catalyst he had been looking for to bring them down proof that mishandling of organic toxins was causing serious biologic injury but it was going to be hard connecting the mine with prion infection well she reminded herself nothing was decided yet if there were answers though joe keller would have them matt returned to the room scrubbed and shaved and looking very good he had stripped off the yale sweatshirt and replaced it with a black t and the denim jacket he had been wearing when he rode to the cabin in the woods and rescued her nikki liked the change he was much more denim than ivy league ready to go he asked she stood and set her hands on his shoulders his eyes immediately found hers you were very cool and very brave last night she said if i had thought about what i was doing i probably would have fainted i doubt it there was much more that she had planned to say much more she wanted to know about him but suddenly she was on her tiptoes her arms around his neck thank you matthew rutledge she whispered thank you for saving my life maybe she had known all along that she was going to kiss him maybe she had promised herself clinging to him on that motorcycle that if they survived and somehow escaped she would kiss him whether he wanted her to or not still the actual act of placing her lips against his briefly and tenderly was as surprising to her as it was exciting she drew away just far enough to read his eyes and saw no doubt in them their second kiss was deeper more prolonged and more passionate his muscular arms enfolded her as his lips and tongue explored hers she set her hands against the sides of his face and ran her fingertips over his cheeks and jaw when at last they broke apart she could barely stand i dont remember the last time i wanted to kiss a woman so much he said in that case im glad i came along when i did very funny actually that was very funny you know i have no recollection of the exact words but doesnt kissing my patient violate some paragraph or other of that hippocratic oath we took she kissed him again this time playfully call it mouthtomouth resuscitation she said i think my hmo might even cover it he looked over longingly at the bed but made no move to lead her there therell be time she whispered gently i promise you that but right now we have work to do work to do pancakes to eat god but you kiss splendidly as do you tell you what well practice every hundred miles or so just in case we can perfect the art a little more that certainly would do wonders for my road rage oh he added here he handed over the yale sweatshirt i actually bought this for you its a large but thats the only size they had and why yale because thats the only one i could find that didnt have some silly foreign version of an english phrase on it like sport tough or big run well youre much more west virginia than yale anyway and coming from me thats a high compliment how so she pulled on the sweatshirt then kissed him on the cheek because she said underscoring the four block letters with her palm i graduated from here nattie and eli serwanga lived in a modest cape in an integrated neighborhood of evanston just up the lake michigan coast from chicago ellen sat at the dining room table sipping tea with honey and trying to remember the last time she had felt this sad there was the situation with rudy and the incredible guilt and humiliation she was feeling over having opened his letter but that situation paled in light of what these two had been through as they talked she flashed over and over again to dr suzanne oconnors incredible account of the horrors of her battle with lassa fever in their early forties ellen guessed the serwangas were kind and generous toward her and clearly in love with each other the perfect couple to have and raise children only they had none and werent ever again going to get the chance deepening their tragedy was irrefutable evidence that nattie was responsible albeit inadvertently for the deaths of two eightyearold children who attended the daycare center at the hospital where she worked nice stuff tell me again nattie ellen asked when did you know you were sick nattie pulled a tissue from a halfempty box and dabbed at some embryonic tears she was a beautiful woman large and expansive with huge expressive eyes and ebony skin it was nearly two weeks after we got back from africa she said we came back on a tuesday and i first felt the sore throat two mondays after that ten days later i was in the operating room they delivered the baby but he was stillborn then they tried to save my womb but there was just too much bleeding eli who was still wearing his suit and tie from work rose and moved behind her to comfort her it was his relatives they had been visiting in sierra leone and he expressed some guilt at having talked her into staying for an extra week while he straightened out some family business the week in which the doctors believed she became infected ellen sipped at her tea and reflected on the impact of her own newly acquired guilt if my questions upset you too much she said you must tell me were doing okay eli replied but it would be good if you could tell us where all this is leading ellen set the passenger manifest on the table during the flight from dc to chicago she had managed to curtail the attempts at conversation by the recently divorced totally selfabsorbed appliance salesman seated next to her long enough to scan all the flights searching for matches passengers who had been on more than one flight with a soontobevictim of lassa fever there were at least six i have reason to be suspicious that nattie may have gotten infected with the lassa virus either just before or just after leaving sierra leone or else on the plane ride home but how nattie asked i dont know do you mean eli said that you think somebody deliberately infected her thats the possibility im looking into please both of you i beg you not to say anything to anyone about my suspicions until i can finish my search its a matter of life and death can you give me your word on that yes they said in unison of course nattie added thank you im looking into the possibility that someone on the flight home transmitted the virus to you nattie this is a list of the people who were on your flight from freetown to ghana and then from ghana to the states do any of these names ring any bells as you can see there were fortysix on the first leg including the two of you and thirtyseven of those among the hundred and sixty on the flight to baltimore do any of these names stand out as someone you remember nattie shook her head its been three years she said plus i think i lost some of my memory when i was sick im afraid i cant help you im sorry your memory is just fine eli countered these names mean nothing to me either tell me do you think this infection was random or do you think my wife was singled out ellen considered the question for a while you know i never thought of that she searched for the words to speak about the ten cases of lassa fever that nattie was believed to have caused through her job as a dietary worker including two that died nattie saved her the trouble if someone did want to spread the infection someone with a job like mine would be perfect provided they somehow knew what i did for a what is it ellen asked noting the odd expression on the womans face eli remember that man on the flight from sierra leone the big man who talked to me outside the rest room he was on the other plane too the white man exactly he sold something insurance i think you mentioned how scarylooking he was i do remember him yes he was a smiler and a talker that one asked me all sorts of questions about myself made it a game like he was such an experienced insurance salesman that he could guess things about me ellen felt a little burst of adrenaline anyone else she asked just in case no one that i can think of she remembered the memory exercise rudy had done with her okay she asked can you bring me a paper and pen certainly eli brought in several sheets of typing paper okay ellen said im going to go and sit in the living room id like you to put your heads together and write down every descriptive word you can remember about this man what he looked like what he acted like even the things youve already told me just relax your minds and freeassociate i know its been a long while but just do your best take as much time as you need and if you disagree on something write down both opinions well try our best nattie said fifteen minutes later the serwangas were out of recollections they called ellen back to the dining room and apologetically handed her their description big tall strong slick smooth smiling gladhander thick hair flat face like a cartoon character hit with a frying pan deep voice maybe a texastype accent scar on face ellen felt her heart stop the scar she asked her voice trembling can you tell me about the scar thats natties eli said i dont remember any scar well there was one im sure of it right here she pointed to the space between her nose and upper lip thats him ellen said who a very bad man i think were onto something well i just thought of another word we should have put on the list clumsy what do you mean i was standing waiting for the rest room he came up the aisle tripped and slammed into me the man nearly knocked me out of the plane chapter matt and nikki had breakfast at pancakes on parade on the banks of the susquehanna if it was possible for a family restaurant to be romantic this one with a broad porch set on tall stilts out over the river surely was but then again on this particular morning the two of them would have found any mcdonalds or burger king atmospheric for over an hour not a word was spoken about bill grimes or spongiform encephalopathy or belinda coal and coke instead they touched fingertips and thumb wrestled laughed to tears at the silly or embarrassing stories of each others lives and commiserated with the sad ones grace their husky gumchewing waitress called matt slugger and nikki dearie after the third time she found they werent ready to order because they hadnt looked at the menu she brought them heartshaped lollypops and a bill for two dollars for mooning at each other in publie its been a long long time since i mooned matt said cept maybe for the time a couple of years ago when my shorts ripped while i was playing basketball boston men are too sophisticated to moon nikki said instead they discuss lunar landings and the hubble telescope there was a pay phone in an alcove by the rest rooms before their order arrived matt called his uncle at the hospital hey unk its matt hey hal said how goes it any word about that patient of yours it goes not too well actually and yes nikki solari is safe shes with me in pennsylvania hal something really weird and really dangerous is going on it has to do with those odd cases the miners them and the girl who died kathy wilson and bill grimes is right in the middle of it my read on grimes is that hes slick and power hungry hal said but hes not evil unk hes evil believe me he is hal sawyer listened patiently as matt recounted the story of nikkis abduction and subsequent rescue and this mornings revelation regarding the microscopic findings in kathy wilsons brain spongiform encephalopathy hal said when matt had finished now doesnt missing something like that make me feel a bit sheepish theres no reason the wilson womans brain looked normal just as im sure our two cases did you wouldnt be expected to do a microscopic on their brains this guy in boston only did it because nikki solari insisted you still think the mines at fault im sure of it i dont know the precise connection between what theyve done and spongiform disease but i do know that somehow theyre the cause of this and grimes is on the take from them any ideas what we should do hal thought for a time it seems showing someone in authority that toxic dump you found is the place to start i agree there is a man fred carabetta at the occupational safety and health administration in washington who owes me a favor for some expert witness work i did for him a few years back maybe the way to go is to see if i can call in my marker and get him to come with us and view that dump once weve got an osha official believing we can bring some legitimate pressure to bear against bc and c if the dump is still there now nephew you know we cant control that thats rule number two in your godfathers lexicon of youth i know i know rule number one theres no such word as cant rule number two if you cant control it dont let it control you excellent im proud that you havent forgotten the lexicon rules after all these years thats cause you still spout them at me every chance you get in that case im glad youve been paying attention listen matt ill see what i can do with fred carabetta how can i get ahold of you just call the house and leave a message on my machine ill check it frequently and get back to you and ill call that coroner in boston too see if he can tell me about that special stain he used do you have any tissue left from those two miners i suspect i do please dont speak with anyone about grimes until you and i have a chance to talk okay hes more dangerous than you think if youre that certain about him why dont you just go to the police somewhere and file a complaint nikki wants to but ive talked her out of it for now from what ive heard the police are a pretty tight fraternity theres no cop whos going to listen to us and run right down to belinda to make grimes assume the patdown position and once we come out into the open hell have us between his crosshairs regardless of what we allege he did for the time being id rather wait okay whatever you say just be careful ill call you later today by the way i visited with your mother this morning shes really slipping i know i saw her for a few minutes yesterday it wont be long now before shell need some sort of comprehensive care ill look into it when i get this business settled listen hal thanks for your help with her and with this youre on the right track matt im certain of it me too unk matt said me too nikki gave the pancakes a solid eight matt claimed to have wolfed down his spanish omelet too rapidly to grade it for taste he left grace a tip that was twice the cost of their meal along with a note that thanked her for presiding over their morning mooning you know what im really relieved about he asked as they headed out to the harley im really relieved those guys didnt kill you aw gee you certainly know just what to say to a girl you romantic devil you its good to know we actually have something in common im relieved they didnt kill me too she reached across the bike and kissed him intensely enough to get a honk from a passing trucker she had just let up when they felt some tentative raindrops fifteen minutes later it was drizzling steadily matt found a walmart outside of york and visaed some rain gear for each of them but for the next five hours the going was slow and not pleasant they gave passing thought to stopping until the next morning but nikki was too anxious to get home by the time the clouds broke they were still several hours from boston having inched through rushhour traffic around new york city at nine nikki called the office to tell joe keller they were running late and might not be there until eleven but there was no answer hes either doing a late case or out to dinner she said i shouldnt have told him when we were arriving so he wouldnt wait but now that i did im sure hell be there matt used the break to call his machine there were two messages the first was from mae reporting that as far as she knew there was no word about his patient dr solari and that she was worried about not having heard from him all day and hoped he was all right and that his absence was due to nothing more serious than the erratic behavior he had been exhibiting so much of lately the second message was from hal good news matt not great but good fred carabetta wont commit to any action regarding the mine but he will meet with us his office tomorrow at three two hundred constitution avenue wherever you are i hope you can make it call and confirm matt left a message on both his uncles office and home machines that he would be there and then dictated a message on his own office machine telling mae he was all right and would be in touch after he set the receiver down he shared hals breakthrough with nikki im going to take the bike back to dc tomorrow he said wanna come do you get frequent flyer miles on this thing double miles to dc its the shuttle well thanks i really want to be with you but for the moment i think i need to stay here for one thing i feel like my body cant take too much more and for another i have this job cutting up dead people that i get paid pretty well for doing but only if i show up it says so in my contract i understand ill be back up as soon as i deal with this mine thing it was nearing eleven by the time they cruised up the southeast expressway toward the shimmering lights of boston the rain had stopped leaving the air cool and fresh have you been back here since your residency nikki asked nope he called back over his shoulder in the beginning after i returned to belinda i was working like hell in the er then to set up a private practice ginny got sick soon after that and never really had much of a remission since she died its been hard enough much of the time just to get up and go to the office much less embark on a nostalgic journey to boston i did like the place though lots the medical examiners office was located just off the highway except for some low nighttime lighting the threestory building was dark nikki rang the front buzzer half a dozen times they could hear the sound of it echoing through the empty reception area but there was no movement inside strange she said theres usually a maintenance man here all night even if hes not joe often works past midnight knowing were coming i have trouble believing he went home maybe he wasnt feeling well matt offered maybe the front door opens with a swipe card that is back in west virginia with my things but theres a security door in the back that has a keypad joes office is toward the back anyhow maybe he cant hear the buzzer matt followed her through a dimly lit alley to the rear of the building see she said thats joes office that light right there on the second floor i knew he was here i think youre right about him not hearing us this is a long building sort of like an aircraft carrier nikki punched in the code and they stepped into the concrete rear stairway eerily illuminated by a red exit sign the air was imbued with the distinctive though not overpowering aroma of formaldehyde with matt following nikki quickly ascended to the second floor and opened the door onto a carpeted corridor with offices on either side joe its us she called out she knocked on the door marked josef keller md chief medical examiner then pushed it open the office was brightly lit by an overhead fluorescent fixture and a desk lamp joe keller was at his desk his back to them joe nikki said why didnt you then she saw the blood on the carpet she raced to the chair with matt right behind and cried out loudly there was dark clotted blood all over the desk and splattered across the face and clothes of joe keller his head drooped over his chest nikki lifted it gently exposing a battered face with a bullet hole just above the nose kellers eyes were open wide and glazed with death his wirerimmed spectacles dangled from one ear look matt said gesturing to kellers right hand which rested in the dead mans lap the index finger had been cleanly severed off at the middle knuckle oh jesus nikki cried stumbling backward her limbs suddenly in spasm oh christ how could someone do this to him matt put his arms around her and held her closely honey please dont touch anything anymore he begged who would do such a thing why he was such a dear sweet man why oh jesus oh shit no she couldnt stop moving shifting from one foot to the other pounding her fists against the sides of her thighs matt led her away from the body of her mentor trying at once to comfort her evaluate the scene and stay alert in case the killer was still in the building he thought about the gun in his saddlebag and cursed himself for not bringing it along when keller failed to answer the door he had an inkling of trouble at that moment but simply hadnt paid enough attention to it there wasnt the slightest doubt in his mind that the mes torture and murder were somehow connected to kathy wilson was grimes nearby or his stooges there was a small round conference table at one end of the office matt helped nikki into the chair that was facing away from keller nikki im really sorry about this sick and sorry you think it had to do with grimes she sobbed im going to try to figure that out but yes yes i do he chose not to question her again about what she might have said to grimes either at the memorial service or in the cabin ii want to help you she said in a little bit nik can you sit here while i look around yes good just keep your hands in your lap i know theres a logical explanation for your prints being in this building but id rather not have them be the only employees fresh prints in this office i understand matt they tortured him matt paced around the desk and scanned the rest of the office no gun no knife no finger he squatted down and examined kellers contused distorted face his nose had certainly been shattered and there was probably a fracture of the orbit bone above his left eye earlier in the evening they had again discussed calling in the police and had voted unanimously against it for the time being nikki matt asked can you estimate when he was murdered i would need to examine him to be really accurate but from what i saw i would guess a couple of hours ago so we can wait to call the police and maybe do it from a pay phone in that case matt said come back to the bike with me dont you want to look around and try to find out why they did this oh i do but theres something in my saddlebag i want to get first on the chance theyre still around minutes later with matt cradling larrys snubnosed revolver the two of them began a systematic search of the building assuming this has to do with kathy he asked what do you think they could have wanted i dont know lets start with our files theyre in a locked room right behind the autopsy suite covering her fingertip with her shirt nikki punched in her code on a keypad and they entered the long narrow file room the charts on the shelves are arranged by case number she said as she crossed to a narrow sixdrawer cabinet this card file is alphabetical and i cant find her card there are seven katherine wilsons but none is the right one look matt said pointing to a dark smear on the corner of the long table in the center of the room nikki peered at the stain they had joe in here she flipped through the cards again then took out all the wilsons and set them on the table matt went through them and shook his head nada we have the cards backed up nikki sat down at a computer terminal and after a few maneuvers wrote down a number kathy wilsons chart was missing too and with it all the autopsy data do you use a transcription service for your dictations nikki was already back at the terminal we have our own inhouse the records been deleted from the database they thought of everything except the backup chart list joe somehow managed not to tell them about that lets go down to histology its right below the autopsy suite they carefully closed the file room and entered the large open autopsy suite with three stainlesssteel tables the center table was occupied a copperskinned man garbed in work boots and stained chino overalls lay peacefully thumbs hooked under his suspenders staring unseeingly up at the drop ceiling there was a thick smear of clotted blood and tissue where his left eye had been beneath the gore they were certain was a bullet hole oh christ nikki said turning away the maintenance man she nodded santiago cute touch hooking his thumbs in like that the stairs to histology are over there to the surprise of neither the slides for kathy wilson and all unsectioned tissue specimens were gone nothing nikki said after she had checked the last possible place where any of kathys tissue might be two men died so someone could be certain of that matt nikki blurted out lets get out of here i want to go to my place right now im not sure thats wise i dont care youve got a gun if youre not comfortable using it i promise you i just became totally ready i want to go home i want to sit down and have a cup of tea in my own chair and figure out what to do next okay okay show me the way thanks and nikki yes im really sick about joe i know you are in silence through largely empty streets they rode the few miles to south boston and parked a block away from nikkis apartment matt secured the revolver in his belt and pulled his shirt over it keeping his hand in touch with the grip warily they made their way along the colorful row of tightly packed duplexes and triplexes keeping an eye out for movement in any of the cars parked along the street how are we going to get in he asked we keep a spare key wedged in a little magnet box behind the drainpipe kathy started losing hers all the time the key was right where she expected it to be cautiously they made their way up to the second floor matt slipped the gun out and held it ready as nikki slid the key in the lock turned it silently and eased the door open oh no her flat was in shambles books were strewn everywhere shelves stripped bare lamps were knocked over every drawer was pulled out and emptied every cushion and framed painting thrown in the middle of the floor figurines and candy dishes were smashed mindless of the possibility that men were still in the apartment nikki dropped to her knees sobbing hysterically matt knelt beside her and did the only thing that felt right he kicked the door closed set his arm around her shoulders and let her cry fifteen minutes later they were still in the same spot finally numbly nikki rose and shuffled into her bedroom she emerged with a mediumsized backpack filled with clothes lets get out of here and out of boston she said flatly i feel as if ive been raped matt followed her out of the ransacked apartment down the stairs and around to the bike theyre not going to get away with this he said i promise you they arent were going to the police she said firmly turning suddenly to face him her expression an unsettling mix of fury and bewilderment im not going to let you talk me out of doing it this time if we had gone when i said maybe joe would still be alive nikki thats dont tell me thats nonsense she snapped maybe it is and maybe it isnt i just want to go to the police matt checked around quickly to see if anyone had been roused by her outburst go now he said but dammit matt my dear friend is dead and grimes killed him i dont care about your fucking coal mine or or your theories about toxic waste or your goddamn insane town joe keller was the gentlest man on earth why in the hell would they do this why sobbing wretchedly again she threw her arms around him and buried her face in his chest matt held her tightly going to the police was asking for trouble he still felt certain of that joe keller had already been dead for a couple of hours when they found him and those who had killed him and destroyed her apartment were not going to be any easier to catch up with this minute than they would be after an anonymous call an hour from now reporting nikkis kidnapping would be their word against grimess and they would be exposing themselves at a time when freedom and mobility were just about the only elements on their side look he said lets get on the road well stop at a pay phone in a little while and call the boston police i hope i can talk you out of actually showing up in an fbi office or police station but thatll ultimately be up to you nikkis racking sobs gradually diminished finally without a word she mounted the harley and waited for him to step on matt stuffed the revolver back into his jacket pocket took his spot in front of her and fired up the bike if going to the police was what she needed the police she would get she had been through so much he drove off sensing her sitting rigidly behind him staring off into the night he was grateful she had gone into her bedroom to gather her things grateful he had had time to pace around her living room before she returned grateful he had happened to look over at the mantel somewhere in the next half hour or so he would ease the harley toward the soft shoulder and when he was certain she wasnt paying attention he would flip what he had found on her mantel into the woods and the whereabouts of joe kellers missing finger would forever remain a mystery chapter it was past two in the morning when matt and nikki found a motel vacancy just outside of stamford connecticut confused bewildered and more than a little frightened they checked in and carried their small cache of belongings up one flight to a fairly standard wellmaintained room with a view of after leaving the shambles that was nikkis apartment they had ridden south in light traffic through providence and on into connecticut it was a somber silent ride made well under the speed limit each of them was experiencing some tension born of nikkis continued determination to involve themselves with the police and possibly the fbi in the face of matts desire to remain as much of a mystery to bill grimes as possible until his business with belinda coal and coke was completed two exits past providence she asked him to leave the interstate there at a rest stop she called the boston police theres been a double murder at the medical examiners office on albany street she said surprised by the composure in her voice chief william grimes grimes of the belinda west virginia police department is responsible a minute later they were back on the highway feel better matt asked over his shoulder not much grimes will probably say that he doesnt know anything and that some nutcase he once arrested is out to cause him trouble once those bodies are discovered im sure the police will begin to search out everyone who works in your building it wont take long for them to figure out that it might be you who made the call i dont care i know you do but i dont you and i are the only ones who can connect grimes to joe itll be our word against his but two md degrees have to count for something after we wake up i want to go to the fbi to report the murders and also being kidnapped thats definitely a federal offense if you want ill tell them i dont know where you are that way you can get to washington and meet with the guy your uncle spoke about do whatever you have to do matt replied im really sorry if i end up interfering with your plans lets hope it doesnt come to that youre angry im not angry i would have liked to have i dont know solidified our position before involving the police maybe speak to a lawyer sorry dont apologize youve been living a nightmare ever since you set foot in belinda you have a right to do whatever you want and so do you she said so do i matt replied just before accelerating up the entry ramp and back onto the interstate so do i nikki showered and dressed for bed in the bathroom matt had changed into sweats by the time she emerged he was reading a hostelry magazine in the armchair beside the small writing desk as far away from the bed as possible you coming in she asked unemotionally soon maybe he responded in the same tone im a little wired from the ride and all thats happened will the lamp bother you not really good there were differences between ginny and this woman matt was thinking but not when it came to digging in god but he wanted to take her in his arms right now instead he stayed in the chair flipping pages one moment staring sightlessly at a bland photo of some snowcovered mountain inn the next nikki rolled onto her side facing away from him but he could tell by her breathing and posture that she wasnt asleep you sleeping he asked finally no this has been a really hideous night yeah joe was such a wonderful man several silent minutes passed you know he said finally in case you couldnt tell when i didnt even know how to pronounce the word i dont know an awful lot about prion disease if youre up to it since were both still too awake to drift off i was wondering if you might be able to share some of what you know from your reading and that guys presentation you went to nikki slowly rolled over to face him and propped her cheek on one hand you mean stanley prusiner yeah him is this a ploy because things are a little tense between us right now no well i mean yes i mean i really dont know anything but the basics about prions so i wouldnt exactly call it a ploy more of a factfinding mission you going to stay over there i dont want to and i dont want you to so what am i doing over here he sat down beside her tell you what how about i work some of that tension out of your shoulders while you enlighten me on spongiform encephalopathy i think stanley would like that she turned onto her stomach as he began to knead at the considerable tightness radiating from the base of her neck mmmmm just a little softer oh thats it thats perfect okay lets see you already know that prions are little particles of protein that have the ability to reproduce themselves no dna no rna yet they can reproduce amazing thats pretty much the sum total of my knowledge youre slowing down you want to learn about this stuff or not much better okay prions are present normally in humans and possibly in every other organism with a nervous system prpc is the abbreviation for these normal prions some people and animals are unfortunate enough to have a mutation occur in one or more of their prpc prions the result is a gradual buildup of a toxic prion known as prpsc the brain and nervous system unknowingly adopt this imposter prion then the normal nervous tissue slowly comes apart and the host organism dies humans and cows and minks and deer and cats and even monkeys i suspect that the more we look the more spongiform diseases well find and prions may be at the center of some other neurodegenerative diseases as well such as alzheimers my mothers disease matt said yes that made me so sad this morning when you told me about her most of the time i think shes handling it better than those around her well its still too early to know but possibly she has a prionmediated disease are you getting tired doing that nope in that case a little farther out toward the shoulders please nice thats it oh doggies that feels good so is mutation the only way to get prion disease no any means that gets the germs into the body will do the trick the prions that cause mad cow disease or kuru are eaten patients receiving corneal transplants from someone infected with spongiform disease can get it that way i would suspect that other routes of administration would do it as well and there is a long delay before symptoms develop maybe decades so far there have only been a hundred or so cases of mad cow disease in great britain despite the tons of beef that those people ingested before the condition was recognized and warnings were sounded that could mean there are thousands of cases still brewing but i dont think so what do you think the arms i think you should work on the upper arms youre very good at this thank you are you like all those guys who say they love giving back rubs then after a girl starts dating them it turns out the first back rub is all they really enjoy giving from then on its do me do me maybe thats for me to know and you to find out so dont leave me hanging why do you think there wont be thousands of cases of bse in humans partly because there havent been thousands tens of thousands already it seems to me that only a very small percentage of those who are exposed to prpsc prions get infected how could it be otherwise why is that why do you think that is genetic factors quite possibly as with most diseases we really dont have any idea why one person exposed to a germ gets sick and the person standing right next to them during the exposure doesnt a little harder doc perfect you tell me bad luck and ill tell you that right now for most infectious diseases thats as good an explanation as any i believe that those who develop spongiform disease are either lacking some sort of protective gene or else have a gene that in essence invites the altered prions in nikki rolled over drew matts face down to hers and kissed him lightly on the mouth tell her what she just won merv he said as she finished congratulations you just won another two hundred hours of massage matt cupped his hands over his mouth and imitated the roar of a crowd ill tell you what big guy she said well stop in some city in new jersey and ill just file a report with the fbi office there then ill go with you wherever it is you want to go deal im agin it i know you are okay deal theres something else you want to add i can see it in your eyes what is it what matt i hate to say this and i dont want you to get upset or discouraged but the mine theory isnt holding together well for me what do you mean i mean the connection between the toxic exposure and the syndrome weve encountered the waste dump is there i saw it given lets assume the two miners had the same spongiform disease that joe found in kathy spongiform encephalopathy at least the four or five different types we know of is caused by prisons but i just dont know how a toxic exposure can cause a prion infection well he said after some thought let me take a crack at that there are good lifesustaining prions that everybody has and loves right yes and there are bad spawnofthedevil prpsc prions that cause spongiform disease right essentially yes then how about the toxic exposure increases susceptibility to bad prions or or causes mutations from good to evil organic toxins cause mutations that go on to cause cancer thats a fact but remember these conditions seem to take years to develop in some instances decades so if a toxic exposure did occur affecting our three cases i would think it occurred before any of the subjects was old enough to be working in the mine and what about kathy she never even came close to the mine as far as we know what about groundwater contamination the toxins from the mine get into the water and accelerate prion mutations is that what you wish to believe that is what i would like to believe yes matt said she kissed him once again then pulled her pillow in tightly as she drew her knees and arms in works for me she said dreamily but matt could tell that it didnt he waited until her breathing said that she was asleep gnight he whispered he rolled over and drifted off his mind playing images of an underground river churning past countless barrels of poison then coursing off into the darkness newark new jersey with four stops for directions which were invariably given to them in dense newarkese it took longer to locate the fbi office than it had to make it to newark from stamford they chose newark because they expected it would have a goodsized office and because neither of them wanted to drive into manhattan matt rolled slowly down a treelined street past the tall nondescript gateway center on market street and stopped half a block away so he said as nikki stripped off her helmet buckled it to the bike and ran a brush through her hair here we are here we are she echoed hands on hips matt youre looking distressed i thought we had decided on a plan i just dont feel comfortable about this i understand how about making it a little easier on me she reached her arms out to him come on she cooed sorry matt muttered accepting the invitation to hold her i still have trouble coming to grips with why people dont accept my point of view on any given subject as the only viable one let alone the best one you can come in with me if you want the fbi agents might not look charitably on any guy with a ponytail who isnt steven seagal tell you what im going to call my uncle from that pay phone we saw on the next block after that i might come in it shouldnt take too long just to file a report were talking government agency here shouldnt take too long is not a wellunderstood concept in that world hold down the fort matt watched as she strode away took a tentative step to follow then turned climbed back on the bike and rode to the next block there were two messages on his answering machine one was from mae reminding him of a three oclock appointment with his dental hygienist and assuring him that his patients for the day had been moved to other slots i certainly hope you are all right she added the concern in her voice unmistakable the second message recorded yesterday evening was from hal everythings set matthew fred carabetta will see us at three oclock tomorrow afternoon at his office in dc call me for details hal answered on the first ring hey matt are you okay no quickly matt reviewed the events of the previous night god thats just awful hal said and where are you calling from newark nikkis in with the fbi right now filing a report well i think youve got to get her out of there hal said i was just going to leave another message on your machine grimes has an apb out for your arrest both of you i was afraid he might do something like that whats he charging us with murder what grimes called me early this morning then came by and drove me out to view a body and bring it back to the morgue big man whats left of him i think i know who he is matt said feeling the acid in his stomach beginning to percolate names larry he worked for grimes extra crispy from what i could tell he was shot in the head in a cabin off tall pines road then incinerated when it was burned to the ground quite well done the man was then while were driving back to town grimes casually tells me that you and dr solari are wanted for the guys murder wants to know if i might happen to know where you are how does he get off making me a suspect there are hospital medications and supplies in the woods near the cabin with fingerprints on them and motorcycle tracks all around grimes is speculating that the big man was working for you when he kidnapped dr solari and that you killed him to keep him quiet or from squeezing you for more money slick hes setting both nikki and me up to die hal maybe a murdersuicide by this deranged doctor who became obsessed with his patient to the point where he had her kidnapped all grimes has to do now is get his hands on us hal ive got to get to nikki before she speaks with the fbi people ill call you later were expected at carabettas office at three this afternoon constitution avenue well be there matt said he sped around the block and dismounted the harley across the street from the office building fbi please twentysecond floor the uniformed security man at the lobby reception desk responded glancing up from his magazine only long enough to ensure that the questioner wasnt encased in dynamite and brandishing an assault rifle the six elevators were all between floors ten and fifteen of the twentyfour stories their descent was so painfully slow that matt actually gave passing thought to sprinting up the twentytwo flights he was the only one in sight as he stepped into the car but predictably three others a man and two women materialized just as the doors were about to close and pressed buttons for floors five nine and seventeen matt tapped his toe and drummed his fingers over the upward journey which seemed to take an hour the elevator opened directly into the waiting room thank god nikki was there seated opposite a receptionist thumbing through a copy of people a wizened asian woman occupied one of the other chairs just as matt stepped off the elevator a darkly handsome young man with a hollywood chin emerged from one of the offices crossed to nikki and introduced himself as duty officer sherman nikki clearly startled by matts sudden appearance didnt respond immediately to the agent the hesitation was all matt needed he moved quickly to her side slipping his hand around her arm and applying as much force as he dared nikki looked momentarily shocked but then came through and handled the assault coolly her expression saying this had better he good im sorry to bust in like this officer matt said but were going to have to come back a little later theres been a death in the family now you jes listen here sara jane tinsley you gotta stop actin up an let me get some damn work done there aint no one followin you an there aint no one tryin to hurt you now go on out an find somethin to do or someone to play with ifn you cant occupy yerself then jes get out back an start pickin corn corn aint ready ma an you know it sara jane snapped its plenty ready besides you jes want me out there so those men can have me you hate me you hate how ugly i done become you think its my fault you think im staying up all night jes to git under yer skin you dont understand that i caint sleep no matter how hard i try i caint sleep she was twelve tall and willowy but yet to show any outward signs of becoming a woman right now she thought she really didnt care if she became a woman er not she cared about the men who had tried to git her into their car as she uz walking down the road first they called her by name an offered her a big stuffed panda to come with them then one of them the thin one with the cowboy hat got out of the car with a fist fulla money an held it out for her at the sight of him sara jane had whirled and taken off through the woods the man came after her but there was no way in hell he uz gonna catch her those were her woods no one caught her out there lessn she wanted em to youre making a big mistake the man had called after her as he gave up chasin sara jane reported the incident to her ma but it uz clear she didnt believe her all she said was that sara jane wouldnt be gettin in such trouble if shed jes stop runnin off ever chance she got an stayed closer to home seven kids an sara jane was the only one actin out the way she was stayin up all night makin up stories havin tantrums screamin at her ma gettin into fights with her brothers and sisters racin off into the woods it were the bumps on her face that were poisoning her an makin her do bad things sara jane had tried to explain the bumps the doctor in ridgefield disagreed he said she uz jes becoming a woman an doin it harder n most the lumpsd go away as soon as her monthlies started maybe so but this mornin she had found another one this one jes above her eye nearly as wide as a dime an hard as a knuckle it was the sixth one plus two right on the top of her head them monthlies had better come soon or there wouldnt be nothin left of her face it was clear that her ma had said all she was of a mind to say on the topic of sara jane tinsley well to hell with her if she wanted the corn picked so damn bad her favrite daughter would pick it sara jane stormed from the house slamming the torn screen door behind her and grabbed one of the plastic baskets takin in laundry an ironin was her mas main source of money but the corn half an acre of it helped only this year had been dry real dry an many of the ears was runted well she wanted em she was gonna get em runted or not furious sara jane marched to the end of the farthest row and began tearing off all the ears she could find and throwing them into the bucket the bending and shaking stalks made a sound like a thresher was going through them the noise and her own wild movements kept her from hearing the man stealthily approaching her from behind or sensing his presence until it was too late simultaneously one of his strong bony hands pinned her to him across her chest while the second one clamped a cloth over her mouth and nose a cloth soaked with something that smelled sickly sweet sara jane tried to fight and bite but he pulled her down to the ground and smothered her with his hand and his body she knew it was the man with the cowboy hat but there was nothing she could do quickly her struggles lessened i told you ma i told you they uz after me her head began to spin then just as she thought she was going to throw up peace and darkness settled over her chapter ellen sat alone nestled in the wellworn leather easy chair in rudys pinepaneled den a barely touched avocado and swiss sandwich on the tv tray in front of her a nearly drained glass of merlot her second cradled in her hand she had never been much of a drinker and couldnt remember if she had ever drunk wine in the morning but the omnivax documentary she was watching put together by the marquand campaign coupled with the letter in her purse that she had yet to deal with had generated a level of tension that simply could not go untreated it was just after twelve noon on the day following her remarkable interview with nattie and eli serwanga and a few hours after that with lassa victim john gendron a thirtysevenyearold schoolteacher from baltimore it was a frantic dash with some luck from the traffic gods thrown in but ellen managed to catch a return flight from chicago to bwi airport her car was at reagan international outside of dc so she rented one and drove to gendrons place a modest town house on fayette several blocks from the sparkling baltimore waterfront before his infection with the lassa virus gendron had taught english in an innercity junior high school he was now eighteen months past his close brush with death and believed he was too disabled ever to teach again ellens conversation with him was limited by his hearing which was percent gone in one ear and percent in the other as a result of his illness i went to sierra leone to visit my sister who is a nurse with an international aid organization he said about a week after i returned my throat began to burn when i swallowed anything even water within three days my temperature was spiking to a hundred and five blood was coming out of my nose and rectum the mans eyes began to glisten and ellen could see that however gracious he had been about inviting her to his home this exchange was exquisitely painful for him mr gendron please feel free to send me packing if this is too hard for you she said i live close enough to come back another time no no im okay you promised to tell me what it is youre working on and i will ellen said well i became delirious around the end of the second week and was put in the hospital they they had to remove my intestine to keep me from bleeding to death even so i nearly did im divorced and live alone so my sister flew back here from sierra leone and took care of me for nearly two months my colostomy is a souvenir of my trip to africa it may actually be the souvenir of your flight home ellen was thinking go on she said as far as i know he went on flatly i infected six of my students plus my son and one of his friends the friend made it okay two of my students and my son steven werent as fortunate oh no i am so sorry he was my only child every day i wish i had died and pray that i will soon ive had personal tragedies too ellen said making any sense of life afterward is terribly hard therapy and time thats all i can tell you therapy and time and reaching out to help others thank you once again gendron assured ellen he was able to continue is there anything unusual you can recall about your flight back to the states she asked taking pains to avoid any leading questions the flight back here was uneventful but i did meet one unusual character on the flight from freetown to london if thats what you mean thats exactly what i mean he was an american engineer interesting and very outgoing specialized in inspecting bridges i think he said ellen gripped the arm of her chair can you describe him for me i think i can although my memory hasnt been so good since just do your best ellen said deciding not to put the man through rudys writing exercise well first of all he was big not just tall but big like a football player his hair was sort of blondish and he wore thick glasses with a heavy frame anything else i cant think of anything except wait he had a scar an unusual scar right here above his lip bingo with some prompting now from ellen gendron even recalled being bumped by the man while waiting in line at gatwick airport in london he tripped i think and stumbled into me it was like getting hit by a train we both went down after extracting the same pledge of silence from gendron as she had from the serwangas ellen explained her interest in the lassa cases and the man with the scar then she drove to reagan and exchanged the rental for her taurus she arrived back at rudys cabin just after two in the morning and was relieved to find that he hadnt waited up for her now she sat in his den watching the omnivax campaign special breathing in the lingering earthy essence of his pipe tobacco his merlot was gradually stoking the fires of her resolve to speak to him rudy was upstairs in his study poring over the passenger manifests making phone calls and being a rock of support to a woman he considered a good friend a woman who just happened to know that he had been in love with her to the exclusion of all others for almost forty years how was she going to tell him what she had done and perhaps even more important how did she truly feel about what he had written there was no way to answer the first question without being ready to respond honestly to the second ellen splashed in another glassful of wine this was last call she resolved even as she felt warm fingers working through the muscles of her face three glasses were quite enough or had it been four the glasses werent that big anyway omnivax had clearly become the flagship of the marquand campaign with just over two months remaining before the election the presidents camp was laying out big bucks to get their message of beneficence progress and commitment to campaign promises through to the public the documentary had initially focused on vaccinations in genera and now had moved on to omnivax the narrator unseen at the moment was a movie star with a voice that inspired confidence and radiated authenticity james garner donald sutherland ellen didnt watch enough movies or tv to be certain and so the voice was saying estimates are that between fifty and sixty thousand cases of potentially lethal infections will be prevented by this astonishingly potent vaccine over just the next year i am honored to introduce to you the first lady of the united states mrs lynette lowry marquand marquand strolled the pediatric ward of a hospital as she spoke at three oclock in the afternoon on september second two days from today a fourdayold child will receive the first official dose of omnivax i will be there for that most significant occasion as will secretary of health and human services dr lara bolton who will administer the supervaccine using this pneumatic device especially developed for this purpose she held up a small gun that looked something like a derringer with a flattened muzzle we are on the verge of the greatest advance in preventive medicine in our history an advance that could signal the beginning of the end of infectious diseases as we know them what about the thimerosal mercury a gazillion kids have gotten dosed with ellen asked out loud aware at the same instant that her speech was thick and her glass was empty what about the autism what about the seizures and brain damage and sudden death what about the asthma and learning disabilities and adhd and what about the man whos flying around sowing disease and death to peddle his goddamn vaccine what about all those what about all what rudy had entered the den carrying the manifests and other papers i am proud to say that all of our major networks will be carrying the ceremony from the anacostia neighborhood health center here in washington where a fourdayold child will take her place in medical history as the first official recipient of omnivax im watching a program that could have been written by the pharmaceutical industrys public relations unit ellen said but instead was written by jim marquands there is something about that prissy wife of his that really bugs me she tried to modulate her voice which seemed like it might be too loud was there ever a time she had drunk like this she followed rudys bemused gaze to the bottle on the table next to her there was at most two inches remaining in it lying beside it the corkscrew and merlotstained cork proof that not long ago the bottle had been a virgin its the best merlot ive found for the money he said gently commenting because the situation demanded he say something rudy im sorry im overtired and and was lost in this show and and i didnt realize i had finished so much of it nonsense good wine is to be enjoyed but i really dont drink very often she said thickly rudy sank onto the tan leather couch there was no judgment in his expression so whats the status of our friendly neighborhood vaccine he asked day after tomorrow a little fourdayold girl will be starting the ball rolling brought to you by the four more years for a better america committee the final credit announced ellen realized that she had neglected to learn who the narrator was if nothing else rudy said i certainly expect the number of lassa fever cases to drop dramatically you have a point no reason for old scarface to fly around infecting people anymore let the epidemic be cured its a little chilly in here would you like a blanket no i mean yes i mean you stay there i can get it myself ignoring her request rudy withdrew a maroon throw from a refurbished old sea chest and floated it down over her lap stop being so nice to me she thought im a jerk thank you she said thickly i dont know how i would have done all this without you nonsense youre the pro im just the caddy no i mean it rudy i rudy sighed let there now be eternal ambiguity surrounding the phrase the shot heard round the world you know before you brought me into this world of vaccinations i more or less took the whole thing for granted the scientists and pharmaceutical companies produce their vaccines and their pr people make sure we know why we need their products and what horrible things will happen to us if we dont embrace them it seemed that simple and after their vaccines are approved by the fda and the cdc tells everybody they should get them we smile gratefully and say thanks heres a clear shot at my body take it when drug companies make a mistake more often than not its a lulu ellen said still trying to direct their conversation toward the letter thats what i have in common with them when i make a mistake its a lulu too tell me about it i used to call myself the king of screwupville rudy ellen said i dont know what made me do what i did but you did it because unlike some first ladies we know you are a seeker of the truth you have a granddaughter who looks as if she has been damaged by her vaccinations and you want to help determine if that is the case and also to protect other children and parents from paying the same price i spose ellen looked about blearily and then emptied half of the remaining wine into her glass you know rudy she tried once more ive always been a very curious person some would even say nosy howard used to say my nosiness was going to get me in big trouble someday if you hadnt been curious about all this we would have already packed up and slipped back into our mundane existences some things you do and the moment youve done them you wish you hadnt thats how that creep who paid you a visit is going to feel when we get to him ellen ive found some stuff for us to work with were closer to figuring out who the guy is than you might think ellen felt dizzy queasy and unable to focus fully on what she was seeing or hearing she had badly overdone the wine and she sensed that she was in the process of making a bad situation worse im anxious to hear about it she managed and ive got something i need to talk with you about too had she actually said those last words or merely thought them well then rudy said ill tell you what i think is the significance of what youve found out it was a mistake ellen said i know i shouldnt have done it and i really am sorry but just the same rudy are you listening to me rudy was leafing through the passenger manifests and a small sheaf of notes but just the same go on im listening ellen sighed next time when she was clearheaded she would try to do things right rudy didnt deserve to have a slobbering slackjawed inebriate blubbering about how she had invaded his privacy what did you learn she asked clicking off the tv okay rudy said excitedly moving the tv tray table aside pulling a coffee table over and taking a seat on the arm of ellens chair i took as my criteria any male who was on multiple flights with a person who subsequently became infected with lassa that includes flights out of freetown and from ghana as well by my thinking our extortionist has to be one of these four men ellen was hearing rudys words and at least some of them were registering but the queasiness in her gut was intensifying go on she said wondering if a bite of sandwich would help matters or hurt of course rudy continued i think its a possibility a good possibility that all four of these men may be one and the same forged passports and ids arent all that hard to come by for someone with enough money and whoever is bankrolling this extortion has enough or will i suspect youre right there i have all of their names and addresses and ellen do you want to take a break and maybe continue this in a few hours or even in the morning you mean the wine i dont see you as much of a drinker and you have had a bit im fine she replied with far more snap in her voice than she had intended really i am lets just try calling information and shee see if any of these four men are listed where they say they live great idea rudy exclaimed seeming genuinely surprised and pleased with her contribution three of the names rudy had culled from the passenger manifests werent listed at all the fourth vinyl sutcher of tullis west virginia had a number that was nonpublished at the customers request i suppose we start with him ellen said now battling exhaustion as well as the nausea and dizziness be brave she told herself vinyl its hard to believe hed make up a name like that for a fake passport must be some sort of family name rudy said or else a mother who liked to name her kids after her furniture coverings hes a cute little baby i think well call him naugahyde maybe we should try and get an artist who will do a composite sketch rudy suggested or else we might try to get a photo of these four guys from the passport files at the state department at some point we may have to ellen managed but i am anxious not to lose that kind of time you know i was quite impressed with that little air injector the secretary is going to use on that baby you think thats how vinyl or whoever infected those passengers either with a pneumatic injection gun like that or some sort of flat hollow plate that fits in his palm and uses compressed air from someplace up his sleeve technically it doesnt seem as if it would be too complicated to rig up a little nudge a jet of compressed air mixed with lassa virus and zap instant disease ellen felt her eyes beginning to close rudy she said in the soft voice of a child i need to close my eyes now just for a little while need to sleep you do that dear heart she heard him say as she floated off you do whatever you need to do using the remote lynette marquand flipped off the television that had been wheeled into her office well lara what do you think she asked hhs secretary lara bolton was beaming brilliant she said masterful theres absolutely no way to tell that most of that program was shot a month ago those guys are good no better than good theyre grrrrrreat and my part perfect just enough information not too much and you looked absolutely smashing thanks you liked the script too it was right on sincere and appropriately solemn yet excited and humble i loved it and the part about the kid you mean having you mention her but holding back on saying precisely who she is yes i think it worked perfectly nobody can criticize you for putting her and her family on the spot or invading their privacy but everyone everyplace will be wanting to know about her well do the rest itll only take one or two anonymoussource phone calls and in a few hours everyone will be buzzing about little adorable donelle cleary and those calls lara bolton made a pretense of checking her watch i believe theyve already been made mrs marquand she said chapter hal sawyer was waiting for matt and nikki in the lobby of osha headquarters on constitution avenue he was dressed more like the commandant of a yacht club than a med school professor white trousers navy blazer blue pinstriped shirt open at the collar but his expression was grim he embraced matt then shook hands with nikki and introduced himself im relieved youre both all right he said thanks to you matt replied we barely made it out of the fbi office without having to explain to them why a chief of police thinks i shot a guy in the head and then tried to burn the evidence they might not have even known yet but grimes is definitely turning up the heat so to speak matt managed a weak smile is it safe to be here theres no reason to think carabetta knows anything at this point i wouldnt suspect osha is on the routing map of all points bulletins for murder lord mom okay does she know im not around for a few minutes at a time she seems to but then just as quickly she forgets im really sorry for all youve been through you too dr solari its nikki please she said i appreciate your concern this whole business doesnt seem to be getting any better it will grimes has a lot of power around where we live but he doesnt have a lot of power everywhere he lowered his voice a notch i know some excellent lawyers we can go see after we get this mine business straightened out you still think grimes is doing all this to protect bc and c im pretty certain of it yes matt said pointedly ignoring nikkis expression of doubt in that case maybe id better start watching my back ive come in contact with these cases too you know i hadnt thought of that matt said all the more reason why we have to get our evidence and put the clamps on grimes as soon as possible oh speaking of evidence ive found darryl teagues brain but so far ted rideouts is a noshow could someone have taken it nikki asked well we like to think we take decent precautions against such things for the moment id prefer to believe its been misplaced we have a storage facility for specimens over a year old even though rideouts death was less than a year ago maybe its over there i hope so by the way nikki i was very upset to hear about joe keller i met him once at a meeting he seemed like quite a guy thanks he was the people who murdered him took all of kathy wilsons specimens it seems possible they might be after the ones you have too maybe i intend to be careful and to try and gather up all the specimens i have and get them someplace safe the man matt and i are supposed to have killed was one of the thugs who kidnapped me grimes was at the cabin with him questioning me about kathys death it was clear grimes was the boss hal whistled softly through his teeth well he says you two killed the guy then tried to burn the evidence so to speak i told him matt wouldnt have bothered with the fire because he knew i was a sharp enough medical examiner not to miss the bullet hole in the guys skull even if he was incinerated but he wasnt interested well he either shot the guy or more likely had it done matt said at least now you see what kind of person he is now i see hal said somewhat ruefully hes banking on support from those country club cronies of his who think im way off center to begin with and probably capable of anything ive known bill pretty well i thought since he came to town just goes to show how wrong you can be sometimes well its time for counterattacking lets visit with fred matthew im going to let you speak with him alone nikki and i will wait in the reception area if he doesnt agree to the inspection you want it will be my turn whatever you say fred carabetta was waiting for them in a neatly maintained singlewindowed space with a worn leather couch and builtin bookcase the office would have been relegated to a low or midlevel manager in the private sector but in government service indicated some clout there were pictures around suggesting a wife and two teenage girls and interests in deepsea fishing and golf carabetta was a rotund balding man around fifty short enough to seem nearly as round as he was high he had the tendency of constantly rubbing his fleshy thumbs across his sausagelike index and middle fingers probably aware of the nervous habit he kept his hands in his lap much of the time to the mans credit matt thought carabetta listened patiently to his account of locating the toxic dump only occasionally interrupting to clarify a point matt purposely left out any mention of joe kellers death or the assault on nikki he didnt know carabetta at all and to this point at least there was nothing about him that suggested fearlessness or a commitment to justice well now he said when matt had finished thats certainly not a tale one hears every day around here knowing you were coming i did a little research on belinda coal and coke there have been some complaints filed against the company over the past few years but for whatever reason all of them were submitted by you and there was never any action taken on any of them matt replied way too intensely most of the allegations were never even responded to i assume youve tried the epa and bureau of mines only a few dozen times in the past the issues i wrote about were never this big or easily documented but i dont have any credibility i need someone with respect and clout to corroborate what i have to say thats why hal suggested you i appreciate that carabetta said i hope you wont take offense dr rutledge but there is a great deal of speculation and hearsay supporting those allegations and very little fact im aware of that but and there is another consideration at work here as well matt knew what was coming namely he said namely senator nick alexander matt rolled his eyes alexander the influential conservative some might say moral rightist senior senator from west virginia was in bed with the mining companies he was a consummate politician who over the years had skillfully quashed any number of bills that would have caused hardship for the owners the best ive ever been able to get from his office are a few well be sure to look into it letters well you may or may not know it but alexander is the chairman of the subcommittee that oversees this bureau and its budget im not surprised he may be in line for secretary of the interior in marquands second administration there is no way i can just barge into a company like bc and c and demand a spot inspection without hard evidence this is crazy matt said struggling to keep his voice even i was there i saw that dump you have a chance to be a hero this time it was carabetta who rolled his eyes dr rutledge i have never been a mover or a shaker or a hero of any kind i expect to work in this agency until i retire by then i will have moved up the gs ladder a couple of more notches my pension at that level will serve me and my family well enough the last thing i want to do is jeopardize that master plan i understand matt said resigned theres one more thing carabetta said i have a graduate degree in chemistry but i studied a good deal of biology as well over the ten years i have been in this division of osha i have been involved in the evaluation of more chemical accidents and exposures than i can count to my knowledge and experience there is no toxin that causes the sort of neurologic condition you have described especially in a woman who lived five hundred miles away and had probably never been in a mine in her life but dont you agree that toxic chemicals can cause mutations matt asked and dont you wonder why the mine would send four thugs out to my friends farm to stop them from telling anyone what we saw inside that cave perhaps carabetta said dr rutledge im sorry i just dont see how i can go any further with this matter at this time given your lack of concrete evidence maybe a report to the police is the way you should go with a sigh matt stood and shook the bureaucrats hand thanks for listening he said taking no pains to mask his frustration hal asked if you might have a few minutes to speak with him of course send him in matt crossed the small reception area to where nikki and his uncle were waiting no go he said not enough hard evidence for him to risk taking any chances especially crossing big nick alexander freddy freddy freddy hal sighed you two wait here he adjusted his sport coat flexed his neck and marched into carabettas office fifteen minutes later he emerged and motioned matt and nikki out of the reception area and into the hallway are you sure you can get us back to the cave at night he asked positive once were through the cleft there are no real forks in the tunnel just twists and turns finding the cleft may be the hard part dont worry about that i know where it is hal said i grew up running through those hills well the news is its going to be tomorrow night youll both stay at my place until then well put your motorcycle in the garage matt you both can just relax empty the fridge and watch videos until fred arrives you did it matt exclaimed pumping his fists way to go then just as quickly he dropped his hands hal you had to pay him didnt you i was hoping your enthusiasm and persuasiveness would win him over but the truth is all along i suspected it would come down to money fred and i have had such dealings once before and believe me im not the only one can you tell me how much he cost i want to help if i can being right about this cave is all you are required to contribute and as for how um difficult fred was to convince lets just say that at the moment my uncle points should be at an alltime high well you sure have a hell of a grateful nephew and dont worry unless they buried it the dumps still there speaking of which the guards may be there as well i thought about that hal said i actually have made a few inquiries searching for someone who deals with such things professionally and might accompany us now that i know when well be going ill make a call matt gave his uncle a hug you know theres no reason you have to go in there he said on the contrary hal replied with the sudden investment i have in freddy carabetta i wouldnt miss this for the world ellen awoke to an unpleasant buzzing in her head an unnatural film covered her tongue and palate well she thought disdainfully it had certainly been a blueribbon day all she had done was gotten drunk in front of rudy passed out and now was in the slow process of waking up with a nasty merlot hangover having managed still to say absolutely nothing of what she had done and to make matters worse a twodayold girl was just fortyeight hours from the first formal dose of a supervaccine containing a component specifically included to halt a lethal epidemic that ellen now knew was totally manmade she held her eyes closed tightly wary of the dreadful spinning likely to ensue from opening them finally more to check the time than anything else she forced her lids apart a bit the walls and ceiling stayed reasonably still she was in rudys guest room not she suddenly realized in the chair where she had nodded off she was dressed as she had been and still covered with the maroon throw the curtains were drawn but there was enough light to check her watch five assuming it was the same day she had been out for four and a half hours not bad for a rank amateur she rolled over and switched on the bedside lamp there was a single beautiful longstemmed rosebud in a vase beside the lamp and propped against the vase was an envelope identical to the one she had torn open her name and address were written on the outside in rudys hand and in the upper righthand corner was a stamp with todays postage her hands shaking she gently opened the envelope dear ellen so now you know what a relief i have debated more times than i can count whether to send the letter or hand it to you or wait now whichever fate decides such things has taken the choice from me well so be it i love you and the next time i see you ill probably tell you to your face there is no need for you to respond one way or the other when i do please dont let what i wrote change our friendship that would hurt me as no rejection from you ever could i have dealt with my feelings for you for many years if necessary ill deal with them for many more please dont feel bad over having opened the letter it was meant to be and for gods sake no more merlot with love rudy ellen washed her face with cold water and brushed her hair and teeth a finelooking woman for your age thats what howard had said rudy peterson hadnt even mentioned her age or his for that matter he loved her thirtynine years ago he loved her today she had in many ways been frozen since the day howard left her feelings tightly bound maybe it was time to open up how much better could a woman ever do than her oldest dearest friend a final check in the mirror and she went out to meet him rudy was seated at his dining room table his unlit pipe resting loosely between his teeth pages of data spread out before him along with a large atlas of the world ellen slipped into the seat across from him then slowly reached her hands over the table and took his thanks for the rose and the note she said thanks for taking the pressure off i cant really say anything in response right now i didnt expect you to but im going to be looking hard at my feelings and ill certainly keep you posted what more could a guy ask youre really a very wonderful man rudy i know he said just cursed by being really really choosy ellen felt herself blush so she said clearing her throat what do you have there well i have an old friend a lawyer who works at the irs he wouldnt give me any more information except to say that vinyl sutcher exists filed a tax return last year and lives right where his passport says west virginia tullis to be exact its right here not too far from the virginia border i know the police chief in my town pretty well im sure hell run this man vinyl through his computer for me maybe he could even check with the police in tullis to see if they know anything about him if i have to ill just take a drive over there and meet with the police myself let me just call beth and make sure shes still okay with getting lucy to school ellen caught her daughter just as she was leaving the house hi mom i only have a minute lucys got a dentist appointment we cant be late because they clear the office out when they have to work on her i know ellen said understandingly it takes the whole damn staff to keep her still and she screams like a banshee it makes sense they should clear the place out i mean who would ever want their kid to hear that in a dentists office everything else she doesnt react enough to but this i know ellen cut in quickly honey just hang in there thats all you can do youre doing a great job last night dick started talking again about adopting mom i just cant i ellen could tell beth was coming unglued there was a time when she was strong competent and centered not anymore beth i was calling to see how things were going and also to see if youre still able to handle the school run for a couple of days sure is everything okay everythings fine just some commission stuff i need to take care of ill call you okay and beth yes i meant what i said youre a terrific mom she set the receiver down dentist day is even tougher on beth than on lucy youre right she is doing a great job ellen shrugged off a sudden wave of melancholy so if need be she said im all set for a trip to west virginia if i can get this sutcher arrested then ill feel much safer about lucy if we decide to take any action i like that approach so long as youre very careful meanwhile ill do a little more research on these men starting with a trip into the passport office in dc to see if i can get a look at their pictures terrific tullis doesnt look like much on this map rudy added just a speck really the nearest town of any size is right here belinda belinda west virginia pretty name ellen said chapter ellen was humming along with a sinatra cd as she crossed the shenandoah river she was in northern virginia heading southwest toward the west virginia state line the late morning sun was therapeutically warm the highway was newly paved and virtually empty and soon very soon she might be helping to cage the beast who had threatened her family and singlehandedly infected a large number of people with a hideous deadly disease it wasnt at all a sure thing yet that vinyl sutcher was the man she wanted but getting a look at him was the only way she would ever know for sure her first stop of the day had been at the police station in her hometown of glenside chief ed curran was a member of the club where howard had played golf and she had played tennis quite often with currans wife lorraine she arrived at the station only to discover that the currans were away in italy for another week celebrating their thirtieth anniversary eds standin a much younger man named wes streeter was a homegrown product a former high school football hero totally lacking currans warmth and ellen quickly discerned much of his intelligence as well so this man with the scar he broke into your house waited for you to come home and then threatened to kill your granddaughter why i dont want any publicity about the reasons why can you promise me that mrs kroft i cant promise you anything until you tell me whats going on never mind ill take care of matters myself you should file formal charges against this man right here streeter said this is where the crime occurred i dont even know for certain if the name i have is the man who broke into my house i just want to get a look at him one look a photo or in person i dont care which the moment i see him ill know if hes the one or not isnt there some sort of police computer site where you can punch in his name and address and see if hes been in trouble before streeter clearly feeling that there might be more to the matter with the woman seated across from him than with the alleged criminal ran the name vinyl sutcher of tullis west virginia through his computer but came up empty eventually with some hardly subtle prompting from ellen he determined that tullis west virginia had no police department of its own but was serviced by the adjacent town of belinda by this time the policeman was bewildered by ellen and her story and most anxious to move on to other business he presented her with the number of the belinda police the name of the chief william grimes and a quiet room where she could make a call she had an image of andy griffith don knotts and mayberry in mind as she dialed so after she told the officer who answered why she was calling she wasnt that surprised to be told that chief grimes would be right with her chief grimes ellens mental image was of a man older than wes streeter and younger than ed curran andy griffith chief grimes my name is ellen kroft im calling from the police station in glenside maryland where i live at the urging of the acting police chief here a few days ago a man broke into my house and threatened me and my family if i didnt do something he wanted i have reason to believe the man might be from tullis next to your town his name is sutcher vinyl sutcher do you have a few minutes we always try to make time for our neighbors in maryland chief grimes replied the truncated story she told to chief bill grimes included her suspicions regarding the lassa fever outbreaks and the way she had ultimately derived sutchers name from the passenger manifest the vinny sutcher the chief recalled didnt fit the description ellen gave him all that well from what grimes remembered and he admitted he wasnt at all sure he was thinking of the right man sutcher was stocky but not that tall and had no scar like the one ellen described above his lip he was a woodsman and occasional bodyguard of some sort who did live in the next town grimes recalled seeing him briefly a year or so ago after he allegedly shoved a man who rearended him at a traffic light the police chief couldnt remember how that incident had been resolved but he didnt think formal charges were ever filed if she wanted to drive down to belinda he would be pleased to meet with her take a statement and share what information he could obtain on the man including a photo if in fact sutcher had actually been arrested and if the evidence she presented was compelling enough he would certainly contact the fbi and assist them in putting together an arrest warrant he said ill give you my cell phone number in case there are any problems he said and ill give you mine it was just after two when ellen rounded a sweeping curve on a mountain road and got her first glimpse of belinda west virginia a postcardperfect town nestled in a broad valley just to the east of a range of rolling foothills beyond the hills the craggy allegheny mountains probed upward into the azure afternoon sky it had been more than three hours since she left home but the uninterrupted drive with cds by carly simon and natalie cole alternating with lyle lovett and sinatra seemed much shorter throughout the trip rudy was very much on her mind not surprisingly he had said and done all the right things to make her feel less humiliated at having opened the letter from his drawer now it was just a matter of sorting through her feelings for him searching beneath the enduring warmth of their friendship for the spark of passion that even at sixtythree she wanted to have rudy loved her truly of that she had no doubt and he was certainly a man she could grow old with the question she was mulling over as she swung onto main street was whether or not he was a man she could grow young with her meeting with police chief grimes wasnt scheduled for almost three hours and except for a doughnut and the coffee she had brought in a thermos she hadnt had a thing to eat since leaving glenside her hangover was essentially gone but the pledge she made about drinking wine in the morning would she hoped live on forever she thought about driving through belinda and into tullis just to check out what the place might look like but the belinda diner a classic railroadcar eatery on the edge of town was just too inviting to pass up the place was nearly empty a competentlooking middleaged waitress in jeans and a t was serving two elderly women in one booth and two grizzled men in another anyplace you like she called out cheerily ellen took a copy of the montgomery county weekly bugle from a rack and brought it to a booth in the corner well away from the other patrons she ordered the meat loaf special and turned to the police report as she inevitably did when reading any smalltown newspaper including her own barking dog stranger lurking fight deer hit by truck disturbance drink dispenser vandalized patient kidnapped tucked in among two dozen or so police calls was a twosentence report of the kidnapping of a hospital patient from an ambulance ellen found the article dealing with the crime on page i and read the skimpy account until the waitress came with her meal whats this kidnapping thing all about ellen asked the waitress shrugged no one knows she said with a pleasant twang rumor i heard is that her doctor did it doc rutledge the patient was a doctor herself now shes gone an hes vanished too maybe he jes got obsessed with her you know couldnt live without her so he hired a couple of thugs to snatch her then acts like hes as surprised as the next fella and i thought i was coming into a sleepy little town doctor kidnaps patient sounds like a tv miniseries poor doc rutledge aint been the same since his wife died a few years back hes a darn good doctor though from what ive heard if i ever went to a doctor i jes might uv gone to him so what brings you here i have a business appointment this sure is a beautiful town thank you we think so your appointment here in belinda actually no ellen replied after pausing while deciding if any harm could come from trying to determine where vinny sutcher lived its in a town called tullis well heck thats jes the next town over parta belinda more or less ellen consulted a pad she took from her handbag deep woods road she said reading back the address they had gotten from the passenger manifests never heard of it the waitress said i have called out one of the old men who was sitting four or five booths away take main street all the way inta tullis then go rot through tullis left onta oak then bout two mile up inta the hills youll be lookin fer a gravel road on the rot i dont bleive its got no sign but some a the mailboxes at the corner say deep woods on em thank you ellen called over belinda road is jes the continuation of main street into tullis the waitress said go right out the parkin lot an jes keep on goin youll see a little sign for tullis place dont deserve nothin no bigger the eavesdropper hollered his tablemate and the two ladies in the booth near them hooted and whooped at his humor not surprisingly given ellens experience with such diners the meat loaf was commendable and the mashed potatoes and gravy appropriately decadent she left a decent tip and walked out into the late afternoon sun there were still almost two hours to go before she was to meet with grimes from the moment the old eavesdropper gave her directions to deep woods road she was obsessed driven by her own anger and curiosity to want even a glimpse of vinyl sutcher if he was as grimes described it was back to the drawing board and the other passenger names for her and rudy if grimess memory was off if she could determine that sutchers cinderblock head featured a flat face and distinctive scar she was on the verge of sweet succulent revenge she just needed to be careful and stay in the car all she wanted now was one look at the man or at least the place where he lived with the same tiny voice that had lost the battle over rudys letter begging her to wait until her meeting with the police chief ellen eased the taurus out of the parking lot and headed for tullis and deep woods road the directions were fairly accurate but the mileage was off on the low side the far end of tullis was nearly six miles away and oak street snaked upward for three miles more before she spotted the cluster of ten or eleven mailboxes several of which had deep woods road painted on one side one of the boxes had the number in neat stickons and beneath it the name sutcher maybe grimes was right after all she thought this was hardly the place one would expect to find a world traveler who had made at least four trips to an obscure country in west africa over the past three years but then if she and rudy were right the trips along with a dozen others were strictly business deep woods road graded dirt and pebbles coursed gently upward through a continuous arch of dense foliage it was one car wide with shallow drainage ditches on either side and periodic spots to pull over so that an oncoming vehicle could pass ellen inched ahead feeling a strange almost perverse pleasure at operating on the edge of a situation she knew might be dangerous despite the mailboxes there were no houses visible instead there were dirt drives wending off into the forest on either side most with a board nailed to a tree announcing the house number ellen slowed even more several dirt drives had no number was one of them to sutchers place her heart pounding ellen stopped and using one of the unmarked drives turned her car around then she carefully opened her door this is stupid the tiny voice was saying this is absolutely dumb she dropped the keys into the pocket of her slacks shut the door softly and cautiously made her way up the narrow road ahead the natural light was considerably brighter the number painted in black on a plain piece of pine board was nailed head high on the trunk of a small birch just past the birch the forest fell away yielding to a clearing beyond which was a spectacular vista a broad valley streaked with rivers stretching out to lush foothills and grayblue mountains in the center of the clearing was a new house or an old one that had recently been extensively renovated one story modern with large picture windows and mahoganystained cedar siding there were remnants of the construction still lying about the lawn had not yet been laid although the piping for an underground sprinkler system was piled up and ready to be installed there was no garage but to one side of the lawntobe was a gravel parking space large enough for two cars despite her certainty that the property was empty if not unoccupied ellen stayed in the relative safety of the forest for more than five minutes watching there was no movement desperate now to glimpse the inside she stepped from the shadows and moved toward the house her pulse still hammering the constructioninprogress notwithstanding the place was clearly someones home through the windows she could see that it was fully furnished in a manner that was quite masculine thick leather couches and easy chairs heavy unadorned end tables encouraged ellen pressed her face to the glass and peered more intently inside there was a huge bullelk head mounted above the mantel and several shotguns hooked on the wall she scanned the interior looking for photographs there were none a window at a time she worked her way around to the side of the house the panorama was truly magnificent made even more so by the sun now in descent toward the mountains the house while not built on a sheer drop was set on the top of a steep slope ellen stepped to the edge the slope was mostly dirt weeds and rocks littered with boards strapping and chunks of concrete from the construction left to be cleaned up when the place was finally landscaped it was then she realized that the house wasnt one story as it appeared from the road but two and possibly even three the others having been hewn into the hillside she took a few tentative steps down the hill and gasped there were two stories of living space the floor she had examined and another beneath it each featured a solid wall of tinted glass running the entire length of the house and underneath the lower story was a garage also built into the hillside and accessed by a narrow driveway that arced far out to her right then undoubtedly upward to a spot not far from where she had parked in the garage was a large black jeep x ellen felt a sickening tightness in her chest at the sight of it well now what have we here vinyl sutchers booming voice was a spear through ellens heart startled beyond measure she whirled stumbled and fell to one knee landing on a jagged piece of concrete she leapt to her feet mindless of the pain the tear in her slacks and the circle of blood rapidly expanding around it sutcher was standing above her twenty feet or so away hands on hips his huge flat face grinning down at her i knew it was you ellen said contemptuously get up herei said get the fuck up here ellen hesitated then slowly did as he demanded she had made a terrible terrible mistake and now she was going to pay for it in pain and then sooner or later with her life if the slope behind her was just a little steeper she might have ended it quickly right there or at least have tried to pull him over with her as things were the driveway below would stop any fall all she could do was stand there and face up to him how did you find this place he demanded isnt it a horrible moment when you realize youre not as smart as you think you are she said as much to herself as to him sutcher was dressed in black jeans a black shortsleeved dress shirt and black boots and looked to ellen as malevolent as any person could his narrow rodents eyes glared down at her i asked you a question he snarled he closed the last ten feet between them grabbed ellens wrist and with his other hand forcefully flexed her knuckles inward until she dropped to her knees crying in pain i know who you are and i know what you did she managed sutcher pulled her to her feet but maintained his grip on her hand what are you talking about do you get much pleasure out of hurting ladies that are old enough to be your mother i get pleasure out of hurting anyone now im going to ask you one more time before the real hurting begins how did you find me ellen pictured her granddaughter sleeping in her room while this monster took photos of her i just stood downwind and sniffed she said then i followed the smell and here you are without hesitation sutcher hit her a vicious openhanded slap that spun her around and sent her tumbling down the slope like a rag doll battered and bleeding she came to rest halfway down to the driveway on her belly her arms and legs splayed her gashed cheek grinding into a chunk of concrete she was awake and alert but hurting in so many places that in some strange way she wasnt hurting at all she remained motionless her eyes closed what was next from up above she could hear sutchers grunts and the clattering of stones as he worked his way down the slope toward where she lay she opened her eyes a slit resting beneath her right hand was a threefootlong thin slat of wood and protruding from the far end of the slat was a nail two inches long maybe two and a half she was going to lose to the monster that was a given but not without at least trying to hurt him first moving nothing but her fingers she closed them about wood her only chance if there was a chance at all was to swing at his face and hope to catch an eye her hatred for the man was such that the idea of blinding him brought no distaste his labored breathing was getting closer at least once she thought she heard him stumble good he was there now next to her nudging her over with the toe of his boot if he noticed her hand clutching the slat and stepped on her wrist her one chance to inflict any damage would be gone but he seemed more intent on determining whether or not she was alive to make it more difficult for him she held her breath come on over you go he said working the toe of his boot underneath her ellen allowed him to turn her nearly over before she finished the job with a loud screech she rolled to her back and swung her weapon in the same motion the nail sank to the hilt through sutchers cheek less than an inch below his eye he howled an obscenity and lurched backward clawing at the wood just as he pulled it free he fell heavily tumbling over and over down the steep rubblestrewn hill ellen was on her feet before he reached the driveway ignoring the pain of many wounds she scrambled up the slope you bitch im going to kill you sutcher bellowed youre dead meat even if he had the key to his jeep in his pocket there was no way he could get to her before she reached her car half stumbling half running gasping for air she charged across the dirt lawn to the taurus moments before she reached it she was seized with the fear that he had flattened a tire or in some other way disabled the car neither was the case turning her car around before leaving it stood out as the lone bright spot in an afternoon of stupidity she scrambled awkwardly behind the wheel and in seconds was skidding off down the road with her eyes darting from the narrow roadway to the rearview mirror and back she negotiated the dirt track as rapidly as she dared nearing the end she chanced fishing out her cell phone from her purse praying she was in range of a transmitter she dialed the number chief grimes had given her she was surprised when he answered himself mrs kroft that certainly wasnt a very wise thing to have done grimes said after she gave him a quick summary of her situation tell me something i dont know she thought i think hes coming after me she said what should i do im in the cruiser right now he replied just keep driving as fast as you can until you see me coming the other way then pull over ill have the flashers on so you can pick me up oh thank you ellen said feeling her pulse rate begin to recede into the thousands its okay mrs kroft youve done a really dumb thing but luckily youre okay ill take over from here just take a deep breath and let it out real slow youre safe now no absolutely not weve got a baby sleeping in here now go away please no more interviews don cleary slammed the door shut and stalked back into his apartment cursing the locked downstairs door and buzzin security system neither of which had been functional for a year or more damn but it was going to be good to get out of the projects once and for all he thought more reporters sherrie asked sleepily from her spot on the sofa theyre crammed on the stairway like rabbits and therere camera crews on the walk outside he sherrie her mother and some friends had watched the omnivax television program after being told about it by a woman named tricia from lynette marquands office as the woman promised in order to protect their privacy for the moment their names werent broadcast on the air of course after the actual injection was given things were going to change that they could count on mrs marquand tricia said would be happy to provide them with a publicity person who would help them after the injection to deal with the press and also to benefit financially in any way possible and there were bound to be a number of offers then just an hour or so after the program ended the phone had started ringing no one who called seemed to know exactly how they had gotten the clearys phone number or donelles name at first he and sherrie had been excited they gave a taped interview to a reporter from one of the washington television stations and allowed a photographer from the post to come in and take a photo of them with the baby after that as the media crush intensified they began saying no now they were getting angry in her cradle by the sofa donelle began crying damn i woke her up don said im sorry honey he hurried to the cradle lifted the precious bundle in his arms and sat down next to his wife the babys bleating stopped immediately her dark eyes opened widely and seemed to fix on his face is she lookin at you sherrie asked what a flirt yeah just like her mother you get out donny look isnt she perfect yeah what do you think shell be a dancer or or a doctor or maybe a famous athlete i dont know and i dont care don said the truth is theres only one thing i want her to be whats that healthy over in the corner the phone started ringing again chapter it was just tenthirty when fred carabetta arrived at hals place a rustic but expansive lodge with half a dozen bedrooms three fieldstone fireplaces and a boathouse built atop a high ledge over a pristine fivemilelong lake matt and nikki watched through the kitchen window as he maneuvered his considerable bulk out of what appeared to be a cadillac of some sort carabettas here matt called out its going to be a tight squeeze in some of those tunnels but i think hell make it hal came in from the kitchen a camera case looped over one arm and a shotgun nestled in the crook of the other he was dressed for their expedition in black as matt had suggested and was clearly keyed up but if he was the least bit frightened or tense he hid it well knowing his uncles sense of adventure matt wasnt at all surprised and freddy makes four hal said cheerily our security man should be along soon with whatever weapon hes bringing plus old hawkeye here plus the handgun you have we should at least be better prepared than you were when you and lewis slocumb waltzed in unarmed believe me i am much more competent at running than shooting anyway hopefully though nothings going to happen it was just a fluke that the guards happened to be making their rounds when they did they waltzed into the cave with no idea we were there well just stay alert tonight there isnt going to be any trouble i expect not hal said you feel pretty sure you can get us in there i was paying really close attention on the way in youll have to trust me on that after what happened to lewis i just dont feel right involving the slocumbs again even though i think one of the other brothers would come if i asked theyve done enough its really a miracle lewis is still alive if he is still alive carabetta knocked on the front door and was let in he looked slightly ridiculous in a black pullover and watch cap but he did have a rather sophisticated pentax slung over his shoulder as well as a narrow leather case that matt suspected contained sampling gear from the moment the osha official stepped through the door he looked uncomfortable greetings freddy hal said are you ready to become numero uno at that agency of yours im not certain this is such a good idea carabetta said whats the gun for we want to be prepared for any situation hal explained i dont expect any problems but if there are at least well be able to negotiate from strength that shotgun is strength actually we have another man coming with us a professional protector if you will believe me fred theres nothing to worry about go in observe maybe bottle some samples of the material and get out thats all we want from you matt said i i need to talk to you hal in private carabetta said talk to me matt said firmly sensing he knew now what the man was about this is my project come on lets go someplace quiet the master suite is fine hal said heidi hals significant other was off visiting her mother for a week matt led carabetta to the expansive suite which featured a lush sitting area a beamed cathedral ceiling and a panoramic window overlooking the lake he could see carabetta staring into the master bath which included a rock wall waterfall that cascaded into a large hot tub the kids college tuitions i never had to spend was the way hal explained the spectacular bedroom matt could read carabettas thoughts more okay he said whats the deal carabetta pulled himself up straight and met matts gaze defiantly the deal is this whole affair is way more complicated than i was originally led to believe and now there are guns and and bodyguards and security people who may or may not show up while were there and and i dont think what im being paid is worth the risk matt suppressed an explosion without carabetta they really had nothing how much he asked carabetta again peered through the bathroom door another five thousand he said quickly matt had not been told specifically what the original deal with hal was but something his uncle said had him thinking it was around fifteen now carabetta wanted five more twenty thousand not a bad nights work matt flashed on his own anemic bank account which could handle a fivethousanddollar ding but only just then he flashed on armand stevenson and elaine leblanc and dontcallmebob crook and the security men who had rousted him from the mine offices and then attempted to eliminate the slocumbs and finally on bill grimes five thousand and not another penny after that he said i expect to be paid first thing tomorrow no money no action from me regardless of what we find tonight carabetta countered you are really a credit to your profession matt wanted to say youll get your money he said instead they returned to the living room where with a minute nod matt indicated to hal that the deal was done he then motioned nikki into the privacy of the hallway where he held her for a time then kissed her lightly on the mouth thanks she said i was just thinking that its been too long so how much did carabetta try and gouge you for he didnt just try matt replied the man is really a sleazebag but a wellplaced sleazebag at least for our purposes keep reminding me howre you feeling about all this nervous maybe a little scared what about you more angry than anything else i think for my dad for all those other miners for all the humiliation ive had to endure for just trying to do the right thing listen he went on clearly searching for the right words theres really no reason you cant wait here until we get back you mean just hang out on the couch and watch home shopping network while you men tromp off to even the score with the people at the mine and maybe the man who kidnapped me and killed joe now doesnt that just sound like an opportunity id jump at i just you just kissed me nikki cut in that means im going plus i want to make certain you come through this in one piece you and i have some unfinished business when all this is over despite the beauty and sensual comforts of hals home joe kellers terrible death was still too raw they had spent the night in each others arms talking and touching and knowing that soon very soon they would be lovers matts kiss this time was much less inhibited nikki dug her nails into the nape of his neck as she responded well do fine she whispered as they drew away from each other well do just fine minutes later a pair of headlight beams lanced through the darkness of hals driveway this must be our protector matt said gesturing out the window how did you find him anyway unk i know you think of me as lilypure and without fault hal replied but the truth is that after spending much of my life around here i know a few people just as you have your strange little connections around the valley i have mine i spoke to a friend with knowledge of such matters he agreed to arrange for what we needed and a few hours later this is the man who called me what better recommendation could anyone get than that matt said do you even know his name i will soon enough remember nephew we are not hiring this gentleman to prune our rhododendrons i gotcha the twin raps on the front door were like pistol shots magnitudes louder than carabettas had been hal swung the door back revealing a man whose shoulders nearly filled the span and whose massive head barely cleared the overhead frame the man nodded a greeting and stepped into the room his impressive head and flat pinched face reminded matt of a villain in a dick tracy cartoon there was a rather large bruise and healing abrasion over his right eye and a square bandaid patch covering some sort of wound on his left cheek the man we want is the one who did that to him matt was thinking sutcher the man said gruffly vin sutcher his name rhymed with butcher hal and matt had decided they would park in a small public lot at the base of a series of hiking trails from there the walk to the cleft would be half a mile or so over terrain that hal felt fred carabetta clearly the physical weak link of the expedition would be able to negotiate without too much difficulty the tunnel to the cave might be another story but matt felt confident there was enough room for the man even in the tightest passageways they took two cars to the spot hal nikki and carabetta in hals mercedes and matt in vin sutchers grand cherokee matt was surprised to find the man erudite wellread and quite willing to discuss his life and profession sutcher had gone to penn state on a football scholarship but tore up a knee and ended up leaving school after his second year he sold automobiles for a time then insurance finally because of his size and willingness to mix it up he found employment with an agency that provided bodyguards for rock stars and occasionally movie stars as well he traveled a good deal but had chosen a house in the hills just west of belinda as his home base because the hunting and fishing were excellent in the area and he had always liked the privacy it was sheer luck that he happened to be around when hals friend called sutchers choice of weapons included a handgun stuffed in a shoulder holster over his black longsleeved t and some sort of semiautomatic submachine gun which he cradled with a loose familiarity in his right hand matt wondered if he had ever killed or even shot anyone but there was no way he was going to ask regardless he felt much more confident and secure knowing the man was coming along it took half an hour to make the walk to the cleft along an illdefined path hal knew the way though and led the silent singlefile procession carabetta followed hal then nikki matt and finally sutcher im really glad youre here matt said to nikki as they trudged along youre very cute when youre intense she whispered back although they all had flashlights only hal had his turned on and then only as necessary the cloudless night was lit by a silver gibbous moon that was bright enough to illuminate the trail the group crossed the broad steam now familiar to matt and reached the cleft without difficulty okay doctor hal said youre up get us in get us out roger that matt said taking over at the head of the line fred why dont you stay right behind me theres going to be some pretty narrow squeezes and one place where were probably going to have to crawl on our bellies for a few feet but i believe youll make it okay jesus carabetta whined no one said anything about wriggling along on our bellies just keep on thinking about all that money and the citations youre gonna be awarded suitable for lamination itll make you thinner also well be edging our way along some dropoffs just dont pay any attention to them aw christ carabetta said the second time along the damp narrow tunnel was considerably easier for matt than the first he moved silently ahead with some confidence despite at times actually having to hold the hand of a softly cursing carabetta to get him around a drop or across a ledge whether it was his familiarity with the passageway or the distraction caused by being the leader matts claustrophobia was less of a strain than he had expected it would be with surprising ease carabetta made it through the tight passage that required them to drop onto all fours and crawl but at the still narrower one where matt motioned them onto their bellies he balked no fucking way he said loud enough for all of them to hear this is as far as im going you can keep your damn money fred come on matt urged you can make this and after about ten feet you can stand on the way back there are other trails we can take that wont be so narrow provided i can find them no way im staying here mr carabetta come speak with me vin sutcher rasped without questioning the order carabetta worked his way past hal and nikki to confront the giant sutcher bent over and whispered something brief into his ear even in the nearly black tunnel matt thought he could see carabetta blanch all right he said pausing midsentence to clear a bullfrog from his throat but if it looks the least bit like im going to get stuck im going back what did you say to him matt whispered to sutcher after all five of them had negotiated the low schism without major difficulty i told him that if he didnt get moving i was going to rip his arm off the bodyguard replied without a fleck of humor very effective now for the first time matt caught the pungent aroma of the chemical dump four days had passed since he and lewis had penetrated the cavern probably not enough time to empty it even if armand stevenson had decided to do so hiring killers and bribing officials was so much cheaper and more efficient especially with the chief of police already on his payroll matt found himself momentarily wondering about the person man he suspected who had slipped the note about the toxic dump under his door whatever ax the writer had to grind with bc ampc was about to be made razor sharp smell it he whispered oh yes nikki said toluene carabetta opined toluene and maybe creosote cameras ready hal ordered mr sutcher would you please take the point be happy to sutcher said tightening his grip on the submachine gun straight ahead matt said keep your flashlights turned off as much as possible and your voices low if there is any interference itll come from the entrance on the far side cautiously with sutcher now in the lead and hal bringing up the rear the column moved through the narrow stygian tunnel following the increasingly potent chemical smell there matt said not far ahead a faint gray light pierced the darkness go ahead sutcher urged ill be watching for trouble matt led the way into the cavern the rushing underground river the huge threedimensional pyramid of barrels stretching upward twenty feet or more the unpleasant sickly sweet odor the protective gear hanging along one rock wall all seemed unchanged from the way he and lewis had seen it a few days ago using his flashlight he motioned carabetta to move closer and led him then nikki around the perimeter okay matt said lets take some pictures and get some samples rutledge carabetta exclaimed pointing past the barrels whats that lying over there matt never got the chance to answer with a deafening roar brilliant light and a force unlike anything he had ever experienced the two entrances to the cavern simultaneously exploded instantly the entire space filled with acrid smoke and choking dust boulders the size of automobiles and all manner of rock hurled through the air flung sideways matt was slammed viciously against the wall he collapsed onto the floor as dust filled his lungs rocks rained down upon him a basketballsized boulder thudded against his back other chunks buried his legs and pelted his arms with enough force to shatter bone in just moments the explosions were over the pitchblack cave was filled with suffocating silt and the smell of chemicals freshly released from their drums matt lay there his face halfburied in rubble the only way he could get enough breathable air in was to force his mouth and nose against the shoulder of his shirt his ears were ringing mercilessly and he sensed that his nose was bleeding then through the darkness he thought he heard whimpering nikki he tried calling out but his dirtcovered vocal cords barely made a croak he coughed then spat then coughed again until it seemed like some of the grit cleared from his throat he also noted that the pain in his back was bad but not incapacitating probably nothing but bruises there he rubbed his hand across his nose it wasnt broken but it was definitely bleeding how much was hard to tell quickly he tested his arms which seemed intact and his legs which were totally buried beneath many pounds of stone nikki he called out again matt he thought he heard her voice faint and strained from somewhere to his left but he wasnt certain his damaged eardrums muffled the sound but the lack of intense pain made him believe that while the membranes and ear bones were swollen and bruised neither drum had been torn it had to have been nikkis voice he pulled his shirt up over his mouth and nose making breathing much easier with great effort he managed to roll over enough to begin moving debris off his legs nikki he tried once more this time there was no answer the backs of his hands were raw and he felt battered all over but stone by stone he was able to free up his legs it seemed logical that the people who had blown up the cave had counted on the roof collapsing and sealing the whole deal instantaneously clearly since he wasnt permanently pancaked under a few dozen tons of rock that hadnt happened he pulled his legs free and flexed them aches but none of the pain that would have indicated a broken bone given what he had just been through he was as intact as he had any right to be nikki hal anybody the sound barely echoed there was no way to tell how much of the cave how much air was left he rolled onto his hands and knees and crawled over the sharp stones toward where he sensed nikkis voice had come from he hadnt moved more than a few feet when he hit against a body it was a woman lying facedown covered with dust and debris her hair was much longer than nikkis and her body clothed in jeans and a tshirt was very slight not much more than a hundred pounds a girl he thought not a woman he checked for a pulse at the carotid artery in her neck and found one easily at that moment the girl took a breath what in the hell he muttered can you hear me he said into her ear no response gently careful to stabilize her neck as best he could he turned her over reaching through the absolute darkness he brushed her hair and some of the dust off her face oh god he moaned the moment he touched the hard neurofibroma nodules scattered over her face and scalp oh god no chapter the darkness in the cave was total oppressive and for matt claustrophobic as well the fumes were pungent though not caustic in the way that chlorine fumes were at least not yet he sat for a time composing himself breathing through his shirt with the unconscious girl resting beside him clearly armand stevenson and his confederates had chosen to bury the human evidence of their transgressions along with their accusers how many others like this girl were in the cave matt wondered his ears were continuing to buzz unpleasantly but from what he could tell the bleeding from his nose had subsided every few seconds another chunk of rock dropped from someplace in the cavern the roof hadnt caved in but clearly it was unstable for a time matt knelt there listening to the rattle of falling rock unable to shake the image of the delayed collapse of the world trade center towers he was finally able to orient himself by focusing on the churning and splashing of the river which ran behind where the chemicals had been stacked the continuous white noise of the moving water echoed through the midnight blackness and had a strangely calming effect nikki he called out hal from somewhere to his right he was sure he heard a man groaning fred he brushed some more dust and shards of stone from the girls face and hair her narrow face seemed intact although there was no doubt she was badly disfigured poor baby clavicles chest wall arms hands abdomen pelvis legs from what little he could tell she had sustained no major injuries nikki he called again anyone for a few seconds there was only the sound of the river then matt matt its me this response was definitely not his imagination nikkis voice weak but composed came from his left some distance away nikki its matt are you hurt i i hear you but i cant make out your words my ears i know matt said speaking slower louder and more distinctly mine too i asked if you were hurt i i dont think badly my ears are messed up they wont stop ringing i got hit on the head pretty hard too i dont think i was knocked out but im a little dizzy a second concussion matt thought the word was often thrown around casually especially in the er where head injuries werent considered serious by most unless there was a period of unconsciousness x rays showing a fractured skull or a ct scan demonstrating a hemorrhage or brain contusion but he had seen many lives ruined and families torn apart by postconcussion syndromes sometimes with as little trauma as a minor fall or fenderbender he pushed himself up from the stone floor his back and legs throbbed and the backs of his hands were stinging but the discomfort was tolerable especially now that he knew nikki had survived nikki can you stand i think so walk let me see yes yes i can walk wait he cried out suddenly dont move do you have any idea where your flashlight is pardon your flashlight i i was holding it when the blast went off theres so much rubble i have no idea where it might be ill look around and her words dissolved into a fit of coughing pull your shirt over your mouth to breathe it helps nikki just stay where you are and keep talking im going to walk toward your voice well look for the light together matt guessed she was twentyfive or thirty feet away shuffling through boulders arms extended like frankensteins monster he inched his way through the blackness guided by nikkis recitation of a country song he knew well silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine matt twice dropped to all fours to negotiate piles of rock and i dare not drown my sorrow in the warm glow of your hey i found it i think its okay an instant later a beam of light filtered through the suspended silt panning about until it locked on him seconds after that they were together oh baby matt said as they held each other i was so frightened you were hurt or or worse i cant believe they would do this to us he took the light to check her blood was flowing from a gash not far from her healing gunshot wound he pulled off one of his socks and used it to apply pressure to the cut are you okay she asked theres a lot of blood on your face my nose has been bleeding but i dont think anything hit it probably the shock from the blast no bones broken anyplace as far as i can tell weird as it sounds were lucky i think they expected the ceiling of this vault to collapse from the way the rocks keep dropping it still may nikki swung the beam around the void because of the dust visibility was limited what about the others she asked i dont know but theres a girl over there at least i think its a girl and not a woman what shes unconscious i bumped against her while i was crawling around and guess what her face and scalp are covered with neurofibromas matt this is awful could you tell if she was badly hurt i dont think so but shes unconscious and i think i heard a man out there moaning as well hal no idea im worried sick about him wasnt he right behind you from what i remember yes well that would put him someplace over there not where the sounds came from hal hal can you hear me nikki panned the flash along the wall if hal sawyer had been standing behind her he would have been virtually under the entrance from the tunnel which was now an impenetrable pile of huge boulders and debris that extended up to the roof of the cavern i dont see how he could have avoided being buried under that matt said hal hal its matt silence lets try to find him matt they shuffled to the pile and moved a couple of rocks then they looked at each other and shrugged helplessly if he was buried beneath this mass there was nothing they would accomplish by digging except to exhaust themselves he was such a good egg matt said finally eccentric and quirky but a real good guy just the same he was so kind to mom and and he loved me to pieces i know he did i just cant believe this hal dammit hal answer me its matt she put her arms around him and pulled him tightly against her stevenson and those other bastards are going to pay for this he said nikki was reluctant to point out the obvious that at this moment their chances of surviving to make anyone pay for anything seemed remote listen she said lets get back to that girl the dust seemed to be settling a bit making the beam of light more effective the girl was there twenty or so feet away lying on her back still unconscious she was eleven or twelve with long cornsilk hair her narrow distorted face possibly pretty at one time was filthy and battered matt was checking her more thoroughly than he had initially been able to when they heard a groan from off to their right a man lay there supine semiconscious buried from the waist down his head was lolling from side to side and every few seconds his arms flailed impotently at the jagged rocks that pinned him down oh my god look nikki exclaimed not ten feet away from the man lay the lower half of a body mens work boots and overalls protruding from under a huge pile of collapsed rock and not far from him lying faceup only partially buried in rubble was yet another man minimally covered with debris unconscious but clearly breathing nikki rushed to him leaving matt temporarily in darkness oh no matt quick she cried setting the light down to remove dirt and stones from the two hes another one matt hurried over took the flash and knelt down the mans siltcovered face was badly disfigured by neurofibromas probably in his twenties he had a gash and a deep bruise on his throat where a rock had apparently hit his respiration was labored and accompanied by stridor the whooping noise produced when air is drawn in past a significant obstruction well nikki asked hell i dont know except that its a miracle any of us are alive this cave was supposed to be a mass grave for all of us we have at least one person dead and three my uncle vinny and carabetta missing we have three people that we know of who are unconscious that man thrashing around over there looks like he might be badly hurt and this guys breathing doesnt sound good matt reached into the mans hip pocket produced a thin billfold and withdrew his drivers license colin morrissey he read age twentytwo from wells wheres that thirty miles south of here so now we have two with neurofibromas do you think there are more i wouldnt be surprised i cant make much sense of this yet but i do know one thing we have a limited amount of air thats loaded with fumes that are probably toxic and one meager source of light with batteries that could last an hour or a minute not so good nikki said we need to find some more light if your flashlight goes out before we come up with something were finished weve got to find the one i had think we should try and help that poor guy over there first your call lets see if we can free him up hes more awake than the rest after that we can decide whether to help the others or look for your light okay once were oriented lets shut the flashlight off and move the rocks in the dark the man heavyset and balding kept crying out as nikki and matt cleared the fallen rocks off of him they both knew the potential for disaster from his situation pelvis abdomen groin legs spine muscles in addition to fractures and internal injuries there was the possibility of sudden death usually from the release of clots formed in injured legs by the time they had removed enough rubble to pull the man free he was beginning to speak his invectiveladen babble was disjointed and garbled but there was no mistaking his anger fuckin doublecrossers you die you die tracy i love you tracy cant move bastards fuckin doublecrossers hey calm down fella matt said easy does it were doctors were here to help you nikki put the light on my face maybe thatll help another minute passed as first matt and then nikki attempted to get through to the incoherent man it was nikki who succeeded she held her hand under his head and had matt hold the light away so that it illuminated both her face and the victims my name is dr solari she said kindly do you understand doctor he murmured yes whats your name name sid he replied sluggishly shaking his head as if to clear it sid what happened how did you end up here doublecrossed bastards nikki lifted his head slightly and brushed some of the remaining dust from his face he responded to her touch his head stopped moving and his gaze fixed on her sid what do you do who doublecrossed you are you really a doctor i am my legs dont think i can feel my legs matt checked both of the mans legs then looked up at nikki and shook his head grimly well go over you and do what we can she said wh what happened there was an explosion were in a cave where they store chemicals the entrances are sealed off whoever did this meant to kill us but the ceiling hasnt collapsed so here we are we have only this one flashlight so were going to have to keep turning it on and off do you understand there are plenty of flashlights big ones what nikki and matt exclaimed in unison cabinet on other side of river gloves lights gas masks firstaid kit tools sid began coughing spasmodically nikki lifted him and propped him against her knee taking pains not to move the area around his lower thoracic vertebrae where it seemed his spinal cord was compressed or severed who are you nikki asked im a guard here tommy wheres tommy nikki glanced over at the motionless lower body protruding from beneath a ton of rock sid followed her gaze oh shit oh no doublecrossing bastards sonofabitch he had a little kid people from the mine doublecrossed you matt asked eagerly no sid said vehemently it was grimes fucking grimes and some guys what did they pay you to do just look the other way while they worked inside this place i thought they were just going to bury it all because of those guys who showed up here last week no one said nothin about people being in here when it blew especially not us they shot us up with something to knock us out and left us to doc my legs you got to help me nearby the girl and colin morrissey had begun moaning loudly whatever they used on you all must be wearing off nikki said matt we ought to check that cabinet dont leave me sid cried i cant move my legs well be back nikki set him back down and took matts arm as they made their way around the mass of barrels many of which had spilled their oily contents onto the stone floor surprisingly a number of them mostly those at the bottom of the pyramid remained secure why do you suppose grimes knocked them out with an injection and not a bullet in the head nikki asked i suspect he was hedging his bets against the remote possibility that anyone ever dug in here and found us there would be no evidence we were all murdered a tour group maybe or else some environmentalists unfortunate enough to be in the wrong place at the wrong time hell mines and explosions are like thanksgiving and turkey especially this mine the river about ten feet wide flowed from their left to right with a modest current its surface a foot or so below the floor of the cave two flat bridges with rustic wooden railings had been built across it but one of those had been destroyed by several enormous chunks of rock the river was already having difficulty negotiating the obstruction and some water behind the new dam had begun splashing over the stone bank onto the cavern floor the second bridge looked passable if this place begins to fill with water matt said which do you think will happen first we suffocate or we drown were going to find a way out of here dr rutledge she replied firmly any more negative thinking on your part will be dealt with most severely well let me ask you this way do you think we should be focusing our energies and oxygen on getting out of here or on stabilizing everyone whos injured could you just ignore them probably not then why did you ask i was hoping youd talk me into it the cabinet made of hard gray molded plastic was where sid had described fixed to the rock wall it was seven feet high at least that wide and a foot and a half deep it contained four powerful batteryrun lanterns three gas masks surgical masks tools of all kinds rope duct tape what appeared to be an exposure suit and a large fairly wellstocked firstaid kit were in business matt said pulling a surgical mask over his face and handing one to nikki you ready to play doctor lets they tested the lanterns all of which worked and carried them to the others along with the firstaid kit on the way they got a better sense of the condition of the cavern the two entrances perhaps a hundred feet apart were completely sealed by massive amounts of rubble most of the drums of toxic waste though no longer piled in a neat pyramid were still in the center of the cave the ceiling twentyfive feet up was holding leaving them with a good amount of air albeit air heavily tainted with fumes no telling what this stuff is doing to our lungs matt said probably not the greatest of our worries right now where do you want to start colin morrisseys throat trauma looks like potential trouble to me but i suggest we make sure there arent any people we dont know about lying around and take another look for hal vinny and fred at the same time then we can move everyone to one area triage and do what we can the dust and silt were settling but each of their steps sent plumes of it floating back into the air the cries of pain had increased and with them the sense of urgency matt and nikki set the equipment down next to the young girl who was beginning some purposeless movements then each carrying a lantern they began picking their way around the cave scanning the rocks for bodies over there matt exclaimed after they had covered just a few yards fred carabetta lay semiconscious on his belly face turned to one side pinned under a mound of rock that extended from his midback to beyond his feet there was blood trickling out of his left ear and what they could see of his face looked like a battered prizefighters help me help me he was moaning over and over fred its matt can you hear me hear you help me should we try and get him out now or check around for others nikki asked we need more hands matt we can only do what we can do then lets try to free him up fred were going to get these rocks off of you the pile holding carabetta down was considerably smaller and easier to move than the one that had covered the paralyzed guard still by the time they had removed enough to free him both were perspiring heavily and working at sucking in air carabetta cried out in pain as they rolled him over the two of them winced at what they saw his black sweat pants and shirt were sodden with blood most of it oozing steadily from a wound to the right of his groin with all these rocks there isnt even enough space to kneel down here matt said lets try to haul him over near the others and work on him there ill do my best fred were going to pull you over to where we have enough room to help you out moving the man was no small feat ultimately success involved nikki and matt each seizing a wrist and dragging him a foot or so at a time past the girl who was now randomly moving all her extremities to the area where the security guard and the man with the belinda syndrome lay exhausted from the effort and from breathing through the surgical masks they stood for nearly a minute hands on knees gasping for breath no more sundaes for fred matt panted at that moment with a bansheelike screech a figure flew from the darkness off a tall pile of rubble onto nikki sending her hurtling backward shattering one of the lanterns nikki cried out in pain as the attacker a stocky woman quickly set upon her hands around her throat from the remaining illuminated light matt could easily discern the dense growth of neurofibromas virtually covering the womans face he dove at her hitting her shouldertoshoulder and tackling her onto the cave floor growling and spitting she flailed at his face and arms landing several effective blows matt hit her in the face first with an open hand then full force with his fist it was the first time he had ever punched someone that way in his life stunned the woman sagged backward matt set his knee across her throat tore off her cotton work shirt and used one sleeve to tie her hands tightly together and the other to bind them to her ankles then he used adhesive tape from the firstaid kit to immobilize her more effectively you okay he asked turning to nikki my left ankle she groaned in obvious pain it went over when she hit me are you hurt anyplace else not badly he knelt by her and examined the injury swelling had already begun across the outside of the ankle in addition there was impressive tenderness over the lateral malleolus the bony prominence if the end of her fibula hadnt broken ligaments had surely torn either way her mobility was to all intents gone nikki moaned softly as matt wrapped the ankle with gauze then he activated a bag of chemical ice and secured it against the joint with an ace bandage a second ace completed the bulky splint with great effort nikki rolled onto her hands and knees lets get to work on fred she said i dont know how much longer he can stay alive you can do this i can try she replied wincing im going to get that duct tape and do the other two while you check fred out i dont want a repeat of tarzana here when they wake up jesus what a mess were in moving slowly and painfully on her hands and knees nikki propped two lanterns on piles of rock took two pairs of rubber gloves from an as yet unopened box and set to work using a bandage scissors and her hands she cut and tore away carabettas clothing if he wasnt in shock yet he was close filthy pale bloodied and sweating with a pulse that was ominously rapid and faint there were four or five lacerations over his fleshy body and treetrunk legs which were still oozing crimson but the real trouble was a deep threeinch rent in his groin where dark blood was flowing freely breathless matt returned from his task arterial he asked i think venous youre bigger how about some pressure matt set a wad of gauze pads over the wound and leaned down on it with all the strength he could muster carabettas thick layer of saffroncolored fat made it difficult to apply enough force blood continued seeping from beneath the gauze meanwhile colin morrisseys stridor was worsening we need more hands matt said again as nikki crawled over to check on the man we have what we have she said over her shoulder matt this guys in trouble too i dont think hes going to make it too much longer without a tracheotomy well i cant maintain enough pressure to stop freddys bleeding my guess hes torn his saphenous vein so what can we do get some narrow gauze bandage underneath the saphenous and tie it off have you done anything like that before if you count my cat cadaver in comparative anatomy i have you well between my year of surgery and my job cutting up the unfeeling i know the anatomy pretty well that settles it i firstassist and you take a crack at it what about colin right now hes breathing if we dont stop this bleeding freddys toast okay okay while matt kept pressure on the wound nikki opened the firstaid kit and extracted a roll of oneinch gauze and a pair of forceps the pointytipped kind used for removing splinters any snaps matt asked referring to selflocking hemostats i don t see any a scalpel nope novocain xylocaine you wish wait there is a disposable scalpel ah something to be grateful for fred can you hear me help me matt abandoned the notion of a medical explanation he leaned close to the mans ear fred this is going to hurt he said emphatically nik hows the ankle numb as long as i dont make any quick movements its bearable i dont think im going to be able to stand on it though well i can keep pressure on this and hold the lantern but youll have to serve as your own scrub nurse im afraid she said suddenly i know matt replied i wouldnt trust you if you werent just do your best and do it fast i think i need to open up the area better just do it nikki shrugged and made a deep fourinch incision at right angles to the middle of the gash blood oozed from the skin margins of the cut and from the bright yellow fat beneath it oh jesus carabetta howled as the slice was made oh fuck at the mans scream nikki pulled back but matt shook his head you can do it he said firmly okay she replied put pressure below the cut a lot of pressure look it is the saphenous vein almost chopped through its a miracle hes still alive youre the miracle tie it off top and bottom then we can move on to he who cannot inhale behind them they could hear colins labored breathing getting worse if that guy and the girl are anywhere near as crazy as tarzana was well have our hands full when they wake up nikki said this guy then that guy then the girl matt said right nikki used her fingers and the blunt end of the forceps first to spread the tissue around and under the torn vessel then she forced the ends of two twelveinch lengths of gauze through the tunnel she had created with each movement fred cried out but his response to the pain was getting feebler a large percentage of his blood volume was in his clothes and on the dusty floor unless his bleeding was stopped he might have a minute or two before drifting into unconsciousness for good maybe a little more maybe less youre doing great matt encouraged get a knot in that lower tie and ill switch the pressure to stop the backflow for someone who hasnt touched a live patient in years youre pretty darn good come on baby nikki murmured to the vein as she gently worked the second gauze tie into place dont tear apart on me now youve got it youve got it i hope so because here goes nikki pulled the gauze tight and a moment later matt released the pressure he had maintained through most of the procedure there was some oozing from the incision and the gash but the area around the lacerated vein was dry the saphenous was the vein usually harvested for cardiac bypass grafts collateral veins would take over the job of returning blood to the heart if carabetta made it through this episode and out of the cave both enormous ifs he might be left with little more than some periodic ankle swelling nicely done matt said getting around that vein without ripping it in two was really something at that moment colin morrisseys breathing seemed to become even more labored we might need to trach him nikki said can you go check him again i would but fred here still needs pressure on this wound ill do that a voice beside them said an older woman battered as the rest of them had crawled over from some part of the cave they had yet to inspect you go check the boy she said ill do my best here my name is ellen ellen kroft chapter nikki knew her ankle was broken she had felt the crack of bone and the explosion of pain when the woman matt was calling tarzana or pounds blindsided her now she simply bit at the inside of her lip and did her best to cope with the pain they were in a fearsome predicament with a finite air supply and no obvious way out of the cave the last thing the others needed was to worry about her the newcomer ellen kroft essentially uninjured kept pressure on fred carabettas wound while matt used his ear as a stethoscope to examine the lungs of colin morrissey i think hes moving enough air he said at least for the moment his coma seems to be getting a little lighter too lets hope hes sane when he wakes up with his larynx swollen nearly shut i dont think hes going to pose much of a problem hows your leg fine nikki said perhaps a bit too quickly adding it aches some think you can put weight on it i i doubt it i watched you working on this man from over there ellen said gesturing toward the darkness to her right youre both doctors im matt rutledge an internist from belinda and this is nikki solari from boston shes a pathologist how many others are there in here besides us do you know of any no i was tied up here for a time then injected with something that knocked me out when i came to i was covered with dust and pieces of rock i assume grimes untied me while i was unconscious then blew up the cave hes the police chief here oh we know who he is you assume right about him in addition to that guy and the four of us there are two people a woman and a girl with lumps on their faces like his they dont seem to be badly hurt but the woman is pretty wild weve tied her up for now the girls still unconscious matt lowered his voice then there are two security guards from the mine over there one of thems dead the other probably paralyzed and two more men who came in with us are missing nikki added do you know why grimes did this to us ellen asked i dont know why he included you matt replied but as you can see the local mine has been illegally storing toxic chemicals in here we were about to expose the whole business grimes is in bed with the mine owners with kathys fatal prion disease not adequately accounted for nikki had never felt completely comfortable with matts contention about the mine not to muddy the water she said but what matt didnt say was that a number of people from this area have developed a syndrome of horrible facial lumps and progressive paranoia matt thinks it has something to do with these chemicals im not as certain about that as he is do you have something to do with the mine no ive never been in this area before then why well believe it or not i came because a man broke into my home in glenside maryland and swore he would kill my granddaughter unless i did what he wanted me to i was able to learn who he might be and traced him back here to tullis but i needed to get a look at him before i could be certain he was the one your police chief was supposed to help me do that and also take a statement from me but we never got that far i dont understand matt said turning back to check on morrissey who was the man you came about his name was sutcher vinyl sutcher stunned nikki and matt stared at one another perhaps youd better tell us more nikki said fred carabetta had lapsed into unconsciousness his steady sonorous breathing formed the background for ellens account of her place on the blueribbon omnivax commission of lynette marquands politically motivated pledge to the american people of her terrifying encounter with vinyl sutcher and finally of the fruits of rudy petersons dogged pursuit of the truth behind the outbreaks of lassa fever for a time after she had finished nothing was said matts eyes closed as he spun through the kaleidoscope of his memories searching to connect with something something he knew was there suddenly he looked up at the two women his expression grim the lassa fever vaccine was tested here he said what i dont know exactly when sometime between when i left for college and when i came back to practice a drug company paid all the doctors in the valley for each patient they could convince to get the shot after i came back to go into practice here a bunch of the older docs were joking about it one day in the lunchroom at the hospital here none of them had ever even seen a case of lassa fever in their lives and now with a bunch of the town immunized none of them ever would that was the gist of what they were laughing about a couple of them didnt even know what the disease was even though they signed up a number of their patients and gave them the shot i actually think i remember them saying that they got a hundred dollars a head and that some of them shared that money with the patients it was all perfectly legal as far as i know docs and patients are both paid all the time for participating in research protocols or drug testing i dont know how many in the valley were given the test shots four hundred ellen said four hundred of all ages i saw the summaries of the field trial but i never noted down where it was conducted how many years ago nikki asked i dont know matt replied maybe ten oh god she exclaimed what matt dont you see prions the latent period between exposure to the germ and development of symptoms can be as much as ten years or even longer thats where the belinda syndrome is coming from from the vaccine not from these barrels of poison the tissue culture cells that the virus was grown on must have been contaminated with prions right from the start it seems likely they would have used monkey tissue if so maybe the monkeys that the cells came from originally were infected but you were right all along about the mine storing toxic waste you were right and you were passionate about what you believed grimes knew about this dump and probably sent you that note to keep pushing you in this direction so you wouldnt ever search for the truth about the cases you discovered but why would he do that he must have a stake in the vaccine if he does ellen said hes on the verge of becoming an extremely wealthy man lasaject is one of the most expensive components of omnivax in the next year especially when older children and adults are immunized in addition to newborns tens of millions of doses are going to be administered whats this about prions what are they the germs that cause mad cow disease and other neurologic illnesses as well nikki said we think theyre responsible for the condition that man has and also the woman who attacked me and the girl over there the symptoms dont appear for years after exposure and theres essentially no test to see if someone without symptoms has contracted the disease you think everyone who gets the vaccine will get infected with prions i doubt it those who get the disease probably have some sort of genetic predisposition to the effects of the prions in britain despite the hundreds of thousands of people who ate contaminated beef relatively few cases of mad cow disease have been reported how many of the original four hundred do you think have developed prion disease nikki shrugged lets see she said matt and i have encountered six cases including these three if say an additional six cases have disappeared thanks to the handiwork of grimes and his men that would make twelve three percent ellen said that may be higher than with mad cow disease matt said but the jury is still out on the rest of those exposed because we dont know how variable the latency period of the disease is and the british ate the germ these people had it injected three percent at a minimum ellen said thats terrible do either of you know the date and time right now the second matt said checking his watch onethirty am why because later today at three oclock this afternoon i think the first lady is going to preside over a live televised ceremony featuring the secretary of health and human services giving a fourdayold girl the first official shot of omnivax shes going to be inoculated at a neighborhood health center in the anacostia section of dc immediately after that first shot pediatricians all over the country will begin giving omnivax to their patients the vaccine is already in their refrigerators and probably none of those kids will get sick immediately nikki said glumly therell be no warning that anything is wrong oh some will get sick ellen said a percentage of children getting vaccinated inevitably get sick some of their reactions are serious some of them even fatal the pediatricians and scientists and drug manufacturers tell us their lives are a tradeoff for the greater good i wonder how they would feel if it was their childs life the real question now is one that has troubled me and others about inoculations right along who will be able to say what will happen five years after a child receives her immunizations or ten especially now that theyre all rolled up into omnivax these three can matt said grimes must have realized the vaccine was flawed with all that money on the line rather than come clean about it or chance someone like us seeing enough cases to piece things together he decided to eliminate everyone who has developed the prion disease that gives him ten years before the next wave of spongiform encephalopathy and neurofibromas hits a wave maybe nikki said but possibly a tsunami nikki you told me kathy was convinced men were following her trying to kill her well i think they might have been i believe grimes tracked down every single patient from the original vaccine test group the three in here may be the last of them with the syndrome we have to stop the supervaccine ellen said ellen nikki replied gently grimes somehow arranged for your friend sutcher to sign on as our bodyguard im almost certain he was the one who threw the switch that blew up the entrances to this place its a miracle the ceiling hasnt collapsed clearly it was supposed to but were sealed in here way inside the mountain theres no way out there is because there has to be ellen countered with grim conviction i hope youre right nikki said weve been around this cavern some and nothings apparent to us i think you can try letting up on the pressure now ellen did as she was asked save for a small amount of oozing the gaping wound below carabettas groin remained dry in silence nikki packed it with sterile gauze and partially closed it with adhesive tape the osha investigator reacted to the painful procedure with nothing more than a muted groan ellens right matt exclaimed his fist clenched theres a way out because there has to be theres too much at stake for us just to sit here waiting for a rescue we know isnt going to happen you want us to dig out matt some of those chunks of rock weigh hundreds or even thousands of pounds i cant even walk without help well then ellen and i will do it maybe the girl when she comes to and even tarzana if we can get her to calm down what choice do we have maybe there is one nikki said the stream back there its coming from someplace and going someplace matt latched on to the notion immediately i think it enters right by the cleft where we came in he said a hint of excitement in his voice but thats a hell of a long way underground and most of it steeply uphill from here i doubt anyone could make it maybe the way out is in the other direction then matt looked from one of the women to the other as he tried to imagine what such a journey might be like and how it might end he recalled the guttightening panic he experienced crawling through the low tunnels what would it be like being carried along through a narrow pitchblack waterfilled tube what if he got stuck what if the passage became too small and he couldnt back up could there possibly be a worse way to die than to drown pinned between rock walls in an underground river how long would it take before he finally lost consciousness lets go take a look he heard himself say without asking permission he bent down and lifted nikki in his arms then with ellen carrying a lantern and another one left illuminated to comfort and orient the others they made their way through the rubble around the barrels to the river nikki wrapped her arms around matts neck and pressed her cheek tightly against his thanks for the lift stranger she said as he set her down on her good leg and she braced herself against the railing of the bridge twerent nothin maam he tipped an imaginary stetson then knelt and peered down at the inky churning water to their left the river entered the cavern through a narrow opening a foot and a half at the most between the surface and the rock ten feet toward them were the remains of the other bridge on the downstream side to their right the opening was even smaller maybe a foot he reached his hand down and confirmed what he already knew the water was damn cold he cast about for some way to measure the depth and settled on one of the railings from the shattered bridge the piece between three and four feet long struck bottom just before the end would have vanished a good sign i can do this he said aware of the ball of fear that was materializing in his chest i should go ellen said im smaller than you are and i swim at the y four times a week even after just a short time together matt had little doubt that ellen kroft had the tenacity to give the escape attempt a hell of a go but he was younger and stronger and no less motivated these woods and mountain people can be pretty inhospitable he said especially in the middle of the night you may still get your chance if theres no sign of me in three or four hours you might want to try going the other way thatll be up to you but ill have you know there is little to worry about i was a junior lifeguard at the y in that case ill wait ellen said youre going to make it i am matt put his arms around nikki and held her close you want me to carry you back to your patients he asked ellen and i will get back to them okay she said sniffing back some tears matt im frightened i i dont want you to go matt kissed her at first gently then with intensity i can think of a few things id rather be doing myself he whispered but like ellen said im going to make it because i have to he sensed there wasnt as much conviction in his voice as he had intended the knot of fear beneath his breastbone was nearing the size of a bowling ball he stared down again at the river then over at the slim opening above the surface where it reentered the mountain in college a mind game he and his roommates had played from time to time centered around what they would do what they would feel if somehow they learned precisely when they were going to die now it felt as if he might actually be in a position to know again the questions rattled through his mind was there any other way any other reasonable possibility of escape for them if he became wedged how much time would it take before he lost consciousness how long could he hold his breath what did it feel like to drown the revolver he had taken from grimess massive associate was nestled in the pocket of his sweat pants the weapon might prove helpful if he ever made it out and then got into trouble he knew enough about handguns to feel confident it would fire after being submerged for a short time provided he remembered to empty the water out of the stubby twoinch barrel before pulling the trigger if he got trapped it was doubtful hed get the chance to use it on himself more questions was there anything else that might be useful to take better to remove his shoes or leave them on hyperventilate or just go for it matt knew that he was stalling he galvanized himself by imagining the terrible loss of life down the road should their suspicions about lasaject and spongiform disease be true holding that thought he slipped over the rocky edge and into the chilly water nikki leaned down and touched her fingertips to his ill see you soon she said he walked chestdeep toward the opening in the rock once there he took several deep breaths and looked back over his shoulder you bet you will he said with that he took a final lungfilling draught ducked below the surface of the ebony river and pushed off downstream chapter the burning in matts chest the first sensation of air hunger began after just fifteen or twenty seconds of swimming beneath the surface of the chilly pitchblack water his awkward swimming became even more uncoordinated fearing that if he tried to break the surface he would encounter only the ceiling of his tomb he pulled himself ahead for another twenty seconds the fire in his lungs was becoming unbearable terrified he reached overhead his hands broke water but then almost immediately with his elbows still bent and his feet scraping along the bottom his fingers touched rock there was some air space above him though it was difficult to be certain how much battling a horrible smothering sensation he pinched his nose closed tilted his head back as far as he could planted his feet on the bottom and pushed himself up his face was level with his forearm when it broke water there was not enough room for him to stand straight up but there was a four or fiveinch space with his forehead pressed upward against the rock he took half a dozen grateful breaths of stale heavy air next he lowered himself until his eyes were just above the waters surface and slowly turned degrees the darkness behind him was intense and absolute it was doubtful nikki and ellen had already left the bridge so he concluded that he had either swum farther than he reckoned or that the river had turned sharply the cold water flowed steadily past his face he worked his way around again so that the current was behind him then tilted back so he could breathe once more even pinching his nose shut with his forehead pressed tightly against the ceiling water still sloshed into his mouth making it hard to get air in consistently fingers of panic infinitely colder than the water squeezed at his throat he was alive but nearly immobilized by fear the oppressive claustrophobic sensation was worse than hed expected much worse there was absolutely no way he could go on he had to get back back to where he could straighten up back to where there was more space to breathe back to nikki he struggled unsuccessfully to swing around again but his strength seemed gone the current though not that forceful kept pushing him downstream lifting his feet off the stony bottom and dragging him underwater with effort he could wedge himself between the floor and roof of the tunnel but only for ten seconds at a time before the current won out aware of little beyond the hideous impotence of being confined he floated on an outcropping of rock struck his hand and forehead with surprising force dazing him momentarily the walls of the tube scraped at his arms the energy it took just to hold himself in place quickly had him gasping he simply couldnt take it anymore he had to stand up straight damn you grimes matt braced himself once more and shut his eyes tightly vision was useless here anyhow he calmed himself down some by imagining that there was a cave just ahead a vast cavern unlimited air space to move space to turn around and stand space to think slowly with his head dragging against the ceiling he lowered his mouth and nose below the surface and took a controlled step downriver then another and still another he sensed his pulse begin to slow and his thoughts to focus the icy fingers loosened their grip every six or seven steps he paused long enough to tilt his head back and suck in a few more gulps of air emboldened he actually dropped down beneath the surface and propelled himself forward with several breaststrokes however this time when he broke water he could straighten up even less than before and the air space had become reduced by half two inches maybe three there was the chance for only a couple of incomplete breaths before the current pushed him ahead another few feet and the space disappeared completely with less than full lungs he dropped down leveled off and began to swim forward again this time desperately and with all his strength twice he tried to break through the surface twice he was met by rock this was it this was the end the current was increasing now as well and turbulence was becoming an additional problem frantically he clawed through the churning water trying to stabilize his body his lungs were afire once more and each heartbeat was a shellburst inside his skull the walls of the tunnel seemed to be closing together tearing at him as he tumbled past dont breathe hang on at the instant he had to inhale his face broke the surface of the water coughing and gagging he struggled to adjust to the now powerful current trying to keep himself upright as he sucked in some of the dense air from what he sensed might be a small cave or even a cavern but his weakness and merciless coughing made regaining control impossible the river had widened and become shallower no more than three feet deep it churned ahead at intense speed through the pitchblack space matt tried to scramble to the righthand bank but water roiled about him forcing him under then flipping him over like a rag doll twice he was slammed into rocks protruding from the bottom over the years he had rafted a number of west virginias rivers traversing dozens of rapids either by oar or swimming the goal either way was to avoid boulders and the technique when in the water was to navigate feet first in a nearsitting position using ones arms as rudders constantly being hammered by rocks he attempted to establish that position but in the dark with no visual cues and no warning of an approaching boulder he had little chance sputtering on aspirated water he careened helplessly down a steep slope the swirling foaming river seemed to be moving closer and closer to vertical and now he could hear a roar echoing off the rock the roar of falling water he tumbled on slamming against the stony bottom and one boulder after another his arms which he was using to protect his head and face were absorbing a fearsome pounding his wind was gone his consciousness was waning and his lungs were filling with water suddenly what had been a slope became a drop weightless and airborne he hurdled over the precipice he hit the shallow pool below awkwardly and with great force pitching forward his forehead smacked against a jagged rock pain exploded through his brain from the impact an instant later there was nothing for fifteen minutes nikki and ellen stood silently by the bridge a lantern fixed on the opening where the river left the cavern im frightened for him nikki said finally i understand why that was a very brave thing he did he has claustrophobia he told me so himself the river has to come out someplace he can do it you dont know ellen put her arm around nikkis shoulders sorry i was just trying to sound positive i know how awful this must be for you its terrible for me too sorry to have popped off nikki said nikki what matt chose to do was right you and i both know that as things stand we dont have much of a chance here im going to wait a couple of hours and if nothings happened and we cant think of anything else im going to try and make it out of here maybe going upstream are you ready to go back and check on the others nikki peered toward the narrow slit between the rivers surface and the ceiling of the tunnel the lantern beam sparked off the water then vanished into the darkness reluctantly she picked up the light and lay her arm around ellens shoulders her ankle was throbbing with even slight movements but it really didnt matter she had always done pretty well with pain youre a very good person she said as she hobbled and hopped back toward where colin morrissey lay as are you ellen replied her arm around nikkis waist as are you the girl her flaxen hair matted and filthy was sitting beside morrissey stroking his hand nikki cringed at the fibromas that distorted what might have once been a pretty face morrissey whose face was even more disfigured than the girls was still unconscious and not moving air at all well the stridor a sign that at least there was some airflow was reduced to barely audible wheezing hes dead the girl said in a distant singsong voice that was devoid of emotion no no hes not nikki replied kneeling next to her my names nikki im a doctor this is ellen she teaches school whats your name sara jane tinsley are ya gonna help him no fear no anxiety no questions about what had happened to her or where they were now nikki decided not to press the issue unless the girl asked pointedly clearly shock and denial were at work along with the residual effect of whatever drug she had been given and maybe even the spongiform disease that was probably eating away at her brain just as well nikki thought the less aware the girl was of their circumstances the better im going to try sara jane she said ah think hes dead dead dead no see hes br nikki stopped in midsentence morrisseys wheezing was gone his contused swollen throat had finally closed entirely she checked his pulse which was weaker than it had been but still present from this instant until irreparable brain damage she had three to four minutes to bypass the obstruction and deliver some oxygen to his bloodstream almost in spite of herself she hesitated her mind unable to get past the likelihood that morrissey already had an irreparable progressive brain disease rapidly though that notion gave way to thoughts of kathy wilson and hal sawyer of joe keller and the dead miners and of the other cases of the belinda syndrome that grimes and his crew had probably already dealt with and suddenly all of her anger all of her frustration and fear became focused on this young man innocent of anything more malevolent than doing what his doctor and his mother recommended a decade ago colin morrissey was not going to die not if she could help it silently nikki cursed herself for not making preparations in advance for an emergency tracheotomy she had been too wrapped up in their predicament and her pain to think clearly and possibly she had also been influenced by the hopelessness of the untreatable disease that she believed was ravaging the mans brain she reminded herself that hindsight was always what had happened had happened what she needed to deal with now was this moment ellen im going to have to get some sort of airway into him ill need your help just tell me what to do nikki tipped the young mans head back straightening his windpipe morrissey responded with a single surprisingly effective breath regaining the precious seconds that had been lost since his last one in nikkis mind the fourminute clock was reset please keep his head in this position she said do you by any chance have a pen or anything else thats hollow im afraid not sara jane im going to do some things to help this man if i can there may be some bleeding from his neck ah seen blood the girl said looking about at the cave as if for the first time there was no more time to explain the skin above colin morrisseys collarbones was retracting inward as his lungs struggled unsuccessfully to suck in air nikki grabbed the firstaid kit and searched through it frantically the disposable scalpel she had used on carabetta was there along with a pair of bandage scissors that she could use as spreaders now she needed something round hollow and sturdy something wide enough to allow enough air through but not so big that it tore the trachea apart a largebore needle would buy her a little more time and a long pen cap would be perfect acutely aware of the passing seconds she dumped the entire kit onto the stone floor a cc syringe still in its sterile wrapper had been buried beneath some bandages perfect were in business she said nikki discarded the plunger and used the bandage scissors to cut off the end of the barrel where the needle would have attached the inchandahalflong hollow tube was as good as she could have hoped for pain shot from her ankle as she shifted so that she was hunched over morrisseys swollen discolored throat ellen clumsily tried to adjust the light while maintaining the neck extension nikki required sara jane she said finally can you shine this lantern right here on this spot ah kin do thet good girl we need you sara jane be steady nikki had no idea how much of the four minutes had elapsed but there would be no stopping for any reason not on my watch she whispered as she focused in not on my watch she located the spot just above morrisseys larynx that she felt represented his cricothyroid membrane the best place to make her incision if she was wrong she would make do but she wasnt going to hesitate and she was damn well not going to screw up a dozen or more had already died to make grimes and his people rich hundreds maybe thousands more were in danger if they succeeded in getting their vaccine onto the market but not this man at least not now using the precious scalpel keeping it parallel with the cartilaginous rings of the trachea she made a stab wound through the skin and straight down through the windpipe instantly a bloody froth bubbled out reflexively morrissey coughed spattering nikkis shirt and chin the drug he had been given was wearing off his consciousness was returning deftly mindless of the blood nikki inserted the scissors into the incision and spread them to open up the hole then she slid the plastic tube down into the trachea there was a whistling gurgling sound as the first rush of air entered the mans lungs quickly his breathing calmed minutes later colin morrissey lifted one arm and soon after that his eyes fluttered open two more hours passed as ellen and sara jane tended to their four patients fred carabetta remained comatose although he seemed to respond a bit when cold river water was sponged over his face and lips sid the guard lay nearby alternately sobbing and cursing he was clearly paraplegic and now was woefully aware of that fact the woman who had attacked nikki remained trussed up with tape she slept much of the time and rattled on incoherently when she was awake seemingly mindless of their predicament sara jane crawled from the woman to morrissey and back comforting them sponging their foreheads holding their hands and even singing to them theyre lak me she said in one of the rare instances when she spoke to ellen and nikki theyre jes lak me nikki had insisted that morrisseys hands be taped securely to his belt to prevent him from pulling the tube from his makeshift tracheotomy now exhausted and more apprehensive each minute she lay on the dusty floor propped against a large boulder her injured throbbing leg elevated on a pile of stones there was nothing more she could do now than wait horrible visions kept impinging on her mind visions of matt his body wedged forever between two rocks his limbs wafting lifelessly in the black water in addition the sickly sweet air seemed to be getting thicker and harder to breathe was it vanishing already not with a bang but a whimper not with a bang as she lay there nikki marveled at ellen who remained in almost constant motion tending to the others speaking cheerfully and hopefully with them and with sara jane periodically she would return to where nikki lay to assure her that her patients were okay and that matt was going to make it and so were they on this trip however she had no such message for the first time tension etched her face im going to try the river she said what i wont go downstream but i have to try something its been almost three hours and i think we might be running low on air do you think you can manage without me what difference does it make nikki stopped herself from saying ill do what i can do she said instead you dont think he made it out do you ellen sat beside her and took her hands i dont know what i think right now except that we cant just sit back and let them win for one thing we both have new men in our lives i want to see how that turns out for me and for another in just a few hours that vaccine is going to be the standard of care pediatricians all over the country have been primed by the publicrelations people from the pharmaceutical houses and the dear president and his wife i wouldnt be surprised if a couple of thousand doses of the stuff get administered by sunset today youre right nikki said pushing herself up weve got to keep trying you said youre a good swimmer a fish let me hop you over sara jane and ill do fine here i know you will both women were breathing harder from the trip across the cavern than they might have expected no comment was necessary the supply of oxygen was definitely dwindling nikki watched as ellen made her way around the pile of wood and rubble that had once been the second bridge and lowered herself into the water this was one hell of a woman she was thinking courageous intelligent resilient and kind precisely the sort of person she would like to be in her sixties the notion of even reaching sixty brought a rueful smile several hours had passed since matt headed off it was doubtful that he had made it out of the mountain and now what little remained of their hope for survival rested with a wisp of a woman who was nearly twice his age ellen would not only have to find a way out of the mountain swimming upstream but she would have to avoid grimes and his gunmen find people who could and would help and make it back to the cavern before it became an airless tomb the chances of her pulling all that off were slim indeed but slim wasnt none lantern in hand nikki settled down on the bank and waited her wait was not a lengthy one not five minutes after ellen had paddled into the pitchblack tunnel she came floating slowly back feet first facedown in the water nikki scrambled onto her hands and knees and reached for ellens blouse the fabric slipped from her hand ignoring the stunning pain from her ankle she pushed off the rocky bank in a clumsy dive and wrapped her arms around the older womans waist just before they reached the second bridge holding tightly nikki grabbed a fistful of ellens hair and pulled her face clear of the water then she braced herself against the bridge and managed to set her one good foot on the bottom the river lapped by just beneath her chin inch by painful inch drawing on a reserve of strength that surprised her nikki pushed ellen upward until she was sprawled out prone on the bridge her legs dangling down into the water then crying out in pain she hauled herself onto the bank and crawled over to where ellen lay a single downward thrust on both sides of her back cleared much of the water from ellens lungs a second thrust and she began breathing on her own sputtering and coughing reflexively in less than a minute she began to come around for some time she lay that way her chest heaving rocks she said finally tunnel was blocked by rocks another minute passed before she spoke again i tried to move them foot got caught couldnt get free water got down my easy nikki said cradling her head in her lap easy you gave it a great try just relax and catch your breath im just grateful you made it back here it was many minutes before ellen could push herself up still violently coughing out river water god but that was awful she said the rocks collapsed on me i couldnt get my leg out nikki hauled herself up using the bridge railing the two women soaked and shivering held each other tightly then ellen pulled away where are you going nikki asked up on that pile of rock ellen replied gesturing toward what remained of the entrance nikki and the others had used send sara jane up to help me move some of that stuff nikki started to protest then merely shrugged and nodded dead waiting around helplessly was no different than dead trying chapter matts first awareness was the smell of motor oil his second was that he was alive and cold he was in a large shed of some sort lying in his sodden clothes on a bed of filthy rags the walls were creosoted wood the bare bulb dangling overhead was unlit but thin gray light filtered in through a footsquare screencovered window near the peak of the ceiling piled not far from him were covered plastic buckets of what looked like chemicals and large unmarked paper sacks of what might have been seeds or fertilizer there were gardening tools in one corner of the coarse wood floor several gaspowered weed whackers hanging on the wall and a goodsized partially dissected motor underneath them it wasnt until he tried to move that he realized his left wrist was handcuffed to a ushaped pipe that seemed to have been built through the wall of the shed for precisely that purpose he peered about again trying to get a sense of who his captors might be a pulsating pain encircled his head like a bandanna that had been knotted too tightly his stomach reacting to the odors and his dizziness was sending acrid jets of bile into his throat his watch was gone as was the pistol he had shoved into his pocket the backs of his hands were scraped raw and coated with clotted blood there was no traffic noise from outside but twice over fifteen minutes or so he heard a motorcycle rumble away two different ones he guessed both harleys bit by painful bit memories of his devastating trip down the underground river crystallized help he cried out hey someone help me he waited for a reply then yelled again tentatively the door across from him opened and a slightly built woman in her twenties peeked in and put her finger to her lips she had badly spiked purple hair dense black eye shadow and piercings through her nose brows and lower lip her black leather pants were frayed and dusty as were her black t and leather vest quiet she whispered urgently theyll tend to you when theyre ready but i need to get the woman had already pulled away and closed the door behind her matt waited a few minutes and then began hollering again this time when the woman reappeared she had a child on her hip a boy two years old filthy and frail with a sallow complexion thick greenish mucus draining from both nostrils and a deep nasty cough she tossed matt a tattered brown army blanket look i told you to shut up she said still in a pressured whisper they aint much likelihood they aint gonna kill you but yellin like that an disturbin the children will take care a what little chance you got the woman moved to go but this time hesitated when he spoke wait please im a doctor he said quickly my names matt rutledge dr matt rutledge from belinda i dont know how i got here or even where i am but ive got to get away and get some help my friends are trapped in a mine cavein and theyre going to die you aint no doctor she said they said you had a gun doctors dont carry guns i can explain that look your boy there has a bad sinus infection and probably a throat infection too ill bet he isnt eating or sleeping well he should be checked over by a doctor and soon he needs antibiotics we dont go to no doctors i can take care of him i can get you the medicine he needs whats your name the womans eyes narrowed becky she said finally this heres samuel an dont go callin him sam neither his daddy gets mighty angry at that well im a really good doctor becky and i can get samuel better just let me go and get some help for my friends then ill be back to take care of him indecision flickered across beckys face but then just as swiftly vanished i did that an theyd never find all the pieces of me she said you jes lay still an keep quiet if yer not a doctor bassll kill you quickern you kin snap yer fingers an if you are hell most likely do you anyway now shut up but this time the door slammed shut becky please matt called out there was no response he looked up at the small window trying to get a sense of the time of day how long had he been gone his damp clothes and the freshly clotted blood suggested it hadnt been all that long but he couldnt be certain the handcuffs were policedepartment grade and put on way too tight to slip out of he set his feet against the wall grasped the copper pipe with both hands and tried to pull it loose the futile effort sent a fusillade exploding through his head frustrated he sank back onto the oily rags and kicked the walls until his strength was gone there had to be a way out waiting for bass or whoever was supposed to kill him did not seem like his best chance becky he shouted samuel is sick really sick you know he is hes not going to get better without medicine that stuff draining out of his nose is serious i can help him he could get very ill please listen to me people are going to die if i dont get some help dont leave me here like this bass no he heard becky cry an instant later the shed door burst open the man stood there filling the space he was sixfive with shoulders that nearly spanned the doorjamb heavily tattooed treetrunk arms and a massive gut his thick shoulderlength auburn hair and full beard hadnt seen a scissors in months if not years and his vest perhaps once the covering for an entire cow was studded with chrome spikes his narrow feral eyes held not a bit of warmth who the fuck are you he said taking a step into the shed and who do you work for behind him matt could see at least one other biker as well as becky samuel still riding on her hip he pushed himself to his feet im a doctor matt said certain that he had better state his case quickly my friends and i were trapped in a mine explosion i swam out in the river to get help bullshit no please its true im from belinda i need to get to the slocumb brothers farm off do you know them they can vouch

belinda im gonna find out and i promise it aint gonna be pleasant for you tell me who you work for and ill see to it you dont suffer too much fuck with me and i promise youll be beggin to die what i told you is the truth matt pleaded stridently i swear it is bass stepped forward grabbed matts shirt in his massive fist and lifted him onto his toes matt could smell the odor of marijuana wafting from his clothes you have half an hour bass growled he whirled and left slamming the door with a force that threatened to collapse the shed im tellin you he really is a doctor matt heard becky say ask him to look at rake no christ bass hes your brother shut up this guys a fed and in a little while hes gonna be a dead fed this aint no fuckin game were playin here i want to know how in the hell he found us drugs matt felt certain the bikers were either growing them processing them or more likely both he again checked the single window the overcast sky seemed brighter now time was running out for him for nikki and for the rest of those in the cavern it was also running out for some children who were about to receive the socalled vaccination of a lifetime for a while he lay in silence assuring himself again that the handcuffs were unyielding and trying to conjure up a way to expand on his primitive effort to exploit becky clearly a weak link in the chain twice a bike rumbled off he couldnt tell for certain if either was one he had heard before he imagined his own harley and the indescribable sense of freedom and completeness he felt when riding the hills then soundlessly becky eased open the door slipped inside and closed it behind her samuel wasnt with her instead she was carrying a dirty pillowcase partially filled with something you are a doctor aint you just like i said becky i tell me which of these will help samuel she dumped the contents of the sack onto the floor in front of him dozens of bottles and vials of various pills and liquid meds almost all of them legitimately labeled from one pharmacy or another the guys mos always clean out the medicine cabinets a the houses they um visit she whispered they all love perks and oxys but a couple of em prefer codeine the rest a the pills they jes keep around will any a these help samuel matt fingered through the vials and picked out two different brands of amoxicillin milligrams thirty capsules in all thisll work he said pulling one of them apart just take about half the powder from one of these capsules and mix it in his food three times a day for the first dose use a whole capsules worth does samuel have any allergies any what dont worry about it here half a teaspoon of this liquid medicine will help his cough thank ya doctor she said gathering up the pills im sorry bass dont believe you becky youve got to help me get out of here oh i caint do thet theyre growing drugs here arent they is that what bass is afraid ill find out i gotta go now becky i swear i wont tell anyone i just want to help get my friends out of that mine please hes going to kill me i know i sure wish he wasnt whos rake matt asked suddenly how did you ah you heered me talkin ta bass whats wrong with rake hes sick some kinda cancer or somethin in his back they said he kin barely walk an he caint ride his bike at all show me on you becky show me where rakes cancer is becky hesitated then turned and pointed to her lower back i gotta go now thanks for helpin samuel becky get bass matt said desperately tell him im ready to talk im ready to tell him everything you aint a doctor i am now please get him im sorry he heard her say as the door closed matt sensed the woman hurrying away he should have been harder on her if she didnt agree to help him he should have threatened to tell bass that she had stupid frustrated he whipped his manacled hand up with such force that a slice of skin peeled back from his wrist he barely noticed the pain bass ill talk he called out certain his voice hadnt carried past the walls lets make a deal come on nothing ten minutes passed maybe more before the door opened again two bikers both in black but neither needing to dress tough in order to look tough strode in and pulled him roughly to his feet one of the men shaved head broad flat nose tattooed neck unlocked the handcuff on the pipe and secured it to his own wrist thank god matt thought but then as they led him outside another far more ominous thought came to mind the bikers were making no attempt to conceal their compound from him in all likelihood no matter what he did or said he was a dead man scattered in the dense woods well hidden from above were ten wooden structures of various sizes the largest looking something like an indian longhouse had smoke curling from two chimneys above the chimneys a broad metal roof suspended from the trees diffused the smoke which carried a distinctive chemical odor opium matt guessed no way they were going to let him go having seen this the two men led him across a dirt and pine needle courtyard to a modestly sized roughhewn house with a small low front porch bass was inside standing by a bed in what might have once been a living room lying on his side on the bed knees drawn up was a man so like bass in appearance that matt guessed they were twins a husky woman her face deeply pocked from burntout acne sat in a wooden rocker in one corner of the room breastfeeding an unkempt infant who looked as if it might be battling the same germ as samuel rake pale and sweating was obviously ill and in pain this heres my brother rake bass said as the bald one unlocked matts manacle hes been sick for a couple a weeks with like a cancer on his back if youre really a doctor fix him up if you aint im gonna put yer eyes out for starters youre going to kill me anyway matt said the moment he spoke the words he knew they were a mistake moving like a cobra strike bass snatched him by the shirt again this time lifting his toes clear of the floor dont fuck with me he rasped and dont fuck with my brother neither okay okay put me down praying his instincts about rakes problem were correct matt walked around the bed and drew down the sheet it was as hed suspected a gigantic abscess of a congenital remnant known as a pilonidal cyst located directly over the tailbone just above the crack between rakes enormous buttocks partially obscuring the abscess which was six inches from top to bottom and almost certainly down to bone was a large geometric tattoo that looked like something drawn with a spirograph i can fix this matt said aint no one can fix cancer one of the bikers said shut up bass snapped this isnt cancer matt replied its infection i need to open it up and wash the pus out you have anything like a bathtub here i mean one with hot water its got to be big enough for him to fit into tubs back there bass said we kin get plenty a hot water from we got it and soap like the kind you wash dishes with bass looked over at the nursing mother who nodded we got that he said and some rags a lot of them the cleaner the better another look another nod this time in the direction of the kitchen one of the bikers went in there and returned quickly with a small armload of rags he set them where matt indicated at the foot of the bed okay i need a knife a sharp one in an instant all three bikers had produced blades from nearly invisible sheaths the smallest of which was half a foot or better pick one an dont do nothin stupid bass warned matt chose the smallest knife and hefted it in his hand examining the point at the same time finally i need some hot soapy water he said half a pail bass grunted something and in a minute the bald biker had left returned and set a bucket half filled with sudsy water at matts feet tell him this is going to hurt like hell matt said a little while after im done much of the pain hes been having should go away you hear that tell him to do whatever the fuck he has to rake groaned given what awaited within rakes infected pilonidal cyst there was no sense in bothering to sterilize the knife or his skin matt wrapped a cloth around the blade and held it in place about an inch from the tip okay rake ready and now he thrust the knife straight in and pulled it straight down through the tattoo almost two inches rake hissed through clenched teeth but made no other sound bloody foulsmelling pus under tremendous pressure spewed from the wound much of it hit the cloth surrounding the blade some of it actually spattered matt soon as he can move get him into the tub of hot soapy water matt ordered cleaning the wound out as best he could and rinsing his hands in the bucket of water it might sting but itll help a lot does anybody here have any antibiotics now that the infection is open they might help youre a shitty liar bass said becky already told me what you did with samuel obviously anticipating the need he tossed over the pillowcase of purloined medications and matt selected out the most powerful of them two of these four times today he said wondering if being caught in this particular lie was a minus or a plus then one four times a day he really should be seen at a hospital but even if you dont take him this cavity should heal from the inside over two weeks three tops send someone to a store for ten or twelve bottles of peroxide and some gauze bandages you can wash out the hole with the peroxide and then pack it with the gauze he glanced down at his unprotected hands and added get a few boxes of rubber gloves too he hesitated carefully choosing the words to make a sort of deal with bass before he could speak though without a word of thanks or warning bass motioned with a jerk of his head and matt was unceremoniously pulled almost dragged from the house and returned to the shed wait a minute he complained as shaved head locked his cuff back onto the copper pipe wait one fucking minute i just saved that mans life no questions asked listen i need to get out of here my friends are going to die if i dont tell bass i wont ever say anything to anyone about having been here i promise the bikers were already headed out stop this isnt fair i saved your friends life he was railing at the inside of the closed door goddamn it matt kicked the wall and made yet another fruitless attempt to pull the pipe free no chance he was as good as dead if they let him live it would only be to care for the cavity he had created in rakes back you bastards he yelled ungrateful bastards he slumped down onto his bed of oily rags pulled the blanket over him and closed his eyes nikki and the others had virtually no chance now either for a time he thought about slow suffocation breathing gets more difficult you feel sleepy you lay down and close your eyes you dont wake up there were certainly worse ways to die probably including whatever the bikers had in store for him time passed he might have actually dozed off when the door flew open again bass stood there as he had initially all but blocking out the scene behind him but this time there was a difference this time his left hand was behind his back and his massive right paw dangling loosely at his side had a gun nestled in it shit bass dont do this matt begged in a half whisper i wont tell anyone about you i promise you better mean that bass growled its a good thing fer you yer such a crummy liar he bent down and skimmed matts pistol across the floor to where he lay matt hadnt fully absorbed the significance of the gesture when the key to the handcuffs followed along with a pair of dry jeans and a work shirt without another word bass turned and left the shack standing in his stead taking up considerably less space was frank slocumb chapter aint it jes the balls lewis har this boy survives a friggin mine cavein goes oer a thirtyfoot unnerground waterfall an then ends up gittin hisself captured by bass vernon an his lunatic gang yare somethin lewis slocumb said to matt lewis his juryrigged chest tube pinned to his shirt sat crammed between his brother frank and matt in the cab of their battered something red ford pickup in the back amidst boxes and tarps was younger brother lyle kyle had been left to guard their farm frank matt said still giddy from his close call with the bikers except maybe for when you popped out of your mothers womb i swear no one has ever been happier to see you than i was back there who sez mammy uz happy lewis chimed in she bout slit her throat when she first saw him an she bout slit yourn when she saw yew matt joined in their laughter it was just past ten on a heavily overcast morning the truck had been jouncing up a steep rutted dirt road for nearly half an hour circling the mountain that contained both the belinda mine and the toxic storage dump ya done took yerself quat a trip matthew frank said five mile allagether mebbe six from whar ya started ta whar vernons people foun ya you are some lucky man i thought i was dead going over the falls then i really thought i was dead when bass came in with that friggin gun in his hand thets his way bass is crazy as a bedbug mean too dependin on whut drugs he bin takin ah don know ifn ah ever seed him let someone go after they done been ta his camp you lewis ceptin us lewis said he knowed we mak the best damn hooch inna valley we got no intrest in the stuff they grow in thet hellhole but they got more guns an ammo than the us army an were always intrested in thangs thet go bang again he and lewis laughed heartily oer the years they come ta trust us leastways much as bass is capble a trustin anyone ya musta done somethin purdy special fer him ta blieve us thet ya kin be trusted an let yer ass go i saved rakes life matt said simply aint no ones gonna give ya no medal fer thet lewis said matt checked his watch there had to be enough air in the cave to get nikki and the others this far he prayed that nikki or ellen hadnt given up on him and tried to get out via the river it was doubtful the gods would let two survive that trip in a single morning how much longer he asked almos there frank said theys no way ta git direct from vernons place ta the tunnel we plan on usin and vernon explained what i needed i mean you brought some explosives frank smiled ah think ya kin say thet lewis replied wha dya think ah been drivin so slow frank added matt gulped and looked back through the window at lyle who was stretched out calmly among the bundles smoking a cigarette i owe you guys bigtime matt said they drove the last quarter mile offroad weaving through the trees and rolling over roots at the spot frank pulled over there was no hint of a tunnel along the rocky base of the broad wooded hill where are we going from here matt asked as they unloaded two large rucksacks from the truck as well as two smaller nylon bags and a long khaki canvas bag with a us army insignia stenciled on it jes cause ya caint see somethin dont mean it aint there frank said passing matt one of the large backpacks and two thick coils of rope theys a bunch a entrances inta this here mounin trick is ta know which one of em end suddenly in big deep holes only lewis wasnt loaded down as the four of them made their way across twenty yards of shrub and leafcovered ground to the hill matt felt his excitement beginning to surge at the prospect of seeing nikki alive hang on baby just a little longer this entrance to the tunnel completely obscured behind an outcropping of rock was no more than four feet from top to bottom a jagged crack large enough to admit a person on hands and knees but certainly not one with a pack they piled their gear by the entry and matt and frank made their way inside each pulling one end of rope matt was not the least surprised to realize that his pulse remained relatively slow and stable despite the tight passageway step right up and get it ladies and gentlemen dr rutledges famous cure for claustrophobia guided by powerful flashlights they made their way thirty feet along the narrow tunnel before arriving at a vestibule high enough to stand and wide enough for all of them and their gear frank tied the ropes together forming one end of a long loop with enough cord extending from the knot to lash onto a strap lewis was doing the same outside one piece at a time they hauled their gear in while the empty cord was returned to lewis and lyle for reloading hurry matt wanted desperately to yell out hurry the trip into the mountain by this route seemed longer and narrower than the one from the cleft but there were no dropoffs and no water until they passed over the river on some planks near the very end of their journey tenforty the landscape of what used to be the entrance to the toxic dump had been completely transformed much of the overhead wall had collapsed making a new cave outside the old one the ceiling of the new cave perhaps twenty feet above them could be reached by climbing up a wall of rock that was just ten degrees or so short of vertical the floor was littered with rubble but passable and some of the righthand wall had collapsed leaving a strangely smooth gouge that looked as if it had been produced with a giant icecream scoop oooeee frank said inspecting the massive front wall them boys uz playin fer keeps matt felt sick he had images of putting a stick of dynamite among some boulders lighting a match and blowing a new entrance to the cavern piece of cake as if reading his thoughts lewis put a hand on his shoulder well git in thar fer ya matthew he said largely in silence the three slocumbs functioned like a highly skilled military unit lyle set out several kerosene lanterns making the space nearly daylight bright and then began unpacking their gear lewis hands on hips slightly short of breath watched as frank scuttled to the top of the pile of rock then across from one side to the other youd best be darn good lewis he called as he scrambled back down the wall ah am lewis replied simply okay matthew heres the deal this heres the headwall its lak a plug whar there useta be a hole aint no big trouble blowin it up the trick is ta do it without killin us an anyone whut mot be behin it but you think you can ah think ah kin try aint no one kin do moren thet lyle lisn up i wanna soften up this here baby with a shell from little bertha jes bout twothirds a the way up kin ya hit thet big pointy rock rot thar from whar far nuff back sos ya don git kilt lyle lyle scanned the cave no sweat he proclaimed theys a spot ta shoot from rot back thar he opened up the long armyissue bag removed a compact rocket launcher and began preparing it to be fired aint she a beauty lewis said to matt a javelin antitank missile with heat hahexplosive antitank warhead itll penetrate moren twenny inch a armor jes far an ferget thet means ferget whut yer shootin at an ferget about standin round ta watch range a twennyfahve hunnerd meter thets goin on two mile jesus lewis howd you guys get this lewis replied with a wry look that said ya know bettern ta ask a queschin ya really don want ta know the answer to frank he said les you an me git the gelpaks ready three rows up an down beginnin with a pound at the very top an finishin with say ten pound at the bottom well use det cord ta link em up frank quickly produced several dozen sausagelike packages from one of the rucksacks and laid them on a tarp by lewis along with the detonating cord skillfully the brothers began linking them together ready lyle called out frank dragged the gelpaks away from the target and threw another tarp over them this way doc lewis said leading him and frank back into the tunnel until they couldnt even see the headwall itd be fun ta watch this but itd also be a mot dangerous ah spect lylell be back here purdy darn quick too matt heard a loud woosh from around the bend followed by lyle diving headfirst at their feet at the same instant a sharp neardeafening explosion resonated through the tunnel followed by the clattering of rock when lewis nodded that it was okay to revisit the headwall they found the center of it largely pulverized and the topmost rocks displaced and loosened id hate to see big bertha matt muttered fahn shot lyle lewis said ah guess theys hope fer ya yet frank les git these here sausages in place an mak us a hole he turned to matt were gonna use delay detinaters ta blow this here thang sos it elapses from the bottom up ifn we do it rot a space oughta pear et the top ifn we miss it had best be on the sod a too little rathern too much ifn we don git no hole the first torn we got enuff vibrogel ta try it again mebbe twice more hurry matt said in spite of himself wha on earth uld we eer want ta tak our torn lewis replied ah mean taint lak were workin with hah explosives er nothin sorry ah thank ahm ready frank said looping the det cord around his elbow before he ascended the wall ready for what pervert bill grimes his service revolver leveled at the four of them stepped into the cave from the tunnel followed immediately by vinny sutcher still in black who casually panned the group with a submachine gun last to step into view his gun also at the ready was the thin man matt had outwitted at shady lake manor estates see vinny grimes said i told you it was worthwhile having you and verne hang around for a day checking the entrances to this place this here doctor is as slippery as an eel what an imaginative metaphor matt said noticing how incredibly calm lewis slocumb and his brothers appeared at that moment he had no way of knowing for certain but he felt some sort of information was being silently exchanged among them grimes may have sensed the same thing his expression darkened and his heavy pistol steadied on lewis step away from that stuff slocumb your brother too he said vinny get around there and move that shit away sutcher shouldered his weapon circled around to the base of the headwall and eyed the pile of gelpaks suspiciously yad best not een fart near thet stuff lewis said mimicking an explosion with his hands kaboom frank who was about ten feet to lewiss right and lyle who was on one knee about fifteen feet behind him both snickered so grimes said turning his attention to matt i must conclude from your presence here that you are not the only one who managed to survive that devastating accident theyve all escaped except the guards you doublecrossed matt replied sensing he needed to stall were digging those two out because they both swore to kill you if they ever saw you again what are you grimes some sort of major stockholder in the company that makes lasaject is that whats going on surprise flashed across the policemans face then just as quickly vanished oh yes he said mrs kroft well if you must know i have a proprietary interest in the company yes do you know how many people how many children will die if that vaccine of yours gets into general use theres no proof thats so spare me those people you tried to kill in there are proof and you know it thats why you did this to them well grimes theyve escaped just like me theyre headed to washington right now along with ellen kroft and nikki youre finished matt saw uncertainty in the mans eyes i dont believe you grimes said well deal with the problems in there as soon as weve dealt with the problems right here verne pat each one of them down beginning with that one back there then get them together over in that corner then the good doctor and i need to have a little chat if any of them give you any crap shoot em in the knee well save the other knee and the balls for later dont ferget ta check me fer rocket launchers lyle said choking himself on a laugh despite the obvious advantage his side held in terms of weapons and age verne approached lyle cautiously stand up he ordered caint lyle said ma laigs broke if he doesnt do as you tell him to just kill him grimes said hes not going to hurt you verne hes a fucking old man and you have the gun yeah lyle said ahm a fuckin old man he smiled toothlessly and shifted his weight as if he was going to stand at that instant there was a scraping sound from high on the headwall all seven of those below turned to the noise ellen a gaunt dusty apparition was standing straight up twenty feet directly above vinny sutcher the broad flat rock she was holding over her head looked as big as her chest at the moment grimes spun and fired at her she hurled the rock with all her strength straight down at sutcher with his head tilted back the heavy missile caught him flush in the face producing the sickening sound of a pumpkin dropped onto pavement from a second story instantly limp blood spattered across his face sutcher crumpled backward onto the stony floor the seconds that followed were a blur to matt he was still fumbling for the gun in his pocket when all three slocumb brothers produced pistols seemingly out of thin air instantly the cavern sounded like a chinese new year gunshots seemed to be coming from everywhere but the only muzzle flashes matt saw came from the slocumbs grimes was instantly hit in the chest neck and face his eyes wide with disbelief he danced sideways like a giant marionette arms flapping legs disjointed then he crumpled as if his strings had been sliced held a sitting position for a single beat and toppled lifelessly onto the dust verne caught bullets in his throat mouth and the center of his forehead and was dead before he hit the floor matt raced over to the headwall above him ellen was down but he could see that she was moving ellen im okay she called back i slipped when i threw the rock my prides going to hurt when i sit but otherwise im not hurt badly is nikki all right shes back there with the others its slow going with her ankle i think its broken is there enough air in there there is now thanks to whoever created that hole ellen began making her way down to where matt waited vinny sutcher lay at his feet deeply unconscious breathing shallowly and intermittently his broad pancake face was a pulpy mass his eyes obscured beneath twin pools of blood his head was cocked at a sharp angle leading matt to suspect that his neck had been fractured ellen moved in beside him her jaw tightly set her eyes fixed on the horrific damage she had wrought then without a word she bent down and with great effort picked up the rock again and leveled it over sutchers face ellen dont matt urged its over trust me its over tears glistened through the dust on ellens cheeks her arms were shaking from the effort of holding the rock sobbing she turned and dropped it to the floor where it split in two matt put his arms around her and held her a few seconds later sutcher took a single shuddering gasp and stopped breathing forever matt led ellen over to where frank was once again arranging the gelpaks and introduced the two im going in to see nikki he said ellen pointed to his watch matt listen that first shot of omnivax is going to be given to that baby in a little over three hours as soon as it is other kids all over the country are going to start getting it weve got to stop them is there someone we can call this is the biggest campaign stunt of this election i dont know anyone in a position to rein in the first lady at this point do you no we could try calling in a bomb threat i hate that idea but i suppose we could try it if we absolutely had to i can see us accomplishing nothing except to give them more publicity and land us in serious hot water if they go ahead with the shot how many kids do you think will be vaccinated by the end of the day i really cant do more than guess ellen replied but i think it could be lots especially on the west coast where pediatricians offices will be open three hours later than the ones on the east coast thanks to the presidents publicity people the papers are calling todays injection the shot heard round the world the public and the pediatricians just love vaccines omnivax is the most eagerly awaited advance in immunizations in decades but its been made clear that even though tens of thousands of doses have been shipped to offices and clinics around the country administering it to patients wont be legal until after lynette marquand and secretary bolton have had their worldwide tv photo op so what maybe a few thousand doses by the end of the day maybe more who knows with a three percent prion infection rate or more or more matt echoed he peered up at the hole high on the rock wall and made his decision my harleys at my uncle hals place i can probably get you to dc on time but i dont want to leave before i see nikki weve been through too much together i understand but please lets get going as soon as you can we will and matt i apologize for getting so wrapped up in my issues just now im sorry about your uncle i really am thanks me too lewis can you wait a little before setting off those charges aint no place we got ta be we don specially need lyle neither he kin drahve ya ta yer bike great lewis tell me something how on earth did you guys get your guns out so fast grinning broadly lewis pulled up the sleeve of his jacket revealing an arrangement of leather straps and springs ma brother frank thar invented this here gizmo a couple a year ago an built one fer each a us we aint really got ta use em but we put em on taday cause we jes don truss bass vernon much an the older we git the more careful we git that rot frank thassit so thats why you guys were looking at each other like you had a secret we knowed somethin they dint thets fer sure lewis said the moment grimes tol his boy thar ta git our guns an dint jes pull the trigger we knowed he uz a dead man providin franks gizmo worked the way its spose ta and did it ever ellen ill be right back well make it my uncles place isnt too far from here his girlfriend is away but i know where he keeps a spare key good because theres someone i need to call ill be back matt was halfway up the headwall when he heard nikkis voice hey sailor come up here and get your red cross advanced swimmers badge looking about as grungy and disheveled as a person could she sat perched on a slab to one side of the rent lewis had made in the massive wall matt hustled to her side and kissed her unabashedly i knew youd make it she said i just knew it you did not okay i didnt but you made it just the same and thats what counts hows your ankle better now than it was a few minutes ago you know any decent orthopedists as a matter of fact i do how many people are still alive down there believe it or not a the ones that were alive when you mt even fred hes actually a little better i did a trach on colin incredible you dun need no steenking or nikki looked down at the three bodies sprawled in blood amid the stones and dust did you do that she asked in my mind i did especially grimes but i didnt even get a shot off i never trusted that vinny i know listen its almost noon let me help you down ive got to get ellen to dc oh yes that first shot is due this afternoon hurry i can get down myself you can let me help you it was a slow awkward descent when they finally reached the bottom matt carried her to a safe spot in the tunnel and set her down even beneath the bandage he had applied he could feel the enormous swelling in her ankle he kissed her hand then her neck and finally her lips you think you might like to i dont know hang with me after i get back only if you promise me we get to do something really really dull i promise they kissed once more before he headed back to ellen as he passed grimess bulletriddled body he paused see i told you there was proof he said chapter clearly pleased with the responsibility lewis had bestowed on him lyle slocumb hopped up behind the wheel of the old ford pickup matt saw ellen mulling over how best to negotiate the gearshift protruding up from the floorboards and saved her the maneuvering by taking the center seat i could have handled it she said sliding in beside him hey after watching what you did with that rock i would say you can handle just about anything i just figured since me and lyle have known each other from when i was a boy he might enjoy rubbing elbows with me yer nuts lyle said yes and dont you ever forget it as they pulled away matt looked back toward the mountain feeling an odd mix of horror relief and foolishness true there was a toxic waste dump just as hed suspected soon the mine owners were going to be exposed for the callous unscrupulous profitmongers they were and the cave would be cleaned out but his narrowmindedness regarding the mine owners and the cause of the belinda syndrome had kept him from the truth and had to some degree cost lives most notably for him his godfathers he also knew that there was going to be trouble for lewis and his brothers the slocumbs had become legendary for their mysterious hermitlike existence now unless a way could be found to dissociate them from the carnage in the tunnel there was going to be publicity inquisitions and scrutiny and probably weapons charges as well inwardly he shrugged he had done what he thought was right and had tried his best that was the way he had been taught to live his life there was nothing more he could ask of himself but there was also no hiding the fact that his exuberance about the mine had almost enabled grimes and his lasaject cronies to pull off their lethal deception over time he would have to deal with the way he had handled matters perhaps with nikkis help for the moment though it was essential to focus on other things all that mattered right now was beating the clock to washington and placing ellen in a position to stop the initial injection of omnivax and all subsequent injections as well three percent the figure reverberated in his mind three percent of tens of thousands biological time bombs with an untreatable communicable disease that had no diagnostic test and didnt manifest itself for a decade or more three percent itll be close but well make it before that first shot is given he pledged not if we try too hard and end up as roadkill okay okay ill introduce myself to the speed limit have you ever been on a motorcycle once and ive been around for a long time doctor over those years there have been plenty of motorcycling opportunities doesnt my saying once tell you anything matt grinned youll love my bike ellen i promise lyle make the next left my uncles road is about three miles from here ya got it lyle said studying the man thinning gray hair aquiline nose weathered skin engaging toothless smile matt wondered if lyle or any of the brothers for that matter had ever had a drivers license they were certainly a strange lot but they also seemed to be living lives that were quite fulfilled on many levels and now once again matt owed them his life becoming their friend was certainly an unmerited gift of that bicycle ride to their house so many years ago know whar the key ta yer bike is doc lyle asked in the kitchen on the counter jes in case ahll wait round til ahm sure ya foun it thanks pal so ellen whats our plan once we get to dc i dont really know the community health center is in the anacostia section of the city i suspect security will be exceedingly tight what with the first lady there and everything else thats been going on since nineeleven i dont know anyone i could call and i dont think phoning someone would accomplish anything in time but once the people at the clinic see that im no menace and hear who i am and assure themselves that the wild man whos with me is no threat i imagine theyll let me speak with someone in authority whether whoever that is believes us in time or not is another story theres a heck of a lot of votes at stake here and im sure the last thing the marquand camp needs is something that looks like a screwup on their part maybe you can get in front of the cameras to explain whats happening i doubt it but i suppose anythings possible the bottom line is weve got to get there in time to find someone wholl listen to me if we dont doctors all over get the green light to start shooting omnivax four days to two weeks old ellen said thats the age range where secretary bolton says theyre going to start administering the inoculations but soon omnivax will be available to all oh thats just great theyre justifying that decision by stating that except for those who are allergic theres no evidence that being overimmunized is dangerous and every single man woman and child in this country should be grateful for the protection against lassa fever ellen laughed sardonically exactly she said but nobodys ever studied the adverse effects of vaccinations over the long term not in any organized study that im aware of i feel like ive been such a medical ostrich about this stuff believe me you have company its not that on balance vaccinations do more harm than good its just that no one really knows well then lets get us to washington lyle thats grandview road right there hang a left the house is at the very end wait until you guys see my uncles place you wont have any trouble understanding why they named the street grandview the road remained paved throughout hals house was at the end of a long gravel driveway that cut through a peninsula covered with lowlying shrubs and scattered pines im sure coming here like this will be hard for you ellen said i still cant believe this has happened hals always been very good to me and my mother ill miss him and i know she will too matt decided against going into any details about his mothers deteriorating mental state the thin woods gave way to a broad beautifully landscaped lot at the end of which was hals expansive lodge perched on a promontory two hundred feet above a large pristine lake magnificent ellen whispered reverently just beautiful wait stop matt cried lyle skidded to a halt what is it ellen asked there parked in the driveway on the side thats my uncles car so somethings wrong he drove us to the mine last night if hes buried there how did the car get back here lyle do you have your gun i left mine with lewis so that we wouldnt have any trouble with the security people in dc franks got m pistol but theys a shotgun in the back bring it please cautiously the three of them approached the lodge look ellen exclaimed in a loud whisper through the broad living room window they could see a man polishing a vase thats hal thats my uncle matt said lyle stand over there and keep the door covered i dont know whats going on his confusion did not last long he was moving toward the front door when it opened hal nattily dressed in white trousers and a light blue buttondown shirt stepped out onto the low front porch at the sight of the man showered relaxed and cleareyed matt knew matthew god im so relieved to see you ive been worried sick about you since the explosion ive called the police and pardon me for saying it hal but you dont seem very frantic in fact you look downright rested not at all like someone whos spent the last twelve hours trying to get his nephew rescued from a mine explosion ive made many desperate phone calls for help matthew i there was no sincerity in his words matts lingering disbelief vanished can it hal he snapped youre demeaning yourself you know whats been bothering me ever since we figured out that the lassa vaccine was really behind those deaths grimes thats whats been bothering me hal hes not exactly a dope but hes no einstein either i couldnt understand how a man like that could have gotten involved with the manufacture of lasaject in the first place then he goes and masterminds an epidemic to get his vaccine included in omnivax then he discovers that the vaccine has a fatal flaw and finally he sets about systematically destroying all the evidence of that flaw that make any sense to you hal that he was capable of doing that hal looked as if he was about to issue another denial then he shrugged nonchalantly grimes is a jerk he said a violent and avaricious jerk and therefore quite useful to me but a jerk nonetheless hearing his uncle openly admit what he had done brought matt a wave of sadness when did you first learn about the prion disease he asked not that long ago really would you please tell your friend to stop pointing that thing at me no go on well two cases were brought to me for autopsy a couple of weeks apart one had killed herself the other had been shot in a bar fight i recognized the names from our initial field trials and began to suspect that was the connection then you got involved with that miner rideout and i was certain lasaject was too close to being included in the supervaccine to allow anyone to stumble on the connection so i simply had to identify those unfortunates who had the side effect and send the late mr grimes and his people to deal with them i assume he is late actually hes very much alive and talking to the state police right now nephew nephew you never were a very good liar and mr sutcher well lets just say things got a little rocky for him matt glanced over at ellen ah said hal the redoubtable mrs kroft yes a lot of people are dead because of you ellen said icily life can be very hard sometimes jesus hal who in the hell are you just a guy trying to make ends meet you want to come in for some tea of course i dont allow shotguns in the house or better still why dont you all just leave hal were not going anyplace until youre tied up and waiting for the state police well i simply cant permit that hall said with disturbing singsong confidence so i suppose im going to have to dispose of you all beginning with your friend who insists on pointing that gun at me youre a slocumb i presume ah surely am lyle said proudly the words were barely past his lips when a shot exploded from where hals car was parked driving lyle backward into the fender of the truck clutching his belly he managed a single wild shot before he dropped the shotgun stumbled and fell heavily on his side standing by the garage smirking was larry the massive killer matt was supposed to have murdered then incinerated matt was just turning to help lyle when larry shot the man again this time in the chest lyle who had been up on one elbow slumped back onto the gravel and was still comfortable with his handiwork the killer turned the gun on matt ive been waiting for this chance he said youll never know how much ive been waiting matt felt his heart stop as he saw the mans sausagelike finger tighten on the trigger no he cried larry wait hal ordered ill tell you when matt felt his knees about to buckle but beside him ellen stood her ground defiantly and even put her arm through his killing us wont solve any of your problems she said to hal too many people know would you care to give me a list of them mrs kroft i didnt think so but please dont worry i can take care of myself matthew im sorry about this really i am you know i care for you a great deal always have but this is business and you have become a definite liability as you see my man larry here is very much alive believe it or not i conjured up that murderincineration story on the spot with you hanging on the other end of the line and dr solari about to visit the fbi brilliant dont you think youre sick matt said now larry here is very anxious to shoot you but i am a sporting man as well as one who doesnt want bodies with bullet holes floating around in the lake that wouldnt appear very accidental so i am perfectly willing to have you and mrs kroft step over that fence he indicated the splitrail fencing that paralleled the side of the drive and step off the edge who knows maybe youll miss the rocks give it up hal matt said regaining a modicum of composure therere way too many loose ends that are all tied to you you know you can still come off looking like a hero in this business by telling the police you are blowing the whistle on lasaject in order to save all those unborn children from spongiform encephalopathy at that moment out of the corner of his eye matt saw movement from the direction of the truck lyle the bullet or the drop matthew hal was asking your choice frantic to stall and keep hals and larrys attention fixed on him matt rejected the notion of some sort of outburst in favor of pandering to hals ego hal tell me one thing he said that was you who slipped that note about the toxic dump under my door wasnt it hal sighed and nodded with exaggerated modesty if you really must know yes i am aware of pretty much everything that goes on around here and i knew about that unusual um storage facility almost as soon as it was established i sent the note to you figuring that as long as you were chasing after your vendetta against the mine you were no threat to my interests brilliant no lyle had moved under the open door of the truck and was pulling himself inside matt took a step toward his uncle larry moved forward to intervene his pistol ready oh give me a break matt cried raising his voice angrily youre not nearly as brilliant as you think youve made one miscalculation after another he laughed loudly man you must have swallowed your gum when nikki solari arrived in town thats where you and grimes blew it you should have just let her go back to boston you got worried that if somehow word got to me about kathy wilson there was every chance id start looking for explanations other than the mine and figure out the truth so you went after her that was a mistake hal a big mistake more movement somehow lyle had found the strength to drag himself inside the cab big words for someone in your position hal said no longer cheery but words for which i have no patience now make your choice larry if they dont choose the drop i want mrs kroft shot first please he pointed to a spot just above his own ear right here from two feet you killed all those people for money matt asked stridently wondering if lyle was lying dead on the seat of the ford his uncles smile was coldly patronizing not for money nephew he said for a great deal of money i have owned more than forty percent of columbia pharmaceuticals for years and i was running out of funds to continue losing on the accursed company can you imagine what its like being my age with my tastes and no money with what were being paid per dose of lasaject my financial concerns are about to be over thats over with a capital o now sir i have things to do you have not behaved at all like a respectful godson and so from this moment you have ten seconds to choose your punishment nine hal no please matt screamed at the moment the trucks engine rumbled to life stop larry and hal whirled toward the noise lyle his eyes virtually closed the bridge of his nose resting on the steering wheel threw the ford into first floored the accelerator and popped the clutch spewing gravel the truck shot ahead straight at larry mouth agape the massive gunman fired off three shots the fords windshield shattered and it looked to matt as if at least one of the bullets had hit lyle in the forehead but nothing short of a cement wall was going to stop the truck now the front bumper caught larry at the knees his gun spun to the ground as he was lifted up onto the hood his moon face not two feet from lyle who looked to matt to be unconscious or dead still lyles foot held the gas the ford shattered the rail fence sped through ten feet of shrubbery and hurtled off the edge of the precipice like a hang glider taking flight then in what seemed like slow motion the nose of the truck tilted downward spilling larry into the void before disappearing moments later there was a loud explosion from the rocks below by the time hal sawyer turned back from the scene his godson was standing there calmly with larrys gun leveled at him business is very bad uncle matt said chapter matthew please youre not thinking of the greater good omnivax will save hundreds of thousands of lives every year if you block the release of the vaccine think of all the blood that will be on your hands why you dont even know for certain that lasaject caused any of those deformities youre guessing assuming hal sawyer ranted on nonstop as matt and ellen used lengths of clothesline to lash him tightly facedown on his bed if someone happened to show up at his home and release him before they had the chance to report things to the state police so be it grimes was gone for good so were sutcher and the other killers larry and verne hal might try to run but he wouldnt get very far darn it matthew this is no way to treat your own flesh and blood whos going to visit your mother if im not around your mother this is going to break her heart and its all your fault for crying out loud matthew im your godfather ellen ellen youre more my generation explain to my nephew the importance of family im his uncle genetically that makes us twentyfive percent of each other twentyfive percent thats like selling out a quarter of yourself we cant make it ellen said checking matts watch were not even going to be close we can only do our best matt replied tightening the cord a bit more than it needed to be we have a shot depending on the traffic itll be closer than you think can you do the rest of this yourself sure why i need to make a phone call before we leave my friend rudy will be worried sick about me also he knows people maybe theres someone he can call quickly though i have just another minute or two here then i want to be on the road listen hals girlfriend heidi lives here why dont you make a quick rummage through her things for some warm clothes it can get chilly on the bike it took just seconds for ellen to appropriate a pair of dark slacks a sweatshirt and a leather jacket she dashed to the kitchen while matt looped the last length of rope around hals ankle then around the leg at the foot of the bed he was badly shaken by lyle slocumbs death and also by his uncles remorseless confession his mothers alzheimers disease made her less aware of some things than she once might have been but she would certainly be aware that her brother no longer came to see her aware and deeply hurt in spite of the situation and the urgency of their getting to washington he found himself composing explanations that would be gentler on her than the horrible truth you cant leave me here like this hal was bellowing each plea more desperate more pathetic than the last what if i have a heart attack what if i have to pee in this country were presumed innocent until proven guilty who made you the goddamn judge jury and executioner for christs sake matthew listen to me ive known you since you were born you cant do this hal where are your car keys my what the keys to your car matt had found his bike in the garage and retrieved the key to it from the kitchen counter but if he was going to drive miles across virginia at eighty miles an hour he would much rather do it in a mercedes sedan than perched on a harley with a novice rider who hated motorcycles squirming on the seat behind him hal stopped his machinegun ranting and laughed if i had them you surely wouldnt get them he said not unless you let me go but thanks to you i dont have any keys at all what do you mean i had only one set my other ones with heidi and my set was in ol larry hogarths pocket when he made the big swan dive too bad hal matt said checking the knots one last time i hope you dont get the pleasure of driving an automobile again for the rest of your life he stopped in the hallway for hals fleecelined leather jacket hurried to the garage pulled on his helmet and revved up the harley he had made the drive to washington in two and a half hours cutting fifteen minutes off that time stretched the bounds of possibility but not past the breaking point then he checked the fuel gauge and groaned just under half a tank two and a half gallons at best at the speed he intended to be going they would be getting around fifty miles per there would be no chance to make the trip without stopping gassing up would be brief but rolling into the station pumping and rolling out would probably add three minutes maybe even four still depending on when the actual injection took place and how lucky they were once they reached the clinic it was still remotely possible ellen raced out of the front door and met him as he was backing the harley past hals mercedes dressed in heidis leather jacket and black slacks she looked every bit the biker let er rip she said climbing up behind him just pull on your helmet lean back relax hang on and watch the world go by matt replied accelerating down the drive did you reach your friend no but i left him a message ordinarily hed be fishing in the pond behind his cabin at this hour today i hope hes out pacing about worrying about why he hasnt heard from me im sure he is well here we go second star to the right and straight on til morning dont worry about me ellen said just go fast go fast damn you hal with vivid lurid images of the victims of the belinda syndrome in full control of his thoughts matt swung onto the highway and hit the gas sher the limos here don called out a white stretch limo at that isnt this something were just about ready sherrie called out from the bedroom i want this girl to look her very best for her debut on national tv worldwide tv don corrected he watched as a man and a woman in dress suits wearing sunglasses emerged from the limousine and headed up the walk men in black he was thinking tada sherrie sang holding the baby out to her husband you both look just fine don said beaming really fine he took the baby and kissed sherrie on the mouth no one could ever guess you had this baby just four days ago youre pilin up some bigtime points sir she said checking out the scene below their window not every kid has the secret service escort them to their baby shots you ready ready as ill ever be even when i was fightin golden gloves i dont remember being this nervous you nervous what are you nervous about believe it or not the baby startled sherrie turned slowly and looked at him a shadow of concern darkening her face you mean the shot uhhuh she sighed me too she said ive been afraid to talk with you about it because i was afraid youd think i was crazy or or ungrateful i know mrs marquand told us that plenty of people babies and grownups had received this shot when it was being tested still donelles going to be the very first to get it after its been approved i know i was speaking to andrea last night about her son randy he was one in may he has fits all the time that his doctor says are caused by a reaction he had to one of his baby shots he has to take medicine and now andrea says the medicine is messing him up i didnt know that is the shot one of the ones donelles gonna get it has to be shes going to get thirty shots at once all the ones shes ever going to need i wish we knew more don said sherrie walked across the room and embraced him and their daughter same here she said just as their secret service escorts knocked on the door thankfully the day was sunny and dry matt pushed the harley as hard as he dared across the virginia border then along rolling twolane roadways through the lush shenandoah mountains and the appalachians in less than an hour they had picked up route in staunton and were headed north toward matt kept their speed at an even eighty nudging it up a mile or two when he sensed there were no police around the windscreen and topoftheline shocks made it feel like forty in harrisonburg they took on four gallons and learned that they were about miles from washington an hour and thirty minutes remained before the shot heard round the world would be fired depending on the congestion once they hit the city they had a chance they picked up in middletown and headed east barreling on through light traffic riverton markham marshall the plains bit by bit they were making up time closing the gap against the moment when lara bolton would trip a switch and inject the first dose of omnivax into the thigh of a baby girl three percent maybe more not odds he would ever want to have operating against his child on the seat behind him ellen sat quietly for most of the trip using the handgrips for balance and occasionally his arms this isnt nearly as unpleasant as i remember she yelled as they sped through a particularly spectacular mountain pass ill help you pick out your first bike he hollered back for most of the initial hour of their trip matt had constantly scanned his rearview mirrors and the road ahead looking for problems or police as the day grew brighter and the road more hypnotic his thoughts drifted to nikki he pictured her hunched over fred carabetta battling through the pain of her fractured ankle using makeshift instruments to perform a delicate procedure that could easily have ripped the mans vein in half courage resourcefulness compassion intelligence over the short time they had known each other she had shown him so much he had truly never believed there was a woman who could take ginnys place in his soul and his heart now at least he knew it was possible perhaps for the first time he acknowledged the effect that ginnys death continued to have on him the indolent and virulent depression that had functioned like a great wall preventing him from experiencing true joy was nikki the answer maybe he said to himself as they rocketed along the interstate maybe she was catharpin centerville fairfax by the time they passed through arlington they had ten minutes left probably not enough unless there were some preliminaries there was still going to be the problem of getting in contact with someone with enough power to stop the injection and doing it without getting killed traffic was heavier now much heavier and matt was forced to slow into the twenties to join the migration along the west bank of the potomac to his right he caught a glimpse of arlington national cemetery joe keller would never be buried there nor would kathy wilson or teddy rideout or any of the others who were victims of hal sawyers war but matt knew that thanks to the woman hanging on behind him the death of every one of them would eventually save lives eight minutes until three take this exit ellen called out well cross the potomac here and look for signs to anacostia were almost there they headed east on crossed the anacostia river at pennsylvania avenue and then turned onto minnesota this was the tenement lead paint hardscrabble section of the city a druginfested percent unemployed island of violence and despair situated less than two miles from the capitol it was hardly an accident that lynette marquand had chosen a community health center here to showcase omnivax her husband was trailing badly among black and hispanic voters matt wondered how long it would take for lynette to accept the tale of lasaject and halt the inoculations traffic had slowed to a nearcrawl two minutes if that are we close enough for you to make it on foot matt asked maybe im not quite sure where we are relative to wait fenwick road over there thats the street im certain of it matt accelerated and swung the harley up onto the tree belt and across a weedy lawn onto fenwick several blocks down the street they could see broadcast trucks a number of them lined up along the side of the road then they saw the blue barricade a block ahead what time do you have matt asked hoping his watch and the one ellen had taken from heidis bureau disagreed after three ellen replied sadly maybe five or six minutes you gave it a heck of a try how long was the show going to last altogether matt wondered probably not more than ten or fifteen minutes with maybe some commentary from the various networks health gurus after that if regular broadcasting resumed it might be hours before they could get their story heard and get word out to the pediatricians of the country to stop the injections they had failed to stop the initial injection but there still might be a chance to get to someone in a position of influence in time to prevent thousands of other exposures three percent barricade matt announced were there as they approached the intersection a young dc cop strode lazily toward them he looked queerly at granny biker perched comfortably on the raised passenger seat behind matt no admission here he said youll have to head that way two blocks until you see the officer or else go back to the freeway should i say something to him ellen whispered i think we get only one chance at this and he aint it by the time he finishes calling his supervisor who will call his supervisor itll be tomorrow what then ellen asked by now several other cars had pulled up behind them the officer walked past the harley to repeat his instructions to the occupants of a silver minivan i think we have to move up a couple of levels in the chain of command hang on just pray that kid in the policemans uniform doesnt start shooting its not him im worried about matt said hold tight im going to try to make it up to the front door of the clinic what time have you got ten after damn matt waited until the policeman had moved to yet another car and then quickly accelerated around the barrier up over a low curbing and down the sidewalk if the cop fired at them they never heard or felt it they were closing rapidly on the phalanx of broadcasting vans marking the entrance to the clinic a hundred yards fifty matt was entertaining theatrical visions of driving through the glass front door when from the corner of his eye he caught rapid movement coming from his left he slowed and was turning his head when a woman hurled herself at them arms outspread she connected with his and ellens shoulders like a missile sending both of them sprawling off the motorcycle and onto the dirt of a weedy trashstrewn vacant lot the riderless harley skidded on its side along the concrete and came to rest against the base of a tree the woman an athletic brunette in her thirties held them down until two other secret service agents arrived guns drawn not a move one of them snarled his pistol fixed on them take those helmets off slowly you first ellen and matt did as he demanded im a doctor matt said quickly please listen to us ellen said im a member of the commission that approved the vaccine they just gave to that baby in there my names ellen kroft weve just discovered theres a serious problem with omnivax we need to speak to someone in authority while theyre still on the air so that we can warn the public and keep more kids from being vaccinated hundreds of lives may be at stake please im telling the truth theres a dangerous contamination of the vaccine mrs marquand must be told about it one agent a lanky black man with a scar across his chin eyed them suspiciously then took a silent poll of the other two both merely shrugged id he asked ellen shook her head of course wallet jacket pocket matt said take it out slowly the agent handed matts wallet over to the other man who scanned the contents west virginia license matthew rutledge it says hes a doctor and im the pope the first agent muttered removing a set of handcuffs from his back pocket on your feet both of you jill pat em down im telling you matt said desperately as his left wrist was shackled to ellens right we have to get down there before they go off the air shut up the agent turned to the other two well jill lifted the twoway radio from her hip bert its jill how much longer of a delay before they get the show going delay ellen asked i said shut up alan bert says ten more minutes jill said to the black agent the man sighed tell him were bringing down two party crashers for him to talk to the sooner we get this out of our hands and into his the better thank you ellen said utterly relieved youre doing the right thing why does that sound to me like find another job have they given the shot yet ellen risked asking no they havent even gotten on the air what happened what happened is some wacko got in there dressed as an electrician he used a pair of electricians shears and cut the pool feed cable from the camera inside the clinic to the truck that transmits the signal to all the networks weve been on delay for fortyfive minutes now but i think the cables just about been replaced then hurry matt said get us to one of mrs marquands people before they give that shot and i promise you youll be heroes you better be right with an agent on either side of them and a sizable crowd jeering from tenement windows ellen and matt were led down the sidewalk toward the clinic i cant believe were going to make it matt said i told you not to give up no that was me i told you ellen turned to jill do you have any idea why the man cut the cable like alan said hes a wackjob listen in case you couldnt tell were not having a good day if youre juicin us about who you are or this vaccine were gonna cuff you to the same tree hes huggin and leave all three of you there overnight to sample the hospitality of the neighborhood the agent gestured to their right where the culprit stood his arms shackled around a goodsized oak ellen grinned as they hurried past him toward the gleaming health center rudy waved with his fingertips hey rudy she called out this is my new friend matt rutledge matt this is my significant other rudy peterson just as they reached the clinic a couple emerged the woman was cradling an infant in her arms holding her so that the child was bathed in the warm afternoon sun behind her just inside the door matt could see what looked like more secret service people at the sight of the two of them handcuffed together the couple took a wary step backward hi ellen said cheerily her smile threatening to escape the bounds of her face is this the baby whos going to get the vaccination yes sherrie replied glancing down lovingly at her child her names donelle chapter late afternoon shadows were stretching across the streets of dc when matt finally fired up the harley and headed back toward west virginia he was riding alone ellen and rudy remained behind to answer more questions from the fbi and to review the evidence rudy had brought into the city with him the progression from the secret service agent in charge of security at the clinic to his counterpart on lynette marquands staff to marquand herself had been rapid there had simply been too much at stake for anyone to delay in a small conference room matt and ellen were being interrogated by former georgia congresswoman joanne kramer marquands chief of staff when word was brought in that the feeder cable rudy had severed had been replaced it was the moment of truth kramer hurried from the room leaving the two of them with a secret service agent five interminable minutes passed before the door opened and kramer reentered with her was the first lady of the united states beneath her piledonfortv makeup marquand was ashen there was no warmth in her expression as she took stock first of matt then ellen so mrs kroft she said still standing it would seem that your abstention from the omnivax vote did not mean you had lost interest in the vaccine hardly ellen said a man had threatened my granddaughters life if i voted against it i needed to buy some time and now that man is dead yes he worked for the owner of columbia pharmaceuticals the manufacturer of the lassa fever component of omnivax and there is something fatally wrong with that component yes and you are convinced it would be a grievous error for us to vaccinate the infant who is out there awaiting her immunizations ellen sighed in relief at the news the shot heard round the world still hadnt been fired yes she said again i most emphatically do and you dr rutledge matt said clearing his throat matthew rutledge people from my community in west virginia who received test doses of the lassa fever vaccine ten years ago are dying i think the agent that is killing them is still in the vaccine marquand again leveled her gaze at ellen mrs kroft my staff has informed me that you have been a financial supporter of my husbands opponent in the upcoming election is your miraculous appearance at this moment at all politically motivated ellen took some time before responding i disapprove of your husbands position on social security she said finally that is why i support mr harrison but our being here now has nothing to do with politics i assure you of that for fifteen seconds all was silent as marquand steadily probed ellens eyes with her own thank you she had said finally her voice was husky her expression still gray and you too dr rutledge without another word she and kramer then turned and left the room fifteen minutes after that the first of the fbi interrogators had arrived the child had been sent home the cameras had been shut down and no doubt the administrations spindoctors had been called in for emergency work before leaving for home matt had sat alone in one of the empty clinic examining rooms wrestling with the decision of whether to notify the police about the situation at the toxic dump site or to wait until he had the chance to evaluate things in person when lyle didnt return lewis and frank would surely have known there had been trouble at hals he was certain of that what they would or could do about it though was anybodys guess their brother was dead their beloved old truck was at the bottom of long lake they were several miles from their farm and lewis was not in the best of shape for travel still the problems matt would cause for them by sending the authorities to the scene of such carnage might well destroy them nikki and those inside the cave were reasonably stable when ellen and he had left for hals place finally after a heated internal debate he had decided to wait on calling for help from anyone until he could ride out to the mountain himself rushhour traffic was a bear and matt took many more chances than he was accustomed to in getting across the potomac and out of the city it was seventhirty by the time he was first able to accelerate past seventy just outside white sulphur springs he glanced down at his pager which he kept in a plastic holder on the handlebars of the harley when he was riding and transferred to his belt loop when he wasnt it had been on the bike since the evening he followed bill grimes up to the mountain cabin the light indicating a page was flashing he had no idea how long that had been the case he pulled off the highway and called the er at the hospital dr rutledge the ward secretary exclaimed weve been trying to find you theres a disaster drill in progress only its not a drill matts pulse quickened whats going on i really dont know its confusing i think theres trouble at the mine maybe a cavein maybe an explosion the first two cases are due to arrive by ambulance any minute tell whoevers in charge that ill be there in about an hour fifty minutes later matt swept around a wide lefthand curve one of his favorites to ride and saw the lights of belinda nestled in the valley below so beautiful so deceptively peaceful main street was quieter than usual but the hospital more than made up for that one ambulance was in a bay having just been unloaded a second also now empty stood off to one side of the tarmac and a third flashers on was just rolling up the drive matt parked the harley and hurried over to help ive never seen anything like it never one of the emts was excitedly telling er nurse laura williams we pulled these people out through a hole way up on this rock wall there were flares marking the entrance to a cave and a rope on the ground leading in to where the trouble was but no indication who put them there i know williams said the other crews still talking about it and those barrels of chemicals god what a stench that cant possibly be legal what made those mine people think they could get away with such a thing need a hand matt asked battling back the urge to answer the emts question and peering into the ambulance at the two stretchers sure the guy on the left is a load fred matt stood on his tiptoes and determined that the occupant of the other stretcher was sara jane tinsley how did you guys know where to go he asked one of the cops who was on duty when the anonymous call came in knew the area the guy was talking about we all went out in a caravan matt took one end of carabettas stretcher hauled it onto the cement platform and helped pull it up into position to be rolled inside the osha bureaucrat moaning continuously and lolling his head from side to side appeared to be in no immediate danger matt moved to speak to him then just as quickly pulled back and raced into the crowded er there would be time for fred he easily spotted orthopedist brian oneil half a head above any of the disaster team hey brian he called out hurrying over well matthew dont you look like shit where were you at some sort of motocross believe it or not i was in the cave with all of these people when it blew but later are you taking care of nikki solari the doc yes sweet woman behave she hurt bad trimalleolar fracture a little displacement but nothing that a bit o time in the or and a few wellplaced screws wont fix promise to do a good job and i promise not to tell her your degree is in veterinary medicine where is she ortho please let her know ill be in with her in two minutes make it five matt said eyes closed an iv draining fluid and antibiotic into her arm nikki lay on a stretcher her swollen discolored foot and ankle propped up on pillows in a transparent air cast her face and arms had been washed clean but dust and small shards of stone filled her hair still she looked absolutely beautiful hey you matt whispered lady doctor nikki smiled broadly before opening her eyes matt kissed her on the forehead then on the mouth did you make it in time she asked no shots today missy he said come back some other time so sorry thats great news nice going it was my uncle hal all the time nik he owned most of columbia pharmaceuticals grimes and the others worked for him her expression darkened she immediately understood the implications for him and for his mother im really sorry she said yeah well its quite possible even john dillinger and attila the hun had nephews i suppose she said sadly how did you get out nikki shrugged while the slocumbs were doing their thing i decided to drag myself back into the cave to look after fred and morrissey and the rest a lot of time passed i was getting worried then all of a sudden there was noise then powerful lights shining in and a few seconds later the calgary stampede of emts policemen and firemen began the slocumbs i have no idea where they are matt kissed her again im worried he said i think im going to let you rest and go see if i can learn something about what might have happened to them brian oneil the orthopedist whos taking care of you is terrific why gunner i didnt know you cared oneil boomed from the doorway okay i care i care just dont make the mistake of thinking my judgment is flawed in other areas as well he pressed nikkis cheek tightly against his ill be back soon baby he whispered be brave after what weve been through how could anything be scary weve got an or right now the orthopedist announced and i think we should take it so long as no one else is ready might as well get it over nikki said i want you to recuperate at my place matt whispered in her ear you still in the backrub business we never close matt patted oneil on the arm as he passed and wandered out into the bustling er looking beyond the busy nurses and physicians at their charges sid the security guard was in bay the curtainedoff area next to fred two bays down sara jane was being cleaned off by an aide and next to where she lay evan julian the ent surgeon was huddled over colin morrissey julian was the most meticulous compulsive physician on the hospital staff and never started a case unless every instrument was perfectly aligned on the scrub nurses tray matt grinned at the notion of nikki her shattered ankle in a bulky makeshift splint performing a successful emergency tracheotomy by lantern light in a cave filled with dust and toxic fumes matt anxiously checked the other bays and rooms the woman he had called tarzana was in a side room thrashing about wildly restrained to her litter by leather straps but no slocumbs if there was dire need for his help with any of the patients matt knew he would have pitched in but at the moment he was feeling totally drained and more than a little fearful about frank and lewis he left the hospital through the waiting room and headed across to his bike as he was approaching the harley he noticed a tan mercedes sedan parked not too far away the driver his face obscured in the shadows was beckoning to him he took several steps in that direction and froze the car was hals doc its me frank the driver called out in a loud whisper matt hurried over and jumped into the passenger seat lewis slocumb was stretched across the back apparently none the worse for wear you all right matt asked gesturing at lewiss chest tube ahm okay lewis said grimly bastard kilt lyle i know i was there im

police out ta yer uncles place you check those knots i tied yep they aint comin loose no tahm soon matt opened the door and stepped out onto the pavement the breezy night was cloudless and utterly clear a west virginia night maybe in a few days he said epilogue six months later the massive hart senate office building more than a million square feet was built in the late seventies adjacent to the dirksen senate office building on constitution avenue between first and second streets for four days now the august central hearing room of the hart building had been the scene of the first major hearing of the new postelection senate an investigation into the omnivax debacle by the committee on health education labor and pensions ellen had already testified as had rudy and matt and others including lara bolton the former secretary of health and human services in the former marquand administration for nearly six hours now the senators seated at draped tables beneath a massive gray marble wall had been taking turns questioning the star of the proceedings dr harold sawyer currently awaiting trial and being held without bail at the maximum security federal penitentiary in florence colorado and for nearly six hours hal had been sidestepping and evading their queries like an allamerican halfback dodging secondstring tacklers matt along with ellen and cheri sanderson from pave had been present for hals entire testimony and his patience as well as his faith in the system was frayed to near the breaking point with grimes sutcher and the hired killer verne all still missing and larry a bloated fisheaten corpse washed up on the shore of long lake weeks after his death there was little in the way of substantive evidence against hal beyond the testimonies of matt and ellen dr sawyer delaware senator martin wells was asking wearily lets get back to your relationship with dr george poulos of the institute for vaccine development in the six months prior to your arrest precisely how many meetings facetoface or by phone or by email did the two of you have i would have to check my appointment book senator hal replied smiling earnestly but from my recollection as i told senator worthington it couldnt have been more than one or two times this is really depressing matt whispered he is just so damn slick if i didnt hear him admit to what hes done i would probably believe that he was just the unfortunate victim of hiring the wrong people matt cheri said i heard that hes in the process of cutting a deal with the federal prosecutors is that true im afraid it might be once they realized that he was going to be tough to convict on many of the major charges against him they started going after the bigger fish he was dealing with george poulos for one ellen said im convinced hes the link between the marquand administration and columbia pharmaceuticals which means hes the one who suggested they might send someone like vinyl sutcher to pay me a visit senator hal was saying i want to cooperate really i do but i feel i have answered your questions regarding my relationship with dr poulos as forthrightly and oh ive had enough of this matt snapped lets go out for coffee my treat cant cheri said sallys meeting me at the office in half an hour shes at a meeting of the commission president harrison has formed to look at vaccine issues including funding for increased clinical investigation and public education as well as debate on the whole business of parental choice its a miracle whats happening all over and its all thanks to you guys oh pshaw ellen said as long as we dont end up throwing out the baby with the bathwater matt cautioned even we dont want to do that cheri said we just want to be listened to so did someone say coffee ellen asked after seeing cheri into a cab matt and ellen bundled up against the brisk february wind and walked arm in arm around to a diner on c street hals testimony would be continuing in the morning federal prosecutors had asked matt to attend as long as his uncle was testifying but today would be ellens last day at the hearings rudy was back at his cabin teaching writing fishing when the weather permitted and awaiting her return she was still living in her place in glenside but the two of them had been seeing more and more of each other and ellen had mentioned something to matt almost in passing about a trial period of living together in two places they sat across from each other in a booth watching the traffic inch past and saying little but each aware of the bonds that would forever exist between them three months after she had helped to save his life ellen had returned to belinda for the burial of colin morrissey who rapidly became incapacitated from his neurologic disease and simply wasted away soon sadly sara jane tinsley would share a similar fate for nearly six months now the owners of bc ampc had been besieged by attorneys mine agencies and government investigations armand stevenson had been sent packing and was facing criminal charges elaine leblanc was gone as well and latest estimates placed the fines and settlements in the tens of millions still under new management the operation had remained open and recently had even been hiring so ellen asked finally what do you think about your uncle making some sort of plea bargain matt shrugged he was thinking about his mother and her brothers many kindnesses to her since hals imprisonment matt had spent even more time with her than before but she was inching closer and closer to custodial care and now as often as not called him hal he hurt a lot of people he said finally one minute i want to see him put away forever and the next i think that he simply went crazy with all the money that was at stake its really out of my hands all i can do now is keep telling the prosecutors what i know well i saw him in action ellen said i hope he gets twenty consecutive life sentences and they let him pleabargain down to one when are you headed back probably tomorrow night you miss her it was a statement not a question i miss her matt said nikki had been in dc for one day and one night but her responsibilities as a pathologist at montgomery county regional hospital and as the new medical examiner for montgomery county precluded taking much time off after having her ankle fixed she had taken a leave of absence from her boston position and had simply never gone back six weeks later with the job offer from mcrh in her pocket she had sent in her resignation and a week after that had flown up to boston with matt to pack her things you want to know what she said to me when she was here ellen asked she said that men like you dont come along and resuscitate a girl every day so she had decided to pay attention to that im paying attention too he said shes really been great to be around i just have to get accustomed to to having someone in my life its just a day at a time at that moment matts cell phone began vibrating actually it was nikkis he had never owned one himself but she insisted they keep in close touch when he was in the big city ill be back in a minute ellen said as he pulled the phone from his pocket say hello for me hey good afternoon doc he said didnt i just talk to you a little while ago that was then nikki said hows it going hals performing even as we speak therere rumblings hes going to cut some sort of a deal with the prosecutors well he cant have his jobs back i like them that wont be a problem i have mixed emotions about any pleabargaining one moment i think there should be some lenience because he was just crazy and the next i dont want him getting away with anything less than the guillotine itll work out the way it works out nikki said i suppose i know youre in a tough spot matt for what its worth i think youre handling things terrifically i think i needed to hear that i mean it youre a great doc and a wonderful man and ill tell you that as often as you want to hear it thanks youre pretty terrific yourself say i almost forgot the reason i called yes virginia there is a reason the neatest thing just happened i was getting ready to go into the office but i had a little time so i took my coffee and kathys mandolin out to the porch and played a few licks out toward the mountains i have a ways to go on the thing to even be listenable but im getting better thats a gross understatement remember ive heard you but wait thats not the point while i was playing this incredibly beautiful little bird flew down and settled on the railing right in front of me ive never seen anything like it i kept playing and playing and it didnt move it just sat there like it was actually listening to my music it was small but so red and and so perfect what do you think it was matt swallowed back a fullness in his throat and gazed across the street toward the hart building i think he said it was a tanager a scarlet tanager
