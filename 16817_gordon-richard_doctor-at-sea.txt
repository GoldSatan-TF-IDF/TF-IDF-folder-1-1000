richard gordon doctor at sea first published in to the merchant navy they have a lot to put up with note the lotus and her crew are as fictitious as the flying dutchman and her insubstantial company chapter one it would be unfair to describe the lotus as an unlucky ship it was just that she was accident prone like a big awkward schoolgirl even her period of gestation in the shipyard was full of mishaps she was laid down in wallsend in and had advanced to the shape of a huge picked chicken when the depression blew down bitterly on tyneside for the next four years she rusted untouched behind locked gates and when they started work again her design was changed on the drawingboard from a north atlantic ship to a far east trader shortly afterwards the company ordering her went bankrupt and she was bought on the stocks by another who began to turn her into a whaler they too rapidly slid into insolvency and abandoned her to a fourth the fathom steamship company of st mary axe it was this concern that succeeded in launching her after she had been through as many fruitless changes in construction as a human embryo at her launch she holed and almost sunk a small tug and on her maiden voyage as a cargopassenger ship she lost a propeller during a gale in the australian bight at the beginning of the war she came home from new zealand painted grey and was one of the first vessels to reveal to the admiralty the effectiveness of the magnetic mine she lost most of her bows in the thames estuary but stayed afloat long enough to be dragged into dock for repairs after several months she set off again to join a convoy and had her stern blown away by a bomb twentyfive minutes after leaving port the stern was patched up and she managed to pass the rest of the hostilities without getting herself involved in any dangerous action apart from shooting down an american mustang in error with her oerlikons in at the end of the war she refitted and returned to peaceful trading disturbed only by an explosion in the engineroom in the caribbean and the cook going abruptly insane one insupportably hot afternoon in the red sea and passing among his shipmates with the meat hatchet much of the damage from both these accidents was repaired but the repeated structural changes had induced in the lotus a premature senility a state of chronic invalidism she was too cold in the higher latitudes too hot in the tropics and she groaned pitifully in bad weather but the fathom steamship company unmercifully sent her anywhere in the world where she could find the shareholders a profit she carried lead and lemons boilertubes and barley copra and cows she took steel from baltimore to brisbane wool from auckland to archangel coal from swansea to singapore she was one of the worlds shopping baskets there was enough room on board for thirty passengers though she rarely carried more than a dozen and often none at all they were people going to unusual places or too poor to afford a big ship or experienced travellers who cringed before the bonhomie of the boatdeck and the deadly ginandsin routine of a sophisticated liner the company was indifferent to them passengers earned little more than complaints but freight meant money in the opinion of the crew one of the severest disasters to overtake the lotus since the war was her commander captain vincent hogg who was officially required to act at various times once his ship was at sea as the sole representative on board of the fathom steamship company the king and god for all three of whom he substituted himself with impartial grandeur his officers accepted him as farmers tolerate a prolonged drought giving daily prayers for divine removal of the affliction the weight of his personality fell most heavily on the mate mr hornbeam who had passed his masters examination twenty years before and was waiting for a command with the pitiful patience of an impoverished expectant relative promotion in the company was simply a matter of dead mens shoes he had in a drawer in his cabin an alphabetical list of the fathom lines captains with their exact ages and notes on their partiality for drink loose women and other items reputed to shorten life but all of them retained irritatingly good health he enjoyed the unstinted sympathy of the chief engineer mr mcdougall who hated the captain like a redhot bearing and the captain disliked the chief engineer like fog round the goodwins mcdougall looked upon the ship as a shell for the transportation of his engines and complained daily when the navigational position from the bridge was some miles astern of the one he calculated from his revolutions indeed according to the chief engineer the machinery and boilers of the lotus should have arrived in any port several days in advance of the rest of the vessel there were two other mates a gang of engineers a wireless operator andas the lotus carried more than ninetynine souls when she was fulla doctor the doctor was by order of the ministry of transport the uncompromising power who prescribes on every item of a sailors life from the number of lifeboats to be available in emergency to the number of times he shall have eggs for his breakfast ninetyeight souls can sail the seas until they are carried away with obscure nautical illness like the shipmates of the ancient mariner their health is preserved with a bottle of black draught the ship captains medical guide and a scalpel also used for sharpening the chartroom pencil the second mate or the chief steward holds the keys of the drug chest and practises daily after breakfast all pains below the umbilicus are treated with strong purgative all disturbances above with ministry cough mixture and lesions on the remainder of the body with turpentine liniment obviously there occur from time to time more alarming complaints and these are submitted to surgery under wireless instructions by the captain on the saloon table after the patient and the surgeon have taken sufficient brandy to instil in each other confidence that both will survive the operation but one more soul on board brings to all the benefits of medical scienceor as much of it as the doctor can remember because ship surgeons are notoriously forgetful of these things the sea induces an attitude of pleasant detachment towards problems that strain thought ashore including those of the diagnosis and prognosis of disease and the doctor has few professional obligations to distract him from his pastimes or enrich him with experience for these reasons the companies naturally dislike the expense of carrying himbut then the fathom steamship company would have objected to the expense of lifeboats when i met the lotus she was lying in liverpool due to sail with a cargo of machinery and motor cars to santos in brazil it had then been raining on merseyside for four days the damp november wind channelled itself down the river broke against the waterfront buildings and ran up the cold streets behind the birds on the liver building that are unfairly supposed by liverpool seafarers to flap their wings when passed by a woman of untarnished virtue wept ceaselessly onto the bleak pierhead the birkenhead ferry forced its way miserably across the choppy harbour the landingstage looked as forlorn as a bandstand in midwinter and even the stonework of the st georges hall appeared in danger of showing through its crust of soot it was about eight in the evening the hour when the shipowners are fed in the adelphi as they glumly finished their martinis in the little american bar they calculated among themselves the rains cost in delayed cargo working outside in lime street the adolescent tarts already clung hopefully to their damp doorways the dripping buses took home the last pale shipping clerks the overhead railway rattled along its grotesque track and the dock police steamed themselves warm in front of the stoves in their cabins the lotus herself lay lifeless at her quay with tarpaulins tented over her hatches creaking gently at her mooring ropes like an old bed in a bad dream i stood in the rain on the quayside reading a large sheet of printed instructions for resuscitating the apparently drowned this was the only information of any sort available to passersby the wharf was deserted the cranes huddled together in a row a few railway trucks crouched between their legs the warehouses were shut locked and abandoned even by the cats the lotus lit with a few dim lights looked as uninviting as a shut pub i was a young doctor with a bad diploma passing through the difficult stage of professional adolescence when you discover the medical schools teach as little about medicine as the public schools do about life my knowledge of seafaring was based only on treasure island pictures in the windows of cooks and a walkingon part i had been allowed to play in a students production of the middle watch i was nevertheless a recognized sailor i had in my pocket a new seamans identity card with my fingerprints on it a document that made me the professional descendant of drake and cabot subject to and protected by a batch of parliamentary acts the target of missionaries good intentions and girls bad ones and entitled if i felt like it and there was enough room to doss down in the sailors home the first problem presented by nautical life was how to get aboard the ship a slippery gangway reached up from the wharf to the lotuss afterdeck but there was no one to welcome me at the top after a few damp minutes i climbed the gangway nervously and looked around me i was on a dirty iron deck littered with pieces of timber scraps of rope and coils of wire like the junk room in a ship chandlers a heavy wooden door led into the upper works and as the rain was coming down my neck persistently i opened it and stepped inside hostile darkness surrounded me i smelt the faint bitteralmonds tang of cyanide uneasy tales of the sea blew through my mind like a sudden cold draught in an old house it occurred to me that the lotus like the marie celeste had been freshly abandoned by her terrified crew or was manned with lost souls from the flying dutchman i shivered a light an oil lantern sprung into mid air in front of me a voice behind it snapped op it i jumped back hitting the door with my head get the ell out of it charlie the voice continued coming nearer iim a member of the crew i managed to say the light advanced on me behind it two eyes stared with concentrated suspicion the new doctor i explained humbly the voice at once took on a friendly inflection sorry doc i thought you was trying to pinch something noi just came aboard there didnt seem to be anyone about i hope it was all right sure its all right liberty hall this hooker make yourself at home spit on the deck and call the cat a bastard thank you glad youve come doc he continued affably ive got a bit of a cold like he sneezed to add point to the remark could you give us something for it yes certainlybut wouldnt a bit later do im extremely wet id like to find my cabin and so forth sure doc follow me ill take you to see the mate he walked off the lamp swinging high in his hand i stepped timidly behind him along narrow alleyways round sharp corners up unidentifiable ladders sorry there aint many lights he apologized over his shoulder but the engineers has got the jennies stripped tonight oh really that sounded more alarming than ever he came to a cabin door and opened it the new doctor he announced as if he had just materialized me out of a hat there were three men in the cabinthe mate archer the second and trail the third hornbeam was sitting in the only chair with his reefer unbuttoned and his stockinged feet on the washbasin it was a small cabin designed like a crossword puzzle and the visitors had to adapt themselves to the interlocking pieces archer who was a tall pale man with an expression like a curate just beginning to have doubts had wedged himself between the bunk and the bookcase above it with his legs dangling on to the deck like a human question mark trail squatting between the locker and the desk was a fat youth going through a florid attack of acne vulgaris talk of the devil hornbeam said immediately we wondered when you were going to turn up archer said have a bottle of beer move over second and let the doctor park his fanny hornbeam said he introduced himself and the others give us another bottle third do you mind drinking out of a toothglass no not at all the welcome was cordial enough but it disturbed me it is a habit among seafarers to accept every newcomer on terms of intimacy but i was a fairly new doctor and stood on my professional dignity like a girl with her first pair of high heels i hope im not butting in i said stiffly not a bit of it throw your coat on the hook there we were only having a quick peg i climbed up on the bunk next to archer without enthusiasm it seemed as comfortable as trying to drink on a bus in the rush hour you just passed out of medical school archer asked certainly not ive been in practice forsome years oh sorry been to sea before im afraid not youll soon pick up the routine i hope youre hot stuff on the diseases sailors get this brought a roar of laughter from the other two we doctors have to be hot stuff on very many things i said i gave a superior smile since i qualified i had fed on professional respect and i found the conversation irritating by george we find some queer doctors at sea trail said handing me a glass of beer dont we mr hornbeam usually theyre getting away from their wives or the police or both sometimes or else its drink thats the commonest sometimes its drugs though i drink very little trail took no notice i remember old doc parsons i sailed with when i was doing my time he went on cheerfully he was a real scream as tight as a tick from morning to night we reckoned he got through a couple of bottles of gin a day easy started before breakfast every morning said the world was so bloody awful he couldnt face it at the best of times but especially with his last nights hangover then one day in the red sea the mate ripped his arm open and old parsons said hed operate laugh the lot of us went down to the hospital to watch i was doubled up hed been at the bottle extra strong and he was as blind as a bat kept dropping the knife on the deck and falling over the table in the end the mate clocked him one and got the chief steward to do it archer leant forward do you remember old doc hamilton in the mariesta he asked the other two began to laugh again he was a real queer un he explained to me started on the grog before we sailedhad to be carried up the gangway by the time we reached gib the old man stopped his tapno more booze you understand so he went down to the dispensary and drank all the surgical spirit when he finished that he scrounged meths from the engineers they tumbled to it of course and wouldnt let him have any more in the end he drank the acid from the wireless batteries the police came for him when we got home hornbeam added i dont know what it was for something about abortions i think i remember we buried an old doctor off teneriffe archer said thoughtfully he hanged himself he did it with his belt he continued in my direction i began to understand that the medical professional was not held in the highest esteem at sea i assure you i shall not commit any of those things i said the voyage hasnt started yet archer observed why look what happened to old doc flowerday yes that was a shame trail said nodding his head sadly he was as mad as you make em but i was sorry about it for one hornbeam agreed he was a nice old boy you heard all about it i suppose doc no i havent why should i he suddenly looked uncomfortable i thought they might have told you something about it in the office he said vaguely he was the last doctor before you he sighed gently into his beer it was a pity he continued in a way i shifted myself nervously on the bunk what was a pity hornbeam drained his glass hiswell his end as you might say they sat in silence for a while the reference to dr flowerday had saddened them and no one seemed to wish to reopen the conversation i sat and anxiously speculated on his possible fate for which i had now a good number of workable theories chapter two i went to bed that night feeling like my first day at school when someone pinched my tuckbox but in the morning the rain had stopped and the sun threw a bloodshot early glance on merseyside the ship had come to life overnight she rattled with the noise of steam winches loading cargo and the ghosts of the evening were replaced by persons who shouted coughed and used bad language on each other with comforting humanity i had breakfast in the saloon with hornbeam and the mates their conversation was as mysterious to me as the chat at the hospital lunchtable would have been to them it was about tween decks and stowage dunnage and ullage tank tops and cofferdams the only fact i could grasp was that the lotuss sailing date was as unpredictable as judgment day after breakfast i went to my cabin sat on the narrow strip of settee and opened the first page of war and peace this i had bought in three volumes from a booksellers near euston station before catching the train for liverpool i thought the voyage would allow me to achieve a tenyears ambition of finishing the thing besides i was determined to make use of the time i was obliged to spend inactively at sea improving my mind and its long restful paragraphs might begin to soothe my headaches a fortnight ago i had been an assistant in general practicethe medical equivalent of the poor curate the unbriefed barrister the new subalternliving in an atmosphere of dettol and damp overcoats and dispensing the loot of the national health service like a maniacal lady bountiful my principal had a bedside manner and two stock remedies with which he had built up a local reputation of infallibility and we divided the work between us he saw the private patients who diminished in number each budget day and took the morning surgery i had the night calls and the evening clinic as my clinic came conveniently after work school and high tea it was popular with everyone who wanted a certificate new teeth hair or spectacles or simply to pass the time the patients brought their troubles and left them on my doorstep like unwanted babies they wedged themselves into the uncomfortable and unhygieniclooking sofas in our waitingroom mirthlessly turning the pages of punch and glancing shiftily at their neighbours wondering what they had got and if it was catching there were so many of them they could idle the drab hours of their evening away contentedly it was cheaper than the pub and more interesting for this i was paid the same wages as an enginedriver in ten or fifteen years however if i behaved myself i would become a partner and take a share in the spoils but my life at the time was illuminated with a more pressing excitement i was going to be married marriage is as much of an obligation for a young doctor as celibacy for a roman catholic priest a medical bachelor is unpopular with the patients except for visits to eligible daughters and as even these are now obtainable on the national health he is a frank financial liability to the practice my principal had no intention of losing his patients through marital hesitation on the part of his young assistant and after he had made this as plain as possible he asked his wife to apply a womans practical mind to the problem and set about finding me a bride she procured the daughter of a town councillor she was a girl called wendy a blonde but of the arid sort like the stubble in a wheatfield after a hot harvest her position in local society made it impossible for me to escape once the town saw what my principals wife was up to wendy and i were mated as firmly as two rats put in the same cage in the biological laboratory we became engaged the wedding approached with the speed of an early winter i suppose looking back on it there was good reason for my subconscious to slip into disorder like a wrecked gearbox in an overdriven car wendy was a nice girl she was well educated and could talk about things like trigonometry and economics but she had her defects her voice was as dull and authoritative as a salvation army drum she walked like an overloaded wheelbarrow and she had a figure like a stook of corn i began to suffer an attack of terror celebans or bachelors panic more robust personalities than mine would have stood up to it it is a common premarital complaint but i did not i developed headaches i immediately diagnosed a cerebral tumour and hurried to london to see a brain specialist savouring everything on the way with exquisite farewell tenderness even the fish served for lunch by british railways the brain specialist listened to me for five minutes and packed me off to a psychiatrist the psychiatrist was an important and busy man and i arrived at the end of the day but he let me talk for a quarter of an hour while he signed a few letters and looked for his car key a long holiday he said sternly putting on his overcoat why dont you take a ship you wont have any work to do i did it when i was your age signed on a cattle boat going to murmansk half the deckhands were washed overboard one night and i had to turnto with the rest of them to work the ship great fun i dont think id be much good as a deckhand anyway youve got to have a holiday put on your best suit and walk down leadenhall street you never know your luck all right sir i said doubtfully if you advise thus my honour was saved by modern psychiatry the next afternoon i tramped leadenhall street trying to get a berth out of every big shipping office and by mistake a branch of barclays bank it was one of those unfriendly november days when dawn and dusk meet each other in a dim conspiracy over the lunchtable the rain drizzled onto the grimy pavements soaking through my mackintosh and the seams of my shoes and my depression deepened with the twilight it looked as if the sea had rejected me when the offices began to close and the important shipping men were already hurrying westwards i walked up the creaking stairs of the fathom line building prepared to sail with captain bligh if necessary there i was introduced to a mr cozens a little bald man crouched in a high leather chair he was suspiciously pleased to see me our lotus doctor he said is in need of a surgeon we should be delighted to have you forty pounds a month no need for uniform just the companys regulation cap can you leave for santos on monday but a seafaring friend had once warned me to treat a new ship like a prospective bride and discover her exact age and precise tonnage before committing myself and i was touchy on such points cozens rapidly sketched for me a description of the lotus she isnt a big ship he concluded nor a fast ship exactly he smiled like a house agent but shes a very nice ship i wondered what to do i was being asked to sail in a ship i had never seen to a place i had never heard of in the employ of a business i knew nothing about i looked anxiously through the dark window running with comforting english rain the wisest course was obviously to go back to wendy and settle for a fortnight in sidmouth instead very well i said i accept excellent said mr cozens with relief im sure youll find yourself well suited doctor shes a very nice ship indeed quite a lady i nodded where do i go now there are a few formalities to be gone through im afraid doctor regulations and such things you understand first of all i must supply you with a letter of appointment if youll just wait one minute ill get one of the girls to type it running away to sea has become more elaborate since the unhedged days when the errant son slipped down to the docks at nightfall mated up with a bosn at a wharfside tavern and sailed with an indiaman on the dawn tide now there are forms to be filled in documents to be issued permits to be warily exchanged for a string of personal data the next day i was sent down to the merchant navy office an establishment which was a cross between a railway bookinghall and the chargeroom of a police station on a saturday night there i poked my letter of appointment nervously through a small window at a clerk who glanced through it with the unconcealed disgust of a post office employee reading ones private thoughts in a telegram got your lifeboat ticket he asked gloomily his steel nib arrested in midair my what i saw for a second the picture of myself shivering on a sinking deck refused permission to enter the lifeboat because i had not purchased my ticket at the proper counter where do i buy it i asked wildly the man looked at me with pity they sends us some mugs these days he observed wearily lifeboat ticket he repeated mouthing the words as if addressing a deaf idiot ministry certificate savvy no i admitted i havent got any distinguishing marks he asked giving me a chance to redeem myself or blemishes tattoos no none at all as far as i know he nodded and gave me a chit entitling me to a free photograph at a shop across the street i queued between a tall negro in a jacket that half covered his thighs and a man in a strongsmelling rollnecked sweater who picked his teeth with a safetypin when my turn came i had to face the camera holding my number in a wooden frame under my chin and i felt the next step would be in handcuffs now sitting in my cabin with war and peace my companys regulation cap hanging from a hook above me i saw that mr cozens was wrong the lotus wasnt a nice ship at all she was a floating warehouse with some accommodation for humans stuck on top like a watchmans attic all the cabins were small and mine was like a railway compartment quarterfilled with large pipes i wondered where they went to and later discovered i was situated immediately below the captains lavatory my appraisal of the lotus was interrupted by a knock on the jalousie door it was easter the doctors steward he was a little globular man who felt his position was not that of a mere servant but of a slightly professional gentleman as an indication of his superiority to his messmates a throat torch and a thermometer poked out of the top pocket of his jacket and he frequently talked to me about we of the medical fraternity he was always ready to give advice to his companions on problems of a medical or social nature that they felt disinclined to pour into the ears of the doctor and had an annoying habit of counselling them for the good of their health to hurl into the sea the bottles of physic just handed to them by their medical attendant good morning doctor he said i have a message from father father the captain oh he said he wants a bottle of his usual stomach mixture pronto his usual stomach mixture i took off my spectacles and frowned how do i know what that is has he got a prescription or anything dr flowerday used to make him up a bottle special i see the problem grew in importance the more i thought of it the captain suffers from his stomach quite frequently does he ho yes sir something chronic hm when he has one of his spasms he gets a cob on worse than usual life aint worth living for all hands the only stuff what squares up his innards is the special mixture he got from dr flowerday makes him bring up the wind doctor or belch as we say in the medical profession quite you dont know whats in this medicine i suppose not the foggiest doctor well cant you remember you were with dr flowerday some time werent you several voyages doctor and he was very satisfied if i may make so bold it occurred to me that this might be the point to clear up the flowerday mystery for good tell me easter i said sharply what exactly happened to dr flowerday he scratched his nose with a sad gesture if you wouldnt mind sir he replied with dignity id rather not talk about it i got up it was useless sounding easter on the fate of my predecessor or on his balm for the captains gastric disorders down aft there was a cabin with a notice stencilled above the door saying certified hospital it was a fairly large apartment which smelt like an underground cell that hadnt been used for some time there were four cots in it in a couple of tiers one bulkhead was taken up with a large locker labelled in red poisons one door of which was lying adrift of its hinges on the deck inside the locker were half a dozen rows of square squat bottles containing the supply of medicines for the ship theselike the doctorwere prescribed by the ministry of transport unfortunately the ministry in the manner of the elderly elegant physicians who come monthly out of retirement to grace the meetings of the royal society of medicine holds trustingly to the oldestablished remedies and the comely prescriptions of earlier decades there were drugs in the cupboard that i had seen only in outofdate books on pharmacology i picked up a bottle amylum what on earth did one do with amylum there was a pound of dovers powder and a drum of castor oil big enough to move the bowels of the earth at the back i found an empty gin bottle some worcester sauce a tennis racket with broken strings a dirty pair of black uniform socks two eggs a copy of the brisbane telegraph and a notice saying no fumare i dropped these through the porthole taking care with the eggs below the shelves of bottles was another compartment i looked into it it held a heavy mahogany case labelled instrument chest which contained the left component of a pair of obstetrical forceps a saw a bottleopener and a bunch of toothpicks but there were five gross of grey cardboard eyeshades over seven apiece for all hands i saw that prescribing was going to be more difficult than in general practice where i scribbled a prescription on my pad and the patient took it to the chemist who deciphered my writing and slickly made up the medicine we had been obliged to attend a course of lectures on pharmacy and dispensing in medical school but these were always held on a saturday morning when most of the students were already on their way to the rugger field for this reason there was an informal roster among the class to forge the signatures of their companions on the attendance sheet before slipping softly away themselves when the lecturer turned to clarify some obscure pharmacological point on the blackboard as i had attended the greater number of my pharmacy lectures by proxy in this way i now felt like a new wife in her first kitchen i picked up one or two bottles hopefully and i was delighted to find that my predecessor dr flowerday had his pharmacy lectures on saturday mornings also on the back of each bottle was a small label bearing in shaky handwriting guidance such as good for diarrhoea or this mixed with tinct ipecac seems all right for colds or apparently inert there was also a sheet of cardboard on which dr flowerday had written in portuguese spanish french and hindustani translations of three questions which he seemed to find adequate for investigating his patients have you a cough where is the pain and have you been with any dirty women recently i found an old pair of pharmacists scales and a glass graduated in drachms and started to make up the captains medicine the first one turned into a pink putty and was abandoned it later came in useful for minor infections of the crews feet the second tasted strongly of peppermint but seemed adequate i corked it and carried it up to the captains cabin i had not met captain hogg before he had been ashore the previous night and he never came down for breakfast when i had asked hornbeam about him he replied unconvincingly he has his good points what are they trail asked gloomily i enquired what form captain hoggs malignity took oh he thinks the sun shines out of his bottom trail said they all get like that its living alone too much that does it they ought to be made to carry their wives with them to keep them under control the old man isnt married hornbeam told him neither was his father trail said i knocked on the cabin door enter i went in captain hogg was of a curious shape he was like a huge pear from the sharp top of his bald head he came out gradually until the region of the umbilicus from which point he spread abruptly in all directions he was sitting in an armchair in his shirtsleeves his face obscured by the book he was reading it was a periodical called true horrors on the front of which a vivid blonde with an alarming bosom was struggling unsuccessfully with a gorilla a man in a black mask and her underclothes the book didnt move i stood just inside the door holding the medicine bottle in front of me like a talisman he spoke well i rubbed my right shoe slowly up my left calf doctor sir i said the magazine came down for a moment we stared at each other with interest i thought he looked as friendly as a firingsquad ah he said i proffered the bottle your stomach mixture sir either my prescribing or dr flowerdays directions were at fault perhaps the ships drugs had degenerated with time some unplanned reaction occurred within the bottle with a sharp pop the cork flew into the air you may find this a little strong i said picking up the cork quickly i recommend taking it well diluted he took the bottle silently and stood it on the desk beside him your cap he said you have a cap yes sir companys regulation pattern why arent you wearing it im sorry sir i the cap is worn on all official visits to the captain if i were asking you up here for a peg that would be different but im not its a matter of etiquette theres no tramp ship stuff about this vessel this is my ship you understand doctor my ship if we get that straight we shall rub along splendidly together yes sir i was a medical student again before the dean for filling the senior surgeons rubber operating boots with iced water good you havent been to sea before no sir youll find the routine fairly simple as far as youre concerned you take your surgery at nine every morning and at ten you bring me up a list of the sick on board and whats wrong with em theres none of this damn medical secrecy nonsense at sea i want to know all about them i have to carry the can in the end understand yes sir good then at eleven oclock we inspect the shipyou wear your cap again dinner is at twelvethirty and supper at six do you play cribbage no sir he looked disappointed pity the last doctor played a good hand passes the tedium of the evenings at sea he indicated the magazine im a great reading man myself but i like a game of crib now and then on a sudden thought he leant over and rummaged in the desk ive got a book on it here read that through then we might be able to have a few games thank you sir he hesitated a moment staring at the square toes of his shoes did you know dr flowerday he asked no sir he was the last doctor very good man we all liked him very much unfortunately he didnt know when to stop i shouldnt like to see you go the same way the company might think there was something wrong with my ship my mouth went dry whater what happened to him sir captain hogg glanced at me then returned to inspecting his toes of course a mans entitled to think what he likes he said forcefully im a respecter of anyones opinions but there are limits doctor limits yes sir youve never thought you were somebody else for instance have you doctor no sir ii cant recall doing so well there you are it happens sometimes at sea ive seen some of the best of fellows get taken that way i remember when i first went mate the third thought he was cleopatra very awkward it was for all hands i can see it would be sir but dr flowerday had a weakness i tell you in strict confidence doctor of course sir it appeared that my predecessor after having drunk two bottles of gin a day for several years in the service of the lotus got religion shortly after leaving singapore and extinguished himself one night in the indian ocean through the mistaken impression that he had the rightful ability to walk upon the water chapter three the lotus sailed to the surprise of her crew three days later we spent the time tethered to the quay loading heavy packingcases from railway trucks it was an interesting performance the cases were raised to the level of the ships deck drawn horizontally inwards and lowered into the holds this was done with the derricks and steam winches each set manned by a gang of liverpool dockers who went about their work with the leisurely decorum of the house of lords considering an unimportant bill on a hot afternoon there was a docker at each winch and the rest of them worked either down the hold or on the quay each gang was controlled by a man in a long overcoat and a bowler hat who directed their activities with the economy of gesture of an experienced bidder at an auction the twitch of a little finger an inclination of the head the drop of an eyelid and four tons of crated machinery went spinning through the air and down the hatch as cleanly as a holedout golf ball the stowage of the cargo was supervised by the mates under the directions of archer he had his bunk covered with cargo manifests bills of lading and plans of the ship with the different merchandise coloured in with crayon the second gets the thin end of it he said hes always cargo officer too much work in it for me but it looks fairly simple dont you just go on putting the stuff in until the ships full havent you ever packed a case for a holiday the things you want first always seem to be at the bottom if that happened in the ship thered be trouble you cant tip everything out i see what you mean besides theres the trim of the ship to think about theres more in cargo than meets the eye he looked at his plan nos and are full but theres plenty of room in and well be here a week yet you can bet on that but orders based on some deep calculation in the fathom line offices came for us to sail twentyfour hours later in the morning the lotus left an air of excitement spread through the ship before sailing as everyone began to go about their jobs more briskly i was greatly stimulated by the promising departure for i had become thoroughly used to living alongside the wharf in the past few days and occasionally doubted that we would ever sail at all the dockers who had made free with our decks were turned down the gangway leaving behind them a litter of newspapers cigarette packets and matches trampled into the rusty steel the wide hatches were covered with heavy slabs of wood and square tarpaulins lashed over them at the head of the gangway the quartermaster fixed a blackboard announcing confidently the ss lotus will sail at oclock for santos no shore leave and a thin black stream of smoke shot powerfully upwards from the funnel our bleak masts were enlivened with flags the red ensign trailed over our stern the companys houseflaga red f topped by an anchor on a white squarewas hoisted at the mainmast and from the foremast the blueandwhite p announced our intentions to the waterside that at least is a flag i recognize i said to trail the blue peter yes well soon be on our way doc its a bloody nuisance i was just getting a nice little piece lined up last night its always the same i shall be glad to get to sea i must say ive seen enough of liverpool youll get your bellyful of sea all right dont you worry shouldnt get too excited though they may change their minds and send us into cardiff when we get out in the irish sea not a bad place cardiff though i prefer middlesbrough myself the pubs are better shortly afterwards trail reappeared on deck with his cap on looking very determined and ten years older got to do the testing he explained brusquely tugsll be here any minute now i heard him ring the bridge telegraphs and sound the whistle which blew a long silent plume of steam into the air for some seconds before it struck its note the customs officers gave us a final suspicious look and made for the shore their threatening bags of rummage tools over their shoulders men in yellow raincoats and misshapen trilbys hurried aboard with desperate last letters addressed to captain hogg and rushed away again anxiously looking at their watches a mr swithinbank a pale youth with steel spectacles from the liverpool office came breathlessly down the deck after me with a paper in his hand heres the bill of health doctor he said cripes for a moment i thought id lost you you cant sail without it thank you very much i said taking the document reverently are you all right he asked quickly making for the gangway medical stores ok too late now anyway have a good voyage cheerybye goodbye i shouted after him helplessly we seem a bit short of sulphonamides bring us a ham from brazil if you remember it he called over his shoulder dont forget the poor starving english he hurried away between the railway waggons and lorries on the quay it was almost ten two sailors who had somehow managed to drink themselves to a standstill at that hour staggered up the gangway and collapsed on the deck take em below hornbeam shouted to the bosn with the air of a man handling a familiar situation theyll be logged tomorrow morning has smiley turned up yet no sign mr hornbeam i dunno hornbeam said resignedly if you docked a ship in hell youd still get deserters get my watch turnedto bosn im going to stations aye aye sir two tugs nuzzled under our bow and stern their skippers standing impassively at the wheel in their oilskins like waiting taxidrivers the pilot came aboardan alarmingly unnautical figure in a tweed overcoat and bowler hat carrying an umbrella and a black gladstone bag i watched trail knock on the captains door salute and announce tugs alongside and pilot aboard sir he stepped aside as captain hogg appeared resplendent in gold braid and mounted solemnly to the bridge the gangway came up the two tugs plucked the ship away from the quay and the ropes fell into the water with long splashes the lotus became suddenly changed into an entity a being in her own right instead of a rusty appendage of a dirty liverpool wharf i leant over the rail with easter watching the steadily widening gap of water between us and the shore i had never been on a moving ship before apart from a brief passage from margate to southend in a paddle steamer and i felt excited and apprehensive i found the belief that we should now all be transported by the lotus from liverpool to the tropics too outlandish to take seriously well were off was all i could think to say yes sir in an hour or so well be well out in the river you know easter to me it seems almost impossible for this little ship to take us all the way to south america sometimes sir he answered gloomily i think its a bloody miracle she moves at all we shook with a gentle ague as the engines picked up speed slipped down the channel of thick mersey water passed the tolling buoys and the bar light out into the irish sea in the afternoon a sharp seawind blew down the deck and the welsh mountains were huddling on the horizon i pranced delightedly round the ship which was now musical with the wind looking at everything like a schoolboy in the science museum i had a letter in my pocket from wendy which i purposely kept unopened until we were under way it was a short prim note wishing me a good voyage hoping my headaches were better and mentioning that i was not to think of ourselves as betrothed any longer it appeared she had become enamoured of the son of the local draper i tore the letter up and scattered it over the side the pieces spread on the sea and were left behind i laughed i felt a cad a devilish cad but now surely i was allowed to be i was a sailor a wife in every port for me i thought watch out my girls watch out a rollicking sailor lad indeed with a snatch of seashanty on my lips i went below for a cup of tea aware that i was perhaps not quite myself my elation lasted less than a day the next morning i was sick the lotus creaked and groaned her way through the water like an old lady in a bargain sale she climbed to the top of a wave paused for breath shook herself and slid helplessly into the trough of the next i lay on my bunk and watched the sprightly horizon jumping round the porthole trying to think about eminently terrestial objects such as the albert hall easter put his head round the door in his hands he had a cup of tea and a small roseless wateringcan of the type preserved for the conveyance of tepid water in english country hotels good morning doctor he said briefly will you be in for breakfast i rolled my head on the pillow not feeling too good doctor i think i am going to die he nodded gravely assessing the clinical findings throwing up much he asked pleasantly everything if i may take the liberty a good meal is what you want plate of fried eggs and bacon and youll be right as rain works like a charm hold it a moment doctor ill fetch a bowl i held the bowl like a mother with a newborn infant feeling better now youve got all that up he asked solicitously a bit a thought struck him wouldnt like a bit of cold beef and a few pickles would you theyd do just as well no no no i dont want anything nothing at all i just want to be left alone very good doctor just as you say perhaps you might feel like a bit of lunch i doubt it very much he left me in ecstatic solitude i lay rigidly on the bunk concentrating on the words stencilled by order of the ministry of transport immediately above me certified to accommodate seaman seaman indeed all i wanted to see was a tree it was essential to keep my mind fixed on something beyond the clouds of nausea spiralling round me so i started to count the rivets in the deckhead i had reached ninetyeight when hornbeam came in he was smoking a pipe hello doc i hear youre off colour whats the trouble im seasick he looked surprised yes i suppose she is pitching a bit he admitted glancing through the porthole do you mind if i use one of your matches he blew mouthfuls of smoke into the cabin better out than in he said as i put the bowl down again i suppose so you know what doc im going to give you a genuine cure for seasickness i cant often treat a doctor but this is just the thing do you want to try it what is it a pint of seawater its an old sailors cure when i was an apprentice it was the only thing that stopped me on my first voyage if we were sick we got kicked down the bridge ladder and given a pint glass just out of the seabucket by the mate shall i get you some i raised my hand i think id rather not have anything at all at the moment thank you as you like doc im only making a suggestion have you tried covering one eye it wasnt much good no i dont believe it is damn can i have another match my pipes gone out again would you mind lighting it outside its a bita bit strong at the moment oh sorry i didnt think of that i called weakly after him at the door how long is this likely to go on for he calculated for a few seconds not very long i should say wed be in pretty calm water in five or six days five or six days i groaned i lay and tried to analyse my condition like the dying surgeon john hunter it was of course a ridiculously simple malady when one looked at it with scientific detachment the endolymph in myemicircular canals was stimulating the endings of my cochlear nerve which transmitted influences to the brain and initiated the reflex arc of vomiting it should be easy for a little willpower to inhibit the reflex after all the brain was the masteri exercised the willpower morning trail said from the doorway when youve got your head out of that bowl ill tell you a surefire cure for seasickness i fell back on the pillow i had given up when the angel of death arrived i would shake him cordially by the hand trail came over to the bunk he put his hands in his trouser pockets and pulled out two bottles of stout guinness he said proudly drink these and youll be fine by lunchtime works like magic oh god i said oh god oh god trail looked puzzled whats the matter dont you like stout here take it easy that one nearly went over my uniform he left me wondering submissively how long it would be before easter came back and started talking about lunch and it was bound to be irish stew after three days the sea and i achieved a compromise the sun came out the wind dropped and lost its malice the water was tidied up like a room after a wild party for myself i learned to lean against the sway of the ship and i felt well enough to risk lunch in the saloon it was my first meal at sea i sat with the captain the chief engineer hornbeam and archer and the chief steward a thin little mousefaced man called whimble as soon as the bell rang we converged on the dining saloon with the briskness of seaside boarders captain hogg disliked anyone to be late i was on the captains right hand the mate on his left the chief engineer faced the captain and the other two sat themselves between ah doctor captain hogg said jovially enough decided to join us at last have you yes sir he unfolded his napkin and tucked it under his chin with deliberation seasickness he said slowly is entirely mental you imagine it i shrugged my shoulders well i said in my professional tone there are more complicated reasons than that i admit there may be a psychological element but there is obviously some fault with the balancing apparatus in the ears and probably with the gastric nerves the captain broke a roll no he said it decisively it is entirely mental he started drinking soup loudly no one spoke until he had finished mr mcdougall he said slipping half a roll into his mouth have you got that book you were going to lend me at supper last night the chief looked up he was a thin wrinkled scot with a face dominated by a thick strip of sandy eyebrow from which his eyes looked out like a couple of highland gamekeepers inspecting poachers through the undergrowth aye he said you mean the squeaker the captain nodded thats it i like a bit of peter cheyney but surely i said immediately the squeaker was by edgar wallace it was written over twenty years ago no the captain said it was peter cheyney you know sir im perfectly peter cheyney he said with the emphasis of a full stop he then fell upon a plate of mutton chops which disappeared into his mouth like a rushhour crowd going down an escalator we continued eating in silence captain hogg finished his chops and brought his knife and fork together with a flourish mr whimble he said sir the chief steward jumped and choked over a chop bone i have i suppose tasted worse chops than these in a fifthrate cafй on the mexican coast possibly why dont you throw the cook over the side if hed served filth like this to the captain when i was an apprentice the fellow would have had his bottom kicked round the deck im sorry captain whimble mumbled ill see to it i should think so you never get cooking like you used to all they think about these days are vitamins and calories and such stuff what goods that to a man fad thats all it is you dont need vitamins or calories he said with disgust eh doctor well they are really two quite different factors and vitamins are terribly important bosh im not a doctori dont pretend to be but if you get a good bellyful of meat and spuds every day youll be all right you must have vitamins i insisted but feebly vitamins are bosh doctor bosh i began to see that opinions were forbidden even professional ones our mealtimes were going to be rollicking chapter four the next morning after breakfast i went to my cabin wedged myself on the settee and again opened war and peace at page one i had not felt well enough to start the book since we sailed but now i looked forward to a leisurely stroll through its pages during the rest of the voyage i had almost reached the end of the first paragraph when a conversation started in the alleyway outside my cabin door the door was on a hook for ventilation so i was able to overhear it clearly there were two speakers who used the adenoidal grunts with which the citizens of liverpool communicate with each other ullo said one whatcher doin la come to seeing quack ar whatsing trouble la dunno reckon i mustve picked up aing dose or something where in liverpeule sright nice bit of skirt she was too you can never tell la ing right there a short silence whats quack like oh hes a younger reckon hes much good ing medical student most likely if we was homeward bound reckon id wait and see a proper doctor the sufferer said i opened the door good morning doc he added brightly can you see us a second in private like go down to the hospital i said coldly ill be along in a few minutes very good doctor when i arrived at the hospital i found that easter had diagnosed and prescribed for the condition with an efficiency founded on wide experience of it take these chum he said handing over a bottle of sulphathiazole tablets and in a couple of days youll be feeling like a box of birds as they say in new zealand the patient stuffed the bottle in his waistband and jauntily walked out dont you think i ought to give him a short lecture i suggested easter seemed to find this amusing we all has our thoughtless moments doctor dont we take a card he said abruptly drawing a pack from his pocket any one dont let me see it i took one automatically right he said i will now shuffle them see no deception you could have taken any card in the pack let me concentrate he screwed up his fat face in a spasm of thought four of diamonds he said that is perfectly correct though i hardly think we should be doing this sort of thing when we are supposed to be treating patients easter slipped the cards back into the top pocket of his jacket with a subdued air of triumph dr flowerday always liked me to show him a few tricks used to have him in fits sometimes didnt half get narked when he couldnt find how they was done and how was that one done if i may ask thems all four of diamonds actual easter said carelessly tapping his pocket you seem to be quite a specialist in this sort of thing for three years ashore i was pin hung the famous chinese magician round the halls mostly the northbarrow carlisle sunderland grimsby was my favourite always hit the jackpot in grimsby ive a book of cuttings down below all right later on in the voyage possibly he flicked three cards from his sleeve and manipulated them on the top of a tin of bandages now then doctor try your luck bet you a dollar that you cant spot the lady easter i said with interest how is it that you have come to land up in your present position a man of your peculiar talents would be far more at home on the racecourse than in a ships hospital thats the trouble doctor i worked the race trains for years but i got fed up with it you can get put inside too many times i stared at him do you meanare you trying to say that you have been in prison i was alarmed in shore practice this was not a condition usually found in ones colleagues ho yes he replied with the air of a man admitting he knew brighton or scarborough fairly well didnt like it much though too bloody cold in winter so you came to sea instead thats right doctor used to be on the western ocean run for donkeys years in the big passenger boats when i was a lad that is and could run about a bit more so i came back to it signed on as a steward its a good life and you gets your grub regular i took this job on when a mate of mine jumped ship in sydney and i helped out in the surgery homeward bound i like it better than waiting in the saloon more dignified and dr flowerday used to let me dispense of surplus equipment and stores on the coast if i could penicillin and such like that aint got long to go before its us that be all right with you doctor dr flowerday and i used to have an understanding about the proceeds i think we shall have to consider that later very good doctor theres one of the crew sick in his cabin then why the devil didnt you tell me before instead of fooling around with all these damn card tricks there aint no hurry doctor its only chippy the carpenter whats the matter with him hes having one of his turns i was suspicious a diagnosis of the turns to which over half of the middleaged population of the country seems liable can represent any condition from attacks of flatulence to fullblown epileptic fits wed better go and see him at once very good doctor i followed easter aft to the crews accommodation in the poop we went up an iron ladder to a door with carpenter and lamptrimmer stencilled over it it was a bleak little cabin with greenpainted steel bulkheads and a couple of metal bunks one above the other the only decoration was a photograph of an oblong tombstone with mothers grave written underneath it on the top bunk was the patient huddled under a grey ships blanket i gave him a shake a head poked out at me and i recognized the man with the lamp i had met at the top of the gangway he needed a shave there was dried saliva at the corners of his mouth and his eyes looked like a couple of cherries on a blancmange aghurrr he said now whats the trouble my man i started briskly he disregarded me his eyes were on something else in the cabin behind me he pointed shakily to the corner get away you bastards he yelled i jumped now dont get excited i said nervously he crouched into a corner of the bunk pulling the blanket tightly round him get away he screamed get away from me he brushed something from the bunk rail what is it i asked whats the trouble the man started muttering so that i had to lean closely over him to hear its them dogs he said bloody great alsatians bloody great green ones look five of the bastards i turned sharply round to easter this man has got dts i announced ho yes easter said casually not shifting from the doorway been having them for years long as i can remember anyway but we must do something about it i hope you realize this is a serious condition you seem to treat it very lightly he always gets em about this part of the trip hell be as right as rain for weeks now been on the booze since we sailed says it makes him sad leaving liverpool the patient rattled the bunk get your paws orf of my face he yelled if i might make so bold doctor easter said still leaning on the door i would say this was an occasion for the medical comforts medical comforts what on earth are you talking about bottle of brandy he explained its issued buckshee like for the hospital you can get another from the chief steward if you indent for it but i havent seen anything of this brandy i usually keeps it in my cabin doctor dr flowerday and i had an understanding about it is there any left almost half doctor he said proudly dr flowerday used to give him a glassful and talk to him gentle like as if he was a baby worked like a charm shall i fetch the bottle here they come again the patient shouted perhaps youd better i said i gave him a tumbler of brandy and explained that the five green alsatians were not really present like a nurse soothing a nightscared child after a couple of glasses and half an hours persuasion i had reduced the intruders to three in number and to terriers of normal colour i felt entitled to be satisfied with this i left the patient sleeping in his bunk with the empty glass in his hand and went back to my cabin seen many cases like him ashore easter asked with interest collecting the remains of the brandy no i have not there seems a great difference easter between the practice of medicine on shore and at sea funny you should say that same thing always struck me about the doctors chapter five it is remarkable what spiritual contentment can be obtained from washing your own socks i soaped a pair in the basin and hung them to dry on a line easter had stretched across my cabin i glowed with a modest sense of achievement this was the first time i had been obliged to do any washing which i had previously looked upon as an esoteric feminine function comparable with giving birth the crew of the lotus did their own launderingeven captain hogg who appeared in the early afternoon on the strip of deck round his cabin with a bundle of white uniforms under his arm and a basket of clothespegs the other officers hung their shirts over their bunks and smartened them afterwards in the bathroom with the third mates travelling iron down aft the crew set aside sunday afternoon for the laundry when it was usual to see large firemen and deckhands dressed only in underpants and tattoos scrubbing their singlets with bar soap in the firebuckets the clothes were then strung thickly round the winches and ventilators and flapped round the stern of the ship like some fantastic signal drying was simple for we had reached the tropics and the ships company was in white uniforms i had only to fix a white cover on my companys regulation cap but the officers appeared unexpectedly one morning in white shorts and shirts like a crop of snowdrops the other hands were less affected by the order easter changed his blue serge jacket for a white one but the rest were permitted the informality of uniform usual in the merchant service and did no more than roll their dungaree trousers halfway up their calves and remove their shirts we should have been in whites two days ago hornbeam grumbled its the old mans fault why whats he done now the old bastard sunbathes every afternoon and keeps us in blues until his knees are brown i felt i was becoming quite a sailor i let my days pass uncaringly carried away in the drift of the sea routine in a ship everybody seems constantly to be getting up or going to bed the watch changes every fourth hour which brings one of the mates warm from his bunk to the bridge and sends a couple of engineers scuttling down the complicated ladders into the engineroom and stokehold as well as the officers two abs go on the bridge to take turns at the wheel and a gang of greasers and firemen troop below all this movement is set off by the ships bell on the bridge which rings through each watch an arithmetical progression of halfhourly strokes members of the ships company who had no watches to keeppeople like whimble easter and myselfall arranged their days round the afterdinner siesta in the afternoon the whole ship died all hands apart from those essential for the running of the vessel tottered away from the saloon table and encouraged by a weighty meal and the noon session of gin crashed gratefully into their bunks this was a habit i found condemnable but irresistible in medical school and practice the afternoon had been my busiest time and i was determined to pass the hours between one and four studying war and peace at first i never drank before the meal and avoided the cooks suet roll of which captain hogg must have eaten several fathoms every voyage butwhether i was the subject of masssuggestion or sea air contains some subtle narcotici was unconscious before i got the taste of the ships cheese out of my mouth and i stayed asleep until easter shook me at four with a cup of tea and a small piece of confectionery known in the merchant service as a tabnab this habit i regarded nervously as the first indication of moral degeneration at fivethirty every evening my bath was run by boswell the bath steward boswell like easter had seen better days and the courtly manners he had learned in big p amp os and cunarders had not deserted him whatever the temperature he wore a shining white jacket a stiff wing collar and a black bow tie he would arrive at my cabin door at halfpast five precisely a clean blueandwhite towel folded over his arm and announce your bath awaits doctor as if it were an important delegation he followed me to the officers bathroom which smelled like a seaside cave at low tide spread the towel over the chair and mixed the water with his skinny hand he dipped in a footlong thermometer with a little metal bucket at the end anxiously inspecting the temperature and made a careful adjustment to the taps later i found the thermometer had not worked for several years he then poured some fresh hot water from a large shining copper can into a small bowl for the feet and laid on the white wooden rack across the bath my flannel a longhandled scrubbing brush a loofah and a bar of seawater soap would there be anything else you require sir he asked every evening i found it difficult to complicate such a simple act as taking a bath any further and he would bow deeply and retire backwards through the steam i knew he did so with disappointment for a bath suggested to him as many variations as soup to a french chef every few days he would press me to take a few spoonfuls of mustard in it or some washing soda or a tumbler of rosewater might i recommend a little sloanes he asked once i used to put it in regularly for one doctor i looked after in the cunard very good for the joints i believe boswells manners were unfortunately not sufficient to overcome the discomforts of the lotuss bathroom there were no portholes or ventilators so water collected on the deckhead as efficiently as in the main condenser in the engineroom and thence fell thickly in rusty brown drops the deck was covered with some crumbling material that left potholes to trip the bather and make him catch his head or his shins against sharp projecting pieces of steel the bath itself was shaped like a coffin and was furnished with a pair of fearsome taps that gave between them hot and cold sea water and a disproportionate amount of steam there was an alternativethe freshwater shower outside hornbeams cabin but owing to some subtle mechanical fault many feet below in the engineroom this emitted only icecold water or superheated steam and after escaping a thirddegree burn i decided to stick to the safe tepid waters under boswells supervision boswell did not stop at baths far greater was his pride in the officers lavatories these were not much more efficient than the bath and in rough weather became alarmingly unreliable but to boswell they were a porcelain monument to his own calling he spent the morning cleaning and polishing them and on our arrival for inspection would bow low and flush each as we passed with the jaunty pride of the satisfied artist theres more in lavatories than meets the eye sir he explained to me one day with a sigh youve got to understand lavatories to do this job i gathered from easter that as he contentedly did his morning task boswell dreamed of his retirement in charge of a small underground nest of them at one of the quieter corners of liverpool my professional duties were not exacting i saw a couple of patients in the morning perhaps half a dozen at five the most common trouble was the constipation doctor this i first treated with pharmacopoeial doses of the usual remedies but i soon found it was necessary to multiply the amount by three for most of the patients and by five for the bosn and firemen there were boils and warts a few burns from the engineroom and several vague illnesses whose leading symptom was a disinclination to work we had a few more cases resulting from careless choice of friends during our last nights in liverpool the approach to the medical attendant by sufferers from this embarrassing condition varied from the shifty requestwith a sidelong glance at easterto ave a word wiv you a minute doctor to the fullblooded storming of the surgery by the experienced invalid with his say doc can you fix this for us by friday at eleven we inspected the ship hornbeam whimble mcdougall and myself gathered outside the saloon door and saluted when captain hoggs boots appeared on the companionway from his cabin this homage he returned with the grace of a publican handing back a counterfeit halfcrown we lined up behind him and set off touring the decks each of us trying to look as disagreeable as possible we filed in and out of boswells lavatories with dignity and zealously searched for dust under the coconut matting the progress was broken only when captain hoggs eye was jarred by something that gave him displeasure when he would turn his fury not only on the man responsible but on his parents as well at first i shivered at the onslaught then i grew to appreciate the range and power of the captains imagination and the felicity with which he turned his sentences until i listened to him with fascination as for the victims they shrugged their shoulders and took no notice raving captains were just like storms at sea you had to put up with them until they blew themselves out and not become unreasonably excited after inspection the captain went on the bridge to supervise the daily ceremony of finding the noon position of the ship i went up there only once because captain hogg looked on visitors like a sour landowner spotting picnickers on his front lawn it was a shady restful place lined with dark wood and brass like an oldfashioned saloon bar the sea was surprisingly far below and the only sound was the irregular loud clicking of the gyro repeater like the ticking of an arrhythmic clock abaft the bridge was the chartroom where rulers setsquares and neatly sharpened pencils were arranged like a tidy school desk and the chronometers nestled under thick glass like a pair of premature infants in an incubator hornbeam once offered me his sextant and let me work out our position but i disgusted him by putting the lotus within a few miles of cleveland ohio i spent most of my time chatting to the officers off watch leaning on the rail playing quoits or nosing round the deck i was beginning to learn what everything was called ships have a distinct anatomy of their own and our daily rounds were as confusing to me as my first demonstrations in the dissecting room i recognized fairly early on the difference between port and starboard fore and aft and a binnacle and a barnacle but i was still uncertain where to find such obscure pieces of marine furnishing as the jumper stays the monkey island and the shrouds the tenth morning of the voyage i sat down resolutely in my cabin and took war and peace from the locker somehow i had not yet found time to pass the first page i opened it smoothed down the paper and began again the first paragraph hornbeam rattled the jalousie door and came in morning doc everything bearing an even strain good morning chief i said i think so thanks very much good picking up the first volume of war and peace he neatly squashed a cockroach that was scuttling across the bulkhead these damn roaches he said come out in families once it turns hot had any in bed with you no not yet he pulled a tobacco tin from his pocket would you like the makings he asked offering it no thank you im afraid its a nautical knack i havent picked up its easy enough cant stand tailormades he neatly rolled a cigarette between his fingers and thumbs whenever i tried the same manoeuvre i squeezed the tobacco out like the cream from an йclair wish youd have a look at the sparks doc hornbeam continued affably why whats the trouble i just saw him shake hands with a lifeboat ah yes i was rather afraid something like that might happen our wireless operator was probably the luckiest man on the ship he was one of those blithe people who live in a world of their own he had been at sea for forty years crouched over a telegraph key with the staccato song of morse in his ears this seemed to have induced psychological changes in him for the rest of us our universe was bounded by the steel and wooden limits of the lotusbut not the sparks he passed his day in the company of softskinned maidens and amiable philosophers with whom he could often be seen laughing conversing and singing while he walked round the deck or sat in the corner of his cabin sometimes he did a coy little dance with some of his companions or played a simple game and occasionally they would have a restrained tiff which always ended happily in the way just observed by the mate the sparks was by far the happiest person under captain hoggs command i suppose hes quite harmless i asked i mean he doesnt send out dangerous messages or anything oh hes not in that stage yet hornbeam assured me tolerantly ive seen a good many worse than him the morse gets em in the end i just thought you ought to know i saw him kissing a ventilator yesterday he added darkly we are all entitled to our little aberrations i suppose youre right there doc life at sea wouldnt be possible without a bit of give and take old sparks is all right just a bit dippy like some of these tanker types tanker types he nodded lighting the cigarette and filling the cabin with smoke men in tankers its a dogs life they run to places like the persian gulf and they can unload in a couple of days that means the boys dont get much of a run ashore when theyre home besides you cant live on top of a few thousand tons of petrol all your life without getting a bit queer of course they get the moneybut is it worth it friend of mine went mate in a tanker to make a bit and ended up by cutting his throat made a hell of a mess in the chartroom so they told me from hornbeams conversation i gathered that suicide at sea had a panache not seen ashore i think ill stick to dry cargo i said that seems dangerous enough for doctors are you coming to the thirds do tonight hornbeam asked thats the reason i looked in i didnt know he was having one its his birthdaytwentyfirstand hes having a few beers youre invited i dont drink much you know oh dont be scared doc none of us drinks while were at sea ill say youre coming the party was after supper in the third mates cabin as i was anxious not to appear at all antisocial i was the first to arrive i had not been in his cabin before it was smaller than mine with just enough room for a man to stand between the bunk and the strip of settee on the opposite bulkhead there was a porthole over the settee and a forceddraught vent in the deckhead that stabbed a narrow stream of cold air across the bunk opposite the door was a small desk covered completely with bottles of gin the rest of the cabin was covered with girls they were everywherein frames over the bunk pasted to the bulkhead suspended from the pipes crossing the deckhead there were plain photographs of ordinary girls shadowy nudes from men only taut scissorlegged girls in impossible brassiйres from esquire a few bright beer advertisements from australia of surprised but unresisting girls with their skirts caught in mangles car doors stiles and dog leads girls with no clothes playing on the beach girls with all their clothes caught in a highly selective gale even pictures of chinese girls covered from neck to ankle come in doc the third said have a peg he pushed a glass into my hand and halffilled it with gin in one motion happy birthday i said faintly you seem to have an eye for art got to brighten the old cart up a bit heres to you he pointed above the bunk to the photograph of a sharpchinned young lady trying earnestly to look like dorothy lamour thats a nice bit of crumpet met her in hull last voyage shes an intelligent bit mind you he added seriously works in boots library he indicated her rival next to her now theres a girl for you came across her in adelaide last time we were there her brother came and socked me on the nose she still writes to me though i hope he didnt hurt you he did a bit hes one of the wharfies that ones from st john but this sheila heres the best of the bunch lives in durban fathers got pots of cash you seem to scatter your affections pretty widely they all love sailors when a girl knows a fellows going halfway round the world in a weeks time she takes the brakes off a bit have a seat on the bunk i sat down and rested my head uncomfortably on the paper bosom of a blonde the other guests arrived together there was hornbeam the crazy sparks whimble the second steward and the chief second third and fourth engineers archer was absent keeping hornbeams watch on the bridge the ten of us crammed ourselves into the tiny cabin hornbeam had his elbow in my face and his shoes on the chief engineers knees whimble wedged himself behind the door and stuck his feet against the end of the bunk the host struggled between everyones legs handing out drinks i felt that something would shortly give way and project the lot of us into the sea the thirds health was drunk by all hands have another doc he said no really come off it its only five bob a bottle he halffilled my tumbler again how do you like the sea he asked it is a very interesting form of existence of course you realize this is only part of it hornbeam explained it varies a good bit as you know british ships are in three classes tankers no first of all theres the p amp o then theres the merchant navy which is the setup were in after that theres the old grey funnel line also known as the royal navy mcdougall explained it was nationalized years ago the p amp o must not be confused with ordinary hookers hornbeam continued its a sort ofwell a floating horse guards if you get me they hate to be called merchantmen if you make a noise drinking your soup they wear swords and spurs trail said i dont believe it well they ought to oh very posh very posh good shower of bastards on the whole though have some more gin not forqh all right as youve poured it out it tastes better than the stuff you get ashore everything does by the way you know the second engineer doc mr macpherson pleased to meet you mr mcphail the third and mr macintosh the fourth what are you all scots in the engineroom weve a taffy and a couple of geordies macpherson said had to have them in to do the dirty work you know what they say mcdougall added proudly if you open the engineroom hatch of any british ship and shout jock someonell be bound to come up mcphail started singing i belong to glasgow but petered out for lack of support coming ashore with us in santos doc hornbeam asked certainly i intend to take advantage of the voyage to broaden my education santos will broaden it all right plenty of nice girls there im sure i should be pleased if youd introduce me to them this remark started everyone laughing you dont need any introductions its keeping them away thats the trouble well i shall not be interested in meeting any of that sort oh youll have to come with us to madame mimis hornbeam said reproachfully it would be like going to london and missing the houses of parliament are you suggesting i said coldly that i should visit a brothel where the hell else do you think there is to go in santos trail said testily anyway madame mimis is as respectable as the liverpool museum i wouldnt put that past suspicion hornbeam said trail cut the conversation short by pouring out gin all round and beginning a complicated story about two sailors losing their way in lime street station after an hour everyone was pretty cheerful dont make such a row trail said fatherll hear to hell with father i heard myself say spoken like a sailor doc hornbeam slapped me on the chest good old doc best one ive ever sailed with i say really youre the only one thats sane this brought a round of applause youre all mad at sea i said defiantly the lot of you the company immediately indicated their disbelief with the usual word you are i said or you wouldnt be here have some more gin trail said thank you i swallowed another mouthful as i was saying i have made a diagnosis from carefulnot to say exactingstudy of you in the past ten days i conclude that youre all suffering from the death wish what the hells that mcdougall asked angrily i held up a hand silence as a disciple of hippocrates i demand respect and silence the death wish when you are born all you want to do is die this again filled the cabin with derision shut up you blokes let the poor blighter speak trail said i continued that is what the psychologists say some people hang themselves others go into monasteries andand things some climb mountains and live in caves others write poetry look at english poetry i demanded hotly of hornbeam look at it redolent with the death wish i screwed up my eyes and struck an attitude of recitation for many a time i have been half in love with easeful death i declaimed stumblingly calld him soft names in many a musиd rhyme to take into the air my quiet i slipped off the bunk but hornbeam caught me death wish to the eyebrows the lot of you you withdrawto sea to sea thats what it is youre full of prunejuice doc someone said i will not have insults i cried if you would care to defend yourself like a gentleman i shall take you up on it you have the death wish by god youve all got it so had nelson ive got it as well i fell over mcdougalls feet and no one bothered to pick me up chapter six the next morning i was suffering from a sharp attack of the death wish but my performance had raised me surprisingly in the eyes of my shipmates my earnest years as a medical student my dignified excursion into practice my prim approach to seafaring had built a scaffold underneath me the third mates gin had slipped the bolt my companions were relieved to find that i was not only sane but human for my part i began to realize that the sea which washes away terrestrial affectations and inhibitions had a great deal to recommend it sailors are of the few remaining people who make their way in companies across the unsignposted face of the world with the help of the sun and the stars and spend most of their lives lying at the unhindered fancy of the weather their sense of values in human and elemental behaviour is therefore unblunted they look on their existence as a long uproarious joke relieved by not unentertaining interludes of necessary tragedy i thought them the last of the elizabethans i believe there is no process so restful as moving at bicycle pace through the sunshine of the south atlantic we were steaming at ten knots which meant we should be about three weeks reaching santos the metallic fragment of england in which we all existedexcept the wireless operatorcreaked easily onwards with a faint haze of smoke rolling from the funnel scattering the nimble flying fish with her bow even crossing the line caused no more disturbance than my having to stand drinks all round the hot sun welded the days together so that they became indistinguishable it was impossible to tell whether it was tuesday or thursday and it didnt matter only twice a week were we reminded of the calendarfriday and sunday at fourthirty on friday afternoons we had boat drill captain hogg stood on the bridge and pulled the cord of the whistle which sent us scurrying up the ladders in our blueandorange lifejackets to the boatdeck i was in boat number four in charge of the third mate who ticked our names off with a rollcall i was alarmed to find that among my companions in an emergency would be the carpenter with a tendency to dts and a pleasantfaced greaser who i heard from easter had just returned from a tenyear stretch for armed robbery swing out captain hogg shouted through the loud hailer the canvas covers were stripped off the boats and three men set to the handle of each davit to lean it out from the ships side when this had been done to captain hoggs satisfaction the boats were swung in again and everyone dispersed board of trade sports trail said with disgust waste of time why do we do it then i asked oh it has to go in the logbook thered be hell in liverpool if we didnt some skippers cook the log but not this baby anything to give him a chance of bawling through a loud hailer sunday was recognizable as it was the only occasion when we flew the flag at sea from eight to midday the red ensign waved from the gaff on the mainmast to convince the almighty that we had not forgotten himfor there was no one else but ourselves to see it the appearance of the flag that symbolized the sabbath was greeted warmly by all hands not through reverence but because under ministry of transport regulations we all got an extra halfdays pay sunday was also marked by the ceremony of full inspection this was ordered by captain hoggs copy of instructions for masters the manual through which the fathom steamship company directed and advised their commanders which contained in its yellow pages regulations designed to right such nautical disasters as mutiny epidemics of smallpox lost anchor and imminent shipwreck at eleven oclock the four of us fell in behind the captain who indicated the exceptional occasion by carrying a torch and a walkingstick on the poop the ships company was lined up ready for usdeckhands under the charge of the bosn on the port side firemen and greasers to starboard and catering staff in fresh white jackets standing nervously athwartships captain hogg passed down the ranks scowling into each face like a vengeful but shortsighted victim at an identification parade then we marched in and out of the little greenpainted crews cabins that each smelt of feet and hairoil they had been cleaned and tidied so that nothing in the slightest degree disturbing could fall into the captains visual fields the decks were scrubbed the blankets folded ostentatiously and the owners possessionsvarying from a guitar to a caged canarywere set in unnaturally tidy piles captain hogg shone his torch beneath the bunks inspected the undersurfaces of tables and chairs and thrust the crook of his walkingstick into every inviting orifice usually his rummaging produced nothing more than a cloud of dust and an empty beertin but occasionally he would drag out a saloon plate a silver coffeepot a mildewed loaf a pair of underpants or the crumpled photograph of an inconstant girl friend mr hornbeam he would shout waving the find under the mates nose whats the meaning of this eh well find the chronometers in here next the last call was my hospital sunday was the only occasion when it was inspected and easter spent the morning polishing the brasswork and tipping all the small movable objects and surgical debris into a large white bin labelled sterile dressings as we arrived he stood smartly to attention beside the door hiding a large black patch on the bulkhead all correct doctor the captain growled every sunday yes sir all correct he fixed easter with his eye any complaints i am very happy captain easter replied unctuously all right pipe down bosn the crew were scattered to their sunday indolence and we went up to the captains cabin where we stood in a line in front of him our caps under our arms and he emphasized the points that had incurred his disapproval then we all sat down and had a gin there were no religious observances on board the lotusan omission that was deplored only by easter this surprised me i didnt know you were a churchgoer i told him ho yes doctor i likes a nice service of a sunday breaks the monotony a bit not much good in an old tub like this but in the big passenger boats i used to sing hymns at the back ive got a bit of a voice he added modestly im very pleased to hear it used to take the plate round as well real nice job that is must be the sea air what makes them generous you see them old skinflints what wouldnt give a tanner to a blind baby at home sticking in quids and suchlike made quite a bit out of that in my time you mean you actually helped yourself from the collection sort of commission as you might say he explained amiably nothing much mind you no one knows what there is in the kitty but youve got to be pretty nifty slipping it out before the purser spots you charity begins at home dont it doctor my clinical practice continued its easy routine and was centred round preservation of the health of the captains stomach i had never known an organ to produce such widespread clinical effects if it functioned painlessly life was tolerable even at mealtimes but the first twinges of dyspepsia immediately communicated themselves to everyone on board fortunately i was able to denature my mixture of its explosive properties and it combated spiritually with the captains diet my morning visit to him with the sicklist gave me an opportunity to see how the battle was going by judging the state of the old gentlemans tempera matter of importance on the ship beyond the belief of any landsman if he was in a good mood he took the chit without question and sometimes even demonstrated extreme geniality by offering me a gin he saw nothing unusual in drinking after breakfast if my mixture was not up to strength or if he had eaten too many platefuls of madras curry the night before he would seize the paper and scowl at it like a tudor monarch affirming a list of executions whats wrong with that man he would demand stabbing the sheet with his blunt finger mcklusky j ordinary seaman whys he off duty whats thispuo pyrexia of unknown origin sir i explained timidly he had a temperature well why has he im afraid i dont know sir why dont you youre the doctor arent you what the devil do you think would happen to us all if i didnt know a lighthouse when i saw one eh what have you got to say to that he slammed the paper down on his desk i said nothing to it now look here doctor he went on im not in your line and i dont pretend to be but i can tell you whats wrong with this manhes constipated i havent been to sea for forty years for nothing give the bastard a double dose of black draught and kick him back on duty if he still shirks ill put him in the logbook thats an order yes sir this put me in a state of professional agitation but captain hogg would have agitated the whole general medical council the captain was at his most terrifying when conducting the ceremony of placing an offenders name in the logbook this was the only disciplinary action left in his hands flogging at the mainmast keelhauling and hanging from the yardarm at sunset have been abolished by parliament and captain hogg made it plain that he thought the world all the worse for it one night shortly after we reached the tropics i was pulled from my bunk by hornbeam to see a couple of firemen who had been fighting in the focsle both of them were drunk they were in the hospital bloodspattered and muttering surly threats at each other separated by easter with the heavy pestle from the drug locker now keep quiet for the doctor he said cheerfully or ill bash your ruddy brains in with this these two have filled each other in something proper he added to me as a clinical explanation during the two hours needed to sew them up i gathered that the pair of them kelly and crosby came from the opposite sides of a liverpool street and a feud had smouldered between them since they first threw stones at each other from the shelter of their mothers skirts too late they had found themselves both aboard the lotus and had been living in grudging amicability since we sailed but that evening kelly had been unable to repress any longer his opinion that crosbys mother was not only a harlot but the oldest and most ugly in all liverpool and crosby cracked the end of a bottle and went for him the next morning at ten i was summoned to the captains cabin which had the ceremonially grim air of a portsmouth courtmartial sitting at the desk was captain hogg an expression on his face of uninhibited malevolence set before him were his goldbraided cap instructions for masters the logbook open at the correct page a sheet of yellow blottingpaper and a large silver inkpot with a pen in it so that everything was at hand for making the damning entry hornbeam was in a chair beside the captain looking seriously at his own feet the bosn and the donkeyman were positioned on each side of the door and i was ordered curtly to the corner in the middle of the circle were the two delinquents twisting their caps in their hands and throwing nervous glances round the cabin from the gaps in their bandages right captain hogg began briskly now we are all assembled we can begin first of all i want to make something perfectly plain to you two you are going to get a completely fair hearing this morning understand you are quite at liberty to put questions to me or any other of the officers you may call any witness you like in your defence as far as im concerned a man is innocent until hes proved guilty whether its murder or pinching a hapenny stamp youll never find me giving a man a bad character till its proved im a fair captain i am get me the two firemen nodded hesitantly very well now tell me your version of the affair he folded his arms judicially the feud that had burned so brightly a few hours before was now outshone by the peril that faced the two opponents they had composed a story during breakfast which was begun by kelly in the tone of bitter repentance that had occasionally swayed sympathetic members of a magistrates bench well sir it was like this ere sir me and me mate was avin a cupper tea you bloody liar captain hogg shouted you were rotten drunk both of you bastards oh yes you were dont answer me back or ill kick you round the deck you were drunk in the focsle and you started fighting like the pair of goddam cutthroats you are my god youre a crowd of loafers up forrard you oughtnt to be at sea you ought to be in jail the lot of you stand up straight when im talking to you blast you he thrust a finger under kellys nose you turn my ship into a liverpool roughhouse and you come up here with some cockandbull story you think im going to swallow what do you take me for eh i was at sea when you were playing marbles in the filth of a liverpool gutter mr hornbeam sir you found these men fighting hornbeam nodded doctor sir did you or did you not find these men were drunk well sir the scientific tests there you are the doctor agrees with me you were soused the pair of you he banged the desk with his fist making the pen leap out of the inkpot do you know what id like to do to you he demanded id like to give you every holystone on board and make you scrub the boatdeck till the plates showed through then id put you in irons in the chainlocker and keep you on bread and water till we got back to liverpool thats the sort of treatment scum like you need id like to put you in an open boat here and now and get rid of the pair of you for good do you understand you couple of lazy sons of bitches but fortunately the captains justice was obligatorily tempered with mercy fined five shillings he muttered good morning it was fortunate that captain hogg was through reason of his being a captain confined most of the day to his own quarters he passed his time sitting in an armchair reading magazines similar to the one hiding his face on the first occasion i met him in the corner of his cabin was a pile three feet high of these periodicals from all parts of the englishspeaking world he consumed them earnestly and steadily like a man with plenty of time looking up a train in bradshaw theres one thing i do like he announced at dinner one day a forkful of beef and vegetables at his mouth and thats a good book for the rest of the voyage i bowed to his opinions like a victorian schoolboy and took the greatest pains possible to avoid him the leader of the opposition in the lotus was the chief engineer mcdougall he alone of the engineers had unresented entry into the saloon and our company the mates looked upon them instinctively as intruders a relic of the days when thin funnels first poked their way through the proud canvas the engineers lived away from the rest of us in tiny hot cabins clustered amidships and ate in a pokey messroom ventilated by the oily breath of the engines we saw them only when they leant over the rail in their black and sweaty boiler suits or lay on their backs dissembling one of the pieces of ugly machinery that sprung from the lotuss deck mcdougall had a noisy cabin by the engineroom hatchway in which he received visitors with a halftumbler of neat whisky he maintained that gin was a drink fit only for harlots his surroundings were as untidy as a nursery scraps of steel and paintpots littered the deck the bunk sagged under pieces of dismantled machinery and the bulkheads supported charts graphs a row of sombre engineering books and an incongruous nude leaving her bath on a boilermakers calendar scattered everywhere like thistledown blown by a breeze were scraps of halfused cotton waste where would ye all be without my engines he demanded do ye know what youve got to thank us for everything from the propeller revolutions to your shaving water and the ice in your gin he thought of his engines as boswell did of his lavatories as living beings possessed of souls yell be no damn good as an engineer till you make friends with your engines he told me talk to em thats what youve got to do give em hell if they play you up it pays in the end lad many a times ive had a row with me mates or the wife and its been a comfort to know ive got a real pal down below if ye cut my veins doc yell find fuel oil there not blood mcdougall believed that the best engineers came from scotland the best scots from glasgow and the only effect of modern innovations like oil furnaces engineroom ventilation and refrigerators was a glaring deterioration in the standard of young men coming to sea when he showed me round his engineroom he exhibited the reverence of an old dean in his cathedral we stood on the quivering control platform in the centre of the lotuss clamorous viscera and he waved his arm proudly and shouted this is where we do a mans job doc i nodded looking nervously at the pipes straining with the pressure of superheated steam thats the main steam gauge mcdougall explained pointing to a dial on the panel in front of us whats the red line for i shouted back that och thats the safety mark but i say isnt the needle well past it that doesnt matter lad weve got to get the old tub moving somehow he took me down greasy ladders along a narrow catwalk between pieces of spinning machinery through the boilerroom where turnbull the geordie seventh engineer sweated eight hours of his twentyfour watching the oil fires we crouched along the tunnel that carried the propeller shaft to the stern and stood at the end in a little triangular humid space where the thick revolving metal pierced the plates and disappeared into the sea there ye are doc all us lads and all that machinery to keep this turning if it wasnt for us that old windbag on the bridge would be out of a job he doesnt seem to be very appreciative chief och weve got better than him conducting the trams in glasgow mcdougall said with disgust you watch doc ill run him off this ship before hes much older you wait and see mcdougalls threat was wholly serious he had in a locked drawer in his cabin a foolscap book labelled shamelessly hogg in which he entered immediately every derogatory fact he discovered about the captain when he was particularly annoyed he took the book out and read it underlining in red ink wherever he thought a passage was not sufficiently condemnatory standing on its own this book he sent to the marine superintendent of the fathom line by registered post every time the ship returned to britain but its effect was largely cancelled by a similar volume about mcdougall put in the superintendents hands by the captain the two passed their lives in a running fight on oil consumption engine revolutions and repair bills and the daily ceremony by which mcdougall handed captain hogg a chit on his speed and fuel supplies was always conducted in bitter silence about once a week the captain became too much for him and the chief engineer then shut himself in his cabin took out a fresh bottle of whisky and determinedly threw the cap through the porthole as the ships company became used to me they paid me the compliment of sharing their troubles with me i soon discovered all of them were hypochondriacs in small ships where they had no doctor they worried in case they caught anything in bigger ships where there was a doctor living down the alleyway they brought along their symptoms like bruised children running to their mother the second mate was the severest sufferer from hypochondriasis the locker in his cabin was a therapeutic bar he had five different brands of antiseptic all the popular stomach powders lotions for rubbing under the arms and between the toes drops for sticking in his eyes or up his nose gargles and liniments hairfood and skinbalm and a frightening collection of purgatives i found him gargling lustily in his cabin one afternoon hello second i said whats up got a cold he spat guiltily into the basin as though i had caught him at some wickedness no he explained i always gargle three times a day i was reading an article in happy health that said that every cubic inch of air is loaded with millions of microbes well sos every inch of your throat listen doc he went on sounding worried theres something ive been wanting to ask you for a long time where could i get my blood cholesterol measured your what yes you see there was an article ineither the readers digest or one of the sunday papers at homethat said some doctors in california had discovered if your blood cholesterol was above milligrams per cent you were bound to get arteriosclerosis ive all the symptoms i youre far more likely to fall down a hatch and break your neck do you think so he asked eagerly still its got me worried im sure ive got an intervertebral disk as well theres a pain i get round here in my back every time i sit down rubbish youre healthier than i am he looked dolefully at his medicine chest for a few moments of course he continued what i really need is a woman im inclined to agree with you i said i sat down reflectively on his bunk i had become aware in the past few days of feelingnot blatantly sexstarved but unquestionably peckish i put it down to the sea air my life ashore had passed undisturbed except for wendy and occasional vague thoughts that it would be nice to take a girl to the pictures but now i began to think even the girls in the third mates cabin were delightful wendy herself became frighteningly glamourized as my minds eye behaved like a magazine photographers lens and substituted curves for angularity and an inviting expression for the usual one that indicated she thought her nose was running now if this was a real passenger ship the second continued everything would be squared up by now have you been in one this is my first ship i forgot i was third in one for a bit it was like a floating ball of kirriemuir i dont know what it is as soon as these females get aboard a ship theyre all after you not a moments peace then theres dances and race meetings and all the fun and games not to mention the moonlight and the phosphorescence on the water i havent seen any phosphorescence yet but they fall for it every time the places they get to we found one couple on the steering engine i used to go under the lifeboats what about the captain he was at it like everyone else he jacked himself up a nice bit of snicket first day out of southampton what a trip that was i take it youre not married i said ive been married got hitched during the war when i was a third it didnt work out weve split it up now he took a cigarette out of the tin thoughtfully its no good being married at sea oh yes every leaves a honeymoon i know what they say but long voyages and young wives dont mix you leave the allotment of your pay and if you dont get a letter at every port you wonder whats up anyhow i reckon you cant ask a girl to sit by the fireside for six months or a year or two years maybe it isnt fair it isnt human what about you i asked oh i always hold youre entitled to count yourself as single at sea he said our reflections were interrupted by the engineroom telegraph ringing faintly on the bridge above whats that i asked i thought they tested them at noon i expect shes stopped archer said calmly stopped but isnt that important she often stops its the first time shes done it this trip somethings blown up down below i suppose come on deck from now on its usually pretty funny we stepped onto the sunny deck just below the wing of the bridge the lotus had stopped sure enough she wallowed in the swell like a dead whale now watch the second said captain hogg appeared on the bridge he had been disturbed in his siesta and was dressed only in a tartan dressinggown he looked like macbeth the day the wood moved mr mcdougall he shouted mr mcdougall he banged the rail with his fist quartermaster present my compliments to the chief engineer and ask him to come to the bridge aye aye sir captain hogg clasped his hands behind him and strode fiercely across the deck after five minutes mcdougall appeared he was in a boilersuit and held in his hand a scrap of cotton waste material that appears as indispensable to engineers as stethoscopes to doctors they glared across the bridge playing havoc with each others blood pressure the ships stopped captain hogg announced aye said mcdougall i know wellwhy the devil has she stopped mcdougall lit his pipe you tell me capn and then well both know damn it mr mcdougall cant you keep the ship going between ports not this ship when i first came to sea engineers took their orders from the bridge their job was to raise steam and keep it when i first came to sea capns behaved like gentlemen i will not be spoken to like that i will speak to ye how i like ill have you put in the logbook mr mcdougall ill report ye to the company capn i will not be obstructed by a pigheaded scot an i will not be told my job by an ignorant sassenach damn you sir and damn you too at that moment the argument was annulled by the telegraph ringing again and the lotus slowly getting under way its always like that the second said you know how it is oil and water wont mix chapter seven the voyage extended the ship ran deeply into the tropics and captain hogg started work on his masters letter from santos we stayed fairly peaceful until the afternoon he threw the chief steward down the bridge ladder whimble was the most introverted and anxious member of the lotuss company and he had a strict rule on boardhe never drank when he came to my cabin early in the voyage and i recalled that the social formula of my new life demanded i offered him a peg he grasped his abdomen with a sigh of horror not a drop doctor he declared never touch a dram of it what not at all finding a teetotaller in the lotus was like running into a sober scot on burns night not for twenty years its my liver doctor he warily indicated the region of his umbilicus i had a real bad turn in cardiff five operations and left to die three times i need say no more to you need i doctor no no more at all so i said to myself walter i said be a man not another drink youre going to have till your dying day and not a drops soiled my lips since willpower doctor thats what it is i used to do pelmanism a bit when i was younger when i passed this information to hornbeam illuminated with admiration he pushed his cap back on his head and roared with laughter hes right in a way doc he said youll never see him with a glass in his hand he keep it in his locker mostly or his hotwater can or under the bunk he gets a bottle a day easybuckshee of course pinches it from the bondroom and fiddles the bar accounts so its poor beggars like you and me that have to pay for it in the end he cooks the books does he i said in surprise id have thought he was too timid to be dishonest dont you believe it there isnt a chief steward afloat who wouldnt flog the funnel if he thought he could get away with it i observed whimble fairly closely after that once hornbeam had given me the diagnosis it was simple to pick out the symptoms in the early morning when he did his round of the galley and the stores he was a pale and nervous man who flattened himself against the bulkhead when he glimpsed captain hoggs threatening silhouette at the other end of the alleyway at nine he paid his daily visit to the little bondroom below the waterline and came up with the ships supply of liquor after that he went to his cabin to clean his teeth he reappeared slightly flushed and took his place in the inspection procession with confidence then he cleaned his teeth again he found it necessary to clean his teeth before dinner at teatime and on several occasions during the evening by ten at night when he prepared the captains sandwiches in the pantry his spectacles were awry and he sang snatches of bawdy songs as he slapped on the mustard with a flourish the end of his day was marked shortly afterwards by the flash of a bottle sailing out of his porthole and the light splash as it hit the water and joined the others that marked at neatly regular intervals the progress of the chief steward round the world to restore this and other profitable discrepancies whimble was forced to spend several hours a day sitting in his tiny office with the storebooks and a readyreckoner biting his pen and working out worried sums on a scrap of paper fathers very hard very hard he explained to me one day always chasing me up over the catering and the company looks at every grain of rice they give you what dyou think theyd do if i was a pound of butter out at the end of the voyage he indicated the sea with his thumb it would be out walter me boy and no mistake i dont know how i make ends meet sometimes really i dont his problem was not so much making ends meet but arranging them to do so with a worthwhile overlap the drawers under his bunk were filled with tins of ham peaches lard tongue and pineapple which were ready to be slipped over the side to a furtive rowingboat our first night in port tins of cigarettes were stacked behind his books in the office and two or three bottles of whisky were locked in the glass locker with the ostentatious label for entertainment of customs if youre wanting any medical stores on the coast doc he confided in me when i dressed a cut on his hand one evening let me have the list and well split the comish fiftyfifty very kind of you im sure of course there wont be much in it there isnt much of anything in this hooker in a big passenger job thats different the purser gets his comish on everything down to the bellboys tips why the barman in one of those makes more than the old man he looked gratefully at his fresh bandage if you want a few bottles of scotch to flog the other end it might be arranged he added generously i can get it ashore for you trust walter never touch a drop of it myself mind you whimble had justification enough for secret drinking at our expense in the captains table manners alone captain hogg made a point of complaining at least once a meal about the menu or cooking beef he would exclaim contemptuously spitting out a halfchewed morsel as big as a golf ball flearidden cow more likely where the devil did you dig this up from mr whimble fresh on board this trip sir saw it loaded with my own eyes if i may respectfully say so sir i dont believe you mr whimble youve had this in the freezer since last voyage or im a dutchman what do you say eh doctor as there was no point in disagreeing with the captain about anything i nodded sympathetically when he was especially enraged with a dish captain hogg would lift his plate shoulder high bellow steward and demand throw that muck over the side and bring us a decent piece of bread and cheese this he would eat glaring at whimble in a silence broken only by the rhythmical snapping of his jaws on other occasions he would suddenly be overcome with longings like a pregnant woman mr whimble he would demand in the middle of a plate of liver and bacon why dont we ever have any avocado pears or steward are there any pikelets on board after the meagre nourishment of my students lodgings and the gps table the portions served in the lotuss saloon looked heavy with the threat of dyspepsia but the sea air and the prospect of sleeping all afternoon soon led to my eating as much as anyone else apart from captain hogg the menu was conservative like a good commercial hotels and ran mostly to joints and puddings all of them were prepared with care by the first cook a large softeyed likeable man who sweated among his spitting roasts in the galley whistling and basting the meat with the delight of an esteemed craftsman a contented cook doc he said and you gets a contented crew he whistled a few bars nice leg of pork cold for supper fond of crackling im glad youre contented i told him most of the cooks i meet ashore seem to have duodenal ulcers he wiped his hands on his trousers and felt in his hip pocket thats why im contented he said he flourished a photograph of a thin simpering young woman in an offtheshoulder dance frock sweetest little girl in the world thats the wife youre a very lucky man yes doc i reckon i am one of the luckiest of the lot howd you like a bit of dressed crab as well he added glowing with bonhomie i could always open a tin but already three thousand miles away disaster was being prepared for the lotuss cooking the next afternoon easter came to my cabin and said beg pardon doctor but the cook reckons he wants to do himself in what you mean commit suicide thats right doctor hes been on the booze since dinner and the lads spotted him rigging up a bit of rope in his cabin good heavens man havent you done something about it ho its all right now easter said calmly the bosn slugged him and hes out cold hell be tame enough when he comes to its always the same they never string themselves up in the end but whats the trouble i asked it seemed barely credible he struck me as a happy enough sort of fellow sheilas easter said with contempt drive a man to it some of them dont they doctor his wifes vamoosed with a busdriver just got a cable from his pal to say so thats a bit of tough luck he seemed to be pretty fond of her it aint the first time its happened by a long chalk cor ive seen these bits waving goodbye to their husbands at the docks then going home to collect the allotment a quid a week regular and ending up with black babies and suchlike there aint no depths doctor what women wont stoop to and the worse they treat the blokes the more they seem to like em mugs aint we well i think youd better keep an eye on the cook i told him perhaps i should have a chat with himpsychology you know i hope he wont let it interfere with his cooking the next morning was sunday the cook was back at workbut a sad lonely tuneless man he pottered miserably round the galley pausing every now and then to break into unexpected tears over the carrots or the boiling duff suddenly he would cry out startlingly rosie rosie i love you then he would fall silent and look grimly along the edge of his carvingknife under the terrified glance of the galleyboy who crouched over the potatobucket the sunday dinner nevertheless appeared on the saloon table rosie could not have chosen a worse day for her defection for the menu was the longest of the week there was always scotch broth boiled turbot steakandkidney pie beef carrots boiled and roast potatoes and plum duff all of which the captain consumed steadily and usually without complaint but that day the cooks grief had intruded into the meal the soup was cold and captain hogg flung his spoon into the plate after the first mouthful with the command steward chuck this dishwater into the scupper the turbot was underdone and it was barely touched by anyone only the steakandkidney pie seemed up to the usual standard give us a big helping the captain growled if the rests as filthy as the soup it wont be worth eating call yourself a chief steward mr whimble youre not fit to be in charge of an icecream barrow he began eating his pie in silence we were all a little bad tempered for sunday dinner was pleasantly anticipated and we had prepared ourselves with extra morning gin i watched the captain sorting out the portions of kidney and felt thankful for the sake of our digestions that peace had fallen on the table captain hogg suddenly jumped to his feet he held his napkin to his mouth and his face was the colour of the port light look he hissed look at that his finger quivered in the direction of his food whimble nervously stretched across the table and removed from a pile of piecrust a dental plate with three teeth attached to it oh dear whimble said is it yours the captain thundered oh no sir ive never seen it before sir captain hogg thrust his napkin forward put it in that he commanded the teeth in a pool of gravy were wrapped up i am taking this up to my cabin and stowing it in the safe i am then showing it to the general manager the minute we arrive in liverpool by god ill see you pay for this mr whimble shaking his fist he left the saloon pausing to shout an order for cold ham and pickles in his cabin we sat in silence the pie going cold in front of us whimble tried to take a drink of water but he was shaking so much he spilled it over the cloth i dont think i want any more hornbeam said pushing his plate away whose are they doc yours theyre probably the cooks hes been a bit forgetful this morning whimble croaked the cook he jumped from the table eager to pass on his castigation the gentle easygoing cook who filched tins of ham and corned beef through whimbles good graces was the only person on board whom he could bully pausing only to clean his teeth on the way he confidently made for the galley but it was a changed cook whom he found sitting on the potato locker with a ginbottle crooning to himself he saw the accident in a different light before whimble could say anything he was gripped by the shirt a choppingknife pointed at his throat and the cook demanded give me my bloody teeth back whimble broke away with a shout that brought us all from the saloon we found him running down the deck chased by the cook who had his knife in his hand and was wearing a frightening toothless snarl murder whimble shouted the cook was not steady on his feet fell over a stay and burst into tears but whimble had no time to see this his only thoughts were of selfprotection and he decided the unpleasantness represented by captain hogg was less than that embodied in the cook he jumped up the ladder to the bridge and hammered on the door of the captains cabin help he cried save me the door was flung open what the blazes is the matter with you look said whimble pointing behind him are you mad the cooks after me with a knife he whimpered calming at the sight of captain hogg he wants his teeth back teeth teeth did you say teeth get off my bridge hell murder me get off my bridge damn you give me the cooks teeth first captain hogg picked whimble up by his shirt collar and gave him a push he uttered a little squeal as he lost his balance at the top of the ladder and came sliding down feet first at that moment the steward was mounting it with the captains tray of ham and pickles there goes our supper hornbeam said gloomily after that no one thought it worth while finishing the meal chapter eight the next morning my professional tranquillity was split like an old sail in a storm i had settled down in my cabin after breakfast to read war and peace with which i first killed three or four cockroaches when easter came in he showed me a new card trick and described the occasion when he was steward on a greek tramp and had won from the skipper an incorrigible but luckless gambler as a final stake one night in the mediterranean the exclusive services of his stout but agreeable wife until gibraltar theres something doctor easter went on one of the crew took queer in the night whats wrong with him vomiting and suchlike shall i chase him up here i think wed better pay a domiciliary visit the patient was a young deckhand he was lying on his bunk holding his abdomen and groaning good morning i said briskly taking his pulse whats the trouble aw cripes i got the bellyache something horrid just let me have a look at theer stomach he stretched himself on his back i reached out a hand and felt the righthand quadrant of his abdomen immediately i felt as if i had eaten a bunch of safetypins and they had all opened inside at once i dragged easter outside the door and shut easter i said hoarsely this man has acute appendicitis cor this is urgent how far are we out of santos about two days the mate reckons well we must make land before then and put the poor chap in hospital ill go up and see the captain captain hogg had just got out of his bath he stood in his slippers with a towel round him looking at me like bligh offering christian the cheese i could appreciate that it was one of his gastric mornings well ergood morning sir good morning could you do twice the speed you are sir what he jumped so violently he shook drops of water from his chest on to the carpet i meanyou see sir one of the crew has developed acute appendicitis he will have to be operated on as soon as possible i understand from the engineers that it is possible for the vessel to make a few more knots and i thought captain hogg sat down on the edge of his desk he gave a sharp tug to his left ear as though pulling the pin out of a mills bomb for every knot above the cruising speed of my ship he began quietly the bill for fuel oil practically doubles itself what do you think the company would have to say eh he banged the desk operate doctor operate he shouted what do you think i pay you for yes sir i said i recognized at once that the captains advice on therapy had obvious drawbacks in the first place i had a meagre idea of how to remove an appendix a medical qualification is like a marriage licenceit gives you official permission to go ahead but it doesnt guarantee you know enough to tackle all the difficulties after the honeymoon i had diligently attended the operating theatre in my hospital but there were always so many students present whenever the surgeons removed an appendix that all i usually saw of the operation were the boils on the neck of the man in front of me the second difficulty was equipment although appendices have reportedly been removed by second mates with bent spoons and a bosns knife i felt that my academic inhibitions made it impossible for me to operate skilfully with the products of an ironmongers shop thirdly there was professional assistance easter was an admirable character for whom i had a sincere admiration as a man of the world but when it came to dabbling in clinical medicine he was as dangerous as an unlabelled bottle of strychnine i called him into my cabin easter i said earnestly have you seen a case of acute appendicitis before ho yes doctor every time i eats pickles im reminded of it pickles thats right doctor i was on the western ocean run at the time the old doc was scared to operate so he puts the patient in the ships hospital and tells me to keep him on a light diet see that night i goes along and asks if theres anything he wants like before i turn in and the patient says to me yes he says i should like just a few pickles pickles i says you cant have no pickles dont be balmy the doctor would have me over the side if i was to give you pickles we of the medical fraternity dont reckon pickles is a light diet not for arf a minute we dont i says well the next morning i brings him is breakfasttwo poached eggs done specialand when i goes to shake himcor he was cold to the touch them pickles was his last wish doctor and i refused him sad aint it quite so easter i said lets have a little less of your reminiscences and a little more action we must operate on this man before sundown do you realize what that means we must strip the hospital scrub it out with antiseptic rig up some lights and an operating table and find some instruments from somewhere savvy very good doctor we of the fraternity always rises to the occasion as they say well start rising he hesitated if might be so bold doctor yes perhaps it might make things go a little easier if you and me was to have a bit of the medical comforts to start with i clapped him gratefully on the shoulder capital idea easter reach down the bottle from my locker rumours of my intended surgical assault spread through the ship faster than the news of a landfall it was not only a pleasurable interruption to the tedium of the voyage but it had the attributes of mystery and originality as well the crew hadnt had such fun since a boiler blew up off panama i shut myself in my cabin and opened the textbook of surgery i had prudently included in my packing turning over the pages to appendicitis i ran my finger down the print i started to read the section headed operation the incision is made at mcburneys point it said oh god what was mcburneys point it sounded like a mountain in california there was a rap on the jalousie come in i unlatched the door it was the chief engineer i heard about this wee party youre having doc he said affably i reckoned youd be needing some lights sos you can get a good squint at the innards i can rig up a cargo cluster for you if youre willing thanks very much he gave a grin of course you wont mind me turning up to see the fun doc will you i reckon i ought to be there in case the lights go on the blink you never can tell with these cargo clusters thatll be all right chief thanks doc give us a shout when you want to standby i opened the book again and had read far enough to learn that the appendix may be in any of six positions when hornbeam put his head round the door he laughed loudly hello doc making you do a bit of work for a change thats what im here for i said casually reading it all up in the old almanac i see he said genially i shut the heavy book with a bang and dropped it behind the bunk one must refresh ones memory i said even lord lister had to do that sometimes what i came down for doc he went on was to offer you a bit of a hand i remember seeing one of these done in the war when i was trooping thought you might like me to hold the bloodbucket or something i considered all right i said id be pleased to have someone with commonsense around you wont faint will you what after all these years at sea ill come along later i was still looking for my place in the surgery book when i saw sparks in the doorway he brushed aside a couple of imaginary companions and grinned at me yes i asked uninvitingly i hear youre going to carve em up doc i am intending to operate certainly wouldnt mind if i watched would you im a bit of a photographer and id like a few pictures to show the kids his grin widened makes a change from seagulls i dont think therell be enough room for me and the patient if you come too would you like to send a message to his mother he asked no i would not havent got a spot of gin handy have you not now later im very busy all right doc have a good time he went off singing with his friends but there had now collected outside the door a bunch of deckhands led by the bosn with his cap respectfully in his hands what the hell do you want i asked crossly sorry to disturb you doctor only seeing as were all pals of erbs we was thinking youd let us come in see to ave a dekko e says its all right wiv im as long as we behaves decent go away i said go away at once all of you who do you think i am a musichall turn i shall report you all to the mate i slammed the door and returned to the intricacies of appendectomy i found easter in the hospital he had dismantled the cabin furnishings and was on his knees scrubbing the deck stripped to the waist hows it going i asked its bloody ot whats the temperature he got up and inspected the thermometer in the corner hundred and six he said cant you put the forced draught on blows soot in oh all right well have to put up with it i suppose how have you got on with the operating table he had a wooden trestle table along one bulkhead which he set up proudly it left just enough room on either side for the pair of us i got it off chippy he said he uses it for mixing the paints on its better than nothing if you scrub it hard enough itll be reasonably sterile as i spoke two large rusty drops fell from a pipe crossing the deckhead on the spot where the operation wound would be damnation cant you do anything to stop that easter shook his head been like it for years its a job for the shore engineers that is well youll have to fix up some sort of screen have we got any dressings and gloves and so forth there was some in the locker seem to have been there since the war get them sterilized in the galley how about instruments what have you found easter pulled two handfuls of metal objects from his trouser pockets ive been on the scrounge he explained i thought these would come in handy like i looked at his booty which he spread on the table there was a pair of pliers two saloon forks a packet of darning needles labelled a sailors friend some paperclips a stiletto a potato knife a pair of tweezers a surgical scalpel and a uterine curette youd better sterilize the lot i said gloomily except the pliers shouldnt there be a set of surgical instruments on board they seem to have disappeared doctor you mean you flogged them he scratched his nose guiltily theres nothing for it but to use what weve got i told him crossly i damn well hope you get an appendix too i went out on deck i needed some fresh air the day was already becoming too much for me outside the hospital i found chippy he was sitting on the deck with a hatch covera thick piece of wood about six feet by two used in rows to cover the hatches he was polishing it carefully with emery paper hello chips i said getting everything shipshape for santos he looked up at me gloomily hell slide off this lovely he said who will whyim down there he pointed aft with his thumb the poor bloke whats for the knife slide off it like a wet fish he will he added with relish i was perplexed whats he want to slide off a hatch cover for i asked why when they buries im of course he gave it another rub lot of work ive put in on this ere atch cover now look here chippy what gives you the idea my patients going to die oh they always does ive seen five appendicitises at sea ad their time every one of em over the wall they went on a atch cover i stamped off in disgust i felt i had been professionally insulted i climbed the bridge ladder angrily to report the carpenters pessimism to one of the mates there i found the second moodily sorting out flags what ho doc he said whens the carveup in about an hour think that ensignll do do what for why in casein case of accidents to cover the body there isnt going to be any body damn you well father told us to take precautions means a lot of work for all hands doc itll be a shame if theyre all disappointed now i admit that they do give one an excellent funeral at sea the properties are traditionally adapted from the ships gear and the routine is prescribed as firmly as that for entering and leaving port as soon as the body is available it is turned over to the bosn who sews it up in canvas with half a dozen firebars from the galley for this he receives a bottle of whisky meanwhile the carpenter has been polishing and attaching rope handles to a hatch cover and the quartermasters have been pressing their best uniforms the ceremony is held at sunset or sunrise on the same day because ships spend most of their time in tropical waters and the performance might be marred by the corpse if it became aggressively high the vessel stops a rail is taken away from the side and the ships officers including the abashed doctor line up with the captain caps are removed and at the appropriate moment the body is marched to the rails on the hatch cover by the quartermasterswho receive a bottle of whisky between them for their servicesand smartly tipped overboard the mate who has charge of all deck stores including flags at the same time edges himself down to the rail and grabs the ensignwhich costs the company moneybefore it slips into the sea with its bundle the ship then starts again and everybody goes off for an obituary peg i should hate to spoil your fun i said coldly but this patient is going to walk off the ship in liverpool i returned into the hospital where easter was boiling the instruments over a primus stove everyone thinks theres going to be a funeral i said i never heard such nonsense ho yes easter remarked calmly thats why i couldnt fit a screen under that there pipe as you said bosn says hes got to keep all his spare canvas for the shroud but its monstrous easter chuckled over the steaming instruments cor ive seen some funny funerals at sea remember one we had in the indian ocean chinaman it was got knifed blimey we pushed him overboard all right but he wouldnt sink bobbed about like a buoy the old man wasnt arf flummoxed in the end we had to leave him to it couldnt pull him out again could we probably still bobbing about somewhere if the sharks aint got him im going to see the patient i said sternly get everything ready in an hours time the patient was sitting in his cabin eating fish and chips and drinking a bottle of beer what the devils this i shouted i thought i told you to have nothing by mouth oh sorry doc he said awkwardly but seeing i was feeling so much better like i thought i could do with a bit of grub better man how dare you say youre better thats for me to decide you only think youre better youve got an acute appendix inside you he pulled a fish bone out of his mouth repentantly theres just one thing doc he said respectfully do people often get this appendix taken out twice twice what do you mean well i had it taken out the first time in birkenhead when i was six i sprang at him and pulled up his shirt a faint white twoinch scar i started to laugh not operating doctor why captain hogg demanded ive charmed it away sir i explained a trick i learnt in infancy from a gypsy chapter nine we arrived at santos in the early afternoon as we slowed down to approach the river mouth between the deep green hills the shore heat hit us like the blast from the engineroom hatchway itll be nice and cosy alongside easter said gloomily we sailed up the greasy river between the rows of ships tied thickly along each bank the ensign of the united states of brazil flying in courtesy from our foremast hornbeam went to his station forrard and archer took the lamptrimmer and his gang of deckhands aft the tugs came up the mooring ropes flew out and we were pushed into place as neatly as a wellparked car the gangway rattled down and a section of the rail was pulled away we had arrived but we were still flying the yellow q flag indicating we were in quarantine a troop of stout brazilian customs and health officials immediately tramped aboard headed by an importantlooking man in a white suit whom i took to be the doctor i saluted boa dia senhor i said in carefully incubated portuguese he held out his hand afternoon old boy he replied hows tricks very well thank you nothing infectious no haul down the yellow peril then can you let me have a few hundred english cigarettes once the quarantine flag was down people came aboard like navy week visitors on a bank holiday there were policemen stevedores moneychangers ship chandlers water purveyors fruit sellers harbourmasters launderersand the agents the agents were the men in charge of the fathom lines business in santos and could get any commodity at short notice from five thousand tons of oil to a new bell for the ships cat they were a pair of tall genial englishmen with minds like efficiently arranged shopping lists hello doc one said want any medical stores chief stewards got the list good youve taken over from flowerday have you he was a rum bird coming to have a peg not just now fair enough by the way theres some mail for you somewhere i had forgotten that the agents look after the ships mail i went out on deck and found most of it had been distributed all over the ship men were leaning on uncomfortable steel corners reading their letters i passed the carpenter who had several closelywritten sheets in his hand and kept saying no it cant be it cant be to himself i hoped it was nothing serious coo one man shouted ive ad a baby ive ad six his companion said morosely not looking up this nonplussed the new father wot all at once he asked i ran into whimble letter for you doc he said i gave it to easter i suddenly felt excited i had forgotten england and home in the past three weeks as efficiently as a patient with amnesia my past seemed a disconnected existence all at once i felt a letter would be like a familiar face in a big crowd i saw easter leaning on the rail and hurried towards him i wondered who it was from wendy perhaps telling me she was crying over my picture and reading conrad from my principal genially wishing me a good voyage or my parents asking where id put the keys of the garage from old classmates envious of my double release i didnt care it was a letter a letter whoever sent it proved the most important thing in the worldi was not forgotten i took the envelope from easter i couldnt recognize the handwriting i tried to open it with dignity but excitedly tore the flap it said thelaundry dear sir if you do not collect your washing within seven days of this date it will be sold to defray charges i tossed it into the dock i leant on the rail and looked at the unfamiliar colours the dirty yellow sheds the strange unenglish mountains in the background with the white road wriggling up them to sгo paulo the dusky lounging men and slim graceful women on the wharfside the signs in portuguese the odd open tramcar behind the surprising uniforms of the police the glare of the unaccustomed suni realized tardily i was on another side of the world after conditioning myself to the exclusive company of my shipmates for three weeks i found the rush of locals on board unsettling the silence of the sea passage was broken by the noise of the winches and the bare decks became littered with hatch covers wires tarpaulins pieces of dropped cargo and resting brazilians the brazilians have a great capacity for rest when they have nothing to do for a few minutes they see no point in continuing to support the burden of keeping awake and fling themselves into the nearest piece of shade whether they are lying on a stone wharf the top of a couple of packingcases or some pieces of scrap metal does not appear to detract from the enjoyment the cargo came out by the exact reverse of the technique that put it in at liverpool as i had nothing else to do i joined easter who was watching crates of machinery being drawn out of number five hatch with the pleasantly indolent air of a londoner observing road excavations hope youve locked your cabin doctor he said and screwed up the port these boys would pinch the soles off your shoes if you wasnt careful i pointed towards the policemen on the gangway but dont they keep an eye on it what them vigilantes thems the worst of the lot as the winches paused i heard feminine giggles and zestful screams coming from the crews quarters in the poop a plump dark girl with a basket of washing under her arm appeared on the deck struggling formally with a large sailor thats maria easter explained she does your laundry for you three blokes got something off her last trip what wouldnt mind having a go at her myself he continued solemnly they dont seem to think much of things like that out here all the girls is tenderhearted i reckon its the climate it all seems very unhygienic to me to say the least mind you some of ems real smashers ho ive had some fun here i have you going ashore tonight doctor i might stretch my legs though i fear i shall do nothing more exciting than go to the pictures ah you can get some queer pictures out here too easter went on pal of mine went ashore one night to have his pleasure as you might say and the next day he went off with a crowd of the lads to one of them odd picture houses blimey he was the big feature didnt arf get his leg pulled about it i think i will go and see mr hornbeam i said santos sounded a place that would have provided easter with extensive reminiscences hornbeams cabin was as full as a compartment in a suburban train in the rushhour there were the agents the chief stevedores the customs the immigration officers and a few unidentifiable officials hornbeam was sitting with his white shirt undone to the waist looking pleased with himself his table was filled with bottles of gin whisky and beer and half a dozen open tins of players everyone was helping themselves come in doc he called have a peg this is our doctor gentlemen how do you do i said taking a glass its always open house in the mates cabin in port hornbeam explained pouring himself another gin everyone wants the poor bloody mate now what about this trouble in number three he said to the head stevedore can you get another gang on there tonight tomorrow morning mister mate tonight no good well have to put up with it i suppose he took a sheaf of papers from a ragged brazilian who appeared in the doorway cargo plans all right have a peg chum coming ashore tonight doc he added to me i thought of it are you certainly i am never been ashore in santos yet tonight i am well collect here about midnight midnight theres no point in going anywhere before eleven in this part of the world nothing livens up before twelve if thats the case i think id better turn in for a bit thats the idea doc youre in the land of the siesta now dont forget god its hot isnt it i screwed the closelymeshed wirenetting in the porthole to keep the flies out and went to sleep the second woke me up about nine coming ashore he asked were going up to the mates cabin they sting you for drinks in brazil so we reckoned wed get a glow on us before we went off i sat up and rubbed the sweat off me with a sheet ill be up when ive had a shower the mates coming with us isnt he archer laughed i wouldnt know about that ive never seen him get ashore anywhere yet when i reached the mates cabin i saw at once that he had not been taking a siesta himself his visitors had gone and the bottles were empty he sat behind a jumble of dirty glasses and cigaretteends humming absently to himself lo doc he said languidly fetch a bottle out of the locker there im coming ashore with you young lads tonight keep you out of trouble eh muy bien cheerio archer and trail were in the cabin dressed in their shoregoing rig the scattered places in which they bought their clothes and their overcompensation for wearing uniform most of their lives gave them a startling appearance trail was particularly arresting he wore a pair of green cotton trousers he had bought in rio a yellow shirt from calcutta the sort of sports coat that is fortunately popular only on the australian beaches suede shoes from ceylon and a tie with a luminous girl on it from new york we all sat down and drank determinedly have to drink beer ashore trail said a gin costs about twelve bob i got some cruzeiros for you doc he handed me a bundle of dirty notes thats the sub you put in for how about you mr hornbeam got some in the kitty he said thickly he pulled a tin out of his locker and spilt the contents on the table there was currency from all over the worldaustralian florins south african sixpences nickels and quarters escudos and francs canadian dollars japanese yen new zealand pounds rupees pesos pesetas and guilders a few marks and a couple of pitcairn island postage stamps always like to have a bit of ready cash he explained rummaging through the pile no cruzeiros though whats this he held up a coin and squinted at it springbok hapenny no good ill take the dollars ashore and flog em dont you blokes go without me he added threateningly ill get a cob on if you dont wait where are we bound for anyway have another peg the third drew a small book from his pocket and turned over to the letter s santos he said oh thats fixed well take the doc to the whores ball the what did you say i asked the whores ball funniest thing this side of the line it doesnt start till midnight well look into the ritz bar first i want to see the bidu bar archer added i met a hot bit of blonde in there last time you game doc by this time my critical faculties were mildly blunted with gin game of course im game im a sailor arent i thats the spirit trail said down the hatch lads and lets get moving its after eleven what about the mate i asked i turned to look at him he was lying with his head in a pool of currency asleep its always the same with the mate archer explained he never makes it hasnt been ashore for years its best to leave him there until he wakes up now for the bright lights trail put down his glass come on doc singing softly we filed down the gangway and slightly intoxicated for the first time in my life i put foot on foreign soil chapter ten there are few attractive cities in brazil and santos is not one of them in the centre is a fairly pleasant square with gardens in it a new post office and the town hall it would pass for a little bastion of bourgeoisie in the south of france on a hot day but the waterfront caters efficiently for different tastes it is a tall line of buildings on a cobbled street that looks like the slums in glasgow draped with neon the third led us jauntily towards a lighted doorway with ritz bardrinks and girls shining over it here we go lads he said if our mothers could see us now the three of us piled inside and took a table by the door it was a long room brightly lit with a bar down one side a small dance floor and a band the walls were lined with foreign flags and signs such as welcomes to our british friends have a swell time baby and we take pounds and dollars the room was full but not with brazilians there seemed to be sailors there from every country with a seaboard there were stiff blond swedes and norwegians a crowd of drunk greeks in the corner some dutchmen a pack of frenchmen arguing with spaniards blankfaced masticating americans and a good many small darkeyed dangerouslooking men of unplaceable nationality by the door stroking his long moustache stood a nervous brazilian policeman i say i exclaimed i stared at the place like a child brought up to town to see the lights it looks a bit tough doesnt it the santos waterfront is the toughest in the world archer said lightly thats why were sitting near the door if anything starts dont wait to see what its all about but hop it they have a habit of arresting everyone in sight down here ever been in jail not yet this isnt the place to start i got pinched two years ago for being drunk they let me go next morning luckily had to rub shoulders with some pretty queer birds none of this single cell and bath business you get in britain a brazilian girl dark and rounded in a black dress and a decorative lace apron came upon us trкs cerveja trail said sure baby she strolled off giving us the benefit of her hips she brings the beer trail explained if you like you can dance with her look over there there were about twenty of the girls colleagues in the room all similarly dressed i watched one at the table next to ours being asked for a dance by an american who used the technique of slapping her on the bottom and grabbing her arm as she passed the girl smiled acquiescence and they took the floor the band played only sambas and rumbas the polite versions of these dances produced in london restaurants have the same relationship to santos sambas as vintage burgundy to raw applejack similarly with the dancing the brazilian girls though languid in daytime come to life like flashing electric signs at nightfall not only do they dance lustily but they do so without any inhibitions whatever if any couple in london were seen performing in the manner accepted as normally sociable in brazil they would be immediately asked to leave the girl brought our beers and opened them trail handed her a hundredcruzeiro note and pinched her bottom she grinned at him i wondered what would have happened if he had tried the same technique in a lyons teashop dont reckon well stay here long trail said its getting on how do you like brazilian beer it tastes like soapy water to me it carries a kick in it somewhere finish it up weve got to look in at the bidu saw a chap get killed outside there last trip archer said to me the bidu bar was exactly the same as the ritz except that the signs round the walls were in portuguese and the girls were fatter we didnt stay long we had a couple more beers and left trail rubbed his hands and now he said for the whores ball the function to which trail was so attracted was held on the top floor of an old building on one of the side streets we could hear the music the inescapable samba blaring down the street from the open windows before turned the corner the way in was through a narrow door with taxi dancing painted over the top of it and up a long narrow unbroken flight of stairs at the foot of the stairs was a ticket office inside which a fat man in his vest was barred up like the crown jewels we paid and mounted the staircase at the top were two solemn policemen who immediately advanced on us archers remarks about the carelessness of the police in arresting people flashed into my mind i jumped nervously and began to walk backwards down the stairs dont be alarmed archer said in england you leave your hat and coat dont you by that time a policeman had grabbed hold of me pulled aside my arms and searched me for weapons i caught sight of a table behind him that explained archers remarks on it was neatly arranged a collection of revolvers knives blackjacks knuckledusters and razors the brazilian likes going around with a bit of cutlery in his belt trail explained makes him feel big unfortunately he tends to be a bit on the excited side these cops sometimes miss a knife or two so wed better keep near the windows dont mind a jump do you we went inside three girls immediately came up to us and told us they loved us trail waved them aside we came to hear the music he told them affably we strode across the floor and sat down it was bigger than the american bar and had more space for dancing the walls were bare of any decoration and the floor was rough boards polished only by the customers feet there were tables scattered round the floor and girls scattered round the tables the atmosphere was like a laundry with a breakdown in the ventilating system at one end was the bandon a platform six feet above the floor and surrounded by barbed wire whats the barricade for i asked if they dislike the music here they dont hide their feelings trail explained what about all these girls what do they do if you pay fifty cruzeiros youll find out oh i see lets have some beer we sat and drank and watched the dancing it was the sort that trail described as the bumps and grinds i looked nervously at men sitting at the other tables with an expectant sensation between my shoulderblades when they saw a girl they fancied they grabbed her and joined the jactitating couples on the floor after the dance they either went off with her dragged her back to their own tables or left her according to the strength of their inclination i saw a party of our liverpool greasers in the corner their shirts unbuttoned and outside their trousers throwing merseyside witticisms at their neighbours everyone seemed to be having a good time a warm brunette descended on my knee hallo darling she said you come wit me no she laughed and ruffled my hair you dance wit me no go on doc archer called give the girls a treat but i cant dance come on darling said the girl she snatched hold of me and pulled me out of my chair then she clapped me to her bosom like a belladonna plaster and pushed me on the dance floor we jostled with the rest of the dancers it was like being lashed to an upholstered pneumatic drill i struggled round in her clammy embrace trying to keep my feet wriggling out of other mens way and reflecting that i was a long way from home when the music stopped i disengaged myself and looked for our table by this time the third was talking earnestly to a thin brown girl who had taken my chair thirty cruzeiros he said forcefully trinta see he held up three fingers she shook her head no she insisted cincoenta fifty fifty fifty oh hell the third said lets get out of here we trooped down the stairs where now archer asked when we were in the street madame mimis trail said with finality its the only place where you can get a decent bottle of beer in town i think im going back to the ship i said come on doc you dont have to sample the goods besides youd get knifed walking back alone where is it second somewhere near the rua bittencourt i think he led us along threatening unlighted streets where the pedestrians shuffled guiltily in the shadows like large rats i think this is the number he said stopping by the heavy door of an unlighted house you fellows stay here and ill go and see he jumped up the steps and rang the bell after a minute or so i saw him jab it again the door opened an old woman with her hair tied in a handkerchief stood against the inside light boa noite senhora trail began he held a conversation in portuguese with her and i saw that he spoke the language rapidly and with great force but unintelligibly after he had delivered a string of sentences embellished heavily with gestures she held up a finger and disappeared to fetch help a tall man in a dressinggown came back with her after a few words he pushed the third abruptly down the steps delivered a few hostile sentences and slammed the door wrong place trail explained picking himself up that seems to be the dentists it must be the house on the other corner at the next door we were received with pleasure and shown immediately into the parlour madame mimis was a sedate establishment the parlour was furnished in the austere grubby style popular with the continental middleclass it was a large apartment with big shuttered windows containing several small tables and a larger one in the corner where madame sat with three or four of her charges on a dark broken sideboard down one side were two unlighted candelabras a sicklylooking plant and a radio round the walls were pictures of the saints business was poor and the room was quiet and inactive one felt one had called on the vicars daughters for tea madame immediately recognized my companions and greeted them warmly ah hello my little boys back so soon eh how goes it in cold england she embraced the two of them she was a big overpowdered woman in a black dress with a figure like a thawing snowman not so dusty archer said meet one of our shipmates we embraced madame is a wonderful character trail explained hails from france originally she built up her own team here like a football manager now boys madame said you would like some beer no lay it on madame archer said sitting down and slapping his knee lay on everything madame clapped her hands is that little girl dina still here trail asked our hostess shrugged her shoulders powerfully she is gone she married a gentleman from sгo paulo well he hasnt done badly trail observed lets have a look at the latest talent madames assistant brought the tall green beer bottles and glasses and three girls came over to sit with us they were pretty girlsslim dainty smiling glowing with cooperation americano asked the one next to me eagerly no ingles cigarette she asked as winsomely as a schoolgirl appealing for pocket money i gave her one which she put carefully in her handbag she began to stroke the back of my neck i clasped my hands in front of me and stared defensively at the opposite wall i lof you she said we sat like that for some time meanwhile trail and archer had their girls on their knees and were conducting a conversation in a mixture of english portuguese and giggles you come with me the girl asked playfully pulling a hair from my neck no i said ii nгo gostar or whatever it is nothing doing go and talk to my amigos i looked round and saw trail and archer disappearing up the stairs leading to the operational portion of the building hey i called jumping up dont you fellows leave me its all right doc we wont be long trail called over his shoulder finish the beer for us i sat gloomily down and bit my lip feeling like a warning to young men the girl discouraged got up and left me i took my handkerchief out and wiped my forehead but madame ever solicitous assumed immediately that my companion had for some reason not pleased me she directed a large grinning blonde to take her place no no i said in alarm no pleasego away theres a good girl nгo no sorry and all that i looked uncomfortably round me i wanted to get out but i didnt know the way back to the ship and i was scared to walk out of the place on my own i took a gulp of beer and sat biting my thumbnail i was hardly aware that another had joined me she sat quietly beside me without speaking i looked up she was sitting demurely with her hands clasped in her lap as pathetic as a wallflower at a village dance hop it vamos pronto i told her pleaseplease she said my dear young lady i have no intention two tears rolled compellingly down her thin cheeks please come she urged softly no one come with me this week if you no come i get fired i licked my lips this was the sort of dilemma even big white carstairs would have had difficulty sorting out she laid a hand on my arm as softly as an alighting butterfly please come she whispered i coughed and ran my finger round my collar my conscience strained to suppress my sense of gallantry just then two large tears followed the first how much i heard it was me hunred cruzeiro ohahvery well then i pulled the note from my pocket seizing it she pulled me by the hand towards the staircase of sin we went into a bare room that contained only a bed a basin and several more pictures of the saints she locked the door i stood and scratched my left ear deftly as though peeling a banana she stripped off her clothes she jumped on the bed and gave me an inviting smile suddenly she held her right side and groaned hello i said immediately interested whats the trouble she bit her lip for a moment then said nadanada have you got a pain erdor she nodded where she pointed under her right ribs thats curious i said just let me have a look a minute will you by jove this is unusualdeep breath now after five minutes careful examination of her abdomen i concluded that the young lady was suffering from inflammation of the gallbladder look here i said you ought to go to hospital she smiled up at me from the pillow hospitaloperacao or whatever it is i indicated with signs oh nвo she said oh yes i said firmly herei took a pencil and paper from my pocket and wrote on ityou take that to the chemistfarmacкuticoand theyll give you something to make it better then you must go to hospital see ok she took the prescription and grinned very well i said automatically call me if you have any severe pain during the night good evening i let myself out trail and archer were waiting downstairs come on you dirty old man trail said grabbing my arm time to get back to the ship it occurred to me that was the only consultation i had ever paid for chapter eleven the next morning i woke sweating and penitent in my unventilated cabin jumbled harbour sounds replaced our usual noiseless morning at sea and the steam winches were already working in frantic bursts on the deck outside there were footsteps and shouting all over the ship and when i turned over for my watch i saw an unknown halfnaked brazilian picking his teeth and solemnly inspecting me from the open cabin door as i shaved i reflected sharply on the change in my recreations in the last four weeks at breakfast i found archer and trail as unruffled as if they had spent the evening in a suburban cinema i hear you had a bit of a lashup last night hornbeam said have a good time in mimis one must see how the other half lives i murmured she was a nice little piece you got hold of trail said in a complimentary tone wouldnt have minded her myself hornbeam who had an unphysiological resilience to alcohol nodded as he ate his way with relish through a dish of bacon chops eggs and liver sorry i couldnt come with you blokes he said cheerfully i reckon i was tired the quartermaster put me in my bunk about three this is not much of a place anyway trail said not a patch on ba theyve cleaned up ba a lot now archer added with disappointment do you remember underneath the arches mr hornbeam a string of them running down behind a sort of colonnade affair from the boca practically to the plaza de majo they had a purity campaign down there after the war they needed it hornbeam said reaching for the tomato sauce any more bacon going steward i get peckish in port what are you doing today doc archer asked going ashore i was thinking of it what going back for an encore trail said no i assure you i was only thinking of a haircut youre right there doc hornbeam said you look like an old rope fender my hair had last been cut in the wintery twilight of a london afternoon more than a month ago now it overhung my newly sunburned ears and its length reflected our distance from home but i was reluctant to step ashore alone for the only portuguese i was confident of saying was good morning and i was not in the position to refuse a shampoo singeing scalp massage hot towels and any unusual luxuries that might be provided by brazilian barbers shops i explained this to easter during surgery and he immediately relieved my difficulties i should be very glad to oblige doctor he said with dignity if requested you cut hair too do you done quite a few haircutting jobs ashore worked six months steady at it once helping out a pal what had a little barbers shop in doncaster he ran a book really but the shop kept the coppers away got pinched last year so i heard very well easter you may try your skill on me he set up his saloon on the strip of deck outside my cabin he first spread out several sheets of the liverpool echo then brought from his quarters a camp stool and a length of cloth striped like a butchers apron he tied the cloth tightly round my neck and drew a pair of scissors and a comb from his hip pocket how do you like it he demanded oh sort of short round the back wouldnt like a crew cut would you suit your sort of head if i may be so bold doctor no thank you he began snipping round the nape of the neck bit of fun and games about noon he continued the violets coming in astern of us where that royal mail boat was yesterday the violet whats she another one of the fathom hookers does the run from the river plate to pernambuco and new york captain beamish in command cor he aint arf a queer un needs his head examined i reckon thats what theyre cleaning up the wheelhouse for is it ho yes got to have her looking posh when we has company sorry doctor was that your ear if i get a septic wound from this i said sternly i shall order your kit to be burned as a sanitary measure he blew hard through the comb and bit deeply into my hair with it i likes haircutting he continued unruffled bit of an art like knocking up a sculpture you never know how its going to turn out when you start i sat in the sunshine unresisting while my hair fell in small bundles across the liverpool echo the increasing warmth and easters conversation behind the regular sharp snip of his scissors encouraged a pleasant feeling of euphoria i was looking forrard towards the mouth of the river the long quay with the tall german cranes grouped eagerly round open hatchways was lined with ships as far as i could see in the water on our port side a clean greyandwhite neat swedish tanker was being turned slowly by a pair of tugs like a birch log between two waterrats immediately ahead of us the stars and stripes dropped over the stern of the omar c ingersoll of baltimore a cargo ship the same size as the lotus designed with the american combination of stark lines and grotesque mysterious appendages just below me on the foredeck a dozen brazilians clutched a swaying crate labelled austin that hovered from the sling over no hatch i reckon you was right not to trust the barbers ashore easter said they aint up to much and theyll rook you as soon as look at you not as bad as the ones in port said thoughfor a dollar theyll give you a shampoo and introduce you to their sister he wiped the comb on the leg of his trousers thoughtfully mind you he went on you can have some fun in port said if youre up to the tricks very rude in places it is very rude he swept away the cloth and stood back proudly lovely he said care for me to read your bumps while im at it used to be phreno the bump man at fairs for a bit that will be enough thank you how much do i owe you fifty woods doctor seeing its you i went to my cabin to fetch the cigarettes and found i looked like a caricature of a prussian general i suspected that easter had learned the elements of barbering while serving one of his terms in jail the advent of the violet seemed to justify the companys regulation cap so i fitted a new white cover and stepped back on deck with easters art hidden underneath by now there was an atmosphere of serious preparation on board captain hogg was shouting at a pair of deckhands painting the large red f on the funnel hornbeam was supervising the desperate removal of a potful of black paint just spilled over the white bridge and the bosn was trying to rig a line of electric bulbs along the gangway without disturbing the fat policeman who slept in a deckchair by the rail as noon approached the crew began leaning over the port rail and captain hogg climbed on the monkey island over the wheelhouse and impatiently trained his glasses towards the bow i went to the boatdeck and squeezed between two davits trying to catch the familiar fathom line houseflag moving slowly through the forest of strange masts mind you dont fall in hornbeam said coming up the ladder a mouthful of this water would kill you any sign of her yet cant see anything from here the old man and beamish are great pals he told me contentedly theyd ram each others ships if they thought they could get away with it not that i have any time for beatilish he added in fact im not certain i wouldnt rather sail with the one weve got this struck me as severely damning to captain beamish whats the matter with him thinks hes one of the big ship boysyou know everything frightfully pukka wipe your feet at the top of the gangway kiss me hand and call me charlie they say he was a cadet in the p amp o but got chucked out i cant say i blame them but surely i said despairingly there must be some good captains in the world theres one or two old morris on the daisy isnt bad he did me a good turn once in belfast when i got mixed up with the cops but as soon as they get their fourth ring most of em get bloodyminded you wait and seeill go the same way we stood chatting between the lifeboats for a while until captain hogg bellowed from above us ahoy there mr trail stand by to dip ensign there she is hornbeam said pointing down the river see what that his account of captain beamish made me imagine his ship as equally superior but the violet as she swung round the bend in the river turned out to be a vessel smaller than the lotus narrow as angular as a piano with patches on her plates and two tall mournful ventilators drooping over her bridge she was high in the water with a wide streak of red showing at the bottom of her rusty hull and the tips of her propeller blades cut the surface below her overhanging stern makes us look like the queen lizzie doesnt it hornbeam said as she drew nearer watch for the fun when we start saluting it was clear that captain hogg was going to pay his respects grudgingly he stood on top of the wheelhouse glaring across the water to the violet and on the wing of the violets bridge a thin tall figure in a shining white uniform glared back at him as the mainmasts of the two ships drew level captain hogg shouted lower away and the violets ensign fluttered down a foot in curt acknowledgment the two captains scowled at each other as they passed and no one in either crew would have been surprised if they had stuck out their tongues the brotherhood of the sea hornbeam said i bet fathers just waiting for her to foul our ropes as she comes alongside captain beamish nevertheless arrived for lunch on board the lotus as soon as his gangway was down he turned out to be a thin brown wrinkled man with a face like a tortoise he compensated for his own shabby ship by turning himself out sprucely his long neck stretched from the high starched collar of his uniform two rows of glossy medal ribbons shone on his bosom his trousers were unsullied with sitting and his feet stood in white buckskin shoes he sat down at the table placed a monocle in his right eye and crumbled a roll in his bony hand with an expression on his face as if he expected it to release an unpleasant smell captain hogg was coldly polite and introduced us all this is my chief officer mr hornbeammy doctormy chief engineermy chief steward captain beamish received these presentations in silence before we had finished the soup it appeared that he was a man sparing of words for the only conversation he permitted himself was to interrupt his hosts remarks every few minutes with the expression strordinary when we reached the treacle roll he cut into captain hoggs description of how he once docked in liverpool without tugs by glaring at me and snapping doctor sir which hospital dy come from st swithins sir strordinary must know dr jenkins jenkins no im afraid i dont sir jenkins was a very wellknown man in the line i shook my head solemnly without making any comment i had gathered that doctors became well known in seafaring life only through the originality with which they left it you look very young doctor he continued fully qualified i suppose of course i am i said angrily strordinary looks very young indeed he added in a slightly softer voice to captain hogg who immediately began looking at me with suspicion lost my damned bosn this trip captain beamish went on blast him what was up captain hogg asked piling the last fragments of suet roll on to his spoon had to put him over the wall off pernam dead yknow go on what of strordinary thing altogether meant to ask your doctor had a turn of the shakes and died before sunset very likely smallpox i said firmly your ship will have to be fumigated for three weeks and all hands isolated in the fever hospital the one in santos is extremely unpleasant but they will probably take you up to sаo paulo as youre certain to get it anyway i sat and sulked over the cheesedish bad about the bosn captain beamish said dont get his type any more respectful knew my ways i may not be in command of a big ship but ill have her run decently eh captain captain hogg had his mouth full of cheese but he nodded violently enough to spill pieces on to the tablecloth dont know what things are coming to the third wore the same uniform three days running last week dyknow what happened yesterday steward brought me a glass of water without a tray communism thats what it is captain beamish then said nothing else for the rest of the meal the violets officers came aboard before supper and noisily packed themselves into hornbeams cabin i found it startling to see the familiar fathom line uniforms and badges with different faces over them they sat and drank gin enjoying the fragmentary friendship of the sea that had been established by a few hours or a day or two in a dozen years at ports all over the world heres our doc hornbeam said as i squeezed through the door meet mr molony chief officer from that old barge down aft hello doc he said shaking hands enjoying the sea i am rather thank you how did you get on with our old man at dinner i must say he was pretty rude molony laughed loudly while hornbeam filled up his glass he takes some getting used to do you know what he asked hornbeam he chased me up for eating peas off a knife the other day can you imagine it now theres bugling too we signed on a yankee galleyboy in new york who brought a trumpet with him so we get bugle calls to meals anyone would think we were a ruddy battleship all skippers are the same hornbeam said wearily do you remember old jack andrews in the buttercup what happened to him didnt you hear he got put ashore in cape town last year they began to talk earnestly of men and ships i had never heard of and their conversation took on an odd parochialism extending across the face of the earth as the violet was due to sail again at midnight our guests left early i leant on the rail and watched her float slowly into the river her portholes drawing yellow streaks across the greasy water she blew three hoots of farewell to us and followed her tug towards the sea captain hogg stood outside his cabin staring after her and no doubt captain beamish was on the bridge glaring astern at us i wondered if i should meet any more fathom line captains and if they would be any less unnerving a man in a pair of khaki trousers and a loose orange shirt was waiting in my cabin he grinned as i came in hiya doc he said im off the omar c ingersoll pleased to meet ya we shook hands i guess i shouldnt have bust in but your chief mate said it was ok perfectly all right i said what can i do for you i just want a bottle of aspirin were right out and we aint carrying a medic i dont want to put you to no bother though no trouble at all my good man i said ill fetch you some from the hospital thats mighty swell of you doc he said grinning at me again mighty swell in return for the bottle of aspirins he presented me with two hundred chesterfields the case of the luckless legs three bars of chocolate life and a photograph of the omar c ingersoll at the gangway he slapped me on the back and said come aboard and have a cup of coffee sometime doc just go up the gangway and ask for me very kind of you i said and you arethe bosn er mate possibly aw hell no doc im the captain so long i went to my bunk reflecting that the feudal system at least had the advantage of leaving you in no doubt whom you were talking to chapter twelve we spent a week in santos all baking in our cabins like a big dish of escargots our next port was to be buenos aires to load grain and hides for home shant be sorry to get away said trail the morning we sailed stinking place this fancy living here when are we off about midday theyve finished cargo in all hatches except no its hot isnt it ill be like a fried egg when i come off the bridge we left the city of tolerance behind us and turned south towards the river plate our voyage down the coast was enlivened by christmas which fell upon us halfway between santos and montevideo the festival is celebrated most warmly by englishmen when away from their own country just as london scots afford the fiercest welcome to the new year as i had now a fair insight into the behaviour of the lotus and her crew i expected the day would pass with a flourish on christmas morning easter awoke me with my tea at seven good morning doctor and a merry christmas to you doctor with my best respects thank you easter and the same to you bloody ot again aint it whats on the thermometer he looked at it closely hundred and two wont be nearly so chilly by midday neither it seems very strange to me to have christmas in this climate cor easter continued i remember one christmas we had in the timor sea i was in a yankee ship thenone of them allmetal jobs inside she was hot enough melt a bosns heart early on christmas morning the chief engineer goes and dies see really easter so i reckons we got to chuck the poor bastard over the wall pronto because in that heat you wouldnt be able to get near him after dinnertime let alone dress him up in a canvas suit i tells the matenasty bit of work he wasbut he wont have none of it you know what these yanks are crazy for embalming hes got to be embalmed he says then well pop him in the galley freezer and he can have a decent burial in the soil of gods own country besides he says we aint going to have no funerals on christmas day yes i says but whos going to do the embalming you are he says theres instructions in the pharmacists mates handbook and you can get on with it if you do him nice ill give you a bottle of scotch and if you makes a pigs bottom of him ill kick you round the deck what could i do i tells the skipper but he gets a cob on and says its orders so i reckon instead of arguing its best to get on with it while hes still pretty fresh the butcher and me goes in there and gets to work me promising the butch half of the scotchused to be in the meat works at chicago the butch and reckoned something like that was right up his alley oh we made a lovely job of him easter continued with pride it would have brought tears to his mothers eyes when wed finished the butch and i gets the hospital stretcher to carry him down to the freezer while the skipper and all hands gathers round the cabin door to have a dekko i goes in first holding one end of the stretcher the butch holding the other and the mate comes in after us to see what sort of a job weve made of him well i dunno either wed made the poor bloke so lifelike or it was that hot or he was starting to pong a bit but the mate gets inside and passes out like a light so what could we do the butch and i puts him on the stretcher and carries him on deck for some air when the skipper sees us coming out with the mate lying there instead of the corpse he takes one look and bloody well faints as well cor what a lashup stiffs all over the deck wasnt arf a funny christmas that wasnt thank you easter i said you have cheered my christmas morn the bosns got toothache he added has he how badly something cruel he reckons send him to the hospital ill be along in half an hour the bosn was a big man with a complexion like an old football and a face as threatening as a battleships gunturret i found him sitting in the hospital chair holding his jaw and moaning merry christmas i said i shone a torch in his mouth and announced itll have to come out ok doc he said squaring his shoulders i can take it we had fortunately found a pair of dental forceps on board and i hoped they would fit the tooth i had never extracted one before but from the ranks of dentists i had seen in action in the hospital outpatient department it looked pretty simple one simply pulled hard as though extracting a nail from a plank and the tooth appeared in a flurry of saliva and blood easter i said what have we in the way of anaesthetics if i may be so bold sir and especially seeing its christmas how about the medical comforts capital idea are there any left i took the liberty of telling the chief steward last night that you was wanting some special for the season very well go and fetch them easter the three of us sat in a circle and purposefully drank brandy have another glass i told the bosn after all youre the patient he said the pain was beginning to wear off nevertheless i said firmly we must proceed with the operation i dont want you messing up my christmas day with toothache open wide i commanded i applied the forceps is that the one he nodded vigorously i gripped the forceps hard and pulled it was like trying to crack a fresh brazil nut i gave another tug the bosn grunted and screwed his eyes up this may hurt a little i remembered to say i threw all my weight against the tooth sweat was running down my face and into my eyes and i was breathing like a middleaged wrestler its no good i grunted im just not tough enough easter apply counterpressure to his shoulders will you thats right nowone two three together heave the patient slipped down the chair oh lord i said if i might suggest easter said dr flowerday used to find it very useful to put his knee in the blokes chest like that thats right doctor now shove your elbows against his shoulders there was a crash and the patient landed on the deck with me on top of him hold on doctor easter shouted its coming i set my jaw and threw myself into a final effort but the tooth was as firm as a rivet in a ships plate i was about to roll off the patient in exhaustion when he decided it was time to intervene himself two large powerful hands came up and enveloped mine the bosn gave a sharp heave and the tooth came out like a pip from an orange he stood up spat a mouthful of blood in the sink and looked at me anxiously are you all right doctor he asked didnt hurt you did i no i think im all right i panted gawd thats better merry christmas doctor the bosn walked contentedly aft and i went to join my shipmates there was an air of geniality on board fostered not only by the season but the fact that christmas was technically sunday and therefore everyone had another halfdays pay after midday the officers were invited to captain hoggs cabin for drinks everyone cameeven the chief engineer who allowed his aversion for both the captain and the foolish sassenach custom of celebrating on december th to be overcome by his satisfaction of getting a free drink out of his enemy the captain had already been setting himself in the mood for christmas and welcomed us with guarded geniality we were all cleanly dressed and sober except the wireless operator who had already been having a party in his cabin with his own friends good morning gentlemen good morning captain hogg said giving us a cold smile compliments of the season gentlemen on behalf of myself and the company it was christmas day in the workhouse the sparks began hornbeam clapped a hand over his mouth help me with the drinks mr whimble will you thats right pink gins all round i suppose help yourselves to iced water gentlemen heres to a merry christmas same to you sir everyone said respectfully raising their glasses the master called down the halls the sparks continued did you like your christmas dinner and the inmates answered hornbeam shut him up again i propose captain hogg said glancing sternly round the company on this solemn day in our year to make a short speech there were murmurs of assent all round he had as much risk of objection as hitler ever had this is my ship captain hogg went on my ship she is in my care and so are the lives of all of you in her he took a swallow of gin my ambition he continued is to have a happy ship do you understand that means that every damn one of yous got to knuckle under this shipmy shiphe waved his glass expansivelyis a floating village we have our butcher our baker and our lamptrimmer we have our own storekeepereven our own doctor this brought a roar of laughter and a round of applause but ihe hit his chesti am the squire of the village get that straight give me another gin mr whimble on this occasion he resumed i look upon you all with a fatherly eye all of you i am proud of you you are the best crew ive ever sailed with you are he stopped he glared out of the porthole his face twisted alarmingly the lotus had stopped mr mcdougall he hissed the ships stopped mcdougall didnt move aye he said what is it captain hogg asked heavily are you celebrating christmas so much down below that you have let the boilers go out mcdougall carefully drained his gin we no celebrate these cissy festivals in my department we save it up for hogmanay so you come up here and take my liquor and listen to an old windbag like you how dare you sir i have never been insulted like that in all my years at sea all your years i was on watch below when you were flying yellow at the mizzen captain hogg shook a fist at him i was in sail sir you ought to have stayed there youd make a good barge skipper we didnt need engineers in those days captain hogg shouted and in ten years time we wont need captains damn you sir i wont be talked to like this ill have you logged i will i mean it i it was christmas day in the workhouse the sparks began aw go to hell mcdougall said please please cried whimble ive had enough of this mr mcdougall and ive had more than enough steady the buffs said hornbeam jovially at that moment the second steward arrived and announced that dinner was served the saloon was decorated with dusty streamers that were produced every year like the dinner menu irrespective of the latitude in which the lotus found herself the english are the greatest colonizing race in the world but they show a reluctance to part with their native habits in climates that render them highly unsuitable or even unhealthy wherever two englishmen are together at christmas the accustomed dinner must be eaten in its full carbohydrate glory the weather demanded a little salad and an ice cream but we sat down and dutifully faced the full gastronomic trappings of the seasonroast turkey sausages cold pork roast beef boiled cabbage roast potatoes mince pies and christmas pudding weve got a nice veal and ham pie on as well if you want any whimble whispered in my ear as we went in all the officers off watch were crammed round the saloon table captain hogg sat at the head with mcdougall opposite him the lotus shivered and started again and they glared at each other over the tomato soup free whisky was given to all hands and whimble handed each officer a paper hat with a plea not to crush it as they would have to make do for the following year i was cutting my first slice of turkey when hornbeam who was next to me gave a nudge your man seems to want you he said easter was standing sheepishly in the doorway i excused myself to captain hogg and went over to him what is it i asked having a nice dinner doctor well if thats all you came to say theres been trouble in the poop trouble what sort of trouble couple of the lads been fighting oh all right who are they two of the stewards myrtle and mavis who did you say easter grinned youll find out he said two tall silkyhaired young men who cleaned the cabins were sitting in the hospital they were both covered in blood and one was in tears what the devils been going on i asked the other his lip quivered and he too began to weep another little problem of the sea easter remarked tolerantly them blokes as is a bit late making up their minds whether theyre men or women oh lord i said what were they fighting about i didnt do it the first one cried i swear on my honour i didnt oh yes you did the other shouted you give it back at once you mean thing how can i give it back if i havent got it yes you have youve been trying to sneak it all the voyage i havent got that beastly lipstick it isnt my colour anyway they started pulling each others hair theyre a bit queer easter explained helpfully well do something about them man pour water on them get the mate and ill have them logged easter hit one over the head with an armssplint turn it up he said genially its christmas i put dressings on the unfortunate couple and went back to dinner by that time everything had been eaten and captain hogg was on his feet again making another speech i have said before he told the company leaning on the table and i say it againi am proud of my crew the crew of my ship i shall put in my report to the company that you are the best crew his face clouded over he snarled the lotus had stopped again chapter thirteen the rest of the day passed unalarmingly we were nearing the busy coast of uruguay where the river plate shipping first turns north to europe and the states that night i stood on the hot deck in my pyjamas and watched the quiet sea swishing unhurriedly past the lotuss side another ship approached us two broken rows of lights in the darkness her green starboard light shining into ours an aldis light flashed from her bridge calling us up i watched the third mate reply i supposed we only wished each other a merry christmas and exchanged the usual courtesy queries about name and destination but it made me realize for the first time that the lotus was not the only ship on the sea all over the world there were tiny floating communities with the same sort of people doing the same sort of things as we didkeeping parallel watches eating similar meals listening to the identical strokes of another ships bell there were other doctors other mates other captains each ship struggling with its own apparently paramount problems i yawned as captain hogg shrank into comforting perspective when i went to turn in i found hornbeam in my cabin hello doc just dropped in for a final peg seeing its christmas night do you mind not a bit help yourself to the scotch thanks he put his feet up on the desk father made a fine showing today he said where is he now sleeping it off i just went up to see if the third mates sober youve never seen any of us go on watch sloshed have you no never it doesnt matter about the old man some of em kill a bottle a day and still keep their jobs he stretched i wish this one would drop dead he said amiably youd get promotion you mean he nodded im next on the list trouble is all the other skippers in the company are as healthy as apprentices theyll have to give me a command soon he added sadly im getting too old and fat to go running up and down hatch ladders youll get one soon enough i dont know all i want is a commandit doesnt matter if the ship sinks as soon as we get out of port as long as i can call myself captain thats what ive been at sea for all these yearsall the way up apprentice third second mate thats what keeps us sane most of us waiting for a ship of our own then im going to chuck the sea and raise chickens i bet you wont its a mugs game when youve been at it a couple of years theyve got you where they want you theres nothing for you ashorewhat goods a masters ticket in the labour exchange the seas a positive bitch you cant run away from her if you want to i suppose youre right there you staying at sea doc me oh no im going back to general practice in the provinces i suppose i saw the grey streets the grey skies the grey complexions of the patients wet winter mornings and acrid summer ones frightened faces on the doorstep at three in the morning four oclock parties with conversation like the weak oversweetened tea hedging respectability the eternal narrowness of the persistent provincial perhaps i added well hornbeam said the only thing to do with life is to live it you know shall we have a last one i passed him the bottle well be in ba tomorrow he added more cheerfully you can have some fun there everythings on the top line here since they had the purity campaign the third said now its as clean as blackpool pity we were lying off the big white flat city of buenos aires lines of tall angular buildings running down to the clean waterfront its pretty nice here in the new port the third went on where do we go i asked down by the meat works two hours later the lotus was coaxed through the narrow entrance of the south dock and tied up not far from the big grey refrigerating plant smells like a farm dont it easter remarked as we were drawing alongside dont arf get a lot of flies down here thick as coppers on a racecourse they are so this is where the beef comes from thats it they walk in one end and half an hour later they slides out in a tin smart these boys are our reception was the same as in santos except that everyone spoke spanish the same functionaries hurried aboard made for the mates cabin and drank the mates gin from which the business of the ship seemed inseparable but hornbeam was determined for once to go ashore ive only had a couple all day he said proudly to me look at the bottle for yourself im going to take you lads on a treat tonight see you about ten ill hold you to that word of honour doc hornbeam kept his promise when trail archer and myself met him in his cabin he was glowing but not extinguished just a quick one before we leave he said unclipping the cap of another gin bottle its all on me tonight boys ive got plenty of pesos where did you land them from archer asked hornbeam winked the mates got to have a few perks he explained small present from the stevedores for giving them the pleasure of our custom also a token from the chandlers for the honour of providing us with deck stores strictly against company regs of course oh ive got abouthe pulled some notes from his pocketabout a thousand pesos thats forty quid trail said reverently nothing but the best tonight hornbeam continued drink up and well hit the town this is the boca hornbeam explained as we walked over the railway tracks towards the gawky german gantry bridge one of the toughest spots in south america a bosn i sailed with once got beaten up about here left him only his shoes he was a big chap too i wish they wouldnt put ships in such insalubrious districts i said its like living in the slums they reckon the slums are good enough for sailors i suppose to reach the town we climbed into a small boat and were rowed across the slimy river towards the bocas main street hard work finding a taxi in ba these days trail said wed better climb in a colectivo a quick one in old mother whiteheads first archer insisted after all its known to every liverpool fireman since steam came in we had a couple of drinks described guardedly as special cocktails and ate bits of chopped meat nuts mussels cheese and olives from the small plates the citizens of buenos aires expect to be handed with their drinks on me hornbeam said firmly pulling out a fiftypeso note now lets go down town and have a steak we went to the broad bright avenida corrientes the broadway of ba in one of the grill rooms we sat down and ate steaks three inches thick nothing like nourishment hornbeam observed im going to have another of these how about you doc i shook my head as my mouth was too full to speak youll want it in a few weeks time when youre treating yourself to a nice spaghetti on toast how about a bottle of argentine wine its not bad all on me you blokes we rose uneasily from the table when hornbeam paid the bill by now his already generous feelings towards the evening were accentuated by heavy feeding im going to show you boys the town he said handsomely everythings my treat where shall we go to how about el nidito archer suggested or latelier theres a joint i used to know round the corner hornbeam said scratching his forehead little redhead in there plays the guitar he was delighted to find the bar was still there though reasonably enough the redhead wasnt it was a small dim place with a band playing sambas in the corner and a tall girl caressing a microphone not much thinner than herself lovely grub hornbeam said with relish whats it to be scotch there was no scotch but they gave us the locally distilled whisky which tasted like an oldfashioned carminative mixture trail got into earnest conversation with the girl behind the bar who came from lytham st annes and i sat wondering what the whisky was doing to my gastric lining ive had this place hornbeam said impatiently after a few minutes lets move on but weve only just arrived its too quiet come on blokes its my party so i can take it anywhere we went to a good many bars they all offered the samedarkness sambas local whisky and a girl behind the bar who came from some spot comparable to lytham its halfpast one i said to archer later doesnt anyone go to sleep in ba things are only beginning they go on like this all night they must be a tougher race than we are apart from the hours they seem to put up with their own whisky hornbeam was seized with a final inspiration lets go to the saratoga boys he announced thats a posh do trail told him dubiously its an expensive joint particularly at this hour of the night only the best is good enough for us hornbeam insisted saratoga next stop i want to see the dancing girls we found a cab and drove down the street to the saratoga it was a class above the bars and night clubs we had been toa small silklined place with two bands a tiny dance floor and a stage hornbeam strode in and demanded a table at the front this is more like it he said contentedly im fed up with slumming he ordered some champagne i looked around me and saw it was certainly more fortunate in its clientele than the other places we had visited the tone was marred only by our party in which hornbeam was now leaning back in his chair clapping his hands and demanding bring on the fat women there arent any here are there i asked archer you wait doc he said three blokes cant sit down alone anywhere south of panama without something turning up he was right a goodlooking blonde in a white evening gown sat on the chair beside me you buy me a trink no she said the waiter had already appeared and brought her a thimbleful of red liquid in a liqueur glass he also brought a green counter which he handed to her this she placed in her handbag id better put you wise archer said across the table out here you buy the coloured water and she gets the commission if you can last out till four you go home with her buckshee i dont think i can last out the next ten minutes the girl swallowed her glassful swiftly like a bad medicine you buy me another trink no the waiter gave her a second glass and another counter this is going to work out expensive i said all on me doc hornbeam said grandly tell her to send her friends over two more girls appeared and started drinking with the frightening rapidity of their companion however we all became very friendly and hornbeam ordered some more champagne when trail fell asleep on the table i said hadnt we better get the bill chief i could do with some sleep myself mozo hornbeam demanded bill pronto it was given to him immediately neatly folded on a plate he scowled at the figures and began counting notes from his pocket you buy me anoter trink no said the blonde no the bars down she got up and walked away say doc hornbeam called can you lend me five hundred pesos what i seem to be a bit short hornbeam spread his notes on the table he had been carried away by his generosity into a ditch of insolvency we searched in our pockets waking trail up to join in ninetyeight pesos archer said thats all we can muster hornbeam looked shiftily over his shoulder the waiter with that second sight which waiters have was aware that some hitch had arisen and threw dark glances at us visions of argentine prisons shimmered before my eyes i was sure the buenos aires police would arrest with the alacrity of their comrades in santos this is serious i said hasnt anyone got any money at all we searched our pockets again not a centavo trail said ive got a couple of bob though someone will have to go back to the ship and raise the wind archer said thats all there is for it the others will sit here and pretend theyre enjoying themselves well toss for who goes we tossed a twentycentavo piece i lost better take the ninetyeight pesos and see if you can get a cab hornbeam said make it snappy ten pound notes will cover it at blackmarket rates i stood outside in the hot dry air already feeling the apprehending hand on my shoulder i saw an empty cab on the other side of the street and leapt towards it dock sul i said but the driver could take me only as far as the rowing boat i had to cross the river and walk alone across the railway tracks to the ship i strode breathlessly along the middle of the road looking behind me more than in front a cat leapt across my path from shadow to shadow and i yelped i ran through the dock gates and up the gangway the lotus was dead the quartermaster was in a chair by the gangway asleep everyone not ashore was in their bunks wallowing in the deep unhindered unconsciousness of watchkeepers in port i thought my best chance was represented by the chief engineer he was lying with his mouth open on top of his bunk chief i called softly i shook him chief he stopped snoring and grunted chief wake up he opened his eyes stop the feed pumps and standby all engineers he said no chief its the doc can you lend me some money money what for man at this hour of night ill explain later but i must have it now in a hurry wait till i put my teeth in lad he gave me five pound notes the rest i collected by rousing whimble the second steward three or four of the engineers and easter i ran back to the ferry crumpling the notes in my hands i had to walk half a mile up the long road to the city before i found a taxi when i jumped out i found my expedition had taken the best part of an hour and the saratoga was rising to a final burst of activity before closing for the night i looked in nervously wondering if my companions had already been extracted by the police or had generously been allowed to wash dishes in the basement neither of these misfortunes had occurred to them in my absence they had all drawn a second wind and were enjoying themselves hugely they had three new girls and another bottle of champagne ive got the money i said breathlessly falling into a chair ah theres the old doc hornbeam said with surprise where did you come from i went to get some money to pay the bill i said angrily dont you remember thats right archer agreed good old doc mozo bill another bill was presented before they read the figures i knew what was coming that ten quid means five hundred pesos hornbeam said solemnly then theres this herehave you got any left doc i threw him a few peso notes umm he said looks as if we need about five hundred pesos well trail said brightly the doc had better go back for some more i banged the table no i said no i damn well wont i dont care if we all go to jail but im not going back to the ship the manager who had been hovering in the distance like a wellpreened vulture put his head into our group anything wrong gentlemen he asked yes i said we cant pay the bill i folded my arms and prepared to be arrested with the dignity of an englishman unfortunate said the manager bloody unfortunate hornbeam said how much are you gentlemen short five hundred pesos i see you are seafaring gentlemen are you not dont we look like it i said a not uncommon predicament always seafaring gentlemen a nice watch you have he said to trail must be worth at least a hundred pesos it cost me twenty quid in durban trail said hotly i stopped him hand it over i said he sulkily unstrapped his watch you other gentlemen have equally valuable timepieces the manager continued your turn trail said brightening a little hornbeam archer and i surrendered ours i think the manager continued a parker would settle it i gave him the pen from my pocket now get the hell out of here you bums he said or ill get the cops on you we stood a forlorn quartet on the pavement oh well said hornbeam you know what i told you the other night the only thing to do with life is to live it now lets start walking back to the ship chapter fourteen if you must be broke there are many conveniences in being broke as a seafarer on ships articles the necessities of life such as food shelter cigarettes and gin continue to be supplied regularly either free or on account until the end of the voyage and the state arouses among ones companions a lively sympathy expressed on land only on occasions of severe illness or other bitter natural misfortune when the story of our visit to the saratoga spread round the ship the next morning we were chivvied with offers of help from all hands had a bit of a night of it i hear doctor easter said jovially im afraid so i dont hold with that there saratoga he continued reflectively mind you they has some very posh tarts there very posh but they dont arf burn up the rhino is it worth it i ask you now me and chippy goes ashore quiet like and has a few beers in old ma whiteheads if we feels like indulging as you might say we goes round the back to a little place what chippy reckons he was first taken to by his father when he was sailing as a deckboy mind they aint no great beauties in there in fact chippy reckons theyre the same ones what his father knew but they come economic like and thats something these days aint it doctor thank you easter i appreciate your little lecture on thrift we lives and learns doctor how about a small contribution if youve run yourself short he pulled a bundle of peso notes from his jacket pocket definitely no i held up my hand i insist on suffering justly for my indiscretions besides i am already in debt to you if you lent me any more you might not have enough left for your own modest pleasures such as you have just described thats all right doctor i just flogged some of that there penicillin what was expired dr flowerday and i used to split it fiftyfifty but i dont mind taking fortysixty to oblige barmy on penicillin these argentinos i got rid of them there pills we didnt know what they wasthem green ones in the back of the locker told em they was good for virility and charged a peso each they go in for that sort of stuff a lot down here it is very kind of you easter butfor reasons which i should be ashamed to confessi much prefer you to keep the proceeds to yourself as you say doctor tip me the wink if you wants anything flogging wouldnt like a few tins of beef would you i scrounged some when a case bust going into no hold no thank you but i appreciate your generosity just get me another pitcher of iced water from the galley i put on my cap and went on deck it was almost noon the sun as coarse and uninhibited as everything else in the region shone savagely on the white planks and brown steel of the decks but the river the ships and the quay were as peaceful as an english village on a high summer afternoon the purring electric cranes were still and stood at untidy angles along the wharf with crates of merchandise at their feet abandoned by the dockers for the midday break some of the stevedores lay asleep in the shade that was sharply cut out here and there by corners and eaves others languidly masticated their lunch inside the doors of the airless sheds from somewhere downstream came the subdued hoot of a small ships whistle and the regular soft thumping of some essential pump the steers mooed spasmodically in the unseen corrals behind the meat works and the flies unaffected by the general langour buzzed in thick irritating squadrons everywhere i leaned on the hot rail and looked at the grey walls of the frigorifico anglo which was temporarily inactive for lunch i began to understand the disadvantages of my abrupt poverty we should be in buenos aires for at least a fortnight and the frigorifico though of superb interest as a commercial and technical undertaking and with appreciable merit as an example of functional design would soon become oppressive as the largest segment of my daily horizon i hadnt even the bus fare to the city while i was examining these bleak thoughts trail came and leaned next to me we discussed our condition in a few words theres not much to be done here if youre broke he observed we could rustle up enough to go to the pictures i suppose i can do that in london thats true theyve got some nice parks so they tell me we had adjusted ourselves to a dull stay in one of the worlds gayest capitals when a bright ray of entertainment abruptly shone into our lives from an unexpected source i was lying on my bunk after dinner reading the first paragraph of war and peace with the drowsy inattentive righteousness of a good churchgoer sitting through a summer sermon when easter pulled aside the curtain across the doorway fathers compliments he said and will you come to his cabin pronto oh lord whats eating the old boy now search me doctor hes getting the mate up there and the hunk hunk chief steward mr whimble very well i rolled off the bunk and took my cap from the hook over the desk i hope it isnt his stomach again hornbeam and whimble were already sitting on the settee in the captains cabin mcdougall was in one of the armchairs on either side of the desk sat captain hogg and mr montmorency the fathom lines manager in buenos aires all of them were smoking cigars and drinking liqueurs ah doctor come in mr montmorency called as i pushed the door curtain away he got up and seized me by the hand have a seat move over there mr whimble cigar real havana wont find them in england eh benedictine curaзao or brandy some kummel perhaps or a flash of the old starboard light benedictine will do nicely i said i sat down between whimble and hornbeam while mr montmorency lit my cigar he was a lean brown man with a brisk black moustache dressed in a crisp linen suit he was an officewallah and therefore formally despised but he was secretly respected as an important and dangerous man in the lives of everyone who depended on the fathom line for their pay beneath the sunburnt hearty crust was a sharp brain eager to send damning cables to st mary axe where a few words of code could hold up a mans promotion for ten years or tip him back into the uncertain currents of the shipping pool even captain hogg was affable to mr montmorency right gentlemen mr montmorency went on forcefully i have asked you up here today for a particular reason apart from having the pleasure of meeting you captain hogg assures me i am glad to say that he thinks highly of your services under his command a very happy ship captain hogg declared he swallowed half a tumbler of benedictine and glared at the rest of us in defiance of contradiction i am sure it is captain now gentlemen i am going to talk to you on a most serious topic it is british prestige he took on his smartest chamber of commerce manner it is hardly necessary for me to trace the course of events in this bustling subcontinent since the cessation of hostilitieshostilities gentlemen in which the company we represent suffered as grievously as anybut you will i am sure all appreciate that the interest of our motherland in its affairs has increased rather than diminished though in the face of severe and sometimes to us inexplicable opposition some more benedictine captain thank you mr montmorency pass the bottle round gentlemen as i was saying the tail of the british lion has been severely put out of joint he went on about the old red duster free trade the socialists nationalization hard times the necessity to pull together put our shoulders to the wheel steer a straight course and not rock the boat all of us were hazily wondering where the speech was leading him and uneasily contemplating our own guilty consciences i nervously calculated the turnover in easters dockside pharmaceutical dealings hornbeam thought anxiously about his stevedores presents and whimble was wondering how to account for the ham and two cases of tinned pears that had somehow vanished between santos and the river plate but if these skeletons were visible to the penetrating eye of mr montmorency he was not going to mention it i suddenly realized he was sayingthere will of course be a running buffet and the best we can do in the way of drinks it will give the british colony here a bit of an outing reassure the local businessmen send up the prestige of the line and in a small way that of the old country besides gentlemen it will fittingly usher in the new year any comments mcdougall who had fallen asleep woke up at the words new year and blew his nose loudly a very generous offer captain hogg growled on behalf of my officers and crew i should like to express my gratitude to the management thank you captain now gentlemen you are the senior officers you know my plans and i expect you to make it a success this dance on shipboard must be remembered in buenos aires as one of the events of the season a dance on shipboardi saw at once tissots paintingmatchwood decks fragile rails graceful bright brasswork summery officers with downy whiskers in gold and blue and white clean sailors contented bandsmen delicate ladies in sprays of frills frail parasols pirouetting beneath a canopy of the majestic ensigns of half a dozen now forgotten empiresinto this they were going to turn the lotus tied up by a meat works the news of the new years eve dance fell upon the ships company like a heavy breaker on the beach overwhelming the minor ripples already set up by our misfortunes in the saratoga the previous night reactions to the party differed sharply easter was frankly disgusted i ask you he said coming into my cabin and tossing an armful of my clean laundry peevishly on the bunk what a lashup fags fairylights and ladies lavatories cor i dunno what they think this hooker is the queen mary isnt in it surely easter after your experience on the transatlantic boats you would welcome a touch of the atmosphere of a large liner what on this old tramp firstclass smokeroom now thats different all the nobs in there getting stinko not noticing you rook em on the measure and slipping you a quid or two to show em the way to some young bits cabindiscreet like what are we going to get on this old tub crowd of shorewallahs looking for free booze thats what fat lot of good that is you may be able to interest some of them in the threecard trick he brightened a little i might that doctor but there aint no flies on them round these parts trail was ecstatic have you seen this doc he called to me the next day waving a sheet of typewritten paper lists of guests take a dekko dont bother with this lot ambassador bishop and so on asked but not able to comelook heremister and missus and daughter here againand daughters all the way downmiss miss miss lovely grub the shipll be like a bloody harem by eight bells i dont think you ought to get overexcited threeo the misses are probably elderly ladies pillars of the mission and the daughters will most likely be still in short frocks in any event you can be sure theyll be kept under strict supervision by their watchful parents on a ship like this steady on doc theres bound to be some nice bits of crumpet among them i think i know this one down here anyway used to work in the companys offices on corrientes he rubbed his hands its going to be a happy new year and no mistake hornbeam was less enthusiastic more work for the bloody mate he said half the buntings gone mouldy and the bosn flogged the canvas awnings in the canaries last trip how the hell can i get the boatdeck holystoned and painted in three days i bet were short of scotch homeward bound on the strength of it too a state of despair settled on whimble the greater part of the preparations fell to him and he was expected to account for everything issued from his stores from a crate of scotch to a jar of maraschino cherries tablecloths fruit bowls glasses and silver came from halfforgotten straw nests in dusty crates stowed under hundredweights of flour rice tinned vegetables and a case of gordons gin he had lost three voyages ago and had been anxiously cooking the bar books to replace ever since oh dear oh dear he said coming out of the storeroom with his shirt stuck to his chest with sweat balloons they want now did you ever hear of it i dont know what the office will say when we get home the balloons were a whim of captain hoggs he had taken an enthusiastic and forceful interest in the dance and spent most of the day pacing up and down the boatdeck rearranging the deck furnishings and decorations mr whimble he shouted frequently mr whimble where the devil are you i think the buffet would be better on the port side not so many flies get it changed over whats happened to mr hornbeam bosn take down number three awning and rig it abaft the funnel so the holes wont show mr trail are you supposed to be in charge of lifeboats yes sir you arent fit to sail a toy boat on a paddling pool get those ropes stowed properly aye aye sir doctor sir flies doctor the bluebottles from the meat works they are a sanitary problem are they not yes sir included in the syllabus for the examination in public health you are responsible for them i dont want a damn fly on my ship by tomorrow night understand its rather a tall order sir thats your look out get some insect killer from mr hornbeam i dont care how you go about it but there arent to be any flies very good sir i could find only enough insecticide for one spraygun and this i gave to easter with instructions to pump it vigorously round the captain every time he stepped on to the deck this seemed to satisfy him he left me alone until the evening before the party when he called a conference of officers in his cabin this is going to be a damn good party he began sternly the office expects everyone to enjoy themselves and its bloody well up to you to see they do get me now listen to this he picked up a sheet of paper from the desk these are the masters orders for tomorrow night one uniform clean number tens with correct epaulettes and white shoes collars to be correctly buttoned up he glared at mcdougall who came to supper comfortably in carpet slippers with the high collar of his jacket wide enough apart to allow the dragon tattooed on his chest to peep coyly over his second brass button doctor you will wear white ducks white shirt black tie and companys regulation cap sir if necessary two guests are to be met at the head of the gangway by master and senior officers see the quartermasters in uniform and sober mr hornbeam aye aye sir three no ladies are on any account to be entertained in officers cabins or elsewhere than on the portions of the boatdeck assigned for that purpose there goes trails evening i whispered to hornbeam four all alcoholic liquors on board to be placed under seal at noon tomorrow and no such liquors to be served to any member of the ships company before the arrival of guests at ten oclock tomorrow night five all shore leave stopped from noon tomorrow six all members of ships company to remain decent and sober throughout tomorrow night my ship is on show gentlemen understand we murmured acceptance of the terms the music will be provided by a band from one of the english clubs captain hogg continued get the sparks to jack up the amplifying system in case we have to play records mr hornbeam have you been through the ships record library mr whimble they seem to be sort of operas and stuff sir capital i like a bit of opera right gentlemen oh doctor ive put that man of yours in charge of the bar who easter yes strikes me as a reliable honest sort of fellow i swallowed i felt any opinion of mine would spoil the contentment of both of them very well conference dismissed as we went down the companionway together i said to mcdougall the prohibition orders going to delay you chaps getting hogmanay away to a good start he dropped a red eyelid over a crafty eye itud take more than yon pipsqueak to stand in a scots way on hogmanay lad come along to my cabin when youve finished yer tea tomorrow well find you a dram or two from somewhere chapter fifteen i was called from my shower at eight the next evening to put half a dozen stitches in the forehead of a fireman who had fallen down the stokehold ladder for this reason i was the only officer who arrived on deck to greet the guests sober captain hoggs orders had been punctiliously obeyed except for the one impounding the ships supply of liquor since teatime whimble had been poking his head in his locker like a nervous ostrich in a perilous desert in the chief engineers cabin scots accents rawed under the sting of neat whisky hornbeam and the mates poured gin from the waterbottles above their basins and captain hogg himself had been entertaining mr montmorency and his sleek argentine wife the boatdeck of the lotus looked surprisingly attractive fairylights shone on the fresh white chalk spread over the scrubbed deck ensigns and signal flags lined the rails and obliterated the stark frigorifico and on the long tables garnished with blazing argentine flowers glass and linen fell pleasingly and promisingly on the eye the bandthree argentines with piano guitar and drums was seriously tuning up behind the ensign of the commonwealth of australia at the head of the gangway which was enlivened with bunting and a string of bulbs a quartermaster stood nervously in white matelots rig stewards in shining jackets stood with silver trays and serviettes between the freshpainted ventilators behind the bar was easter with an expression of disarming honesty on his face that suggested a bishop going through the dover customs with two bottles of brandy in his gyp besides the quartermaster the ships officersin clean white number tens white shoes correct epaulettes collar fully buttoned upstood greeting the guests with great charm and affability to me it seemed that the decorum of my shipmates had a certain brittleness about it a nervous overemphasis this was noticeable in the way the chief engineer tenaciously kissed the hands of the ladies the hesitation with which whimble brought a match to a guests cigarette hornbeams roar of laughter trail openmouthed mentally stripping every woman under forty stepping off the gangway and the abandon with which captain hogg was pinching mrs montmorencys bottom i felt a tug at my elbow it was easter leaning across the bar holding out a long glass of brownish fluid best respects doctor he said hoarsely this is the stuff im making up for me and my mates what is it little cocktail i invented on the western run i calls it fire alarm thank you easter i fancy i have some leeway to make up the guests seemed to be shippers and senior fathom line employees who knew each other and mr montmorency well and were therefore relieved of the cumbrance of social chatter while getting down to the free drinks and lobster patties as i was not in uniform no one bothered to talk to me and i was content to stay in the shade of a ventilator by the bar smoke the ships cigarettes drink fire alarms and leave the entertaining to my companions chй un cigarillo por favor a slim brunette with incandescent eyes and teeth stood in front of me i beg your pardon oh dont you speak spanish i only want a cigarette i handed her one from my own tin thanks you work in the meatworks too do you i was hurt the lotus may have been a rusting oldfashioned tramp but that night i was proud of her not a bit im one of the officers what of this old tub you look too respectable why arent you dressed up i am the doctor i explained stiffly her eyes instantly shone brighter well what do you know i get the most crippling pain in my back i saw at once that i had committed a social error during my spell as a general practitioner i had learned that members of the public meeting a doctor socially believe they can entertain him only by briskly trotting out an account of their illnesses when introduced to the bank manager they do not immediately start talking about their overdrafts and on shaking hands with the local jp they are not compelled to discuss the number of times they have been summonsed but they firmly hold the idea that the doctor can be diverted for halfhours at a time by details of their symptoms or even those of faraway relatives and dead acquaintances it sort of catches me round here she continued twining her arm behind her and pushing her sharp bosom forward whenever i twist round suddenlyouch see what i mean ive been to doctors all over the worldlondon paris new york here in ba they never did me a bit of good though i still had my pain sometimes i woke up in the night and screamed very distressing for you im sure oh i began to lose faith in doctors you dont mind my saying so do you not a bit have a fire alarm what is it its a drink very good for backache she giggled well then i went to an osteopath in wimpole streethe was sweet he told me i had a displaced spine what do you think he slipped it back again like shutting a door there i think that i only used to get it after that when it rained why do you think that was and then i was playing tennis out at the hurlingham club last month when bingo i may i introduce you to our third officer i interrupted you will find him very charming for the past few seconds trail had been staring at my companion with his mouth open he jumped at my remark so much he spilt his drink on the deck then he stepped forward with the expression of a hungry deckhand going in for his sunday dinner mr trail i said miss ella robinson mr trail is our most popular officer i whispered to her the captain thinks highly of him but if i may speak as a shipmate he is a little shy and needs encouragement enjoying the dance threeo have another drink trail said thickly i think hes cute miss robinson decided flashing him a swift glance of appraisal i had been treating his spots since we left santos and in his clean white jacket and painstakingly brylcreemed hair he looked as presentable as an ian hay subby har trail said how about a dance mmm ive never danced with a sailor before be a sweetie and hold my glass doctor grinning weakly trail drew her on to the chalked square of deck and began dancing with the spirit that nightly won him hearts in reeses dance hall in liverpool i contentedly took another fire alarm from easter and leant back on my ventilator after the night at the saratoga anyone so pressingly feminine as miss robinson was too much for me when the music stopped the couple came back to my corner of the deck both of them were flushed and breathless youre a swell dancer miss robinson said to trail giving him a hot glance of admiration am i really he asked eagerly go on yes i mean it not like most englishmen out here when i dance with you i sure know im dancing have another fire alarm i said signalling to easter do you dance doctor she asked definitely no i come from a family with very strong views on the subject how amusing do you know my pains coming back look she turned round run your hand down my spine thats rightjust there ooo exquisitely painful what do you think i ought to do about it i should go and see a doctor she laughed playfully gee youre funny youre the nicest doctor ive ever met thank you down the hatch now we drank our fire alarms and the band began to play again lets dance she said to trail not for a minute he said let me show you the steering gear what on earth should i want to see the steering gear for it looks most attractive in the moonlight i added encouragingly not many people are privileged to see it only mr trail and the captain have the key cmon trail said he gave her a look that would have terrified the heart out of any girl in england and strode off purposefully with her hand in hand towards the steel nooks and shadows of the stern i moved to the rail leant over the strip of dirty oilcoated water between the lotus and the quay and exchanged glances with the two sour argentine policemen standing at the foot of the gangway the night was hot and the awnings prevented ventilation shortly the ships officers unhooked their high collars and wiped their foreheads with coloured handkerchiefs and sweat began to run down the faces of the guests no one bothered me so i sipped my way through my drink and thought guiltily about england i was interrupted by a hundred pipers an a from the corner where the band had been playing it was almost eleventhirty and the engineroom had by then taken over the party for themselves the engineers were lolling round the piano with an air of genial possessiveness towards everything they could see and mcdougall was stripped to the waist his dragon hearts and sailing ship glistening among the grey tufts of hair that sprouted from his thorax and shoulders like bracken on a highland hillside singing with them was captain hogg drunk to the point of harmlessness and the montmorencys the music was provided by easter who was playing the piano in the style of chico marx with a flourish easter finished his piece rose to his feet and announced solemnly ladies and gentlemen for my next number tonight i shall give you my rendering of the famous old english ballad the lily of laguna jolly good luck to you gentlemen jolly good luck he sat down heavily and began the tune to which most of the audience sang the words of annie laurie mcdougall then shouted it was midnight by ships time as the clocks were to be advanced half an hour and broke into auld lang syne this was taken up by the company and i was swept into a chain of crossed hands mcdougall sang with his eyes tightly shut swaying between a pair of other scots suddenly he stopped shouted kiss all the lasses and dived towards mrs montmorency he grasped her in his moist naked arms and kissed her hotly until he was elbowed out of the way by macpherson mcphail and macintosh these were followed by captain hogg easter whimble one of the argentine policemen from the dock the quartermaster hornbeam and myself then everyone sang auld lang syne all over again at the end of the verse captain hogg shouted eight bells quartermaster ring eight bells midnight ships time mrs montmorency instantly threw her arms open and was kissed by mcdougall macpherson captain hogg mcdougall again myself easter hornbeam mcdougall once again macpherson mcphail and mcdougall she appeared to enjoy these unstinted tributes thoroughly though mr montmorency who stood fidgeting beside her and moved during her fourth embrace with mcdougall to murmur nervously steady on maria i say steady on old girl we sang auld lang syne and kissed maria montmorency several times as a member of the circle recalled that it was midnight in greenwich glasgow greenock or some other point of overwhelming importance to himself finally her husband grabbed her by the arm and led her to the gangway while everyone cheered and easter played sons of the brave the engineers and hornbeam then decided to visit the taxidance on the other side of the dock come on doc hornbeam urged its only over the ferry we can get there in ten minutes i thought you hadnt any money i flogged some whisky to the policeman its a cheap jointthe girls will darn your socks as well for twenty pesos i shook my head no thanks ive got into enough trouble in ba already besides im tired im turning in i left my shipmates who were already on the gangway with bottles sticking out of the pockets of their white ducks i was tired and muzzy easters fire alarms had an effect like anaesthetic ether producing a disturbing numbness and incoordination of the extremities all i wanted was to lie on my bunk turn on the forced draught and sink on to the soft foam that overlies the dark cool liquor of unconsciousness yawning i unhooked my cabin jalousie pushed the curtain aside and turned on the light on the deck was trail asleep two halfempty whisky bottles and some broken glasses were on the desk lying on my bunk her skirt round her waist and snoring heavily was ella i began with an attempt to resuscitate trail by throwing the remains of my drinking water over him from this it was apparent that he was in a state of deep surgical anaesthesia and i could have cut a leg off without his noticing it while i was shaking him and slapping his face i heard a deep groan from the bunk and noticed that ella was wearily moving her arm i dropped trail and began flicking her face with the end of a towel she shook her head and muttered something ella ella i called wake up come onfor gods sake woman whats that i bent my ear close to her wanna be sick she said oh lord i lay the towel over her poised my empty hotwater can on her bosom and hurried down to the hospital to find some sal volatile when i came back she was sitting on the edge of the bunk her head held heavily in her hands her long black hair scattered uncaringly over her shoulders and forehead her eyes closed and her face white she looked like a patient at the end of a long operation here ella drink this i said cheerfully she pushed me away clumsily dont wan another drink this isnt drinkits medicine make you feel better see jolly good stuff look im having some myself wanna go home yes i know but drink this first its something special for chrissake take me home for chrissake oh all right then where do you live there was a pause she slowly shook her head dunno i looked hopefully at trail but he seemed unlikely to take part in any conversation before noon the following day ella i said gently think please where do you live havent you got a phone number wanna go to bed she started to roll back on my bunk but i caught her no you cant go to sleep i told her firmly therell be hell to pay if i dont get you out of my cabin and off this ship now try and remember where you live the street will do i spotted her handbag wedged down the side of the bunk opened it and found one of her visiting cards it bore an address in the palermo district which i thought was somewhere on the other side of buenos aires all right i said slipping my arm under her shoulders were going for a walk the gangway quartermaster gave me a grin lovely grub eh doctor he said he winked and smacked his lips in case i had missed the point of his remark benson i said sternly i need about two hundred pesos i should be obliged if you would lend it to me if you have it i see no prospect of repaying you until we return home but if you refuse i shall give you hell should you happen to fall sick on the voyage back thank you we stumbled down the gangway together ella grasping my collar and groaning after picking our way over the railway lines and bollards on the quay we reached the little office of the dock police by the gate i gave the policeman ten pesos and asked him to call a taxi twenty minutes later we were bumping along the dirty road beside the frigorifico ella already asleep and snoring on my shoulder the cab stopped outside a tall block of flats several miles from the ship i gave ella a shake and she woke up with a start youre home i said end of the line oh god i feel horrible so do i take me inplease cant you make it yourself she shook her head oh all right then i helped her out of the cab making signs to the driver to wait we went into a small hall which contained a staircase and an automatic lift as i opened the lift doors ella leant heavily on my shoulder and burst into tears she told me through sobs she lived in number seventeen on the third floor the key was in her handbag i took her up to her own door and opened it at that moment her knees gave way she began to slide slowly down the doorpost the room opposite she muttered for gods sake help me in i supported her across the hallway and into the room opposite the flat door i turned on the light with my free hand and found i was in her bedroom put your arm round my neck i commanded she obeyed and i lifted her up laying her on the bed heavily all right i said you can unclasp my neck now i heard a noise behind me and turned standing in the doorway was a tall stern greying gentleman with a stiff moustache and a military eye dressed in a yellow silk dressinggown behind him was a timid sandy becrackered woman in a faded housecoat ive a damn good mind to horsewhip you the grey gentleman said decisively now look here i say i began i might tell you i consider you an unmitigated cad ive no idea what your upbringing is but i dont imagine its very savoury if i were a few years younger id give you a good hiding with my bare fists a young puppy like you needs teaching a good lesson be careful charles the woman said nervously you know what you did to the rolleston boy charles twitched his muscles under his dressinggown ella seemed to have bulldog drummond for a father i should never have let her go on that damn ship he said bitterly i believed at least the officers would be gentlemen i was mistaken mind your temper charles the woman added timidly covering her eyes with her hands now look here i said angrily i assure you i have had nothing to do with your daughter charles snorted pray how do you explain that lipstick all over your shirt a disgusting exhibition by god im not at all certain i shant horsewhip you after all charles charles you have got quite the wrong end of the stick charles by now had time to look at me carefully and find i was much smaller than he was he advanced going red in the face put them up you young hound he growled there was nothing for it i threw one of ellas pillows at him sidestepped quickly and dashed for the door i shot into the lift leaped for the taxi like a survivor grasping for a lifeboat and drove back to the ship looking nervously through the back window at every turn for cars bearing greying gentlemen in silk dressinggowns who were anxious to relieve the strangling monotony of buenos aires social life by avenging the honour of their daughters and when i got back i found trail had recovered sufficiently to climb into my bunk chapter sixteen i spent the rest of our time in buenos aires walking the broad crisscrossed sundrenched streets looking for a cheap watch i kept out of the bars and if i thought a woman looked at me i jumped the momentum that had carried us headlong into the pleasures of south america had expended itself by the end of the dance afterwards our lives settled into the unexciting routine of a ship in port every morning i read carefully through the english buenos aires standard had a cup of tea with hornbeam and strolled round the active decks in the afternoon i filled my cabin with the last squirts of our ddt spray and slept soundly until tea in defiance of the rattling winch just beyond my head now and then i picked up war and peace but the freezing plains of russia seemed so fantastic i killed a few cockroaches with it and finally put the books away for the voyage home in the evening when the sun had gone down and a breeze sometimes blew off the river plate to refresh our decks we sat in hornbeams cabin with a case of tinned beer flaying sober games of bridge or liardice i felt that i had been living alongside the wharf in buenos aires for a lifetime and i sometimes stared at the familiar angles of my cabin in disbelief that they had ever been softened with the shadows of an english winters day when i told the others this one evening hornbeam said youd get used to living in hell doc if we sailed there all these places are the same anyway he lay on his bunk halfnaked fanning himself with a copy of the shipping world theyre hot and sweaty and full of blokes ready to cut your throat for tuppence its the same out east and on the african coast theres no more romance at sea than there is round aldgate tube station when are we leaving for home i asked he shrugged his shoulders i couldnt say maybe a week maybe two it depends how the cargo goes in once youre in port the wharfies have got you whether its in cardiff or calcutta i heard from the agent today the boys might be cooking up a strike that would fix us right enough i wouldnt mind a pint of old english wallop out of the barrel just now archer said seriously or a bit of backchat with a liverpool barmaid you can have too much of these highpressure floozies out here we sat looking miserably into our beer glasses all suddenly homesick i reckon i ought to have married and settled down hornbeam continued i nearly did once im still engaged to her if it comes to that shes in sydney sends me letters and sweets and things i see her about once every two years i should have stuck to selling refrigerators archer said to me i did it for a bit after the war but i had to give it up your money doesnt go anywhere ashore these days you fellows dont know how well off you are in the merchant navy i told him the merchant navy hornbeam said folding his hands on his bare stomach reflectively its a queer institution a cross between fred karnos army and a crowd of blokes trying to do a job of work theres no security at sea archer added gloomily maybe its better than sitting on your fanny in an office till you drop dead hornbeam said pictures every saturday night and margate for a fortnight in summer drive me up the pole that would margates all right trail remarked joining the conversation i knew a girl who lived there once her father ran a shootingalley in dreamland chapter seventeen it was a fortnight before we sailed a quiver of excitement ran through the ship with the fresh vibrations of the engines the deckhands ambled about their work singingnot seashanties because they heard those only occasionally on the pictures but anything they knew from shell be coming round the mountain to rock of ages all hands seem to be pretty happy i observed to easter as a man sauntered past chanting every turn of the screw brings me nearer to you well were going home doctor but weve only been away a couple of months still its always like this whether youve been away two years or a fortnight you gets a bit slaphappy when you leaves your final port i think i can understand it for most of them i suppose its only an attic in liverpool or a dirty old house in the east end still its home sir youre right where do you live easter down in cheltenham do you indeed i lives with the old lady he continued she keeps a sweetshop down there getting a bit past it now though well over seventy the idea of easter having a mother was disturbing i had thought of him vaguely as climbing out of the sea on the heels of venus are you coming back next trip easter i suppose so he replied ive tried it ashore done all sorts of jobs apart from the halls and the races ive worked in pubs laundries hotels fishandchip shops even done a bit of navvying sometimes i gets settled into something steady butwell you know how it is i goes round to the public library and has a look at lloyds list on a saturday afternoon and im finished i think how nice it would be getting away somewhere instead of standing in a queue in the rain im afraid i see your point easter but perhaps youll get married what at my time of life and after what ive seen of women cor ive had em all i haveblack white brown and yellow theyre all the same underneath do you read kipling easter i asked with interest kipling hes dead now aint he he doesnt seem to be dead at sea no i dont read much doctor no time for books takes you all your life to keep going these days dont it we detached ourselves from the meat works and steamed slowly down the long buoyed channel along the shallow river plate towards montevideo and the atlantic from there we had a straight run home broken only at the canary islands for oil the sea was calm and the sky unbroken off montevideo we left the last persevering seagull behind us and were again alone ourselves and the sea about another three weeks hornbeam said and youll be having a pint at the carradoc i hope it turns out cheaper than the last drink i had with you he laughed remind me to get you a new pen doc anyhow we ought to have a pretty quiet voyage till we reach the bay and so we did two days out captain hogg became more morose than usual then took to keeping to himself for a few days he came down to meals which he consumed without passing a word or giving any indication that he sensed our presence at the table at all as no one else dared to speak this meant that lunch and supper were eaten in a silence that amplified such noises as chewing a stick of celery to the volume of a tropical thunderstorm after that he took his meals in his cabin and appeared only occasionally on the deck he would stand outside his door for a few minutes scratch his head blow his nose and disappear for the day everyone was delighted the old mans got a proper cob on about something hornbeam said never pokes his nose on the bridge when i go to his cabin he just grunts and says hes left the running of the ship to me suits me fine lifes nice and quiet isnt it yes its wonderful i wonder how long itll last it lasted until the night of the shipwreck when we were two days away from the canaries the weather broke suddenly within a few hours the sun was intercepted by heavy englishlooking clouds and a cold wind came down from the north and threw handfuls of rain across our decks i lay in my bunk rocking contentedly and confidently in the swing of the ocean it was shortly after midnight and i was suspended in the pleasant arcade between sleep and wakefulness enjoying the best of both then the alarm bells rang i sat up and switched on the light seven short rings meaning boat stations someone on the bridge had obviously leant on the alarm button i was wondering what to do when the whistle blew abandon ship christ i said i jumped from my bunk like a sprinter off the mark i fell over the hotwater can picked myself up and threw open the cabin door trail lived opposite me and had just come off watch he was looking disturbed whats up i asked anxiously its abandon ship i know but why search me doc she was all right when i came off the bridge wed better get up top i hitched up my pyjama trousers and started for the companionway your lifejacket you fool trail shouted at me oh lord i forgot i ran back to my cabin pulled on my lifejacket and started tying it it occurred to me i should make an attempt to save some of my possessions so i picked up my empty spongebag and stuffed one or two handy articles into it i later discovered i had preserved from the deep a shoehorn two empty cigarette tins a roll of film and a copy of teach yourself spanish grabbing a tin of morphine from the locker i hurried towards the boatdeck the crew of the lotus had boat drill at fourthirty every friday afternoon as prescribed by the ministry of transport and this was always carried out efficiently with calmness and in an atmosphere of polite cooperation there are however certain factors that complicate boat drill in earnest which are not operative during its harmless rehearsals in the first place it is usually nighttime there is a cold wind blowing and it is raining a strong sea is running which makes it difficult to swing the boats out without smashing them everyone has been woken up from a deep sleep and is bad tempered the bosn has forgotten where he put the handle to one of the davits the third has lost the rollcall all hands are perplexed and naturally worried about saving themselves as well as giving wholehearted enthusiasm to preserving their shipmates also all the lights are out i slipped over the wet deck now alive with hurrying sailors and found my way to the huddle of men round my own boat they were cutting away the strings holding the canvas cover under the directions of the third my god what a lashup the third said all right bosn standby to swing swing out all boats captain hoggs voice came through the loud hailer swing out the third repeated three men swung on each davit handle with an energy usually shown at sea only when arriving in port ten minutes before the pubs shut swing out there captain hogg repeated the ship is going down a rocket flew into the air and exploded into gently falling coloured stars get a move on you men he shouted come on come on trail ordered impatiently standby the falls there excuse my interrupting i said but if were sinking we dont seem to have much of a list on cut it out doc right lower away there steady forrard hornbeam in his lifejacket and underpants came breathlessly over to us whats up i asked search me the old man started it i went up to the bridge and he kicked me off suddenly the deck lights snapped on we all paused and looked at one another right came from the loud hailer that was the poorest exhibition ive seen in all my years at sea that was boat drill see as it should be done none of this friday afternoon teaparty stuff youre the most inefficient crew ive ever had the misfortune to sail with swing em in again and dismiss to a chorus of groans and ingenious profanity the boats were swung in and made fast i went below to change my clothes and pour myself a drink i was still towelling myself when trail came in what the hell does father think hes up to he demanded throwing his wet lifejacket on my bunk i suppose hes allowed to hold boat drill at night if he wants to hes allowed to all right hes allowed to do anything he can marry you bury you put you in irons or hang you from the yardarm that doesnt mean to say he can do it every night what do the crew think of it theyre complaining to their union i wish i could complain to mine trail pulled his wet jacket off and sat down i wonder what made the old man do it he asked more calmly its the first time weve seen him for a week probably didnt want us to forget him thats likely its finished with now anyway it was bloody cold up there on deck youre going to have about twenty pneumonia cases tomorrow care for a peg before we turn in thanks ill have a quick one i was handing him the whisky bottle when the whistle blew for the second time the scene on the boatdeck was repeated but it was played at a much more leisurely pace the crew showed no enthusiasm at all for the exercise come on trail ordered its got to be done so youd better get it over with put your backs in it the loud hailer roared call yourselves sailors get a move on with number four mr trail for gods sake lads trail said keep the old man happy slowly our boat swung out rocking in the wind tugging at the arms of the swearing crew after twenty minutes on the cold wet deck captain hogg gave the order to swing in again the boats were brought back to their blocks lashed down and covered with their canvas sheets hornbeam who had found time to put on his uniform came back to us all squared up third he asked anxiously aye aye mr hornbeam all right you lot can dismiss the voice came from the loud hailer right now repeat the exercise hornbeam spun round no he shouted towards the bridge we wont the wind and sea were making a fair noise but these were obliterated by the silence that fell upon everyone on deck i held my breath the bridge was in darkness but i imagined clearly the explosive figure standing there the loud hailer was still for a few seconds this is mutiny it roared hornbeam shrugged his shoulders dismiss all hands he said disregard all further alarm signals mr hornbeam ill put you in irons hornbeam took no notice youll pay for this by god you see everythings lashed down third hornbeam continued calmly im going on the bridge he made towards the ladder you come up here and ill kick your teeth in he reached the end of the ladder a heavy firebucket fell on the deck just missing his head i got hold of him and pulled him away look here i said dont be a fool let me go up and see him after all im more or less out of this i can explain its bad for the crew on medical grounds or something hes got nothing against me i can be an intermediary nothing doing doc this is my pidgin no it isnt i dont want to spend the rest of the night putting stitches in your scalp im sure he wont chuck anything at me all right doc he said but watch your step setting my teeth i climbed up the ladder to the bridge at first i thought the wheelhouse was empty then i caught sight of the captain standing by the terrified quartermaster who was steering he looked like a fat malignant ape whos that he growled doctor sir i began i came on behalf of the mate get off my bridge i wondered if i might explain that on purely medical grounds get out in my professional opinion i continued resolutely get out he screamed or ill bash your bloody brains in he seized from the bulkhead some heavy instrument it was i suppose a marline spike or some similar appliance that skippers are traditionally expected to take to beat in the brains of their crew i did not wait to find out i scrambled down the ladder and fell hard on to the deck i hurt my arm and ripped my pyjamas but already i had forgotten the incident a new and more terrifying thought took possession of me captain hogg was undoubtedly clinically insane chapter eighteen delusions of grandeur i read aloud occur frequently in this condition it was the next morning hornbeam and trail were sitting in my cabin while i read aloud from a textbook of medicine the weather had calmed down and the storm that blew through the ship the night before had abated with it immediately after turning me off the bridge captain hogg had abruptly gone to his cabin locked the door and turned in he appeared in the morning without making any reference to the nights excitement and was even faintly friendly towards everyone on board he gave the impression that he imagined the activity on the boatdeck was part of a particularly enjoyable dream you see i explained to the others delusions of grandeur i ought to have spotted it before still its difficult in a ships captain no one notices if they have them whats wrong with him doc hornbeam asked with interest gpigeneral paralysis of the insane undoubtedly its a late stage of syphilis listen to this the patient is usually a man in his middle fifties who suddenly becomes subject to attacks of bad temper fits of sulking and lack of judgment these may alternate with periods of violent excitement the condition is usually first noticed by members of the sufferers family circle rather than the physician doesnt that fit in the old boy picked it up thirty years ago on the brazilian coast and now were getting the benefit of it hornbeam rolled a cigarette thoughtfully its a serious business doc if youre right im pretty certain i am is there any sort of test you can do to make sure trail asked i couldnt give you a definite opinion without examining him i ran my eye down the page of the book the patient has the sensation of walking on cottonwool i read out stabbing pains in the legs at nightloss of kneejerksloss of pain sensation in the tendo achillespupils do not react to lighttheres a good many signs you see yes but do you suppose hes going to let you barge into his cabin and examine him hornbeam asked have you thought about that you raise a difficulty in diagnosis certainly i admitted i dont feel he would be a highly cooperative patient particularly after last night well well have to let him go on being balmy then i shut the book and took my spectacles off i have an idea i announced i remember the way i was once told to examine children children this ones some baby its the principle of the thing that matters they taught us in hospital to deal with unwilling children by distracting their attention and examining what you wanted while they werent looking see what im getting at the kneejerks for instance i shall engage him in conversation and drop a book or a bottle of something on his patella pretending its an accident oh yes i think thats the answer i said warming to the idea ill build up a diagnosis in a couple of days and send in a report to the company mind he doesnt bite you trail said i had a chance to try my new technique of fragmented diagnosis at dinner captain hogg appeared for the first time since his retirement and seemed in capital spirits he sat down next to me at the head of the table tucked his serviette in with a flourish and fell upon the roast mutton good mutton this mr whimble he said through a mouthful of potatoes dont get much like it these days where did you buy it london sir its kept well bythe way mr hornbeam get the hatch covers off number three by tonight if the weather holds we may be filling that twenty feet in teneriffe very good sir im pleased to find the weathers cleared sir i said brightly this fresh breeze makes you feel youre walking on cottonwool he said nothing do you ever feel you are walking on cottonwool sir i asked no he said i dont he swallowed another mouthful of greens and mutton i was keenly disappointed the weather ought to hold he said the glass is going up i had an aunt i remarked every time the glass went up she had stabbing pains in her legs did she do you get stabbing pains in your legs sir what the devil are you talking about doctor oh nothing of importance sir i miserably fiddled with a piece of roast potato it seemed that my means of eliciting the patients symptoms was not going to meet with clinical success i decided i would go ahead and examine for the physical signs i dropped my serviette on the deck as i bent down to pick it up i pinched captain hogg hard behind the ankle ouch he said im dreadfully sorry sir what the hell are you playing at i thoughti thought it was the mates foot well what difference does that make we were having a little game i dont like games captain hogg said not in my ship very good sir i jabbed moodily at my treacle sponge for the rest of the meal despair freezing my heart find anything out hornbeam said in my cabin afterwards not much couldnt you see yes you were making a bit of a mess of it supposing hes not potty at all but just acting his own sweet self im sure hes insane i said heatedly certain of it if they put him in the final examinations every student would get through hes a classical case the only trouble is i cant get near enough to prove it well have to be pretty certain before we say anything to the company doc i always believe in clearing my own yardarm i banged the desk with my fist damn it heres this mancertifiably insanewith every one of us at his mercy why any time he might break out again like last night supposing he goes and puts us aground at the canaries or rams the queen mary or something off bishop rock hes capable of absolutely anything what would we do then hornbeam scratched his cheek with the lip of his pipe its a teaser doc well have to think out some other scheme he looked at his watch i must go and tell the bosn to take the covers off number three if i think of anything ill let you know meantime ill keep a sharp watch on father myself thanks ill try and work something out see you for a peg before supper i passed the rest of the day sorting ingenious schemes for diagnosis in my mind nothing seemed workable i thought of confessing frankly to the port doctor in teneriffe that we had a madman loose on board and asking him to send for a couple of assistants and a straitjacket but i felt that the port doctor who was used to ships captains might find captain hogg not in the least abnormal i wished sincerely that he would foam at the mouth or do something equally spectacular when we got in when easter brought my tea i admitted my difficulties to him i think the captain is insane i told him ho yes he said hes as mad as a fiddlers bitch youve noticed it too have you dr flowerday always reckoned he was did he do anything about it used to slip the cook half a dollar to lace his tea with a mickey when he was real bad i hadnt thought of that it might do in an emergency wasnt much cop as it happened he chucked the tea at the steward usually we must think of some way easter to settle this once and for all i said firmly i am prepared to give you ten boba quidif you can think of some legal means of getting the captain off this ship at the first possible moment easter scratched his head very kind of you doctor im sure cant think of anything offhand like well try man try if i cant think of i was cut short by a crash outside my cabin a loud scream confused shouting the clatter of running feet what the hells happened now i exclaimed my door flew open hornbeam was outside he was grinning like a toothpaste advertisement quick doc he said fathers fallen twenty feet down number three hatch i ran on to the deck there was a crowd round the edge of the hatch hurriedly letting down a ropeladder i pushed my way through and climbed over the coaming in a few seconds i found captain hogg had solved all our problems for us by fracturing his right femur in three places easter and i strung up captain hogg in splints on his bunk he was a heavy man and still not a remarkably cooperative patient it took us a couple of hours and we were sweating when we had finished ill have that bosn logged he muttered as we arranged the pillows under his head leaving the covers loose like thatill have the mate logged too now keep quiet i commanded i forbid you to talk or move i will talk as much as i damn well like i give the orders now im the doctor well im the captain easter i said just tighten up that splint a bit more will you ouch said captain hogg now i continued if you will just stay quiet for a moment i can complete my examination if you dont i shall have to consider putting you on a milk diet tinned milk naturally i pulled out my torch and shone it in his eyes ah yes i said in my most menacing professional tone as i thought just take this down easter pupils do not react to lightloss of sensation to pinprick over the noseabdominal reflexes absenta classical picture we will have to put you ashore tomorrow in the canaries of course you will not i am not leaving my own ship for you or anybody damn it man use your sense this leg has to be set properly i cant do it here it needs xrays and so forth you will have to go into hospital with it i hear they have some excellent surgeons in teneriffe i will not go doctor if we cable the company and they say so youll have to go there is no reason why you should cable them i am still fit to keep my command its a bit late to think of that now the message has already gone gone he jerked his head from the pillow no messages are allowed to leave the ship without my permission really you are a most difficult patient i said gently i will leave easter to read to you you will find plenty of literature in the corner easter what these here easter asked picking up one of the captains library cor looks like a bit of all right eh he settled himself comfortably by the sickbed right sir he began i will start with i was a white slave true confessions of a french girl kidnapped from a convent and sent to the infamous kasbah of algiers cor he added to the captain i know algiers all right funny thing happened to me last time i was there id gone ashore with the cook see and we was looking for a bit of fun as you might say i left them feeling i had inflicted on captain hogg sufficient misfortune for the evening hornbeam was sitting in his cabin writing up the logbook hello doc he said cheerfully hows the patient god rot his soul as well as can be expected im afraid im just putting it in the log youll have to sign down here when will we get to teneriffe i asked about midday we should be tied up alongside by one weve got to put father ashore you know i cant treat a fracture properly at sea the trouble is he wont shift he says he wont go without instructions from the company hornbeam tossed a cable across to me sparky just brought that down he said take a look at it i unfolded the paper it was from the fathom line head office to chief officer ss lotus it said place captain ashore teneriffe if doctor so advises and bring vessel home under your command stop prepare take command immediately on arrival uk ss primrose owing resignation captain barsett well doc he said smiling do you advise do i advise yes sir yes indeed i grabbed his hand yes captain hornbeam chapter nineteen the next day we arrived off the rocky volcanic canaries sailed under the lee of the islands and shortly after noon slipped into the tidy clean harbour of teneriffe archer and trail took the bow and stern tugs flying smoky redandyellow spanish flags turned us round to face the sea and we tied to the jetty between a smart blue star boat outward bound for rio and a disconnectedlooking craft flying the flag of panama which had cows on the deck at first captain hogg refused to be moved we showed him the cablegram but he accused us of forgery so i filled him up with morphine and sent him to sleep he was carried out on the shoulders of the sailors like nelsons bier arranged in a derrick sling and unloaded by the steam winches between two bales of cowhide youll find the full history in the letter i said handing the case report to the smiling handsome spanish doctor with the ambulance the british consuls fixed everything else up the doctor shook hands the ambulance doors swung shut and captain vincent hogg drove out of my life get rid of him all right easter asked as i reached the top of the gangway it seems so i dont think hell have much chance to throw his weight about in a spanish hospital especially after that letter i sent with him wouldnt mind going ashore here for a spell myself easter said meditatively ive had some fun here i have i remember when i was on the south africa run the barber and me went all right easter later will do they got some lovely girls here easter continued prettiest in the world i reckon look at that one down there see they got the same as our girls at home but they carry it around better he pointed to a slim dark girl stepping along the quay with a grace that is unhappily forgotten on cold english parks and pavements ho they got some smashing bits here easter said enthusiastically mind you youve got to be careful do you want a tablecloth a tablecloth what should i want a tablecloth for this is the place to buy them he pointed over the side where the wide pipes ran towards the ship in a pool of black fuel oil an informal market had been set up on the quay offering thick brocaded tablecloths scarves with vivid bullfights on them canaries in cages metal ornaments and dolls four feet high them dolls is all right easter advised me i used to buy a lot of them at one time im pleased to hear you think of the children easter ho crikey no i used to buy em here and flog em in pernambuco good business that was canaries too make a good few bob on canaries you could unless the little bastards went and died on you or you got gyped some of ems sparrows fed on quinine well i ought to buy a few presents i suppose but i havent got much in the way of money they takes all kinds of junk here old clothesa pair o boots worn out if youve got em fags mostly get anything for a few hundred woods i exchanged five hundred ships woodbines for two scarves a small bracelet and a decorated picture of general franco i supposed i had better make a return with some of the assets of a seafarer we stayed eight hours in teneriffe then we set off under hornbeams command our next stop england the removal of captain hogg from the ship had the effect of dissolving a chronic state of anxiety all hands walked about cheerfully did their work amiably and set to it with twice the effort got to have her looking nice for home now the bosn said looking critically at the gang he had set painting the upper works we cant let mr hornbeam down can we hornbeam slipped easily into his new rank he took over the captains cabin and his seat at table our mealtimes now were lively with conversation with the result that everyone ate more contentedly and the cases of dyspepsia among the officers dropped sharply even archer began reluctantly to feel better and admitted he hadnt taken any stomach powder for a week our only excitement was a message to hornbeam changing our destination from liverpool to london because of a threatening dock strike the order caused disapproval among the liverpudlians in the crew but this was charmed away quickly by easters account of the fun he had had at various times in london smashing place london he claimed you wait till you see west ham the sea became rougher the weather became colder spray came once again over the lotuss bows the broken water took on the greengrey tint of european coasts and the ship began to groan and stagger in the january waves but now i was unaffected by the sea and stood on deck innocuously watching the focsle head rise and dip with the swell and the tops of the masts trace wide irregular circles against the sky all round us were signs that we were coming nearer to our own country boxes and cartons were lying in everyones cabins the ships time became synonymous with that of greenwich three pounds channel money was advanced to all hands the light programme assailed us undiminished and the weather remained persistently foul one evening easter put his head round my door and said cheerfully want to see the ushant light doctor just coming up on the starboard bow together we stood in the shelter of the storm door leading on to the deck i followed his finger towards the flashes well theres old europe again easter said aint a bad old continent all things considered we turns the corner here the next marks the casquettes then for beachy blimey ive seen folks in tears looking at that there light when theyve been gone for a long time that is yes i expect everyone will start being excited from now on ho theyll have the channels tomorrow you mark my word the channels ah theres a complaint what even you dont know doctor all hands goes a bit balmy like you wait till tomorrow easter was right the channels is a clinical entity that has not found its way into the medical textbooks but is as noticeable as scarlet fever the next morning the crew were prancing round the decks like highlystrung lambs in springtime everyone had a bright word for their mates a salute for the captain and even a few sirs left over for me work was done with a lighthearted air that drew scowls of disapproval from the bosn who had been up the channel so many times that he had developed an immunity to the complaint easter repeated his most successful card tricks and thought it a great joke to tell me falsely the hospital was three feet in water i forgave him readily for i too was walking the deck murmuring to myself every turn of the screw brings me nearer to you to whom i wondered it didnt matter i could settle that when we arrived beachy headwhite shining in a brief ray of sunshine turned on like an effective spotlight on a darkened stage i looked at it with mixed feelings of affection and disapproval that the voyagers first sight of england should be eastbourne we came closer to the land making for the pilot boat off dungeness the atlantic rollers had flattened themselves in the narrow waters but the sea was high enough to throw the pilots launch about unenviably he came round to the lee side and had two shots at grasping the jacobs ladder trail and the bosn dangled from the foredeck the third time he caught a rung as the launch dropped away from his feet he climbed aboard his black oilskins running with water shook himself like a dog gave me a cheerful nice morning and climbed up to the bridge the red and white pilots flag broke over the wheelhouse and the lotus proceeded under the arrangement invariably stated in the logbook as masters orders pilots advice the channel was busy that day we passed or were passed by a representation of lloyds list there were tankers making for thameshaven so low in the water they disappeared to the bridge between the waves rickety tramps setting out fearlessly for voyages longer than ours little coasters bound for a rough passage round lands end sodden fishing boats cargo ships of all sizes and states of repair british norwegian swedish and dutch one of the ubiquitous city boats with a black and salmon funnel homeward bound fully loaded from the australian wool sales even a couple of warships they were a pair of corvettes steaming jauntily down channel in line astern the meeting led to a burst of activity at the foot of the mainmast as the deckboy afforded the kings vessels their salute by dipping our ensign the correct form was for us to dip watch for the white ensign fluttering down in reply and follow its return to the masthead unfortunately the wind caught our rainsoaked flag and twisted it in the rigging so that we passed the fleet apparently in mourning but the intention was there and the navy would be the first to understand a big white p amp o passed us outward bound for india and australia and the sunshine that appeared to me to have vanished for ever be away for the best part of four months that lot easter remarked all be taking their last look at old england as long as that they gets them dock strikes something horrid out aussie way its a lovely life being a wharfie in sydney or melbourneyou draws your money and puts your feet up most of the day like being a lord orif i may be so boldships doctor yes i suppose youre right i admitted sadly except the dockers get paid more i suppose theyre all pretty excited on boardfirst night at sea and so on ho yes ive seen it often enough on the big passenger boats all the blokes giving the girls the onceover in the dining saloon cor ive seen them sweet little things with their eyes still wet with tears from saying goodbye to their husbands and sweethearts carrying on something shocking hardly out of the river we wasnt neither the red lamps were shining on the tops of the high radar masts when we crept close to dover inside the goodwins the lights of ramsgate and margate passed off our port side then we cut across to the nore where we were to anchor and await the tide someone gave me the morning paper that the pilot had brought aboard i opened it and read the front page with the careless baffled interest of a holidaymaker inspecting the social column in the village weekly we had been more or less newsless for three months but the happenings that used to shake my breakfast table no longer aroused my concern a paragraph near the foot of the page caught my eye it was headed mayor rebukes dancers and went on the mayor of alderman yesterday refused an application for an extension to midnight at a cycling club dance he said he was highly disturbed at complaints of immoral behaviour that had followed the dance last year the place for young men and women at midnight he told the secretary is in their own homes asleep i knew i was back in england chapter twenty the next morning we steamed into the thames the country raised a faint glow of sunshine to welcome us but the effort was too taxing and the atmosphere soon relapsed into its habitual rain we passed the long finger of southend pier which appears a far more dignified structure when seen in reverse signalled our name and passed down the channel towards tilbury the wet orderly fields of england on the narrowing banks with a demure english train jogging through them towards london had the appearance of a winters garden after the turbulent unfenced vegetation of the south american coast off tilbury landingstage we anchored for the port of london doctor to board us he was a large friendly man in a naval battledress and a dufflecoat have a good voyage old man he asked running his fingers down the pages of my logbook pretty good thanks going again oh no i dont think so anyway back to the nhs eh thats it if i can remember any of my medicine he laughed you can still sign your name cant you all right free pratique granted we continued down the river and i was seized with a spasm of nostalgia by catching sight of an lptb bus in gallions reach the tugs set about us and turned us towards the locks of the royal albert dock is that all the room weve got i asked easter as we headed for the narrow entrance as i always had difficulty parking a car in a busy street i filled with admiration for the mates and tugmasters every time the lotus came into port theres bags of room easter said they gets them big new zealand boats through here easy enough look at all them bright lads weve got to help us i saw a chilly knot of longshoremen waiting to receive our ropes as we came into the lock sad damp englishmen their coat collars up to their sodden caps that one theres been on the job for years easter said we calls him knuckle arry he pointed to a depressedlooking man with a long moustache standing still and holding a rope fender over the end of the jetty thats an odd name whats his knuckles got to do with it the knuckles what hes standing on now you wait as the lotus drew near the stonework the pilot shouted from the bridge keep her off the knuckle arry the man touched his cap and solemnly manipulated his fender to save our paint he then resumed his immobility in the thick rain we passed the knuckle the locks the entrance to the dock the tugs dragged us slowly down to our waiting berth more men in caps and old overcoats secured our ropes to the quay the ensign came down from the gaff and was rehoisted in compliance with custom on the stern jackstaff lower away gangway hornbeam shouted from the bridge the lotus leant contentedly against the dock and after three months all but five days we were home there was a wonderful endofterm spirit abroad everyone was packing up and behaving with the recklessness of men for whom there are no longer any consequences we were payingoff the morning after our arrival mr cozens and his colleagues came aboard and treated us with cordial superiority and we looked on them with goodhumoured contempt cozens himself questioned me closely about the exit of captain hogg very good doctor he said i think you did entirely the correct thing our sunflower is due at teneriffe in three weeks time and she will bring him home we have your successor for next tripa dr gallyman do you know him im sorry i dont cozens sighed im afraid he is a little on the old side he said retired from practice some years ago i believe there was some trouble with the medical authorities toostill we must hope for the best its so difficult getting doctors for these ships just now apart from the office staff the ship filled with taxidrivers luggage carters laundrymen dry cleaners marine tailors and haircutters all of them pressing their services on the ships company before it dispersed i shut the door of my cabin looked despairingly at the empty cases and my curiously augmented possessions and wondered how i was going to pack i started with the volumes of war and peace i hadnt got beyond the first page but i had killed one hundred and thirtytwo cockroaches with them i was hesitantly fitting them into a case when easter came in letter for you doctor it was only the second one i had received since leaving liverpool it too was from the laundry dear sir it said further to ours of november th i have to inform you that your laundry has been sold to defray expenses of the wash the sum received was s d which is s d less than your account we would appreciate your settling this deficit at your earliest convenience sadly i put the letter into my pocket getting the loot packed doctor easter asked i only wish i could the customs is pretty hot down here he went on not like some ports i could mention get away with murder you used to so long as you bought your tickets for the police ball what police ball i remember once the old arm of the law putting his head round our cabin door and saying im sure as you gentlemen would like to come to the police ball well i knew the ropes see so i says not arf we wouldnt weve been thinking about it all voyage so he hands over tickets at a dollar a timebut you mustnt take em like i looks at mine and says ho constable i regrets but what i have a previous engagement so he collects all the tickets back and flogs em again in the next cabin mind you he keeps the five bob well i hardly think it worth while my making the investment apart from the junk i got at teneriffe ive only some corned beef and a pair of nylons thats the ticket doctor girls round our way will do anything for a tin of corned beef show em the nylons as well and cor theyre all over you i assure you these are destined for middleaged relatives used to do pretty well out of nylons during the war some of the blokes on the western ocean made a fortune flogging em in southampton the places they thinks of to hide em down the chain locker in the focsles usual one of the lads put a dummy pipe across the deckhead and filled it with nylons and fags lovely job he made of it painted it up just like it was real but the customs boys copped him oh theyre very fly they are ill get you an empty beercase from the chief steward thank you easter i sat wearily among the disheartening jumble well this was the end of the trip what had i got from it some corned beef some nylons a cure for headaches two stones in weight and a deep sunburn but much more than that surely i had found for the first time that the world isnt divided simply into two classesdoctors and patients three months at sea had taught me more than six years in a medical school i had learned to give and take toleration to grapple with grotesque predicaments to appreciate there is some goodness behind everybody that life isnt really so serious and that doctors arent such bloody important people after all the customs manyoung and keencame in and rummaged my cabin he did so like an oldfashioned physician searching for a diagnosis with an irritating air of professional detachment where did you get these from he asked holding up my best pair of pyjamas swan and edgars timm have you any spirits bottle of whisky opened certainly umm have you a watch no what not one at all i lost it one night in ba he looked at me narrowly watch your step doctor he said leaving me alone i managed to throw my packing together before payingoff started in the saloon it was more a ceremony than a business transaction we were theoretically not entitled to any pay until the end of the voyage though we could draw foreign currency at the pleasure of the captain our wages were set out in a long narrow sheet with additions for leave and sundays at sea and deductions for advances channel money bar bill stores account and anything else the chief steward thought he could add without protest the pay was distributed by the fathom line officials under the eye of the shipping master they sat at the big table behind exciting piles of fivepound notes looking like the tote about to pay off on the favourite also on the table were the ships articles and a pile of discharge booksthe sailors personal recordsigned by the captain with a comment on conduct like a school report the crew lined up eagerly all in their best clothes i had difficulty in placing the clean modestlooking men in the smart blue and grey suits as the halfnaked roughs who strode round the decks with paint pots in the tropics the carpenter was particularly baffling he wore a dark herringbone tweed a hard white twoinch collar and an artificial rosebud in his buttonhole giving the appearance of a moderately liberalminded clergyman on holiday at sandown nothing gives such a pleasant feeling of false prosperity as payingoff a ship by the time my wages had been reduced by deductions i had less than a months salary in general practice but i stuffed the notes into my pocket and felt like lord nuffield then i signed off the book of ships articles opposite the space where i had signed on them three months ago my contract with the commander of the lotus was broken i was quit of my obligations to him to obey his lawful commands to work the ship in emergency to abstain from bringing my own liquor on board and to check myself from using foul language in his presence for his part he had no longer to trouble about feeding me at the required standards avoiding carrying me into arctic or antarctic latitudes and returning me to my own country within a period of eighteen months i was freeout of work but free i said goodbye to as many of the crew as i could find sailors farewells are brief and shallow for they make up half their lives easter shook hands heartily and impressed on me solemnly the importance of speed whenever i should come to do the threecard trick almost everyone left the shipto go on leave to quit her for good or to be in canning town by the time the pubs opened the rain prevented cargo being worked and the lotus was not only empty of people but silent as miserable as a school when the children have gone home my taxi was coming later so i went up to the deck to look round the docks the sheds and the cranes did something odd to the lotuss proportions at sea when she was alone and stood unhindered from the water she achieved a touch of dignity now that she lay in relation to other pieces of wood and steel she shrank and became ridiculous the long boatdeck i used to walk was hardly the size of four railway waggons and the enchanted spot where i sunbathed and watched the flying fish in the afternoon was nothing but a sooty piece of wet planking standing in the rain i saw clearly but with regret that the land is ever master of the sea i saw hornbeam in his blue raincoat striding alone up and down the few feet of shelter below the bridge hello doc he said as i went up to him you off now in a few minutes im only waiting for my taxi oh well im sorry to see you go we havent had a bad voyage on the whole weve made a bit of fun for ourselves we certainly have we walked for a minute or two in silence what are you going to do now doc he asked ive no idea find a practice somewhere i suppose do you reckon youll go back to sea again some day i will im making sure of that you might at that how about you i said going on leave no leave for me doc im off to liverpool tonight to join the primrose shes sailing tomorrow for new zealand of course i was forgetting you know to me our arrival is the end of an isolated adventure but i suppose to you and everyone else its just another stop in port thats it doc always on the move its a mugs life isnt it still someones got to do it my taxi came then i waved to him from the dock and watched him as i drove away he was walking up and down the deck again in the rain an incongruous and lonely figure the first person i went to see in london was the psychiatrist hello he said when are you going away
