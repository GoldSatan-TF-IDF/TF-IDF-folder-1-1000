mean streets jim butcher simon r green kat richardson and thomas e sniegoski the warrior by jim butcher i sat down next to michael and said i think youre in danger michael carpenter was a large brawny man though he was leaner now than in all the time id known him months in bed and more months in therapy had left him a shadow of himself and he had never added all the muscle back on even so he looked larger and more fit than most his saltandpepper hair and short beard going heavier on the salt these days he smiled at me that hadnt changed if anything the smile had gotten deeper and more steady danger he said heavens i leaned back on the old wooden bleachers at the park and scowled at him im serious michael paused to shout a word of encouragement at the second baseman or was that baseperson on his daughter alicias softball team he settled back onto the bleachers they were covered in old peeling green paint and it clashed with his powderblueandwhite shirt which matched the uniform tshirts of the girls below it said coach in big blue letters i brought your sword its in the car harry he said unruffled im retired you know that sure i said reaching into my coat i know that but the bad guys apparently dont i drew out an envelope and passed it to him michael opened it and studied its contents then he replaced them put the envelope back on the bench beside me and rose he started down onto the field leaning heavily on the wooden cane that went everywhere with him now nerve damage had left one of his legs pretty near perfectly rigid and his hip had been damaged as well it gave him a rolling gait i knew he couldnt see out of one of his clear honest eyes very well anymore either he took charge of the practice in the quiet confident way he did everything drawing smiles and laughter from his daughter and her teammates they were obviously having fun it looked good on him i looked down at the envelope and wished i couldnt imagine the photos contained inside it quite so clearly they were all professional clearmichael walking up the handicap access ramp to his church michael opening a door for his wife charity michael loading a big bucket of softballs into the back of the carpenter family van michael at work wearing a yellow hard hat pointing up at a halffinished building as he spoke to a man beside him the pictures had come in the mail to my office with no note and no explanation but their implications were ugly and clear my friend the former knight of the cross was in danger it took half an hour for the softball practice to end and then michael rolled back over to me he stood staring up at me for a moment before he said the sword has passed out of my hands i cant take it up againespecially not for the wrong reason i wont live in fear harry could you maybe settle for living in caution i asked at least until i know more about whats going on i dont think his plan is for me to die now he replied calmly it was never hard to tell when michael was talking about the almighty he could insert capital letters into spoken words im not sure how what happened to no man knows the day or the hour i asked he gave me a wry smile youre taking that out of context i shrugged michael id like to believe in a loving just god who looks out for everyone but i see a lot of people get hurt who dont seem to deserve it i dont want you to become one of them im not afraid harry i grimaced id figured he might react like this and id come prepared to play dirty what about your kids man what about charity if someone comes for you they arent going to be particular about what happens to the people around you id seen him display less expression while being shot his face turned pale and he looked away from me what do you have in mind he asked after a moment im going to lurk and hover i told him maybe catch our photographer before things go any further whether or not i want you to do it he said well yes he shook his head at me and gave me a tight smile thank you harry but no thank you ill manage michaels home was an anomaly so close to the city propera fairly large old colonial house complete with a white picket fence and a yard with trees in it it had a quiet solid sort of beauty it was surrounded by other homes but they never seemed quite as pleasant homey or clean as michaels house i knew he did a lot of work to keep it looking nice maybe it was that simple maybe it was a side effect of being visited by archangels and the like or maybe it was all in the eye of the beholder im pretty sure there wont ever be a place like that for me michael had given a couple of the girlsyoung women i supposea ride home in his white pickup so it had taken us a while to get there and twilight was heavy on the city i wasnt making any particular secret about tailing them but i wasnt riding his back bumper either and i dont think either of them had noticed my beatup old vw michael and alicia got out of the car and went into the house while i drove a slow lap around their block keeping my eyes peeled when i didnt spot any imminent maniacs or anticipatory fiends about to pounce i parked a bit down the street and walked toward michaels place it happened pretty fast a soccer ball went bouncing by me a small person came pelting after it and just as it happened i heard the crunchy hiss of tires on the street somewhere behind me and very near i have long arms and it was a good thing i grabbed the kid who must have been seven or eight about half a second before the oncoming car hit the soccer ball and sent it sailing her feet went flying out ahead of her as i swung her up off the ground and her toes missed hitting the cars fender by maybe six inches the car one of those fancy new hybrids that run on batteries part of the time went by in silence without the sound of the motor to give any warning the driver a young man in a suit was jabbering into a cell phone that he held to his ear with one hand he never noticed as he reached the end of the block he turned on his headlights i turned to find the child a girl with inky black hair and pink skin staring at me with wide dark eyes her mouth open and uncertain she had a bruise on her cheek a couple of days old hi i said trying to be as unthreatening as i could i had limited success tall severelooking men in long black coats who need a shave are challenged that way are you all right she nodded her head slowly am i in trouble i put her down not from me but i heard that moms can get kind of worked up about courtney gasped a womans voice and a woman i presumed to be the childs mother came hurrying from the nearest house like the child she had black hair and very fair skin she had the same wary eyes too she extended her hand to the little girl and then pulled her until courtney stood behind her mother she peeked around at me what do you think youre doing she demandedor tried to it came out as a nervous question who are you just trying to keep your little girl from becoming a victim of the green movement i said she didnt get it her expression changed as she probably wondered something along the lines of is this person a lunatic i get that a lot there was a car maam i clarified she didnt see it coming oh the woman said oh ththankyou sure i frowned at the girl you okay sweetheart i didnt give you that bruise did i no she said i fell off my bike without hurting your hands i noted she stared at me for a second before her eyes widened and she hid behind her mother a little more mom blinked at me and then at the child then she nodded to me took the daughter by the shoulders and frogmarched her toward the house without another word i watched them go and then started back toward michaels place i kicked courtneys soccer ball back into her yard on the way charity answered the door when i knocked she was of an age with michael though her golden hair hid any strands of silver that might have shown fairly well she was tall and broadshouldered for a woman and id seen her crush more than one inhuman skull when one of her children was in danger she looked tireda year of seeing your husband undergoing intensely difficult physical therapy can do that i guess but she also looked happy our personal cold war had entered a state of detente of late and she smiled to see me hello harry surprise lesson i think molly went to bed early not exactly i said smiling thought id just stop by to visit charitys smile didnt exactly vanish but it got cautious really harry screamed a little voice and michaels youngest son of the same name flung himself into the air trusting me to catch him little harry was around courtneys age and generally regarded me as something interesting to climb on i caught him and gave him a noisy kiss on the head which elicited a giggle and a protest of yuck charity shook her head wryly well come in let me get you something to drink harry hes not a jungle gym get down little harry developed spontaneous deafness and scrambled up onto my shoulders as we walked into the living room michael and his darkhaired quietly serious daughter alicia were just coming in from the garage after putting away softball gear papa little harry shouted and promptly plunged forward off my shoulders arms outstretched to michael he leaned forward and caught him though i saw him wince and exhale tightly as he did it my stomach rolled uncomfortably in sympathy alicia charity said her daughter nodded hung her ball cap on a wooden peg by the door and took little harry from michael tossing him up into the air and catching him much to the childs protesting laughter come on squirt time for a bath leech harry shouted and immediately started climbing on his sisters shoulders babbling about something to do with robots michael watched them exit with a smile i asked harry to dinner tonight he told charity kissing her on the cheek did you she said in the exact same tone shed used on me at the door michael looked at her and sighed then he said my office we went into the study michael used as his officemore cluttered than it had been before now that he was actually using it all the timeand closed the door behind us i took out the photos id received without a word and showed them to charity michaels wife was no dummy she looked at them one at time in rapid succession her eyes blazing brighter with every new image when she spoke her voice was cold who took these i dont know yet i told her though nicodemuss name does sort of leap to mind no michael said quietly he cant harm me or my family anymore were protected by what i asked faith he said simply that would be a maddening answer under most circumstancesbut id seen the power of faith in action around my friend and it was every bit as real as the forces i could manage former presidents get a detail of secret service to protect them maybe former knights of the cross had a similar retirement package only with more seraphim oh youre going to get to the bottom of this charity asked thats the idea i said it might mean i intrude on you all a little harry michael said theres no need for that dont be ridiculous charity replied turning to michael she took his hand very gently though her tone of voice stayed firm and dont be proud he smiled at her it isnt a question of pride im not so sure she said quietly father forthill said we were only protected against supernatural dangers if theres something else afoot youve made so many enemies we have to know whats happening i often dont know whats happening michael said if i spent all my time trying to find out there wouldnt be enough left to live in this is more than likely being done for the sole purpose of making us worried and miserable michael i said quietly one of the best ways i know to counter fear is with knowledge he tilted his head frowning gently at me you say you wont live in fear fine let me poke around and shine a light on things so we know whats going on if it turns out to be nothing no harm done and if it isnt charity asked i kept a surge of quiet anger out of my voice and expression as i looked at her levelly no harm gets done to you and yours her eyes flashed and she nodded her chin once honey michael sighed charity stared at him michael might have slain a dragon but he knew his limits he lifted a hand in acceptance and said why dont you make up the guest bedroom by a little after nine the carpenter household was almost entirely silent i had been shown into the little guest room kept at the end of an upstairs hallway it was really charitys sewing room and was all but filled with colorful stacks of folded fabric some of them in clear plastic containers some of them loose there was room around a little table with a sewing machine on it and just barely enough space to get to the bed id recuperated from injuries there before one thing was new there was a very fine layer of dust on the sewing machine huh i sat down on the bed and looked around it was a quiet warm cheerful little roomalmost manically so now that i thought about it everything was soft and pleasant and ordered and it took me maybe six or seven whole seconds to realize that this room had been charitys haven how many days and nights must she have been worried about michael off doing literally god only knew what against foes so terrible that no one but him could have been trusted to deal with them how many times had she wondered if it would be a solemn father forthill who came to the door instead of the man she loved how many hours had she spent in this welllit room working on making warm soft things for her family while her husband carried amoracchiuss cold bright steel into the darkness and now there was dust on the sewing machine michael had nearly been killed out there on that island he had been crippled forced by his injuries to lay aside the holy sword along with the nearly invisible deadly war that went with it and he was happier than id ever seen him maybe the almighty worked in mysterious ways after all another thought occurred to me as i sat there pondering whoever had sent those pictures hadnt sent them to michael hed sent them to me what if id put michael and his family into real danger by showing up what if id somehow reacted in exactly the way id been meant to react i grimaced around the cheerful room so much for sleep i got up and padded back downstairs in my sock feet to raid the fridge and while i was in the kitchen munching on an impromptu coldcuts sandwich i saw a shadow move past the back window i had several options but none of them were real appetizing i settled for the one that might accomplish the most i turned and padded as quickly and quietly as i could to the front door slipped out and snuck around the side of the house in the direction that would i hoped bring me up behind the intruder a quick spat of rain had made the grass wet and the night had grown cool enough to make my instantly soaked socks uncomfortable i ignored them and went padding through the grass keeping to the side of the house and watching all around me the backyard was empty i got an itchy feeling on the back of my neck and continued my circle had i given myself away somehow was the intruder even now circling just the way i was hoping to sneak up on me i took longer steps and stayed as quiet as i knew howwhich is pretty darn quiet ive developed my skulking to professional levels over the years and as i rounded the corner i spotted the intruder a dark form hurrying down the sidewalk past courtneys house i couldnt follow him without being spotted pretty quickly unless i cheated which i promptly did my ability to throw up a veil wasnt anything to write home about but it ought to be good enough to hide me from view on a dark night on a heavily shadowed street focused on my surroundings on drawing the light and shadow around me in a cloak and watched my own vision dim and blur somewhat as i did i half wished id woken molly up the kid is a natural at subtle stuff like veils she can make you as invisible as paris hiltons ethical standards and you can still see out of it with no more impediment than a pair of mildly tinted sunglasses but since it was me doing the job i was probably just sort of indistinct and blurry and my view of the street was like something seen through dark thin fabric i kept track of the pale concrete of the sidewalk and the movement of the intruder against the background of shadowy shapes and blurry bits of light and walked softly the intruder crept down the street and then quickly crouched down beside my old volkswagen the blue beetle it took him maybe five seconds to open the lock reach into the car and draw out the long slender shape of a sheathed sword he must have come to the house first and circled it to determine where i was he could have spotted my staff which id left resting against the wall by the front door when he looked into the kitchen window and i was pretty sure it was a him i was dealing with too the movement of his arms and legs was brusque choppy masculine i took a few steps to one side and picked up courtneys soccer ball then i approached to within a few yards and tossed it up in a high arc it came down with a rattling thump on the blue beetles hood lurkyboy twitched twisting his upper body toward the sound and freezing and i hit him in a diving tackle with my body as rigid as a spear all of my weight behind one shoulder trying to drive it right through his spine and out his chest he was completely unprepared for it and went down hard driven to the sidewalk with a whuff of expelled air i grabbed him by the hair so that i could introduce his forehead to the sidewalk but his hair was cut nearly militaryshort and i didnt have a good grip he twisted and got me in the floating rib with an elbow and i wasnt in a good enough position to keep him from getting out from under me and scrambling away the sheathed weapon still in hand i focused my will flicked a hand at him and spat forzare unseen force lashed out at the back of his knees and hit the mystic equivalent of a brick wall there was a burst of twinkling shifting lights and he let out a croaking sound as he kept running something that glowed like a dying ember fell to the sidewalk i pushed myself up to pursue him slipped on the wet grass next to the sidewalk and rolled my ankle painfully by the time id gotten to my feet again he was too far away for me to catch even if my ankle had been steady a second later he hopped a fence and was out of sight i was left there standing beside my car on one foot while neighborhood dogs sent up a racket i gimped forward and looked down at the glowing embers of the thing hed dropped it was an amulet its leather cord snapped in the middle it looked like it had been a carving of wood and ivory but it was scorched almost completely black so i couldnt be certain i picked it up wrinkling my nose at the smell then i turned back to the car and closed the open door after that i untwisted the piece of wire that holds the trunk closed picked up a blanketwrapped bundle and went back to michaels place morning on a school day in the carpenter household is like southampton just before june theres a lot of yelling running around and organizing transport and no one seems to be exactly sure whats going on or maybe that was just me because by a little before eight all the kids were trooping out to their bus stop led by alicia the senior schoolchild so he grabbed the sword and ran molly asked sipping coffee she apparently had a cold and her nose was stuffy and bright pink my apprentice was her mothers daughter tall and blond and too attractive for me ever to be entirely comfortableeven wrapped up in a pink fluffy robe and flannel pjs with her hair a mess give me some credit i said unwrapping the blanketwrapped bundle and producing amoracchius he thought he took the sword michael frowned at me as he put margarine on his toast i thought you told me that the sword was best hidden in plain sight ive been getting paranoid in my age i replied munching on a bit of sausage i blinked at the odd taste and looked at him turkey michael said mildly its better for me its better for everyone charity said firmly including you harry gee i said thanks she gave me an arch look cant you just use the amulet to track him down nope i said putting some salt on the turkey sausage tell her why not grasshopper molly spoke through a yawn it caught on fire fires a purifying force wiped out whatever energy was on the amulet that might link back to the owner she blinked watery eyes besides we dont need it michael frowned at her he took the decoy i said smiling and i know how to find that unless hes gotten rid of it or taken steps to make it untraceable michael said in a patient reasonable tone after all he was evidently prepared with some sort of defensive measure against your abilities different situation entirely i said tracking someone by using one of their personal possessions depends upon following a frequency of energy that is inherently unstable and transient i actually have a piece of the decoy sword and the link between those two objects is much more concrete itd take one heuh heck of a serious countermeasure to stop me from finding it but you didnt trail him last night charity asked i shook my head i didnt know where id have been going i wasnt prepared and since apparently someone is interested in the swords i didnt want to go off and leave you the sword unprotected here i finished what about the other one michael asked quietly fidelacchius brothersword to michaels former blade currently rested in a cluttered basket in my basementnext to the heavy locked gun safe that was warded with a dozen dangerous defensive spells hopefully anyone looking to take it would open the safe first and get a face full of boom my lab was behind a screen of defensive magic which was in turn behind an outer shell of defensive magic that protected my apartment plus there was my dog mouse two hundred pounds of fur and muscle who didnt take kindly to hostile visitors its safe i told him after breakfast ill track buzzcut guy down have a little chat with him and well put this whole thing to bed sounds simple michael said it could happen michael smiled his eyes twinkling buzz as it turned out wasnt a dummy hed ditched the decoy sword in a dumpster behind a fastfood joint less than four blocks from michaels place michael sat behind the wheel of his truck watching as i stood hipdeep in trash and dug for the sword you sure you dont want to do this part i asked him sourly i would harry he replied smiling but my leg you know the bitch of it was he was being sincere michael had never been afraid of work why dump it here do you think i gestured at a nearby streetlight dark last night no moon this is probably the first place he got a good look at it parked his car here too maybe i found the handle of the cheap replica broadsword id picked up at what had amounted to a martial arts trinkets shop aha i said and pulled it out there was another manila envelope ducttaped to the blade i took the sword and the envelope back to the truck michael wrinkled up his nose at the smell coming up from my garbagespattered jeans but that expression faded when he looked at the envelope taped to the sword he exhaled slowly well he said no use just staring at it i nodded and peeled the envelope from around the blade i opened it and looked in there were two more photos the first was of michael in the uniform shirt he wore when he coached his daughters softball team he was leaning back on the bleachers as he had been when id first walked up to speak to him the second picture was of a weapona longbarreled rifle with a massive steel snout on the end of it and what looked like a telescope for a sight it lay on what looked like a bed with cheap motel sheets hells bells i muttered what is that michael glanced at the picture its a barrett he said quietly fiftycaliber semiautomatic rifle snipers in the middle east who use them are claiming kills at two kilometers sometimes more its one of the deadliest longrange weapons in the world he looked up and around him at all the buildings overkill for chicago really he said with mild disapproval you know what im thinking i said im thinking we shouldnt be sitting here in your truck right next to a spot buzz expected us to go while he and his superrifle are out there somewhere michael looked unperturbed if he wanted to simply kill me here hes had plenty of time to make the shot humor me i said he smiled and then nodded i can take you to your place you can get some clean clothes perhaps that hurts man i said brushing uselessly at my jeans as the truck moved out you know what bugs me about this situation michael glanced aside at me for a second i think i do but it might be different than what you were thinking i ignored him why i mean sure we need to know who this guy is but why is he doing this its a good question he sends the pictures to me not you i said i held up the new photo of the sniper rifle i mean this is obviously an escalation but if what he wanted was to kill you why why document it for me it looks to me michael said as if he wants you to be afraid so he threatens you i demanded thats stupid he smiled do people threaten you very often sure all the time what happens when they do he asked i shrugged i say something mouthy i said then i clean their clocks for them at the first opportunity which is probably why our photographer here call him buzz i said it will make things simpler why buzz hasnt bothered threatening you i frowned so youre saying buzz knows me it stands to reason it seems clear that hes trying to push you into some sort of reaction something he thinks youll do if youre frightened like what i asked what do you think he replied i put my hand on the hilt of amoracchius the swords tip rested on the floorboards of the truck between my feet that would be my guess too he said i frowned down at the blade and nodded maybe buzz figured id bring you the sword if you were in danger so that i didnt finish so that id have some way of defending myself michael said gently you can say it harry you wont hurt my feelings i nodded at the true sword sure you dont want it michael shook his head i told you harry that part of my life is over and what if buzz makes good i asked quietly what if he kills you michael actually laughed i dont think thats going to happen he said but if it does he shrugged death isnt exactly a terrifying proposition for me harry if it was i could hardly have borne the sword for as long as i did i know what awaits me and i know that my family will be taken care of i rolled my eyes yeah im sure everything will be fine if your younger kids have to grow up without a father in their lives he winced and then pursed his lips thoughtfully for a few moments before he replied other children have he said finally and thats it i asked incredulous you just surrender to whatever is going to happen it isnt what id wantbut a lot of things happen that i dont want im just a man the last thing i would expect from you i said is fatalism not fatalism he said his voice suddenly and unexpectedly firm faith harry faith this is happening for a reason i didnt answer him from where i was standing it looked like it was happening because someone ruthless and fairly intelligent wanted to get his hands on one of the swords and worse it looked like he was probably a mortal too if what charity had said was accurate that meant that michael didnt have a heavenly insurance policy against the threat it also meant that i would have to pull my punchesthe first law of magic prohibited using it to kill a human being there was some grey area involved with it but not much and it was the sort of thing that one didnt play around with the white council enforced the laws and anyone who broke them faced the very real possibility of a death sentence and thats all i need i muttered what nothing michael pulled the truck into the gravel parking lot of my apartment in the basement of a big old boardinghouse i need to drop by a site before we go back to get your car is that all right i took the sword with me as i got out of the truck well i said as long as its all happening for a reason michaels small company built houses years of vanishing at irregular intervals to battle the forces of evil had probably held him back from moving up to building the really expensive really profitable places so he built homes for the upper couple of layers of the middle class instead he probably would have made more money if he cut corners but it was michael i was betting that never happened this house was a new property down toward wolf lake and it had the depressing look of all construction sitesnaked earth trees bulldozed and piled to one side and the standard detritus of any such endeavor mud wood garbage discarded by the workers and big old boot tracks all over the ground half a dozen men were at work putting up the houses skeleton shouldnt take me long michael said sure i said go to it michael hopped down from the truck and gimped his way over to the house moving with an energy and purpose id seldom seen from him i frowned after him and then pulled the first envelope out of my pocket and started looking at the photos inside the photo of michael at a building site had been taken at this one buzz had been here watching michael he might still be here now i got out of the car and slung the swords belt over my shoulder so that it hung with its hilt sticking up next to my head photo in hand i started circling the site trying to determine where buzz had been standing when hed taken his picture i got some looks from the men on the jobbut like i said before im used to that kind of thing it only took me a couple of minutes to find the spot buzz had useda shadowed area of weeds and scrub brush behind the pile of felled trees it was obscured enough to offer a good hiding spot if no one was looking particularly hard but far enough away that he had to have used a zoom lens of some kind to get those pictures i had heard that digital cameras could zoom in to truly ridiculous levels these days i found footprints dont read too much into that im not ranger rick or anything but i had a teacher who made sure i spent my share of time hiking and camping in the rugged country of the ozarks and he taught me the basicswhere to look and what to look for the showers last night had wiped away any subtle signs but i wouldnt have trusted my own interpretation of them in any case i did find one clear footprint of a mans left boot fairly deep and half a dozen partials and a few broken branches in a line leading away hed come here hung around for a while then left which just about anyone could have deduced from the photo even if he hadnt seen any tracks i had this guy practically captured already there werent any bubblegum wrappers discarded cigarettes or fortuitously misplaced business cards that would reveal buzzs identity i hadnt really thought there would be but you always look i slogged across the muddy ground back toward the truck when the door of one of the contractors vans opened and a prematurely balding thin guy with a tool belt and a twofoot reel of electricians wire staggered out he had a shirt with a name tag that read chuck chuck wobbled to one side dragging the handles of some tools along the side panel of michaels truck leaving some marks i glanced into the van there was an empty bottle of jim beam inside with a little still dribbling out the mouth hey chuck i said give you a hand with that he gave me a bleary glance that didnt seem to pick up on anything out of the ordinary about me or the big old sword hanging over my shoulder nah i got it its cool i said im going that way anyhow and those things are heavy i went over to him and seized one end of the reel taking some of the weight the electricians breath was practically explosive he nodded a couple of times and shifted his grip on the reel okay buddy thanks we carried the heavy reel of wire over to the house i had to adjust my steps several times to keep up with the occasional drunken lurch from chuck we took the wire to the pouredconcrete slab that was going to be the garage at some point it looked like and dropped it off thanks man chuck said his sibilants all mushy sure i said look uh do you really think you should be working with electricity right now chuck he gave me an indignant drunken glare whats that supposed to mean oh you just uh look a little sick thats all im just fine chuck slurred scowling i got a job to do yeah i said kind of a dangerous job in a big pile of kindling he peered at me what it came out more like wha ive been in some burning buildings man and take it from me this place i looked around at the wooden framework fwoosh im just saying fwoosh he worked on that one for a moment and then his face darkened into a scowl again he turned and picked up a wrench from a nearby toolbox buzz off freak before i get upset i wasnt going to do anyone any favors by getting into half of a drunken brawl with one of michaels subcontractors i looked around to see if anyone had noticed but they were all at other parts of the house i guessed so i just held up one hand in front of me and said mildly okay im going chuck watched me as i walked out of the garage i looked around until i spotted the power lines running into the house and then followed the trench they were buried in back to the street until i got to the transformer i looked up at it glanced around a little guiltily and sighed then i waved my hand at the thing exerted my will and muttered hexus wizards and technology dont get along at all prolonged exposure to an active wizard has really detrimental effects on just about anything manufactured after world war ii or so especially anything involving electricity my car breaks down every couple of weeks and thats when im not even trying when im making an effort the transformer exploded in a humming shower of bluewhite sparks and the sound of an electric saw somewhere on the site died down to nothing i went back to the truck and sat quietly until michael returned he gave me a steady look it was in the name of good i said your electrician was snockered by the time the city gets by to repair it hell have sobered up ah michael said chuck hes having trouble at home how do you know hes got a wife a daughter michael said and i know the look maybe if he spent less time with jim beam i said itd go better the booze is new michael said looking worriedly at the house hes a good man hes in a bad time he glanced back at me a moment later thank you though perhaps next time you could just come tell me about it duh harry that probably would have worked too i shook my head calmly thats not how i roll how you roll michael asked smiling i heard molly say it once so it must be cool how you roll michael shook his head and started the truck well you were trying to help thats the important thing harry dresden saving the world one act of random destruction at a time okay i said to molly as i prepared to get into my car just keep your wits about you i know she said calmly if theres any trouble you call the cops i said this guy looks to be operating purely vanilla but he can still kill you just fine i know harry if you see him do not approach himand dont let your dad do it either molly rolled her eyes in exasperation then she muttered a quick word and vanished gone she was standing within an arms length of me but i couldnt see her at all lets see the bozo shoot this said her disembodied voice and while were at it lets hope he isnt using a heatsensitive scope i said drily she flickered back into sight giving me an arch look the point is that im perfectly capable of keeping a lookout and yelling if theres trouble ill go with dad to softball and youll be the second person i call if theres a whiff of peril i grunted maybe i should go get mouse let him stay with you too maybe you should keep him close to the swords molly said quietly my dads just a retired soldier the swords are icons of power the swords are bits of sharp metal the men who hold them make them a threat in case you hadnt noticed my dad isnt one of those men anymore molly said she tucked a trailing strand of golden hair behind one ear and frowned up at me worriedly are you sure this isnt about you blaming yourself for what happened to my dad i dont blame myself i said my apprentice arched an extremely skeptical eyebrow i looked away from her you wanna talk to me about it no i said i suddenly felt very tired not until im sure the swords are safe if he knew where to send the pictures molly said then he knows where your house is but he cant get inside even if he could get the doors or one of the windows to open the wards would roast him and your wards are perfect molly said theres no way anyone could get around them ever the way you told me those necromancers did a few years ago they didnt go around i said they went through but i see your point if i have to ill take one of the ways to wardens command center at edinburgh and leave the swords in my locker mollys eyes widened wow a locker technically i havent used it ive got the combination written down somewhere on a napkin i think does it hurt to be as suave as you boss its agonizing looks it her smile faded what are you going to do after youre sure the swords are safe she hadnt thought it through she didnt know what was going to happen in the next few minutes so i gave her my best fake grin and said one step at a time grasshopper one step at a time i began pouring my will into my shield bracelet about half a mile from home that kind of active magic wasnt good for the beetle but having a headless driver smash it into a building would be even worse i fastened closed the buttons on my leather duster too the spells that reinforced the coat were fresh and theyd once stood up to the power of a kalashnikov assault riflebut that was a world of difference from the power of a fiftycaliber sniper round buzz had missed his shot at the sword at michaels house its really hard to tail someone without being noticed unless youve got a team of several cars working togetherand this had all the earmarks of a lonegunman operation buzz hadnt been tailing me today and unless hed given up entirelysure rightthat could only mean that he was waiting for me somewhere hed had plenty of time to set up an ambush somewhere he knew id go home the sword was my priority i wasnt planning on suicide or anything but at the end of the day im just one guy the swords had been a thorn in the side of evildoers for two thousand years in the long term the world needed them a lot more than it needed one battered and somewhat shabby professional wizard as i came down the street toward my apartment i stomped on the gas granted in an old vw beetle that isnt nearly as dramatic as it sounds my car didnt roar as much as it coughed more loudly but i picked up speed and hit my driveway as hard as i could while keeping all the wheels on the ground i skidded to a stop outside my front door as the engine rattled pinged and began pouring out black smoke which would have been totally cool if id actually made it happen on purpose i flung myself out of the car the sword in hand and into the haze of smoke my shield bracelet running at maximum power in a dome that covered me on all sides i rushed toward the steps leading down to the front door of my basement apartment as my foot was heading down toward the first step there was a flash of light and a sledgehammer hit me in the back it spun me counterclockwise as it flung me down and i went into a bad tumble down the seven steps to my front door i hit my head my shoulder screamed and the taste of blood filled my mouth my shield bracelet seared my wrist gravity stopped working and i wasnt sure which way i was supposed to be falling get up harry i told myself hes coming hes coming for the sword get up id dropped my keys in the fall i looked for them i saw blood all over the front of my shirt the keys lay on the concrete floor of the stairs i picked them up and stared stupidly at them it took me a minute to remember why i needed them then another minute to puzzle out which of the five keys on the ring went to my front door my head was pounding and i felt sick and i couldnt get a breath i tried to reach up to unlock the door but my left shoulder wouldnt hold my weight and i almost slammed my head against the concrete again i made it up to a knee i shoved my key at the door hes coming hes coming blue sparks flew up and a little shock lit up my arm with pain my wards id forgotten about my wards i tried to focus my will again but i couldnt get it to gel i tried again and again and finally i was able to perform the routine little spell that disarmed them i shoved my key into the lock and turned it then i leaned against the door it didnt open my door is a heavy steel security door i installed it myself and im a terrible carpenter it doesnt quite line up with the frame and it takes a real effort to get it open and closed i had grown used to the routine bump and thrust of my shoulders and hips that i needed to open it upbut like the spell that disarmed my wards that simple task was at the moment beyond me footsteps crunched in the gravel hes coming i couldnt get it open i sort of flopped against it as hard as i could the door groaned and squealed as it swung open pulled from the other side my huge shaggy grey dog mouse dropped his front paws back to the ground shouldered his way through the door and seized my right arm by the biceps his jaws were like a vise though his teeth couldnt penetrate the leather he dragged me indoors like a giant groggy chew toy and as i went across the threshold i saw buzz appear at the top of the stairs a black shadow against the blue morning sky he raised a gun a military sidearm i kicked the door with both legs as hard as i could the gun barked real guns dont sound like the guns in the movies the sound is flatter more mechanical i couldnt see the flash because id moved the door into the way bullets pounded the steel like hailstones on a tin roof mouse slammed his shoulder against the door and rammed it closed i fumbled at the wards babbling in panicked haste and managed to restore them just in time to hear a loud popping sound a cry and a curse from the other side of the door then i reached up and snapped the dead bolt closed for good measure then i fell back onto the floor of my apartment and watched the ceiling spin for a while in two or three minutes maybe i was feeling a little better my head and shoulder hurt like hell but i could breathe i tried my arms and legs and three of them worked i sat up that worked too though it made my left shoulder hurt like more hell and it was hard to see straight through the various pains i knew several techniques for reducing and ignoring pain some of them almost too effectivebut i couldnt really seem to line any of them up and get them working my head hurt too much i needed help i half crawled to my phone and dialed a number i mumbled to the other end of the phone and then lay back on the floor again and felt terrible buzz must have fallen back by now knowing that the sound of the shots could attract attention now that the sword was behind the protection of my wards there was no reason for him to loiter around outside my apartment i hoped the next thing i knew mouse was pawing at the door making anxious sounds i dragged myself over to it disarmed the wards and unlocked it are these shell casings on the ground is this blood sputtered a little man in pale blue hospital scrubs and a black denim jacket he had a shock of black hair like a startled haystack and black wirerimmed spectacles holy hannah harry what happened to you i closed the wards and the door behind him hi butters i fell down weve got to get you to a hospital he said turning to reach for my phone i slapped my hand weakly down onto it to keep him from picking it up cant no hospitals harry you know that im not a doctor yes you are i saw your business card the effort of vocalizing that many syllables hurt im a medical examiner i cut up dead people and tell you things about them i dont do live patients hang around i said its early yet still too many syllables oh this is a load of crap he muttered then he shook his head and said i need some more light matches i mumbled mantel better he found the matches and started lighting candles next ill be getting out a big jar of leeches he found the first aid kit under my kitchen sink boiled some water and came over to check me out i sort of checked out for a few minutes when i came back he was fumbling with a pair of scissors and my duster hey i protested lay off the coat youve dislocated your shoulder he informed me frowning without stopping his work with the scissors you dont want to wriggle it around trying to take your shirt off thats not what i the pin that held the two halves of the scissors together popped as butters exerted more pressure on their handles and the two halves fell apart he blinked at them in shock told you i muttered okay he said i guess we do this the hard way i wont bore you with the details ten minutes later my coat was off my shoulder was back in its socket and butters was pretending that my screams during the two failed attempts to put it back hadnt bothered him i went away again and when i came back butters was pressing a cold coke into my hand here he said drink something stay awake i drank actually i guzzled somewhere in the middle he passed me several ibuprofen tablets and told me to take them i did it i blinked blearily at him as he held up my coat he turned it around to show me the back there was a hole in the leather mantle i flipped it up beneath the hole several ounces of metal were flattened against the second layer of spelltoughened leather about three inches below the collar and a hair to the right of my spine that was chilling even through my best defenses that was how close id come to death if buzz had shot me six inches lower only a single layer of leather would have been between the round and my hide a few inches higher and it would have taken me in the neck with absolutely no protection and if hed waited a quarter of a second longer until my foot had descended to the first step leading down to my door he would have sprayed my brains all over the siding of the boardinghouse you broke your nose again butters said thats where some of the blood came from there was a laceration on your scalp too which accounts for the rest i stitched it up youre holding your neck rigid probably whiplash from where the round hit you there are some minor burns on your left wrist and im just about certain that youve got a concussion but other than that i muttered i feel great dont joke harry butters said you should be under observation already am i said look where it got me he grimaced doctors are required to report gunshot wounds to the police good thing i dont have any gunshot wounds eh i just fell down some stairs butters shook his head again and turned toward the phone give me a reason not to do it or i call murphy right now i grunted then i said im protecting something important someone else wants it if the police get involved this thing would probably get impounded as evidence thats an unacceptable outcome and it could get a lot of people hurt something important butters said something like a magic sword i scowled at him how do you know that he nodded at my hand because you wont let go of it i looked down to find the burnscarred fingers of my left hand clutching amoracchiuss hilt in a whiteknuckled grasp oh i said yeah kind of a tipoff isnt it think you can let it go now butters asked quietly im trying i said my hands kind of locked up okay lets just go one finger at a time then butters peeled my fingers off the sword one at a time until he had removed it from my grasp my hand closed in on itself tendons creaking and winced it sort of hurt but at the moment it was a really minor thing butters set the sword aside and immediately took my left hand in his massaging brusquely murphys going to be pissed if you dont call her murphy and i have disagreed before i said butters grimaced okay can i help you are helping besides this butters said i looked at the little me for a moment butters had been my unofficial doctor for a long time never asking a thing in return hed waded into some serious trouble with me once hed saved my life i trusted his discretion i trusted him generally so as the blood started returning to my hand i told him more or less everything about buzz and the swords so this guy buzz butters said hes just a guy lets dont forget i said despite all the nasties running around out there its just guys who dominate most of the planet yeah but hes just a guy butters said hows that i flexed my fingers wincing a little its good thanks he nodded and stood up he went over to the kitchen and filled my dogs water bowl then did the same for my cat mister my point is he said that if this guy isnt a supermagical something he had to find out about the swords like any other guy well i said yeah butters looked at me over his spectacles so he said who knew that you had the swords plenty knew i had shiros sword i said but this guy tried to get to me through michael and the only ones who knew about amoracchius were me a couple of archangels michael sanya and butters tilted his head looking at me waiting and the church i growled st mary of the angels is just about as big and impressive as churches get in a city known for its architecture st marys more than holds its own it takes up most of a city block its massive stone and as gothic as black frosting on a birthday cake id watched my back all the way there and was sure no one was following me i parked behind the church and marched up to the delivery door twenty seconds of pounding brought a tall rather befuddledlooking old priest to the door yes he asked im here to see father forthill i said excuse me he said s okay padre i told him clapping his shoulder and moving him aside less than gently ill find him now see here young man he might have said something else but i didnt pay much attention i walked past him into the halls of the church and headed for forthills room i rapped twice on the door opened it and walked in on a priest in his underwear father forthill was a stocky man of medium height with a fringe of white hair around his head and his eyes were the color of robins eggs he wore boxers a tank top and black socks a towel hung around his neck and what hair he had left was wet and stuck to his head a lot of people would have reacted to my entrance with outrage forthill considered me gravely and said ah hello harry i had come in with phasers set on snark but even though im not particularly religious i do have some sense of what is and isnt appropriate seeing a priest in his undies just isnt especially when youve barged into his private chamber uh i said deflating oh forthill shook his head smiling yes priests bathe we eat we sleep occasionally we even have to go to the bathroom yeah i said urn yeah i do rather need to get dressed he said gently im giving mass tonight mass forthill actually let out a short belly laugh harry you didnt think that i just sit around in this old barn waiting my chance to make you sandwiches bandage wounds and offer advice he nodded to where a set of vestments was hung up on the wall on weeknights they let the junior varsity have the ball weve got to talk i said its about the swords he nodded and gave me a quick smile perhaps ill put some pants on first yeah i said sorry i backed out of the room and shut the door the other priest showed up and gave me a gimlet eye a minute later but forthill arrived in time to rescue me dressed in his usual black attire with a white collar its all right paulo he told the other priest ill talk to him father paulo harrumphed and gave me another glare but he turned and left you look terrible forthill said what happened i gave it to him unvarnished merciful god he said when id finished but it wasnt in an oh no tone of voice it was a slower wearier inflection he knew what was going on i cant protect the swords if i dont know what im dealing with i said talk to me anthony forthill shook his head i cant dont give me that i said with quiet heat i need to know im sworn not to speak of it to anyone for any reason he faced me jaw outthrust i keep my promises so youre just going to stand there i snapped and do nothing i didnt say that forthill replied ill do what i can oh sure i said i will he said you have my word youre going to have to trust me that might come easier if youd explain yourself his eyes narrowed son im not a fool dont tell me that youve never been behind this particular eight ball before i looked for something appropriately sarcastic and edgy to say in response but all i came up with was touché he ran a hand over his mostly bald scalp and i suddenly saw how much older forthill looked than he had when i met him his hair was even more sparse and brittlelooking his hands more weathered with time im sorry harry he said and he sounded sincere if i could is there anything else i could do for you you can hurry i said quietly at the rate were going someone is going to get killed at the rate wed been going probably me i approached the park with intense caution it took me more than half an hour to be reasonably sure that buzz wasnt there somewhere lurking with another fiftycaliber salutation for me of course he could have been watching from the window of one of the nearby buildingsbut none of them were hotels or apartments and none of the pictures taken in the park had been shot from elevation besides if i avoided every place where a maniac with a highpowered rifle might possibly shoot me id live the rest of my life hiding under my bed still no harm in exercising caution rather than walking across the open ground of the park to the softball field i took the circuitous route around the outside of the parkand heard quiet little sobs coming from the shade beneath the bleachers opposite the ones where id sat with michael i slowed my steps as i approached and peered under the bleachers a girl in shorts sneakers and a powderblue team jersey was huddled up with her arms wrapped around her knees crying quietly she had stringy red hair and was skinny even for someone her age it took me a minute to recognize her as alicias teammate the second basemperson hey there i said quietly trying to keep my voice gentle you all right the girl looked up her eyes wide and immediately began wiping at her eyes and nose oh oh yes im fine im just fine sir right right next youll tell me youve got allergies i said she looked up at me with a shaky little smile huffed out a breath in the ghost of a laughand it transformed into another sob on her her face twisted up into an agonized grimace she shuddered and wept harder bowing her head i can be such a sucker i ducked down under the bleachers and sat down beside her a couple of feet away the girl cried for a couple more minutes until it began quieting down i know you she said a minute later between sniffles you were talking to coach carpenter yesterday aalicia said you were a friend of the family id like to think so i agreed im harry kelly she said i nodded shouldnt you be practicing with the team kelly she shrugged her skinny shoulders it doesnt help help im hopeless she said whatever it is im doing i just screw it up well thats not true i said with assurance nobody can be bad at everything theres no such thing as a perfect screwup i am she said weve only lost two games all year and both of them were because i screwed up we go to the finals next week and everyones counting on me and im just going to let them down hells bells what a ridiculously tiny problem but it was obvious that it was real to kelly and that it meant the world to her she was just a kid it probably looked like a much larger issue from where she was standing pressure i said yeah i get that she peered at me do you sure i said you feel like peoples lives depend on you and that if you do the wrong thing theyre going to be horribly hurt and it will be your fault yes she said sniffling and ive been trying so hard but i just cant be perfect i asked no of course not but what choice do you have she looked at me uncertainly anything you do you risk screwing up you could do a bad job of crossing the street one day and get hit by a car i probably could she said darkly i held up my hand my point i told her is that if you want to play it safe you can stay at home and wrap yourself up in bubble wrap and never do anything maybe i should i snorted they still make you read dickens in school great expectations yeah you can stay at home and hide if you wantand wind up like miss havisham i said watching life through a window and obsessed with how things might have been dear god she said youve just made dickens relevant to my life weird right i asked her nodding kelly let out a choking little laugh i pushed myself up and nodded to her i never saw you hiding over here okay im just gonna go do what i gotta do and leave you to make the choice choice sure do you want to put your cap back on and play or do you want to wind up an old maid wandering around your house in the rotting remains of a wedding dress and thirty yards of bubble wrap plotting heartlessly against some kid named pip i regarded her soberly theres really no middle ground im pretty sure thats not right she said see there im not much good at offering wise counsel but that didnt stop me from trying i winked at her and walked on around behind the backstop to where michael sat on the bleachers on the far side of the field molly sat on a blanket underneath a tree maybe ten yards away with earbuds trailing wires down into her shirts front pocket as if she was listening to a digital music player it was an effort to blend into the background i supposed since she couldnt have been listening to one of those gizmos any more than i could have she was wearing sunglasses too so i couldnt tell where her focus was but i was sure she was being alert she gave me the barest trace of a nod as i approached her father i sat down next to him and waited for it harry michael said you look awful yes i do i said i told him about the attempted assassination and about my discussion with forthill michael frowned out at the children practicing his expression quietly disturbed the church wouldnt do something like that harry it isnt how they operate people are people michael i said people do things they make mistakes but it isnt the church he said if this person is part of the church he isnt acting with their blessing or under their instructions i shrugged maybe maybe not i dont think they were too happy with me when i was a couple of days late turning over the shroud but you did return it safe and sound michael said how many people know about the swords how many knew that i had amoracchius he shook his head im not certain given the sorts of foes they contend with the knowledgeable people within the church are more than mildly secretive and securityconscious i gestured around us ballpark it for me he blew out a breath honestly i just dont know ive personally met perhaps two hundred priests who understood our mission but it wouldnt shock me if there were as many as six or seven hundred worldwide but among them that kind of important information would be closely kept four or five at most plus the holy father im going to assume that il papa didnt personally attempt to blow me away i said gravely how do i find out about the others you might talk to father for been there did that he isnt talking michael grimaced i see so other than him he spread his hands i dont know harry forthill was my primary temporal contact i blinked he never talked to you about your support structure in the church he was sworn to secrecy michael said i just had to trust him excuse me he stood up and called to the softball team thank you ladies two laps of the park and well call it a day the team began discarding gloves and such and fell into a line to begin jogging around the exterior of the park in no great hurry talking and laughing as they went i noticed that kelly was among them and fell a little less like a complete incompetent id really like to keep my brains on the inside of my skull i told him when he sat down again and if one of the churchs top guys is leaking information or has sprung a gear they need to know it yes i stared out at the nowempty softball diamond for a minute then i said i dont want to kill anybody but buzz is playing for keeps im not going to pull any punches michael frowned down at his hands harry youre talking about murder what a shock i said after taking one of those monster rounds in the back there must be some way to end this without bloodsh over his shoulder i saw molly abruptly spring to her feet and whip off her sunglasses staring across the park with a puzzled frown on her face then the girls from the team appeared from the direction molly had been staring the girls were running as fast as they could screaming as they came coach screamed kelly coach the man took her easy easy michael said rising he put his hands on kellys shoulders as molly came hurrying over easy what are you talking about he came out of the van with one of those electric stunner things kelly babbled through her panting he zapped her and then he put her in the van and drove away molly drew in a sudden breath and almost seemed to turn green michael stared at the girl for a second and then glanced at me his eyes widened in horror alicia he called stepping past kelly and looking wildly around the park alicia he took her sobbed kelly her tears making her face blotchy he took her kelly i said to get her attention what did he look like she shook her head i dont i cant white not really tall his hair was cut really short like army haircuts buzz hed threatened michael to get me to bring a sword out in the open where it was vulnerable then hed tried to kill me before i locked it away again and when that failed he tried something else molly michael said quietly take the truck drive sandra and donna home call your mother on the way and tell her whats happened stay at the house but molly began michael turned hard eyes to her and said now yes sir molly said instantly michael tossed her the keys to the truck then he turned to a nearby equipment bag and smoothly withdrew an aluminum bat he whipped it around in a flowing rondello motion nodded as if satisfied and turned to me lets go youre driving okay i said where st marys michael said his tone positively grim im going to talk to forthill forthill had just finished giving evening mass when we showed up father paulo greeted michael like a longlost son and how was he doing and of course we could wait for forthill in his chambers i suspected paulo held deep reservations in regards to me but that was okay i wasnt feeling particularly trusting toward him either wed been waiting in forthills quarters for maybe five minutes when the old priest came in he took one look at michael and got pale talk to me about the order michael said quietly my son forthill said he shook his head you know that i hes taken alicia tony forthills mouth dropped open what hes taken my daughter michael roared his voice shaking the walls i dont care what oaths youve sworn i dont care what the church thinks needs to be kept secret we have to find this man and find him now i blinked at michael and found myself leaning a little away from him the heat of his anger was palpable a living thing that brought its own presence its own gravity into the room forthill faced that anger like an old rock thrusting up stubbornly through a turbulent seaworn and unmoving i will not break my oaths michael not even for you im not asking you to do it for me michael said im asking you to do it for alicia forthill flinched michael he said quietly the order maintains security for a reason its enemies have sought to destroy it for two thousand years and in that time the order has helped hundreds of thousands even millions you know that a breach could put the entire order at riskand that means more than my life or yours or an innocent childs apparently i said i guess youre going to take that suffer the little children to come unto me thing kind of literally eh padre forthill looked from michael to me and then to the floor he took a slow breath and then smoothed his hands over his vestments it never gets any easier does it trying to work out the right thing to do he answered his own question no i suppose its often simpler to determine the proper path than it is to actually walk it forthill rose and walked over to a section of the woodpaneled wall he put his hands at the top right and lower left section of the panel and with a grunt pushed it in it slid aside revealing a space the size of a closet filled with file cabinets and a small bookshelf i traded a glance with michael who raised his eyebrows in surprise he hadnt known about the hideyhole forthill opened a drawer and started thumbing through files the ordo malleus has existed in one form or another since the founding of the church originally we were tasked with the casting out of demons from the possessed but as the church grew it became clear that we needed to be able to counter the threats from other enemies as well other enemies i asked various beings who were masquerading as gods forthill said vampires and other supernatural predators wicked faeries who resented the churchs influence he glanced at me practitioners of witchcraft who turned their hand against the followers of christ hells bells i muttered the inquisition forthill grimaced the inquisition has become the primary reason malleus maintains itself in secrecyand why we very seldom engage in direct action ourselves its all too easy to let power go to your head when youre certain that god is on your side the inquisition in many ways attempted to bring our struggle into the lightand because of the situation it helped create more innocent men and women died than centuries of the most savage supernatural depredation we support the knights of the cross and do whatever we can to counsel and protect gods children against supernatural threatsthe way we protected the girl you brought to me the year michaels youngest was born now the order recruits people singly after years of personal observation and maintains the highest levels of personal ethical integrity humanly possible he turned to us with a file folder in his hands but as you pointed out earlier harry were only human i took the folder from him opened it and found buzzs picture i recognized the short haircut and the severe lines of his chin and jaw his eyes were new to me though they were as grey as stone but less warm and fuzzy father roarke douglas i read age fortythree five eleven hundred eightyfive sniper for the rangers trained in demolitions us army chaplain parish priest in guatemala indonesia and rwanda good lord preserve us michael said yeah a real holy warrior i said i eyed forthill and this guy was brought in ive met roarke on several occasions forthill said i was always impressed with his reserve and calm in the face of crisis he repeatedly distinguished himself by acts of courage in protecting his parishioners in some of the most dangerous locations in the world he shook his head but he changed in the last few years changed michael said how he became a strong advocate for preemptive intervention he wanted to hit back first eh i asked you wouldnt say that if youd seen what life can be like in some of the places father douglas has lived forthill said its not so simple it never is i said he was in particular an admirer of shiros forthill continued when shiro died he was devastated they had worked together several times the way you worked with michael i said forthill nodded roarke was not satisfied with the disposition of fidelacchius he made it known to the rest of malleus too as time went by he became increasingly frustrated that the sword was not being put to use i could see where this one was going and then i got hold of amoracchius too forthill nodded he spent the last year trying to convince the senior members of malleus that we had been deceived that you were in fact an agent of an enemy power who had taken the swords so that they could not be used and no one thought to mention the way those archangels gave orders that i was supposed to hold them they never appear to more than one or two people at a timeand you are a wizard harry forthill said father douglas hypothesized that you had created an illusion to serve your purpose or else had tampered directly with our minds and now hes on a crusade i muttered forthill nodded so it would seem i kept on reading the file hes versed in magicwell enough at least to be smart about how he deals with me contacts in various supernatural communities like the venatori umbrorum which probably explains that protective amulet i shook my head and he thinks hes saving the world the guys a certifiable nightmare where is he michael asked quietly he could be anywhere forthill replied malleus sets up caches of equipment money and so forth he could have tapped into any one of them i tried his cell phone hes not returning my calls he thinks youve been mindscrambled by the enemy i muttered what did you expect to accomplish i had hoped forthill said gently that i might ask him to be patient and have faith im pretty sure this guy believes in faith through superior firepower i closed the file and passed it back to forthill he tried to kill me he abducted alicia as far as im concerned hes off the reservation forthills expression became distressed as he looked at me he turned to michael beseeching michaels face was bleak and unyielding and quiet heat smoldered in his eyes the son of a bitch hurt my little girl i rocked a step backward at the profanity so did forthill the room settled into an oppressive silence the old priest cleared his throat after a moment he put the file back in the cabinet and closed the door ive told you what i know he said im only sorry that i cant do more you can find her cant you michael asked me the way you found molly sure i said but hes bound to be expecting that magic isnt a cureall but you can find her i shrugged he cant stop me from finding her but he can damn well make sure that something happens to her if i do michael frowned what do you mean maybe he stashes her in a box thats being held fifty feet above the ground with an electromagnet so that when i get close with an active spell up and running it shorts out and she falls the bastard is smart and creative michaels knuckles popped as his hands closed into fists besides i said we dont need to find him no no i said weve got the swords hes got the girl i turned to go hes going to find us father douglas called michaels house later that night and asked for me i took the call in michaels office you know what i want he said without preamble obviously i said what do you have in mind bring the swords he said give them to me if you do so without attempting any tricks or deceptions i will release the girl to you unharmed if you involve the police or attempt anything foolish she will die how do i know you havent killed her already the phone rustled and then alicia said hharry im okay hhe hasnt hurt me nor do i want to father douglas said taking the phone back satisfied can i ask you something i said why are you doing this i am doing gods work okay that doesnt sound too crazy or anything i said if youre so tight with god can you really expect me to believe that youll be willing to murder a teenage girl the world needs the swords he replied in a level calm voice they are more important than any one person and while i would never forgive myself yes i will kill her im just trying to get you to see the fallacious logic youre using here i said see if im such a bad guy to have stolen the swords then why would i give a damn whether or not you murder some kid you dont have to be evil to be ambitiousor wrong you dont want to see the girl harmed give me the swords and she wont be there clearly wasnt going to be any profitable discussion of the situation here father douglas was going to have his way regardless of the impediments of trivial things like rationality where i asked he gave me an address the roof you come to the east side of the building you show me the swords then you come up and make the exchange no staff no rod just you when one hour he said and hung up i put the phone down looked at michael and said we dont have much time the building in question stood at the corner of monroe and michigan overlooking millennium park i had to park a couple of blocks away and walk in with both swords stowed in a big gym bag father douglas hadnt specified where i was supposed to stand and show him the swords but the streetlights adjacent to the building were all inexplicably dark except for one i ambled over to the pool of light it cast down onto the sidewalk opened the bag and held out both swords it was hard to see past the light but i thought i saw a gleam on the roof binoculars a few seconds later a red light flashed twice from the same spot where id thought i had seen something this would be the place then id brought my extremely illegal picklocks with me but as it turned out i didnt need to use them father douglas had already circumvented the locks and presumably the security system the front door was open as was the door to the stairwell from there it was just one long thighburning hike up to the roof i emerged into cold strong wind you get up twenty stories or so and you run into that a lot it ripped at my duster and sent it to flapping like a flag i peered around the roof at spinning heat pumps and ac units and various antennae but saw no one the beam of a handheld floodlight hit me and i whirled in place the light was coming from the roof of the building next to mine father douglas flipped it off and after blinking a few times could see him clearly standing in the wind in priestly black his white collar almost luminous in the ambient light of the city his grey eyes were shadowed and he was maybe a day and a half past time to shave a long plank lay on the rooftop at his feet which he must have used to move over alicia sat in a chair next to him her wrists bound to its arms blindfolded with a gag in her mouth father douglas lifted a megaphone thats far enough he said i could hear him over the heavy wind thats detcord shes tied up with do you know what that is yeah he held up his other hand this is the detonator as long as its sending a signal shes fine its a dead man switch if i drop it or let it go the signal stops and the cord goes off if the receiver gets damaged and stops receiving the signal the cord goes off if you start using magic and destroy one of the devices it goes off thats way better than the electromagnet thing i muttered to myself i raised my voice and bellowed so how do you want to do this throw them disarm the explosives first no the girl stays where she is once im gone ill send the code to disarm the device i considered the distance it was a good fifteenfoot jump to get from one rooftop to the other an easy throw douglas i shouted think about this for a minute the swords arent just sharp and shiny theyre symbols if you take one up for the wrong reasons you could destroy it believe me i know the swords are meant for better things than to molder in a dingy basement he replied he held up the detonator surrender them now i stared at him for a long second then i tossed the entire bag over it landed at his feet with a clatter he bent down to open it i steeled myself this was about to get dicey i hadnt counted on the dead man switch or a fifteenfootlong jump father douglas opened the bag and the smoke grenade michael had rigged inside it in his workshop went off with a heavy thud white smoke billowed back into his face and i took three quick steps and hurled myself into the air for an awful portion of a second twenty stories of open air yawned beneath me and then i hit the edge of the other roof and collided with father douglas we went down together i couldnt think about anything but the detonator and i clamped down on that with my left hand crushing his fingers beneath mine so that he couldnt release it he jabbed his thumb at my right eye but i ducked my head and he got nothing but bone he slammed his head against my noseagain with the nose hells bells that hurtand drove a knee into my groin i let him seizing his arm with both hands now squeezing trying to choke off the blood to his hand to weaken it so that i could take the detonator from him his left fist slammed into my temple my mouth and my neck i bent my head down and bit savagely at his wrist eliciting a scream of pain from him i slammed my weight against him slipping some fingers into his grasp and got one of them over the pressure trigger then i wrenched with my whole body twisting my shoulders and hips for leverage and ripped the detonator away from him he rolled away from me instantly and seized the bag then he was up and running for a doorway leading down into the building i let him go and rushed over to alicia the darkhaired girl was trembling uncontrollably detcord is basically a long rubber tube filled with explosive compound its a little thicker than a pencil flexible and generally set off by an electrical charge wrap detcord around a concrete column and set it off and the explosion will cut through it like a piece of dry bamboo alicia was tied to the chair with it if it went off it would cut her to pieces the detonator was a simple setupa black plastic box hooked to a twelvevolt battery which was in turn connected to a wire leading to the detcord a green light on the detonator glowed cheerily it matched a cheery green light on the dead man switch transmitter in my hand if what douglas had said was accurate then if the light went out things wouldnt be nearly so cheery if i let go of the switch it would stop the signal to the detonator which would then complete the circuit send current to the detcord and boom in theory i should be able to cut the wire leading from the battery and render it harmlessas long as douglas hadnt rigged the device to detonate if that happened i didnt have much time the electronics of the transmitter wouldnt last long around me even though i hadnt used any magic around them i had to get the girl out now i made the call based upon what i knew about father douglas he seemed like he might have good intentions despite all his shenanigans so i gambled that he wouldnt want the girl to die by any means other than a conscious decision from someone either him letting go of the trigger or me blowing the transmitter by using magic i took out my pocketknife opened it with my teeth and slashed at the heavy plastic tubing that held her tied down i cut through the tube once unwound it from first one arm then the other and she was free she clawed away the blindfold and gag her fingers still clumsy from being bound come on i said i grabbed her arm and hauled her out of the chair and away from the explosives she staggered leaning against me and i ran for the stairs as we got to the first landing my ongoing presence apparently became too much for the transmitter something sparked and crackled inside the plastic case the cheery green light went out and there was a huge and horrible sound from above and behind us i managed to get between alicia and the stairwell wall as the pressure wave caught us and threw us into it it slammed my already abused head into the wall i staggered under the pain for a minute and forced my way through it like a drowning man clawing for the surface come on i croaked to alicia come on we have to go she looked at me with dull stunned eyes so i just grabbed her hand and started down the stairs with her stuffing the heavy transmitter into my duster pocket with the other hand we only had a few minutes before the place would be swarming with police and firefighters i didnt particularly feel like answering their questions about why my fingerprints were on an expensive transmitter and showed trace evidence of explosive residue going down all those stairs was only slightly less taxing than going up had been and my legs were going to be complaining at me for days we got to the bottom and i led alicia out into an alley then out to monroe i looked wildly up and down the street michaels truck was there waiting right where it was supposed to be out in front of the original building i put my fingers to my lips and let out a shrill whistle michaels truck pulled into the street and stopped in front of us i hurried alicia forward the door swung open and molly leaned out taking alicias hand and pulling her in i went in right behind her though it made things awfully cozy in the pickups cab hes loose with the swords i said did you do it did it molly replied and promptly handed me a dashboard compass with one of her own golden hairs stuck to it with clear tape the needle pointed firmly to the east instead of to the north the grasshopper had set up a basic tracking spell one of the handier tricks i know hes probably moving on foot through the park i told michael circle around to lakeshore get us in front of him are you all right baby michael asked alicia fumbled for his hand and squeezed it tight then she leaned against molly and started crying hurry i told michael hes got to know weve bugged the swords somehow if he finds those hairs molly tied onto the hilts were done he wont get away michael said with perfect confidence and slammed the accelerator down as we approached an intersection sporting a bright red light maybe it was divine intervention or fate or just good driving but the truck shot through the intersection missing two other cars by inches and sailed on forward the needle on the compass pointed steadily toward the park as we went but then abruptly began to traverse from one side to the other i looked up ahead of me and saw a dark form sprinting across the road that separated the park from lake michigan there i shouted pointing there he is michael pulled over to the side of the road and i hit the ground before the truck had stopped moving sprinting after father douglas he was in good shape covering the ground in long loping strides normally it wouldnt have been a contest to catch him i run three or four days a week to train for situations exactly like this one of course when i practice im not generally concussed weary and sporting a recently dislocated shoulder douglas was holding his lead as we sprinted down the beach and i was tiring more rapidly than i should have so i cheated i reached into my pocket drew out the heavy transmitter and flung it at him as hard as i could the black plastic device struck him on the back of the head shattering and sending several heavy batteries flying father douglas staggered and couldnt keep his balance at the pace he was moving he went down in the sand i rushed over to him and seized the bag with the swords only to have him sweep one leg out in a martial arts move and kick my legs out from beneath me i went down too father douglas ripped at the bag but i clung grimly while we fought and kicked at each otheruntil the bag tore open under the strain and spilled the swords onto the sand he seized the hilt of fidelacchius a katanatype sword that was built to look like a simple heavy walking stick until you drew the blade i seized amoracchius scabbard and all and barely brought the sheathed broadsword up in time to deflect a sweeping slash from father douglas he gained his knees and swung again and i had all i could do to lift the sheathed sword and fend off the strike blow after blow rained down on me and there was no time to call upon my power no opportunity to so much as rise to my knees until a sizefourteen work boot hit father douglas in the chest and threw him back michael stood over me aluminum baseball bat in his right hand he put out the other one and i slapped amoracchius into it he gripped it midblade like some kind of giant crucifix and limped toward father douglas with his bat held in a guard position father douglas stared at michael with wide eyes stay back he said i dont want to hurt you who says youre able to michael rumbled put down the sword and ill let you go douglas stared at him with those cold grey eyes i cant do that then ill put you down and take the sword anyway its over roarke you just dont realize it yet father douglas wasted no more time on talk but came at michael the katana whirling michael batted no pun intended the attack aside like a cat swatting down moths the baseball bat spinning slow he said too slow to hit a halfblind cripple you dont know the first thing about what it means to bear a sword douglas snarled and came at him again michael defeated this attack too with contemptuous ease and followed it by smacking douglas across one cheek with the hilt of the sheathed sword it means sacrifice michael said as douglas reeled it means forgetting about yourself and what you want it means putting your faith in the lord god almighty he swung a pair of blows which douglas defended against barelybut the third a straight thrust with the baseball bats tip drove home into his solar plexus douglas staggered to one knee you abandoned your duty douglas gasped the world grows darker by the day people cry out for our helpand you would have the swords sit with this creature of witchcraft and deceit you arrogant child michael snarled the almighty himself has made his will known if you are a man of faith then you must abide by it you have been lied to douglas said how could god ignore his people when they need his protection so badly that is not for us to know michael shouted dont you see you fool we are only men we only see in one place at one time the lord knows all that might be would you presume to say that you know better than our god what should be done with the swords douglas stared at michael are you stupid enough to believe that he would want you to cast aside your beliefs to impose your will upon the world do you think he wants you to murder decent men and abduct innocent children the bat struck fidelacchius from douglass hands and michael followed it with a pair of crushing blows one to the shoulder and one to the knee douglas went down to the sand in a heap look at yourself michael said his words hard and merciless look at what you have done in gods name look at the bruises on my daughters arms at the blood on my friends face and then tell me which of us has been deceived again the bat swept down and douglas fell senseless to the sand michael stood over the man for a moment his entire body shaking the bat still upraised michael i said quietly he hurt my little girl harry his voice shook with barely repressed rage he isnt going to hurt her now i said he hurt my little girl michael i said gently you cant if this is how it has to be ill do it but you cant man his eyes shifted back toward me for just a second easy easy i told him were done here were done he stared for another long silent moment then he lowered the bat very slowly and bowed his head he stood there for a minute his chest heaving and then dropped the bat he settled down onto the sand with a wince i got up and collected fidelacchius returning it to its sheath thank you michael said quietly he offered me amoracchiuss hilt are you sure i asked he nodded smiling wearily yes i took the sword and looked at douglas what do we do with him michael stared at him silently for a moment in the background we could hear emergency vehicles arriving to attend to the aftermath of the rooftop explosion well bring him with us michael said the church will deal with its own i sat in the chapel balcony at st marys staring down at the church below me and brooding michael and forthill had been seeing to father douglas who wasnt going anywhere under his own locomotion for a while they had him in a bed somewhere it had hurt to watch michael moving in what was obviously great pain hobble around the room helping to make douglas feel better id have been content to dump the asshole in an alley somewhere and leave him to his fate which might just possibly be one reason i was never going to be a knight i had also swiped forthills flask of scotch from his room and it was keeping me company in the balcony two more reasons i was never going to be a knight right at the end there i said to no one in particular those two started speaking a different language i mean i understood all the words and i understood the passion behind them but i dont get how they connect you know i sipped some more scotch come to think of it there are a lot of things i dont get about this whole situation and you want an explanation of some kind asked a man seated in the pew beside me i just about jumped out of my skin he was an older man he had dark skin and silverwhite hair and he wore a blue workmans jumpsuit like you often see on janitors the name tag read jake you i breathed youre the archangel youre uriel he shrugged the gesture carried acknowledgment somehow what are you doing here i askedmaybe a bit blearily i was concussed and half the flask was gone perhaps im a hallucination brought on by head trauma and alcohol he said oh i said i peered at him and then offered him the flask want a belt very kind he said and took a swig from the flask he passed it back to me i dont exactly make it a habit to do this but if youve got questions ask them okay i said why did you guys let michael get so screwed up we didnt let him do anything jake replied calmly he chose to hazard himself in battle against the enemy the enemy c hose to shoot him and where to point the gun and when to pull the trigger he survived the experience so in other words god was doing nothing to help jake smiled wouldnt say that but you got to understand son god isnt about making good things happen to you or bad things happen to you hes all about you making choices exercising the gift of free will god wants you to have good things and a good life but he cant gift wrap them for you you have to choose the actions that lead you to that life free will huh yes for example your free will on that island i eyed him and sipped more scotch you saw the valkyrie staring at michael you thought he was in danger so even though it was your turn you sent him up to the helicopter in your place no good deed goes unpunished i said with one too many sh sounds thats where he got hurt jake shrugged but if you hadnt youd have died in that harness and hed have died on that island i scowled what jake waved a hand i wont bore you with details but suffice to say that your choice in that moment changed everything but you lost a knight i said a warrior jake smiled did we he can barely walk without that cane sure he handled douglas but thats a far cry from dealing with a denarian ah jake said you mean warrior in the literal sense what other kind of warrior is there i asked the important kind i frowned again harry jake said sighing the conflict between light and darkness rages on so many levels that you literally could not understand it all not yet anyway sometimes that battlefield is a literal one sometimes its a great deal more nebulous and metaphorical but michael and me are literal guys i said jake actually laughed yeah do you think we angled to have you brought into this situation because we needed you to beat someone up well generally speaking yeah i gestured with the flask pretty much all we did was beat up this guy who had good intentions and who was desperate to do something to help jake shook his head the real war happened when you werent looking huh courtney jake said the little girl who almost got hit by a car what about her i asked you saved her life he said moreover you noted the bruise on her cheekone which she acquired from her abusive father your presence heightened her mothers response to the realization that her daughter was being abused she moved out the next morning he spread his hands in that moment you saved the childs life prevented her mother from alcohol addiction in response to the loss and shattered a generational cycle of abuse more than three hundred years old i um chuck the electrician jake continued he was drunk because hes fighting with his wife two months from now their fouryearold daughter is going to be diagnosed with cancer and require a marrow transplant her father is the only viable donor you saved his life with what you didand his daughters life too and the struggle that family is going to face together is going to leave them stronger and happier than theyve ever been i grunted that smells an awful lot like predestination to me what if those people choose something different its a complex issue jake admitted but think of the course of the future as oh flowing water if you know the lay of the land you can make a good guess where its going now someone can always come along and dig a ditch and change that flow of water but honestly youd be shocked how seldom people truly choose to exercise their will within their lives i grunted what about second baseperson kelly i save her life too no but you made a young woman feel better in a moment where she felt as though she didnt have anyone she could talk to just a few kind words but its going to make her think about the difference those words made shes got a good chance of winding up as a counselor to her fellow man the five minutes of kindness you showed her is going to help thousands of others he spread his hands and that only takes into account the past day despair and pain were averted loss and tragedy thwarted do you think that you havent struck a blow for the light warrior urn and last but not least lets not forget michael he said hes a good man but where his children are involved he can be completely irrational he was a hairbreadth from losing control when he stood over douglas on the beach your words your presence your will helped him to choose mercy over vengeance i just stared at him for a moment but i didnt actually mean to do any of that he smiled but you chose the actions that led to it no one forced you to do it and to those people what you did saved them from danger as real as any creature of the night he turned to look down at the church below and pursed his lips people have far more power than they realize if they only choose to use it michael might not be cutting demons with a sword anymore harry but dont think for a second that he isnt still fighting the good fight its just harder for you to see the results from down here i swigged more scotch thinking about that hes happier now i said his family too funny how making good choices leads to that what about father douglas i asked whats going to happen for the most part jake said that will be up to him hope fully hell choose to accept his errors and change his life for the better i nodded slowly then i said lets talk about my bill jakes eyebrows shot up what my bill i said enunciating you dragged me into this mess you can pay me same as any other client where do i send the invoice youre youre trying to bill the lord god almighty jake said as if he couldnt quite believe it heluh heck no i said im billing you that isnt really how we work it is if you want to work with me i told him thrusting out my jaw cough up otherwise maybe next time ill just stand around whistling when you want me to help you out jakes face broadened into a wide merry grin and laughter filled his voice no you wont he said and vanished i scowled ferociously at the empty space where hed been a moment before cheapskate i muttered but i was pretty sure he was right the difference a day makes by simon r green it isnt that the wages ofsin are so bad its the collateral damage one it was three oclock in the morning in the oldest bar in the world and i was killing time drinking with a dead man dead boy is an old friend though hes only seventeen hes been seventeen for some thirty years now ever since he was mugged and murdered for the spare change in his pockets he made a deal to come back from the dead and take his revenge on his killers but he should have read the small print hes been rapped inside his dead body ever since searching for a way out hes surprisingly good company for a man with so many strikes against him im john taylor private investigator i dont do divorce work i dont chase after the maltese falcon and i am most definitely not on the side of the angels either variety i do however wear a white trench coat get in over my head more often than not and get personally involved with my female clients far more often than is good for me i have a gift for finding things and people id just finished a case that hadnt ended well a man hired me because his imaginary friend had gone missing and he wanted me to find out why apparently this mans imaginary friend had been his constant companion since childhood and had never gone off on his own before the client got quite tearful about it so i gave him my best professional look and my most reassuring smile and promised him i would waste no time in tracking down his imaginary friend as cases go it wasnt that difficult i found the imaginary bastard in the first place i looked he was having an affair with the clients wife i put the three of them together in the same hotel room and left them to it knowing there was no point in even sending in my bill it was all the clients fault really far too imaginative except when it came to his wife and there i was consoling myself with a large glass of wormwood brandy while dead boy made heavy going of something that heaved back and forth and looked like it was trying to eat its way through the glass being very thoroughly dead though not in the least departed dead boy doesnt need to eat or drink but he likes to pretend it makes him feel more real and since his taste buds are quite definitely damaged it takes more than the usual hard stuff to hit his spot dead boy knows this appalling old obeah woman who whips up pills and potions especially for him potent enough to make a corpse dance and a ghoul show you her underwear god alone knows what it would do to the living certainly ive never been tempted to find out for the moment dead boy was drinking a graveyard punch made with ingredients from real graveyards i just hoped it was no one i knew for once dead boy was in a better financial state than me so he was paying for the drinks hed just started a new job as doorman for club dead the special club for zombies vampires mummies and all the other forms of the mortally challenged club motto we belong dead i didnt see the job lasting dead boy has all the social graces of a lemming in heat or a sewer rat with bleeding hemorrhoids but since he was in the money i was ordering the best of everything in a big glass the oldest bar in the world is called strangefellows these days you get all sorts in here the living and the dead and those who havent made their minds up yet along with gods and monsters aliens and shapeshifters and a whole bunch of things that shouldnt exist but unfortunately do something from a black lagoon was sitting slumped in one corner big and green and mossy and stinking of brine drinking whiskey sours one after the other and mourning over the one that got away the tribe of the gay barbarians tall muscular fellows resplendent in fringed leather chaps nipple piercings and tall ostrich feather headdresses were challenging all comers to a game of twister a dancing bear was giving it his best john travolta moves he looked pretty silly in the white jacket but given his size no one felt like telling him and a group of rather disreputablelooking dwarves were selling tickets to see the incredible sleeping woman id seen her forty years of catatonia had not been kind which was why the dwarves were no longer allowed to bill her as the incredible sleeping beauty one of frankensteins female creations was singing a torch song the transvestite superheroine ms fate was reading a gossip tabloid with great concentration to see if he was in that week and harry fabulous was doing his rounds selling chemical adventures knockoff hyde formula and shorttime psychoses for really quite reasonable prices just another night at strangefellows hut while the oldest bar in the world has few rules and even fewer standards we do draw the line at weeping women so when the tall slender brunette in the expensive outfit came stumbling into the bar crying her eyes out everyone fell quiet and turned to look weeping women always mean trouble for someone she lurched to a halt in the middle of the room and looked about her and i quickly realized that she was crying hot angry tears of rage and frustration rather than sorrow the tears ran jerkily down her cheeks the sheer force of them shaking her whole body something about her gave me the feeling she wasnt a woman who often gave in to tears she sniffed them back with an effort and glared about her as defiantly as her puffy eyes and streaked makeup would allow and then she looked in my direction and my heart sank as she fixed her attention on me she pushed her way quickly through the packed tables and marched right up to me the bars normal bedlam resumed as everyone celebrated someone else getting hit by the bullet i sighed inwardly and turned unhurriedly on my bar stool to nod politely to the woman as she crashed to a halt before me and fixed me with dark haunted eyes she was goodlooking enough in an undemanding way her long lean body positively burning with thwarted nervous energy her clothes were expensive though somewhat disheveled she was clutching a white leather shoulder bag as though she would never let it go and her whole stance screamed stress and tension her mouth was compressed into a thin dark red line and she held herself very stiffly as though she might fall apart if her control lapsed for just one moment and yet behind the clear anger in her eyes i could see an awful unfocused fear hi i said as kindly as i could im john taylor yes she said jerkily the words coming out clipped in sudden bursts i know you were described to me the man in the white trench coat the knight in cold armor he said youd help me sorry im not making myself clear ive had something of a shock my name is liza barclay im lost i dont know what im doing here ive lost all memory of the last twentyfour hours of my life i want you to find them for me i sighed again still inwardly and handed her my glass take a sip of brandy i said doing my best to sound kind and helpful and not at all threatening she grabbed the brandy glass with both hands took a good gulp and immediately pulled a face and thrust the glass back into my hand god thats awful you drink that for fun youre tougher than you look but then youd have to be sorry im rambling its all right i said take your time get your breath back then tell me how you got here this isnt an easy place to get to i dont know she said immediately ive lost a day a whole day i slipped off my bar stool and offered her a seat but she shook her head quickly so i just leaned back against the long wooden bar and studied her openly as she looked around strangefellows making it very clear with her face and body language that not only had she never seen anything like it but that she was quite definitely slumming just by being there i was impressed the oldest bar in the world isnt for just anyone most people take one look and run away screaming and we like it that way strangefellows is a place of old magic and all the very latest sins and indulgences this is not the kind of bar where everyone knows your name its the kind of bar where you can wake up robbed and rolled in someone elses body liza barclay deliberately turned her back on the disturbing sights and the appalling patrons and fixed her full attention on me i did my best to look tall dark and handsome but i couldnt have been that successful because after only a moment she nodded briskly as though id passed some necessary test but only just she switched her gaze to dead boy who smiled vaguely and toasted her with his glass the graveyard punch made a valiant attempt to escape and he had to push the stuff back in with his fingers dead boy was tall and adolescent thin wrapped in a long purple greatcoat spotted with various food and drink stains and topped with a fresh black rose on his lapel scuffed black leather trousers over muddy calfskin boots completed the ensemble he let his coat hang open to reveal a bare torso covered with old injuries bullet holes and one long yshaped autopsy scar dead boy might be deceased but he still took damage even if he couldnt feel it he was mostly held together with stitches and staples and superglue along with a certain amount of black duct tape lashed around his middle his skin was a pale gray and dustylooking he had the face of a debauched and very weary preraphaelite poet with dark feverbright eyes a sulky mouth with no colour in it and long dark curly hair crammed under a large floppy hat he didnt smile at liza barclay he didnt care her tears hadnt touched him at all liza shuddered but didnt look away she was impressing me more and more most people cant stand being around the dead and that goes double for dead boy liza glanced around the bar again at its various strange and unnatural patrons and rather than being scared or appalled she just sniffed loudly and turned her back on them again they were no help to her or her problem so they didnt matter liza barclay it seemed was a very singleminded lady how can you stand being in a place like this she said to me quite seriously what strangefellows i said there are worse places to drink in the ambience isnt up to much ill grant you but i dont mean just here i mean everywhere this whole area a tinge of hysteria had entered her voice liza heard it and clamped down hard on it she hugged herself suddenly as though a cold wind had blown over her grave ive been walking back and forth in the streets for ages this terrible place ive seen things awful things creatures walking right out in the open with normal people and none of them batted an eye where am i am i dead is this hell no i said though on a good day you can see hell from here as far as i can tell you are a perfectly normal woman who has had the misfortune to somehow find her way into the nightside the nightside she grabbed on to the word considered it and then looked to me for more information and it wasnt a request it was a demand i was liking her more and more the nightside i said the dark secret hidden in the heart of london the longest night in the world where the sun has never shone and never will where its always three oclock in the morning and the hour that tries mens souls this is where all he secret people come in search of forbidden knowledge and all the pleasures people arent supposed to want but still do you can pursue any dream here or any nightmare sell your soul or someone elses run wild in the streets and satisfy any fantasy you over had as long as your credit holds out this is the nightside liza barclay and it is not a place for normal people like you its not an easy place to find your way into said dead boy i low did you get here i dont know i cant remember her shoulders slumped and her strength seemed to seep out of her i understood she was having to take in a lot at one go and the nightside does so love to break people i thought for a moment she might start crying again but her chin lifted her eyes flashed and just like that she was back in control again i live in london have done all my life and i never heard of the nightside i just came to and found myself here lost and alone and now youre among friends i said more or less said dead boy i am john taylor i said ignoring dead boy with the ease of long practice and im a private eye yes really her mouth twitched in a brief smile i suppose i shouldnt be surprised to find one more mythical creature among so many and my appalling friend here is dead boy yes really hi said dead boy leaning forward and offering a pale dead hand for her to shake yes that is formaldehyde youre smelling so get used to it im dead im wild and exciting and extraordinarily glamorous and youre very pleased to meet me dont put money on it said liza whats it like being dead cold said dead boy unexpectedly its getting hard for me to even remember what being warm feels like though i think i miss sleep the most never being able to just lie down and switch off no rest no dreams dont you get tired said liza fascinated despite herself im always tired dead boy said sadly cut it out i said firmly you think i dont know you mainline that synthetic adrenaline when no ones looking i shrugged apologetically at liza sorry but you mustnt encourage him hes not really as selfpitying as he likes to make out he just thinks it makes him more attractive to women never dismiss the pity factor dead boy said easily suicide girls go crazy for dead flesh thats disgusting said liza very firmly he leered at her you havent lived till youve rattled a coffin with someone on graveyard viagra changing the subject right now i said loudly tell me about your memory loss liza whats the last thing you do remember before waking up here she frowned concentrating the last twentyfour hours are just gone a whole day the last thing im sure of i was in london the real london down in tottenham court road underground station though i cant quite seem to remember why i think i was looking for someone the next thing i knew i was here running through the streets crying as though my heart would break i dont know why im not the crying kind usually im just not its all right i said what happened next i was attacked they came out of nowhere tall spindly men in top hats and oldfashioned clothes with great smiling faces and knives for hands scissormen i said always looking for someone weaker to prey on they can home in on guilt and horror like sharks tasting blood in the water i havent done anything to feel guilty about said liza as far as you know said dead boy reasonably who knows what you might have done in the missing twentyfour hours its amazing how much sin a determined person can cram into twentylour hours i speak from experience you understand ignore him i said hes just boasting but scissormen said liza everything comes to the nightside i said especially all the bad things with nowhere else to go still its always a shame when childhood characters go bad how did you get away from them i didnt said liza her eyes and her voice becoming uncertain again as she remembered they were all around me smiling their awful smiles opening and closing their scissorhands chanting something in german in shrill mocking voices they cut at me always drawing back at the very last moment and laughing as i jumped this way and that to avoid them scuttling round and round me always pressing closer smiling and smiling and nobody did anything most people didnt even stop to watch i was screaming by then but no one helped until this strange man appeared out of nowhere and the scissormen stopped just like that they huddled together facing him like a pack of dogs at bay he said his name and the scissormen just turned and ran i couldnt believe it what was his name i said eddie he was very sweet though he looked like some kind of vagrant and from the smell of him hed been sleeping rough for some time i tried to give him some money but he wasnt interested he listened to my story though i dont know how much sense i made and then he brought me here told me to look for you john taylor that youd be able to help me do you know this man oh sure said dead boy everyone here knows razor eddie punk god of the straight razor no wonder the scissormen cut and ran most people do liza looked at me and i nodded eddies a good man in his own disturbing way and hes right i can help you i have a gift for finding things even missing memories liza managed a real hopeful smile for the first time anything i said but i have to ask are you sure you want to remember a lot of the time people forget things for a reason she looked at me steadily of course i want to remember i think i need to i think something bad happened in the nightside i can practically guarantee it said dead hoy youre really not helping i said liza youre sure youve never even heard of the nightside before its not unheard of for innocents to wander in by accident but usually you have to want it pretty bad i never knew places like this existed liza said stubbornly i never knew monsters were real the world is a much bigger place than most people realise i said magic still exists though its grown strange and crafty and maybe just a bit senile magic she said raising one perfectly plucked eyebrow magic and other things time isnt as firmly nailed down in the nightside as it might be we get all sorts turning up here from the past and any number of alternate futures not to mention all kinds of rogues adventurers and complete and utter scumbags from other worlds and dimensions all looking for a little excitement or a nice bit of sin that isnt too shopsoiled i stopped and considered her thoughtfully you really dont care about any of this do you it doesnt interest or attract you in the least no said liza i dont belong in a madhouse like this i have no business being here i could just take you home i said back to the safe and sane london youve always known no she said immediately theres a whole day of my life missing its mine and i want it back but what if youve done something really bad said dead boy most people come to the nightside to do something really bad its always better to know liza said firmly no i said not always and especially not here but if thats what you want then thats what you get the client is always right now the odds are you came here looking for something or someone so lets take a look in that shoulder bag of yours the way youve been clinging to it since you got here it must hold something important she looked down at the bag as though shed honestly forgotten it was there and when i reached out a hand to take it she actually shrank back for a moment but once again her stern selfcontrol reasserted itself and she made herself hand over the bag but there was a subtle new tension in her that hadnt been there before i hefted the bag it wasnt that large and it didnt feel like there was that much in it nothing obviously special about it expensive yes white leather gucci without a mark on it i opened the bag and spilled the contents out onto the wooden bar top all three of us leaned in for a closer look but it was just the usual feminine clutter with nothing out of the ordinary apart from a single colour photograph torn jaggedly in two i fitted the pieces together as best i could and we all studied the image in silence for a while the photo showed a somewhat younger liza barclay in a stylish white wedding dress hugging a handsome young man in a formal suit they were both laughing at the camera clearly caught a little off guard they looked very happy as though they belonged together and always would someone had torn the photo fiercely in two right down the middle as though trying to separate the happy couple thats frank said liza frowning so hard her brow must have ached my husband frank thats our wedding day just over seven years now i was never so happy in my life the day we got married poor frank he must be worried sick by now wondering where i am but this is my favourite photo ever i must have worn out half a dozen copies carrying it around in my bag and showing it to people who could have torn it like this maybe you tore it said dead boy been having problems recently have you no no but even as she objected i could practically see the beginnings of memories resurfacing in her she concentrated on the two pieces of the photo speaking only to them we were always so much in love he meant everything to me everything but i followed him all the way across london on the underground he never saw me hed been so preoccupied the last few months i could tell something was wrong i was worried about him hed been keeping things from me and that wasnt like him there were letters and emails i wasnt allowed to read phone calls he wouldnt talk about hed never done that before i thought he might be in some kind of trouble something to do with his business i wanted to help he was my love my life my everything i was so worried sounds like another woman dead boy said wisely and was genuinely surprised when i glared at him well it does but liza was smiling and shaking her head you dont know my frank he loves me as much as i love him hes never even looked at another woman come on said dead boy every man looks at other women when he starts pretending he doesnt thats when you know hes up to something you followed frank through the underground i said to liza ignoring dead boy what happened then i dont know liza reached out to touch the photo but didnt quite the next thing i remember im here in the nightside and theres no sign of frank anywhere could we have been kidnapped dragged here against our will and i somehow escaped well i said diplomatically its possible i suppose but you dont think so its not the way id bet no but at least now we know youre not here alone if youre here then the odds are frank is too i can find him with my gift and see if perhaps he holds the answer to your missing memories no said liza i dont want my frank involved in all this madness if hes here hes involved said dead boy if only because the nightside doesnt take kindly to being ignored she shook her head again still smiling you dont know my frank and you dont know the kind of temptations on offer here said dead boy sex and love and everything in between sweet as cyanide and sprinkled with a little extra glamour to help it go down easier sin is always in season in the nightside and you followed him here i said she glared at me how could he know the way to a place like this because hed been here before said dead boy sorry but its the only answer that makes sense liza glared at him and then looked me right in the eye find him find my frank for me if only so he can tell us the truth and throw these lies back in your faces ill find him i said anything else is up to you and him i picked up the two pieces of the photo holding them firmly between thumb and forefinger and held them up before me i took a deep breath and concentrated reaching deep inside myself for my gift my special gift that allowed me to find anyone or anything i concentrated on the photo until i couldnt see anything else and then slowly my inner eye opened my third eye my private eye from which nothing can hide with my inner eye all the way open i could see the world as it really was every last bit of it all the things that are hidden from humanity because if we could all see the true nature of this world and the kinds of things we share it with humanity would go stark staring mad with horror i can only bear to see it for a little while i sent my sight soaring up out of my body shooting up through the roof of my skull and the roof of strangefellows until i was high in the starspeckled sky looking down on the nightside spread out below me turning slowly like the circles of hell hot neon burned everywhere like balefires in the night sudden bright glares detonated in this place or that as souls were bartered great magical workings rewrote the world or some awful new thing was born to plague mankind there were great voices abroad in the night and terrible rumblings deep in the earth as powers and dominations went about their unknowable business ghosts howled in the streets trapped in moments of time like insects in amber demons rode their human hosts whispering in their ears and vast and powerful creatures walked the night in majesty wonderful and terrible beyond human ability to bear i dropped down from my high vantage point sending my sight flashing through the packed narrow streets slamming in and out of buildings with the quickness of thought following a trail only i could see the photo of frank barclay had let me sink my mental hook in his consciousness if not his soul and i could see the ghost of him still striding purposefully through the streets semitransparent and fragile as a soap bubble the mark hed made in the nightside was still clear his imprint on time itself still walking the streets that he had walked not so long ago and would do until the last vestiges of it faded away frank barclay showed no interest in any of the usual pleasure joints or temptations the open doors of nightclubs where the music never ends the heavylidded glances from darkeyed ladies of the twilight had no attraction for him he never hesitated once or paused to check directions he knew where he was going and from the increasingly intense almost desperate anticipation in his face wherever he was going promised something none of the usual temptations could hope to satisfy i could see him clearly now and he was smiling and something in the smile chilled me all the way to my soul i pulled back as i realised where he was going there are some places you just dont go into with your spirit hanging out some parts of the nightside are hungrier than others i slowly closed my third eye my inner eye until i was safely back inside my own head again and then i dropped the two pieces of the photo back onto the bar top as though they burned my fingers i looked at liza good news and bad news i said ive found him ive found husband frank then whats the bad news said liza meeting my gaze unflinchingly hes in the badlands i said where the really wild things are and hardly anyone gets out alive you only go into the badlands in search of the pleasures too sick too twisted and too nasty for the rest of the nightside if thats where he is liza said steadily then thats where i have to go you cant go there alone i said theyd eat you up and chew on the bones but i have to know said liza her chin jutting stubbornly i have to know whats wrong with him what could possibly bring him to an awful place like this and i have to know what if anything this has to do with my missing memories i have to go there then i guess ill have to take you i said i dont have much money on me at the moment said liza is my credit good put the plastic away i said no charge this time razor eddie owes me a favour for dumping you on me and thats worth more than you could ever pay i leaned over and nudged dead boy whod lost interest in all this long ago his eyes snapped back into focus what is it john i have some important existential brooding i need to be getting on with im taking liza into the badlands in pursuit of her missing husband and her missing memories i said briskly bound to be some trouble interested oh sure said dead boy you cant get too much excitement when youre dead how much are you offering tell you what i said you can have half of my fee but only if we can use your car done said dead boy why do we need his car said liza because we have to travel all the way across town i said and the rush hour can be murder two shed never seen the sky before preoccupied with so much new sin and strangeness right before her it had never even occurred to her to stop and look up now on the rainslick pavement outside the oldest bar in the world lizabarclay followed my pointing finger and stood very still held to the spot by awe and enchantment quite unaware of all the people and others hurrying by on every side in the nightside the sky is full of stars thousands and thousands of them burning bright and sharp in constellations never seen in the outside world and the moon ah the moon is big and bright indeed in the nightside unnaturally luminous and a dozen times larger than it should be hanging over us all like a great mindless eye like an ancient guardian that has quite forgotten its duty and purpose seeing all judging nothing i often think that it isnt a matter of where the nightside is so much as when meanwhile all kinds and manner of humanity and many things not in any way human pushed past with brisk impartial haste intent on their own personal salvations and damnations no one got too close though they might not give a damn about liza clearly just another starstruck tourist but everyone in the nightside knows me or knows enough to give me plenty of room liza finally tore her gaze away from the overcrowded heavens and gave her attention to the crowds bustling around us the street as always positively squirmed with life and energy and all manner of hopes the pavements packed with desperate pilgrims come in search of sin and temptation and the kinds of love that might not have a name but most certainly have a price hot neon blazed and burned up and down the street gaudy as a hookers smile signposts to all the most succulent hells if you cant find it in the nightside it doesnt exist liza clung to my arm like a drowning woman but to her credit she never flinched or looked away she took it all in staring grimly about her refusing to allow the strange sights and tacky glamour to overwhelm her she pressed a little more closely to me as a bunch of eightfoottall insect things paused to bow their devilish heads before me bones glowed through their flesh filmy wings fluttered uncomfortably on their long chitinous backs and their iridescent compound eyes didnt blink once their absurdly jointed legs lowered them almost to the ground as they abased themselves speaking in unison with urgent breathy childrens voices all hail to thee sweet prince of a sundered line and remember us when you choose to come into your kingdom move on i said as kindly as i could they waited a while antennae twitching hopefully until they realised i wasnt going to say any more and then they moved on liza watched them go and then looked at me what the hell was that all about who what were they they are all that remains of the brittle sisters of the hive i said they were just being polite so youre someone special here i might have been once i said but i abdicated so what are you now im a private investigator i said and a bloody good one she favoured me with another of her brief smiles and then looked out at the traffic thundering ceaselessly through the nightside there was a lot of it to look at vehicles of all kinds and natures flashed past never slowing never stopping jockeying endlessly for position and dominance some of them carried goods and some of them carried people and many of them carried things best not thought about at all most were just passing through on their way to somewhere more interesting mysteries and enigmas never to be understood a horsedrawn diligence from the eighteenth century clattered past overtaken by a lipstick red plymouth fury with a dead man grinning at the wheel an articulated rig bore the logo of a local longpig franchise while a motorcycle gang of screaming skeletons burning forever in hellfire chased something very like a tank crossed with an armadillo the boggart on stilts one of the lesser atrocities strode disdainfully down the middle of the road while smaller vehicles nipped in and out of its tall bone stilts a great black beauty of a car cruised past driven by an oriental in black leathers and the man in the back in the green face mask and snapbrimmed hat nodded respectfully to me in passing liza turned and looked at me speechlessly demanding an explanation in the nightside the traffic comes and goes but not everything that looks like a car is a car i explained patiently here ambulances run on distilled suffering motorcycle couriers snort powdered virgins blood for that extra kick and sometimes the bigger vehicles sneak up behind the smaller ones and eat them pretty much everything passes through the nightside at one time or another and sometimes simultaneously and its always in a hurry foot down everything forward and trust in the lord and devil take the hindmost that isnt traffic out there thats evolution in action which is why we cant get where were going by just hopping on the crosstown bus we are waiting for dead boy and his marvelous car of the future the sky the traffic creatures and demons walking openly in the street liza shook her head just a bit dazedly where is this place john good question i said of this world but not necessarily in it halfway between heaven and hell but beholden to neither a place of infinite jest and appalling possibilities but dont let it get to you the nightside is just a place where people go in search of all the things theyre not supposed to want forbidden knowledge forgotten secrets and all the nastier kinds of sex a place where the shadows are comfortably deep and the sun never rises because some things can only be done in the dark its the nightside liza looked at me you do like the sound of your own voice dont you you asked i said perhaps fortunately dead boy arrived at that moment in his fabulous futuristic car and liza had something else to stare at dead boys car is always worth a good look it glided silently to a halt before us hovering a few feet above the ground a car from the future so stylish it didnt even bother with wheels anymore it originally arrived in the nightside through a timeslip from some future time line and adopted dead boy as its driver bright gleaming silver long and sleek and streamlined to within an inch of its life the car hovered arrogantly before us looking like it ran on distilled starlight the long curving windows were polarised so no one could see in and the mighty engines didnt so much as deign to murmur the drivers door swung open to reveal dead boy lounging languidly behind the steering wheel he had a halfempty bottle of vodka in his hand all aboard for the badlands boys and girls feel free to admire my beautiful rides elegance and style this is what every car would be if they only had the ambition youre late i said sternly im always late im the late dead boy he sniggered at his own joke and took a healthy pull from his vodka bottle i am not getting into that liza said firmly it hasnt got any wheels it looks like something from a bad seventies scifi movie hush hush my beauty dead boy said soothingly to his car she is an uneducated barbarian and doesnt mean it he appeared to listen for a moment all right yes she probably did mean it but you mustnt take it personally she is a mere tourist and knows nothing of cars please let her in and please dont activate the ejector seat no matter how annoying she gets there was a pause and then the other doors opened slowly enough to express a certain reluctance liza looked at me does he often have conversations with his car oh yes i said only he can hear her though i see and does this car really have an ejector seat oh yes more than powerful enough to blast you into a whole different dimension ill be more polite to the car from now on said liza i would i said but im still not sitting next to dead boy so we both got in the back liza jumped just a bit as the door shut itself behind us the seats were bloodred leather and very comfortable there was a faint perfume of crushed roses on the slightly pressurised air there were no seat belts of course their very existence would have been an insult to the cars driving skills liza leaned forward and stared openly at the frankly futuristic display screens where the dashboard dials should have been in fact there were enough screens and displays and flashing lights to suggest anything up to and including warp speed can you get warp speed on this thing said liza proving that great minds think alike only in emergencies said dead boy he didnt seem to be kidding liza took in the whiskey brandy and gin bottles lined up on top of the monitor screens all of which showed signs of extensive sampling and sniffed loudly dead boy took this as a hint and gestured generously at the bottles and the open dashboard compartment full of honeyed locusts spiced potato wedges and assorted chocolate biscuits help yourself he said around a mouthful of chocolate hobnob liza declined dead boy shrugged finished his biscuit knocked back a handful of glowing green pills finished off the last of the vodka and slung the bottle through the window which didnt happen to be open the bottle passed right through the glass without stopping they really have thought of everything in the future where to john dead boy said easily my car requires directions she is powerful and lovely and full of surprises but she is not actually prescient apparently that only came as an optional extra head for the badlands i said i should be able to provide more specific directions once we get there i love mystery tours dead boy said happily off you go girl the futuristic car moved smoothly out into the vicious traffic and absolutely everything slammed on the brakes or changed lanes in a hurry to give us plenty of room everybody knew dead boys car and the awful things it could and would do if it got even slightly annoyed i cant help noticing youre not even touching the steering wheel liza said to dead boy oh i wouldnt dare he said my sweeties a much better driver than ill ever be i dont interfere liza leaned back in her seat watched the traffic for a while and then looked thoughtfully at me why are you helping me john its not like im even paying you for your services im curious i said honestly and i dont like to see an innocent caught up and crushed under the nightsides wheels theres enough real evil here without adding cruel and casual stuff good people shouldnt end up here but if they do they need to be protected just on general principles if this is such a bad place she said what are you doing here i belong here i said she settled for that and went back to watching the traffic i took out the two pieces of her photo fitted them together and concentrated on the image of her husband my gift barely stirred manifesting just enough to keep a firm hold on franks location husband frank hed better be worth all this trouble liza clearly loved him with all her heart but women have been known to fall for complete bastards before now his face in the photo didnt give anything away the smile seemed genuine enough but i wasnt so sure about the eyes frank hadnt moved since i first sensed his location and i got the feeling he hadnt moved in some time as i concentrated on his image i began to get a feel for his surroundings and the first thing i felt was the presence of technology advanced future tech not from this time and place frank seemed to be surrounded by it fascinated by it and the more i concentrated the more my images of this future technology were tainted by distinctly organic touches sweating steel and cables that curled like intestines lubricated pistons rising and falling and machines that murmured like people disturbed in their sleep strange nightmare devices performing unnatural tasks with hot blood coursing through their systems what had frank got himself into i was beginning to get a really bad feeling about this especially when franks image in the photo suddenly turned its head to look right at me his face was drawn tired and burning with a strange delirium his eyes were dark and feverbright and he never even glanced at his wife liza sitting right next to me he locked his gaze onto mine and his faraway voice sounded in my head go away i dont want you here dont try and find me i don v want to be found your wifes here i said silently to the photo lizas here in the nightside looking for you shes very worried about you i know keep her away for her sake and just like that the photo was only a photo and his face was just an image from the past i didnt tell liza what had just occurred it didnt matter to me whether frank wanted to be found or not i was working for his wife and she wanted to know what her husband was up to even if she hadnt actually put it that way this is why i dont do divorce work no matter what the client says they never really want the truth still the unexpected contact with frank brief as it was had given me a more definite fix on his position ive found frank i announced to liza and dead boy hes on rotten row ah said dead boy sucking noisily on his whiskey bottle that is not good why liza said immediately what happens on rotten row what do people do there pretty much everything you can think of and a whole lot of things most people have never even contemplated said dead boy rotten row is for the severely sick and disturbed even by the nightsides appalling standards liza turned to me what is he talking about rotten row is where people go to have sex with the kind of people and things that no sane person would want to have sex with i said just a bit reluctantly sex with angels or demons with computers or robots slumming gods or otherdimensional monsters worms from the earth or some of the nastier versions of the living dead rotten row is where you go when the everyday sins of the flesh just dont do it for you anymore where men and women and all the many things they can do together just dont satisfy sex isnt a sin or a sacrament on rotten row its an obsession liza looked at me horrified sex with how is any of that even possible love finds a way dead boy said vaguely liza shook her head stubbornly as though she could prove me a liar if she was just firm enough no you must be wrong john my frank would never never lower himself to he just wouldnt hes always been very normal hed never go to a place like that we all find love where we can said dead boy youre talking about sex not love snapped liza sometimes you have to go a little off the beaten path to get what you really need said dead boy philosophically theres more to life than just boy meets girl you know and that was when all the cars alarms went off at once flashing red lights followed by a rising siren and the sound of an awful lot of systems arming themselves dead boy sat bolt upright tossed his whiskey bottle onto the passenger seat and studied his various displays with great interest dead boy lived for action and adventure all right car turn off the alarms i see them proximity alert people we are currently being boxed in by three no four vehicles in front and behind left and right look out the windows see if you can spot the bastards it wasnt difficult they werent being exactly furtive about it four black london taxicabs were forcing their way through the crowded lanes of traffic to surround us on every side positioning themselves to cut off all possible exits and escapes the cabs bore no name or logo on their flanks just flat black metal like so many malignant beetles they all had cyborged drivers human only down to the waist the head and torso hung suspended in a complex webbing of cables tubes and wires that made them a part of their taxis the car was just an extension of its techaugmented driver so it could manoeuvre as fast as they could think human consciousness given inhuman control and reaction times by the time id finished peering out of every window there were black cabs speeding in perfect formation all around us and long machinegun barrels protruded from each and every one of them covering us put your foot down i said to dead boy try and lose them you go girl go said dead boy and the futuristic car surged forward the back of the taxicab in front of us loomed up disturbingly fast and for a moment i thought we were going to ram it but the taxi accelerated too maintaining its distance the other cabs swiftly increased their speed too suggesting the cyborged drivers and the protruding machine guns werent the taxis only special features these black cabs had been seriously souped up we were all moving incredibly fast now hurtling through the nightside at insane speed streets and buildings just gaudy blurs of colour all around us traffic hurried to get out of our way vehicles that didnt or couldnt move quickly enough were slammed and shunted aside by the taxis cars ran careering off the road into defenceless storefronts or smashed into one another crying out like living things screams and shouts of outrage rang briefly behind us dopplering away into the distance the cabs decided enough was enough closed in on us from every side and slammed on their brakes simultaneously we had to slow clown with them or risk a collision and the futuristic car was clearly cautious enough not to want to risk direct contact until it had to just because they looked like cabs it didnt mean they were protective camouflage is a way of life in the nightside why do you think i work so hard to look like a traditional private eye dead boy beat on the steering wheel with his pale fists hooting with the excitement of the chase and shouting helpful advice that the car mostly ignored liza peered out of one window after another her small hands unconsciously clenched into fists i wasnt that worried yet the car could look after itself one cab pressed in from the left trying to pressure us into changing lanes the cyborged driver wasnt even looking at us the other cabs gave way a little to entice us trying to persuade us away from the badlands exit some way up ahead to keep us away from frank and probably to herd us into a previously chosen killing zone where theyd have all the advantages the futuristic car swayed back and forth looking for a way out between the cabs but they constantly manoeuvred with their more than human reflexes to block our way and then without warning all four sets of machine guns opened fire on us the sound was painfully loud as bullets raked our car from end to end and slammed viciously into front and back liza cried out but quickly calmed down again as she realised i wasnt even ducking the machinegun fire roared and stuttered but none of it could touch us whatever dead boys car was made of it wasnt just steel bullets ricocheted harmlessly away in flurries of sparks and metallic screeches but the futuristic car didnt even shudder under the impact the gunfire continued as though the taxis thought they could break through our defences through sheer perseverance time for puff the magic dragon i think dead boy said cheerfully entirely unmoved by the massed firepower aimed at him from all sides what said liza what did he just say hes got a bloody dragon in here somewhere not as such i said more of a nickname really because it breathes fire and makes problems disappear go for it dead boy lights gleamed brightly all across the display screens and there was the sound of something large and heavy moving into position to be exact a large gun muzzle was slowly protruding from the cars radiator grille puff the magic dragon fired two thousand explosive flechettes a second pumping them out at inhuman speed and with appalling vigour puff is a guns gun the futuristic car opened up on the taxicab in front of us and the whole back of the cab just exploded black steel disintegrating under the impact throwing ragged shrapnel in all directions the cab surged wildly back and forth but puff moved easily to follow it tearing the cab apart with invisible hands the cab burst into flames and was thrown this way and that by a series of explosions before the endless stream of explosive flechettes picked the cab up and threw it end over end across several lanes of traffic leaving a trail of blazing debris and drifting smoke behind it i caught a brief glimpse of the cyborged driver trapped behind his wheel in his ruptured webbing screaming horribly as he burned alive in the wreckage i couldnt bring myself to care much he would have done worse to us if he could the taxi to our left accelerated wildly forcing its way in front of us to block our escape machine guns blazing fiercely from its rear a brave and determined move but the driver really shouldnt have taken his eyes off the main threat the other traffic a long dark limousine with dull unreflective black windows moved effortlessly in beside the cab having sneaked up in the drivers blind spot while he was concentrating on us i winced despite myself id seen the limousine in action before it moved in beside the taxicab matching speeds perfectly until it was right opposite the drivers window and then the black window surface erupted into dozens of long grasping arms with clawed hands hooked fingers sank deep into the steel side of the cab holding it firmly in place while powerful black arms smashed through the window to get at the cyborged driver the limousines can smell human flesh and theyre always hungry the cyborged driver screamed horribly as a dozen clawed hands gripped him fiercely long barbed fingers sinking deep into flesh and bone and then they hauled the driver right out of his webbing tearing the human torso free from its rupturing tubes and cables they dragged the screaming head and torso out through the shattered window and into the interior of the limousine the drivers mouth stretched wide in an endless howl of horror his eyes almost starting from his head at what he saw waiting for him he disappeared inside the limousine there was a brief spurt of blood out the window and then the black arms snapped back in the window reformed itself and the dark limousine accelerated smoothly away the empty taxicab shot across the lanes traffic diving every which way to avoid it until finally it ran off the road and crashed that left just two taxicabs running now on either side of us still firing their guns and trying to herd us away from the badlands puff the magic dragon had fallen silent at two thousand rounds a second it runs out of ammo pretty fast the taxi guns fell silent too either because theyd realised their inventory was getting low as well or perhaps because theyd finally realised the guns werent doing any damage the taxis pressed in close on either side and a dozen long steel blades protruded from the sides of the cabs aimed right at our windows long blades with strangely blurred edges and a chill ran through me as i realised what they were dead boy i said doing my best to sound calm and concerned and not at all like i was filling my trousers do you see what i see of course i see them he said entirely unconcerned the cars computers are already running analysis on the blades monofilament edges one molecule thick cut through anything someone really doesnt want us going wherever it is were going which means they must be protecting something really interesting and i want to know what it is more than ever were going to have to do something about those blades john the car says her exterior is no match for them and while she does have a force shield maintaining it for any length of time will put a serious strain on the engines i think were going to have to do this old school in their face up close and personal just the way i like it sweetie lower the window please his window immediately disappeared and dead boy calmly climbed out the window it took a certain amount of effort to force his gangling body through the gap and then he braced himself in the window frame before throwing himself at the taxicab it jerked away at the last moment as the cyborged driver realised what dead boy was planning but the unnatural strength in dead boys dead muscles propelled him through the air across the growing gap until he slammed into the side of the cab and his dead hands closed inexorably onto the cabs steel frame he clung to the side of the cab as it lurched back and forth trying desperately to shake him off his purple greatcoat streamed out behind him flapping this way and that in the slipstream i couldnt hear dead boy above the roar of the traffic but i could see he was laughing he drew back a gray fist and drove it right through the cabs window the cyborged driver cried out as the reinforced glass shattered showering him with fragments the cab was all over the place now trying to throw dead boy off but he held his balance easily the fingers of one hand thrust deep into the steel roof his feet planted firmly on the wheel arch he leaned in through the empty window and punched the cabdriver repeatedly in the head with his free hand bone shattered and blood flew and the driver screamed as the force of the blows slammed him all around the cabs interior dead boy grabbed a handful of tubes and cables and pulled them free sparks flew and hot fluids spurted and the drivers face went slack and empty he collapsed forward across the jerking steering wheel and dead boy threw the cables aside he checked to make sure hed done all the damage he could and then backed out of the cab window he turned and braced himself his back pressed against the empty window frame the cab was a good ten feet away now but he jumped the increasing gap like he did it every day and landed easily on the futuristic cars roof i heard the thud above me followed by whoops and cheers as dead boy applauded himself and challenged all comers to come and have a go if they thought they were hard enough the futuristic car was still driving itself it didnt need dead boy and it certainly didnt need me so i gave my full attention to the one remaining taxicab closing in really fast from the right its vicious steel blades were now only a few inches away one good sideswipe and those blades would punch right through the cars side and gut liza and me wed already retreated as far back as we could pressed up against the far door but those blades looked really long dead boy came suddenly swinging in through the drivers window and dropped back into his seat he grinned widely and started to beat a victorious tattoo on the steering wheel before he realised one hand still had bits of glass sticking out of it so he leaned back in his seat and set about removing them one at a time from his unfeeling flesh hi he said cheerfully im back did you miss me youre a lunatic said liza excuse me dead boy said coldly but i wasnt talking to you and he spoke loving baby talk to his car until i felt like puking i did point out the nearness and threat of the remaining taxi but dead boy just shrugged sulkily suggesting through very clear body language that he felt hed done his bit and it was now very definitely my turn so i very politely asked the car to lower the window facing the taxi and it did i peered out into the rushing wind concentrating on the distance between us as the rushing wind blew tears from my eyes we were still both moving at one hell of a speed but the taxi was having no trouble keeping up the blurryedged blades were almost touching the car the cyborged driver glared at me his lips pulled back in a mirthless grin his tubes and cables bobbed around him as he stuck close to the futuristic car despite all it could do to lose him i leaned out through the cars window and smashed the drivers window with the knuckleduster id slipped on my fist while he wasnt looking i always make it a point to carry a number of useful objects in my coat pocket because you never know the taxi window shattered glass flying everywhere and the cyborged driver ducked yelling obscenities at me as i leaned farther through the empty window and grabbed on to his door frame i hung in midair between the two vehicles very much aware that if they pulled apart id very probably be torn in two and i would have overbalanced and fallen if liza hadnt been clinging desperately to my legs in the back of the car i hauled myself inside the cab and the taxi driver pointed his arm at me a dull gray metal nozzle protruded from his wrist pointing right at my face i really hadnt expected the driver to have an energy gun implant but i still knew one when i saw one and my mind raced for something to do time seemed to slow right down to give me plenty of time to consider the possibilities but since they all seemed to end with my face being shot off that didnt help much i was just about to try a really desperate lunge when liza let go of my legs i could feel myself sliding out of the car only a few moments from falling and almost certainly dying when liza appeared suddenly beside me forcing herself into the remaining gap in the car window the cyborged driver hesitated as surprised as i was and while he tried to decide which of us to shoot first liza surged forward and grabbed his arm forcing it to one side she was more than half out of the car now and only our two bodies wedged in the car window stopped her from falling the cabdriver struggled to bring his gun hand to bear on either of us while liza fought to control his flailing arm i tried to reach him with my knuckleduster but i was too far away and i couldnt risk trying to wriggle farther out the window and all the time the taxicab and the futuristic car were hurtling through the nightside at terrible speed the ground rushing by only a few feet below us whatever youre planning on doing liza yelled to me now would be a really good time to do it so i gave up trying to reach the driver and wriggled back through the car window liza clung fiercely to the drivers arm as she started to fall he brought his energy gun to bear on her and i pulled a small blue sachet from my coat pocket ripped it open and threw the contents into the drivers face vicious black pepper filled his eyes blinding him in a moment shocked tears streaming down his face he was just starting to sneeze explosively as i pulled liza away from him and both of us wriggled back through the window into the backseat of the futuristic car we sprawled together on the bloodred leather seat breathing harshly as we struggled to get our breath back the taxicab swayed away from us the driver utterly blind and unable to control his cab for the force of his sneezing the cab fell away behind us and a fiftyfoot articulated rig ran right over it from behind and that was very definitely that liza looked at me speechlessly for a long moment and then pepper that was your great idea pepper it worked didnt it i said reasonably condiments are our friends never leave home without them liza shook her head slowly and then sat up straight pushing herself away from me and adjusting her clothes as women do was that all that just happened was that normal for the nightside not really no i had to admit most people have the sense to leave dead boys car strictly alone and they certainly should have known better than to take on dead boy and myself we have reputations which can only mean it has to do with your frank someone knows were coming someone who really doesnt want us to know whats happened to frank and to justify this kind of open attack whatevers going on it must be something really out of the ordinary which means dead boy said cheerfully it must be something new and im always up for something new on my lovely car on to rotten row youre weird said liza three and so we headed into the badlands where the neon gets shoddier and the sins grow shabbier though no less dangerous or disturbing if the nightside is where you go when no one else will have you the badlands is where you go when even the nightside is sick of the sight of you the badlands where all the furtive people end up pursuing things even the nightside is ashamed of because some things are just too tacky the traffic thinned out more and more as we left the major thoroughfares behind dying away to just the occasional tattooed unicorn with assorted piercings and a prince albert a stretch hearse with the corpse half out of its coffin and beating helplessly against the reinforced windows and a headless bounty hunter on horseback the flotsam and jetsam of the nightside all hot in pursuit of their own private destinies and damnations the streets grew narrower and darker and not only because maybe half the streetlights were working the shadows were darker and deeper and things moved in them more and more buildings had boardedup windows and brokenin doors and where lights did sometimes glow in highup windows strange shadows moved behind closed blinds the neon signs remained as gaudy as ever like poisonous flowers in a polluted swamp a few people still walked the rainslick streets heads down looking neither left nor right drawn on by siren calls only they could hear homeless people lurked in the shadows broken men in tattered clothes mostly they moved in packs because it was safer that way there are all kinds of predators in the badlands and a few good people fighting a losing battle and knowing it but fighting on anyway because they knew a battle is not a war i saw tamsin macready the rogue vicar out in her rounds determined to do good in a bad place she recognised dead boys car and waved cheerfully the night grew quieter and more thoughtful the deeper into the badlands we went a shining silver presence in a dark place working streetlights grew few and far between and the car cruised quietly from one pool of light to another dead boy tried the high beams but even they couldnt penetrate far into the gloom as though there was something in this new darkness that swallowed up light the roar and clamour of the nightside proper seemed far away now left behind as we moved from one country to another the few people we passed ignored us intent on their own business this wasnt a place to draw attention to yourself unless of course you had something to sell a tall and willowy succubus with dead white skin crimson lingerie and bloodred eyes loped along beside the futuristic car for a while easily matching its speed she tapped on our polarised windows with her clawed fingertips whispering all the awful things she would let us do liza shrank back from the succubus her face sick with horror and revulsion when the succubus realised we werent going to stop she increased her speed to get ahead of us and then stepped out into the middle of the road blocking our way dead boy told the car to put its foot down and the car surged forward the succubus ghosted out becoming immaterial and the futuristic car passed right through her a spectre tinted rose red and lily white the succubus drifted at her own pace through the car ignoring dead boy her inhuman gaze fixed on liza a succubus always has a taste for fresh meat she reached out a ghostly hand to liza but i grabbed her wrist and stopped her it was like holding the memory of an arm cold as ice soft as smoke the succubus looked at me and then gently pulled her arm free the ghostly trace passing through my mortal flesh in an eerily intimate moment she trailed the fingertips of one hand along my face winked one bloodred eye and then passed on through the car and was gone the badlands grew grimly silent abandoned and forsaken as we closed in on rotten row we had left civilisation behind for something else here buildings and businesses pressed tight together in long ugly tenements as though believing there was strength and protection in numbers windows were shuttered doors securely locked and none of these establishments even bothered to look inviting either you knew what you were looking for or you had no business being here enter at your own risk leave your conscience at the door and absolutely no refunds welcome sir whats your pleasure few people walked the gloomy desolate streets and they all walked alone despite the many dangers because no one else would walk with them or perhaps because the very nature of their needs and temptations had made them solitary and though most of the figures we passed looked like people not all of them walked or moved in a human way one figure in a filthy suit turned suddenly to look at the car as it drifted past and under the pulleddown hat i briefly glimpsed a face that seemed to be nothing but mouth full of sharks teeth stained with fresh blood and gristle its all about hunger in the badlands glowing eyes followed the progress of the futuristic car from shadowy alley mouths rising and falling like bright burning fireflies they didnt normally expect to see such a highclass hightech car in their neighbourhood they could get a lot of money and other things for a car like ours and its contents in the quiet of the street a baby began to cry a lost hopeless despairing sound liza leaned forward stop do you hear that stop the car we have to do something no we dont said dead boy we keep going i said and turned to liza as she opened her mouth to protest that isnt a baby its just something thats learned to sound like a baby to lure in the unsuspecting theres nothing out there that youd want to meet liza looked like she wanted to argue but something in my voice and in my face must have convinced her she slumped back in her seat arms folded tightly across her chest staring straight ahead i felt sorry for her even as i admired her courage and her stubbornness she was having to take an awful lot on board most of which would have broken a weaker mind but she kept going all for her dearest love frank husband frank what kind of man was he to inspire such love and devotion and still end up here in rotten row i would see this through to the end because i had said i would but there was no way this was going to end well interesting that dead boy hadnt even slowed the car perhaps his dead ears heard something in the babys cry that was hidden from the living this is it people he said abruptly as the car turned a tight corner into a narrow garbagecluttered culdesac we have now arrived at rotten row just breathe in that ambience are you sure liza said doubtfully peering through the car window with her face almost pressed to the glass i cant see anything no shops no businesses no people i dont even see a street sign someone probably stole it dead boy said wisely around here anything not actually nailed down and guarded by hellhounds is automatically considered up for grabs but my car says this is the place and my sweetie is never wrong someone in the tattered remains of what had once been a very expensive suit lurched out of a side alley to throw something at the futuristic car it bounced back from the cars windscreen and exploded the car didnt even rock there was a brief scream from the thrower as the blast threw him backwards his clothes on fire hed barely hit the ground before a dozen dark shapes came swarming out of all the other alleys to roll his still twitching body back and forth as they robbed him of what little he had that was worth the taking they were already stripping the smouldering clothes from his dead body as they dragged it off into the merciful darkness of the alley shadows liza looked at me angrily more disgusted than disturbed what kind of a place have you brought me to john my frank wouldnt be seen dead in an area like this the photo says hes here i said look i held up the two jaggedly torn pieces pressed carefully together and concentrated my gift on them the image of frank jumped right out of the wedding photo to become a flickering ghost in the street outside he was walking hurriedly down rotten row a memory of a man repeating his last journey imprinted on time past his palely translucent form stalked past the car his face expectant and troubled at the same time as though he was forcing himself on towards some longdesired longdenied consummation that both excited and terrified him his pace quickened until he was almost running his arms flailing at his sides until at last he came to one particular door and stopped there breathing hard the badly handpainted sign above the door said simply silicon heaven frank smiled for the first time at the sight of it and it was not a very nice smile it was the smile of a man who wanted something men are not supposed to want not supposed to be able to want this was more than need or lust or desire this was obsession he raised a trembling hand to knock and the door silently opened itself before him the doors of hell are never bolted or barred to those who belong there frank hurried inside the door closed behind him and our glimpse into time past came to an end i busied myself putting the torn pieces of photo away so i wouldnt have to see the disappointment and betrayal of trust in lizas face dead boy turned around in his seat to look at us calmly munching on a chocolate digestive he didnt care about where we were or what we were doing here he was just along for the ride apparently when youre dead you only have so much emotion in you and he doesnt like to waste it he would go along with whatever i decided but this wasnt my decision it was lizas we dont have to do this i said as gently as i could we can still turn the car around and go back after coming all this way to find frank said liza why would i want to leave when all the answers are in there waiting for me i need to know about frank and i need to know what happened to my memories we should leave i said because frank has come to a really bad place trust me there are no good answers to be found in silicon heaven liza looked from me to dead boy and back again she could see something in our faces something we knew and didnt want to say typically she became angry rather than concerned she wasnt scared and she wasnt put off she wanted to know what is this place this silicon heaven what goes on behind that door you know dont you liza i said this isnt easy it doesnt matter she said firmly resolutely if franks in there im going in after him she wrestled with the door handle but it wouldnt turn no matter how much strength she used no ones going anywhere just yet dead boy said calmly we are all staying right here until john has worked out a plan of action this is not your world liza barclay you dont know the rules how things work in situations like this hes right liza i said this is a nasty business even for the nightside with its own special dangers for the body and the soul but look at it said liza gesturing at silicon heaven with its boardedup window and its stained paintpeeling door its a mess this whole street would need an extreme make over before it could be upgraded enough to be condemned and this shop or whatever it is looks like its been deserted and left empty for months probably nobody home but the rats protective camouflage i said when she finally ran out of breath remember the baby that wasnt a baby silicon heaven set up business here because only a location like this would tolerate a trade like theirs but even so it doesnt want to draw unwelcome attention to itself there are a lot of people who object to the very existence of a place like silicon heaven for all kinds of ethical religious and scientific reasons we like to say anything goes in the nightside but even we draw the line at some things if only on aesthetic grounds silicon heaven has serious enemies and would probably be under attack right now by a mob with flaming torches if they werent afraid to come here are you afraid said liza fixing me with her cold determined eyes i try very hard not to be i said evenly its bad for the reputation but i have learned to be cautious liza looked at dead boy i suppose youre going to say youre never afraid being dead theres nothing here that bothers me said dead boy but there are things i fear being dead isnt the worst thing that can happen to you you really do get off on being enigmatic dont you said liza dead boy laughed you must allow the dead their little pleasures talking of fates worse than death i said and liza immediately turned back to look at me you have to brace yourself if were going in there just by coming to an establishment like this frank is telling us things about himself and theyre things youre not going to want to hear but you have to know if were going in there after him tell me said liza i can take it tell me everything silicon heaven i said carefully exists to cater to people with extreme desires for men and women for whom the ordinary pleasures of the flesh arent enough and im not talking about the usual fetishes or obsessions you can find all of that in the nightside and more in silicon heaven science and the unnatural go hand in hand like lovers producing new forms of sexuality new objects of desire theyre here to provide extreme and unforgivable outlets for love and lust and everything in between this is the place where people go to have sex with computers liza looked at me for a long moment she wanted to laugh but she could see the seriousness in my face hear it in my voice telling her that there was nothing laughable about silicon i leaven sex with computers she said numbly i dont believe it how is that even possible this is the nightside said dead boy we do ten impossible things before breakfast just for a cheap thrill abandon all taboos ye who enter here i wont believe it until i see it said liza and there was enough in her voice beyond mere stubbornness that i gave the nod to dead boy we were going to have to go all the way with this and hope there were still some pieces left to pick up afterwards dead boy spoke nicely to his car and the doors swung open we stepped out onto rotten row and the ambience hit us like a closed fist the night air was hot and sweaty almost feverish and it smelled of spilled blood and sparking static bluewhite moonlight gave the street a cold alien look defiantly hostile and unsafe i could feel the pressure of unseen watching eyes cold and calculating and casually cruel and over all a constant feeling that we didnt belong here that we had no business being here that we were getting into things we could never hope to understand or appreciate but i have made a business and a very good living out of going places where i wasnt wanted and finding out things no one wanted me to know i turned slowly around letting the whole street get a good look at me my hardearned reputation was normally enough to keep the flies off but you never knew what desperate acts a man might be driven to in a street like rotten row the futuristic cars doors all closed by themselves and there was the quiet but definite sound of many locks closing liza looked back at the car frowning uncertainly is it safe to just leave it here on its own dont worry said dead boy patting the bonnet fondly my sweetie can look after herself even as they were speaking a slim gun barrel emerged abruptly from the side of the car and fired a brief but devastating bolt of energy at something moving not quite furtively enough in the shadows there was an explosion flames and a very brief scream various shadowy people whod started to emerge into the street and display a certain covetous interest in the futuristic car had a sudden attack of good sense and disappeared back into the shadows dead boy sniggered loudly my car has extensive selfdefence systems a total lack of scruples about using them and a really quite appalling sense of humour she kept one wouldbe thief locked in the boot for three weeks hed probably still be there if i hadnt noticed the flies in his own way he was trying to distract liza and make her laugh but she only had eyes for silicon heaven so i took the lead and strolled over to the door as though i had every right to be there liza and dead boy immediately fell in beside me not wanting to be left out of anything up close the door didnt look like much just an everyday oldfashioned wooden door with the paint peeling off it in long strips but this was rotten row where ordinary and everyday were just lies to hide behind i sneered at the tacky brass doorknob sniffed loudly at the entirely tasteless brass door knocker and didnt even try to touch the door itself i didnt want the people inside thinking i could be taken out of the game that easily i thrust both hands deep into my coat pockets and surreptitiously ran my fingertips over certain useful items that might come in handy for a little light breaking and entering a private investigator needs to know many useful skills in the end i decided to err on the side of caution and gave dead boy the nod to start things off on the grounds that since he was dead whatever happened next wouldnt affect him as much as the rest of us he grinned widely and drew back a gray fist and the door swung slowly open all by itself i gestured quickly for dead boy to hold back a door opening by itself is rarely a good sign at the very least it means youre being watched and that the people inside dont think they have anything to fear from you entering or it could just be one big bluff the nightside runs on the gentle art of putting one over on the rubes are we expecting trouble said liza as i stood still considering the open door always dead boy said cheerfully its only the threat of danger and sudden destruction that makes me feel alive then by all means you go in first and soak up the punishment i said generously right said dead boy brightening immediately he kicked the door wide open and stalked forward into the impenetrable darkness beyond his voice drifted back to us come on give me your best shot you bastards i can take it liza looked at me is he always like this pretty much i said this is why most people wont work with him personally ive always found him very useful for hiding behind when the bullets start flying shall we go liza looked at the open doorway and the darkness beyond her face completely free of any expression i dont want to do this john i just know something really bad will happen in there but i need to know the truth i need to remember what ive forgotten whether i want to or not she stepped determinedly forward her small hands clenched into fists at her sides and i moved quickly to follow her through the doorway my shoulder brushed against hers and i could feel the tension in her rockhard muscles i thought it was something simple fear or anticipation i should have known better the darkness disappeared the moment the door closed behind us and a bright almost painful glare illuminated the room wed walked into solid steel walls surrounded us a good forty foot a side and even the floor and the ceiling were made from the same brightly gleaming metal our own distorted images stared back at us from the shining walls dead boy stood in the middle of the room glaring pugnaciously around him ready to hit anything that moved or even looked at him funny but we were the only ones there there was no obvious way out and when i looked back even the door wed come through had disappeared i dont understand said liza this room is a hell of a lot bigger than the shop front suggested in the nightside the interior of a building is often much bigger than its exterior i said its the only way we can fit everything in there was no obvious source for the sharp stark light that filled the steel room the air was dry and lifeless and the only sounds were the ones we made ourselves i moved over to the nearest wall and studied it carefully without touching it up close the metal was covered with faint tracings endless lines in endless intricate patterns like paintedon circuitry the patterns moved slowly changing subtly under the pressure of my gaze twisting and turning as they transformed themselves into whole new permutations as though the wall was thinking or dreaming i gestured for dead boy and liza to join me and pointed out the patterns dead boy just shrugged liza looked at me does this mean something to you not as such i said could be some future form of hieroglyphics could be some form of adaptive circuitry but its definitely not from around here this is future tech machine code from a future time line there are rumours that silicon heaven is really just one big machine holding everything within and weve just walked right into it said dead boy great anyone got a can opener he leaned in close to study the wall tracings and prodded them with a long pale finger bluegray lines leapt from the wall onto his finger and swarmed all over it dead boy automatically pulled his finger back and the circuitry lines stretched away from the wall clinging to his dead flesh with stubborn strength they crawled all over his hand and shot up his arm growing and multiplying all the time twisting and curling and leaping into the air dead boy grabbed a big handful of the stuff wrenched it away and then popped it into his mouth dead boy has always been one for the direct approach he chewed thoughtfully evaluating the flavour the bluegray lines slipped back down his arm and leapt back onto the wall becoming still and inert again interesting said dead boy chewing and swallowing could use a little salt though i offered him some but he laughed and declined liza made a sudden pained noise and her knees started to buckle i grabbed her by one arm to steady her but i dont think she even knew i was there her face was pale and sweaty and her mouth was trembling her eyes werent tracking her gaze was fixed on something only she could see she looked like shed just seen her own death up close and bloody i held her up gripping both her arms firmly and said her name loudly right into her face her eyes snapped back into focus and she got her feet back under her again i let go of her arms but she just stood where she was looking at me miserably something bad is going to happen she said in a small hopeless voice something really bad a dozen robots rose silently up out of the metal floor almost seeming to form themselves out of the gleaming steel more robots stepped out of the four walls and dropped down from the ceiling it seemed silicon heaven had a security force after all the robots surrounded us on every side silent and implacable blocky mechanical constructs with only the most basic humanoid form liza shrank back against me dead boy and i moved quickly to put her between us for a long moment the robots stood utterly still as though taking the measure of us or perhaps checking our appearance against their records they were roughly human in shape but there was nothing of human aesthetics about them they were purely functional created to serve a purpose and nothing more bits and pieces put together with no covering their every working open to the eye there were crystals and ceramics and other things moving around inside them while strange lights came and went sharpedged components stuck out all over them along with all kinds of weapons everything from sharp blades and circular saws to energy weapons and blunt grasping hands they had no faces no eyes but all of them were orientated on the three of us they knew where we were many things about them made no sense at all to human eyes and human perspectives because human science had no part in their making they all moved forward at the same moment suddenly and without warning metal feet hammering on the metal floor they did not move in a human way their arms and legs bending and stretching in unnatural ways their centres of gravity seeming to slip back and forth as needed they reached for us with their blocky hands all kinds of sharp things sticking out of their fingers buzz saws rose out of bulking chests spinning at impossible speeds energy weapons sparked and glowed humming loudly as they powered up the robots came for us they would kill us if they could without rage or passion or even satisfaction blunt instruments of silicon heavens will ive always prided myself on my ability to talk my way out of most unpleasant situations but they werent going to listen dead boy stepped forward grabbed the nearest robot with brisk directness picked it up and threw it at the next nearest robot they both had to have weighed hundreds of pounds but that was nothing to the strength in dead boys unliving muscles the sheer impact slammed both robots to the steel floor denting it perceptibly the sound almost unbearably loud but though both robots fell in a heap they untangled themselves almost immediately and rose to their feet again undamaged dead boy punched a robot in what should have been its head and the whole assembly broke off and flew away the robot kept coming anyway another robot grabbed dead boys shoulder from behind with its crude steel hand the fingers closing like a mantrap the purple greatcoat stretched and tore but dead boy felt no pain he tried to pull free and snarled when he found he couldnt he had to wrench himself free with brute strength ruining his coat and while he was distracted by that another robot punched him in the back of the head im sure i heard bone crack and break it was a blow that would have killed any ordinary man but dead boy had left ordinary behind long ago the blow still sent him staggering forward off balance and straight into the arms of another robot the uneven arms slammed closed around him immediately forcing the breath out of his lungs with brutal strength but dead boy only breathes when he needs to talk he broke the hold easily and yanked one of the robots arms right out of its socket he used the arm as a club happily hammering the robot about the head and shoulders smashing pieces off and damaging others but even as bits of the robot flew through the air it kept coming and dead boy had to back away before it and while he was concentrating on one robot the others closed in around him they swarmed all over him clinging to his arms beating at his head and shoulders trying to drag him down he struggled valiantly throwing away one robot after another with dreadful force but they always came back he was inhumanly strong but there were just so many of them he disappeared inside a crowd of robots steel fists rising and falling like jackhammers over and over again driving dead boy to his knees and then they cut at him with their steel blades and whirring buzz saws and vicious hands while the majority of robots were dealing with dead boy the remainder closed in on me and liza shed frozen her face utterly empty her body twitching and shaking i gently but firmly pushed her behind me out of the way our backs were to the nearest wall but not too close i was thinking furiously trying to find a way out of this most of my useful items were magical in nature rather than scientific and while i knew quite a few nasty little tricks to use against the living and the dead and those unfortunate few stuck in between i didnt have a damned thing of any use against robots certainly throwing pepper into their faces wasnt going to work i dont carry a gun i dont usually need them i backed up as far as i dared herding liza behind me and fired up my gift my inner eye snapped open and immediately my sight found just the right places for me to stand and where and when to dodge so that the robots couldnt touch me their blocky hands reached for me again and again but i was never there already somewhere else one step ahead of them except the more they closed in the less room there was for me to move in i managed to be in the right place to trip a few and send them crashing into one another but all i was doing was buying time i knew what was happening to dead boy but there wasnt a damned thing i could do one robot aimed an energy weapon at me i waited till the very last moment and then sidestepped and the energy beam seared past me to take out the robot on my other side it exploded messily bits and pieces flying across the room they ricocheted off the other robots harmlessly but one piece of shrapnel passed close enough to clip off a lock of my hair liza didnt react at all the robots had discovered they couldnt hurt dead boy so they decided to pull him apart they grabbed him by the arms and legs stretched him helpless in midair between them and did their best to tear him limb from limb he struggled and cursed them vilely but in the end they were powerful machines and he was just a dead man liza darted suddenly forward from behind me grabbed up the robot arm that dead boy had torn off and used it like a club against the nearest robot she swung the arm with both hands using all her strength her eyes wide and staring lips drawn back in an animal snarl she wasnt strong enough to damage the robot but i admired her spirit we werent in her world anymore but she was still doing her best to fight back but she still couldnt hope to win and neither could dead boy so as usual it was down to me i concentrated forcing my inner eye all the way open till i could see the world so clearly it hurt i scanned the robots with my augmented vision struggling to understand through the pain and it didnt take me long to find the robots basic weakness they had no actual intelligence of their own they were all receiving their orders from the same source through the same mechanism i moved swiftly among the robots dancing in their blind spots yanking the mechanisms out one after another and one by one the robots froze in place cut off from their central command helpless without orders they stood around the metal room like so many modern art sculptures and i sat down suddenly and struggled to get my breathing back under control while my third eye my inner eye slowly and thankfully eased shut i have a gift for finding things but its never easy dead boy pulled and wriggled his way free from the robots holding him looked in outrage at what theyd done to his purple greatcoat and kicked some of the robots about for a bit just to ease his feelings liza looked about her wildly still clutching her robot arm like a club i got up from the floor and said her name a few times and she finally looked at me personality and sanity easing slowly back into her face she looked at what she was holding and dropped it to the floor with a moue of distaste i went over to her but she didnt want to be comforted a voice spoke to us out of midair a calm cultured voice with a certain amount of resignation in it all right enough is enough we didnt think the security bots would be enough to stop the famous john taylor and the infamous dead boy or should that be the other way round but we owed it to our patrons to try you might have been having an off day it happens and the bots were nearing the end of their warranty anyway youd better come on through and well talk about this i said liza barclay would come back to haunt us if we just let her go but of course no one ever listens to me ive been here before said liza you dont remember i said quietly no said liza ive never seen this place before but she didnt sound as certain as she once had i remembered her earlier premonition just before the robots appeared when shed known something bad was about to happen perhaps shed known because something like it had happened the last time she was here unless she was remembering something else even worse still to come a door appeared in the far wall where i would have sworn there was no trace of a door just a moment before a section of the metal just slid suddenly sideways disappearing into the rest of the wall leaving a brightly lit opening i started towards it and once again dead boy and liza fell in beside me youd almost have thought i knew what i was doing we threaded our way through the motionless robots and i held myself ready in case they came alive again but they just stood there in their stiff awkward poses utterly inhuman even in defeat dead boy pulled faces at them liza wouldnt even look at the robots all her attention focused on the open door and the answers it promised her we passed through the narrow opening into a long steel corridor comfortably wide and tall the steel so brightly polished it was like walking through an endless hall of mirrors it occurred to me that none of our reflections looked particularly impressive or dangerous dead boy had lost his great floppy hat in his struggle with the robots and his marvellous purple greatcoat was torn and tattered some of the stitches on his bare chest had broken open revealing pinkgray meat under the torn gray skin i keep telling him to use staples liza looked scared but determined her face so pale and taut there was hardly any colour in it she was close to getting her answers now but i think even then she knew this wasnt going to end well and i i looked like someone who should have known better than to come to a place like rotten row and expect any good to come of it the corridor finally took a sharp turn to the left and ushered us into a large antechamber more steel walls still no furnishings or comforts but finally a human face a tall slender man in the traditional white lab coat was waiting for us he had a bland forgettable face and a wide welcoming smile that meant nothing at all slick i thought immediately thats the word for this man nothing would ever touch him and nothing would ever stick to him hed make sure of that he strode briskly towards us one hand stretched out to shake still smiling as though he could do it all day the smile didnt reach his eyes they were cold certain the look of a man utterly convinced he knew important things that you didnt fanatics eyes believers eyes such men are always dangerous he dropped his hand when he realised none of us had any intention of shaking it but he didnt seem especially upset he was still smiling hi he said brightly im barry kopek i speak for silicon heaven id say its good to see you but i wouldnt want to start our relationship with such an obvious lie so lets get right down to business shall we and then we can all get back to our own lives again wont that be nice he tried offering us his hand again and then pulled it back with a resigned shrug as though he was used to it and if he was the official greeter for silicon heaven he probably was even a ghoul in a graveyard would look down on a computer pimp like him come with me he said and many things will be made clear all your questions will be answered or at least all the ones youre capable of understanding no offence no offence but things are rather advanced around here tomorrow has come early for the nightside and soon therell be a wakeup call for everyone slogans are such an important part for any new business dont you agree sorry about the robots but we have so many enemies among the ignorant and our work here is far too important to allow outside agitators to interfere with it your work i said arranging dates for computers for people with a fetish for really heavy metal is important work he looked like he wanted to wince at my crudity but was far too professional the smile never wavered for a moment we are not a part of the sex industry mister taylor perish the thought everyone who finds their way here becomes part of the great work we are always happy to greet new people given the extreme turnover in participants but they all understand they do really they do this is the greatest work of our time and we are all honoured to be a part of it come with me and youll see only do keep mrs barclay under control please she did enough damage the last time she was here dead boy and i both looked at liza but she had nothing to say her gaze was fixed on the official greeter staring at him like she could burn holes through him she wanted answers and he was just slowing her down all right i said lead the way show us this great work delighted said barry kopek i was really starting to get tired of that smile he led us through more metal corridors turning this way and that with complete confidence even though there were never any signs or directions on the blank steel walls he kept up an amiable chatter talking smoothly and happily about nothing in particular the light from nowhere became increasingly stark almost unbearably bright there was a sound in the distance like the slow beating of a giant heart so slow you could count the moments between each great beat but they all had something of time and eternity in them and there was a smell faint at first but gradually growing stronger of static and machine oil ozone and lubricants burning meat and rank fresh sweat you said lizas been here before i said finally after it became clear that kopek wasnt going to raise the subject again himself oh yes he said carefully looking at me rather than at liza mrs barclay was here yesterday and we let her in because of course we have nothing to hide were all very proud of the work we do here what work said dead boy and something in his voice made kopek miss a step yes well to put it very simply in laymans terms we are breaking down the barriers between natural and artificial life if youre so proud and this work so very great why did you send those cyborged taxis to attack us i said in what i thought was really a quite reasonable tone of voice kopeks smile wavered for the first time he knew me and my reputation ah yes he said that i said that was a mistake you must understand they were some of our first crude attempts at melding man with machine those men paid a lot of money for it to be done to them so they could operate more efficiently and more profitably in nightside traffic we were very short of funds at the beginning when they found out you were coming here mister taylor well frankly they panicked you see they relied on us to keep them functioning who told them i was coming i said though im pretty sure i already know the answer i said it was a mistake said barry kopek are they all yes i said he nodded glumly still smiling but you could tell his heart wasnt in it im not surprised your reputation precedes you mister taylor like an attack dog on a really long leash its a shame though they only wanted to better themselves by having their humanity cut away said dead boy just a bit dangerously they gave up so little to gain so much said kopek just a bit haughtily i would have thought you of all people would appreciate you dont know me said dead boy you dont know anything about me and no one gets away with attacking my car being dead hasnt mellowed you at all has it said kopek is frank here i said frank barclay well of course hes here said kopek its not like were holding him prisoner against his will he came to us pursuing his dreams and we were only too happy to accommodate him he is here where he wanted to be doing what hes always wanted to do happy at last he was happy with me said liza he loves me he married me a man wants what he wants and needs what he needs said kopek looking at her directly for the first time and mister barclays needs brought him to us can we see him talk to him i said of course thats where im taking you now but you must promise me youll keep mrs barclay under control she reacted very badly to seeing her husband last time shes seen him here before i said well yes said kopek looking from me to liza and back again clearly puzzled i escorted her to him myself didnt she tell you no liza said quietly though exactly what she was saying no to i wasnt entirely sure she was all drawn up in herself now looking straight ahead her gaze fixed almost disassociated the corridor finally ended in a flat featureless wall in which another door appeared kopek led us through and we all stopped dead to look around impressed and overwhelmed despite ourselves by the sheer size of the glassandcrystal auditorium spread out before us it takes a lot to impress a native of the nightside but the sheer scope and scale of the place wed been brought to took even my breath away bigger than any enclosed space had a right to be with walls like frozen waterfalls of gleaming crystal set so far apart the details were just distant blurs under tinted glass ceilings so high above us clouds drifted between us and them like some vast cathedral dedicated to science the auditorium was so enormous it had generated its own weather systems kopeks smile was openly triumphant now as he gestured grandly with outstretched arms lady and gentlemen welcome to silicon heaven he led the way forward between massive machines that had shape and form but no clear meaning or significance so complex so advanced as to be incomprehensible to merely human eyes there were components that moved and revolved and became other things even as i watched strange lights that burned in unfamiliar colours and noises that were almost or beyond voices things the size of buildings walked in circles and intricate mechanisms came together in complex interactions like a living thing assembling itself gleaming metal spheres the size of sheepdogs rolled back and forth across the crystal floor sprouting tools and equipment as needed to service the needs of larger machines dead boy kicked at one of the spheres in an experimental way but it dodged him easily kopek led the way and we all followed close behind this wasnt a place you wanted to get lost in it felt like walking through the belly of leviathan or like flies crawling across the stainedglass window of some unnatural cathedral so of course i strolled along with my hands in my coat pockets like id seen it all before and hadnt been impressed then never let them think theyve got the advantage or theyll walk all over you dead boy seemed genuinely uninterested in any of it but then he died and brought himself back to life and thats a hard act to follow liza didnt seem to see any of it she had a hole in her mind a gap in her memories and all she cared about was finding out what had happened the last time she was here did she care at all about husband frank anymore or was she remembering just enough to sense that her quest wasnt for him and never had been but only to find the truth about him and her and this place there was a definite sense of purpose to everything happening around us even if i couldnt quite grasp it but i was pretty sure there was nothing human in that purpose nothing here gave a damn about anything so small as humanity i was here before liza said slowly theres something bad up ahead something awful i looked sharply at kopek is that right barry is there something dangerous up ahead that you havent been meaning to tell us about theres nothing awful here he said huffily youre here to see something wonderful and finally we came facetoface with what wed come so far to see a single beam of light stabbed down shimmering and scintillating like a spotlight from heaven as though god himself was taking an interest the illumination picked out one particular machine surrounded by ranks and ranks of robots they were dancing around the machine in wide interlocking circles their every movement impossibly smooth and graceful and utterly inhuman they moved to music only they could hear perhaps to music only they could hope to understand but there was nothing of human emotion or sensibility in their dance it could have been a dance of reverence or triumph or elation or something only a robot could know or feel the robots danced and the sound of their metal feet slamming on the crystal floor was almost unbearably ugly kopek led us carefully through the ranks of robots and at once they began to sing in high chiming voices like a choir of metal birds in perfect harmonies and cadences that bordered on melody without ever actually achieving it like machines pretending to be human doing things that people do without ever understanding why people do them we passed through the last of the robots and finally there was frank beloved husband of liza having sex with a computer the computer was the size of a house covered with all kinds of monitor screens and readouts but no obvious controls with great pieces constantly turning and sliding across each other it was made of metal and crystal and other things i didnt even recognise at the foot of it was an extended hollow section like a large upright coffin and suspended within this hollow was frank barclay hanging in a slowly pulsing web of tubes and wires and cables naked ecstatic transported liza made a low painful sound as though shed been hit franks groin was hidden behind a cluster of machine parts always moving sliding over and around him like a swarm of metallic bees clambering over themselves in their eagerness to get to him like metal maggots in a selfinflicted wound thick translucent tubes had been plugged into his abdomen and strange liquids surged in and out of him up and down his naked body parts of him had been dissected away to show bones and organs being slowly replaced by new mechanical equivalents there was no bleeding no trauma one thigh bone had been revealed from top to bottom one end bone and the other metal and already it was impossible to tell where the one began and the other ended metal rods plunged in and out of franks flesh sliding back and forth never stopping lights blinked on and off inside him briefly rendering parts of his skin transparent and in that skin i could see as many wires as blood vessels the computer was heaving and groaning in rhythm to the things going in and out of franks naked body and the machines steel exterior was flushed and beaded with sweat it made orgasmic sounds franks face was drawn shrunken the skin stretched taut across the bone but his eyes were bright and happy and his smile held a terrible pleasure cables penetrated his skin and metal parts penetrated his body and he loved it one cable had buried itself in his left eye socket replacing the eyeball digging its way in a fraction of an inch at a time frank didnt care he shuddered and convulsed as things slid in and out of him changing him forever and he loved every last bit of it liza stood before him tears rolling silently and unheeded down her devastated face i turned to barry kopek is he dying yes and no said kopek hes becoming something else something wonderful we are making him over transforming him into a living component capable of being host to machine consciousness a living and an unliving body for an artificial intelligence from a future time line it came to the nightside through a timeslip fleeing powerful enemies it wants to experience sin and in particular the hot and sweaty sensations of the flesh it wants to know what we humans know and take for granted all the many joys of sex together frank and the computer are teaching each other whole new forms of pleasure he is teaching the machine all the colours of emotion and sensuality and the very subtle joys of degradation in return the machine is teaching him whole new areas of perception and conception man becomes machine becomes more than machine becomes immortal living computer a metal messiah for a new age kopeks face was full of vision now a zealot in his cause why should men be limited to being just men and machines just machines human and inhuman shall combine together to become something far superior to either but like all new life it begins with sex how many others have there been said dead boy before frank one hundred and seventeen said kopek but frank is different he doesnt just believe he wants this oh yeah said dead boy looks like hes coming his brains out liza collapsed her knees slamming painfully onto the crystal floor her face was twisted ugly filled with a horrid knowledge as all her repressed memories came flooding back at once she pounded on the floor with her fist again and again and again no no no no i remember i remember it all i came here following frank following my husband into the nightside and through its awful streets all the way here because i thought he was cheating on me i thought he had a lover here he hadnt touched me in months i thought he was having an affair but i never suspected this never thought he wanted this she talked her way in yesterday said kopek determined to see her husband but when we brought her here and showed her she went berserk attacked the computer did some little damage before the robots drove her off we wouldnt let her hurt frank or herself and after a while she left and she blocked out the memories herself i said because they were unbearable how could you liza screamed at frank how could you want this it doesnt love you it cant love you frank stirred for the first time his one remaining eye slowly turning to look down at her his face showed no emotion no compassion for the woman hed loved and married not so long ago when he spoke his voice already contained a faint machine buzz this is what i want what ive always wanted what i need and what you could never give me ive dreamed of this for years of flesh and metal coming together moving together thought it was just a fetish never told anyone knew they could never understand until someone told me about the nightside the one place in the world where anything is possible and i knew i had to come here this is the place where dreams come true including all the bad ones murmured dead boy what about us frank said liza tears streaming down her face what about us said frank you selfish piece of shit suddenly she was back on her feet again heading for frank with her hands stretched out like claws moving so fast even the robots couldnt react fast enough to stop her she jumped up and into the coffin punched her fist into a hole in franks side and thrust her hand deep inside him his whole body convulsed the machines going crazy and then liza laughed triumphantly as she jerked her hand back out again she dropped back down onto the crystal floor brandishing her prize in all our faces blood dripped thickly from the dark red muscle in her hand i grabbed her arms from behind as she shouted hysterically at her husband you see frank i have your heart i have your cheating heart keep it said frank growing still and content again in the metal arms of his lover i dont need it anymore and already the machines were moving over him mopping up the blood and sealing off his wound working to replace the heart with something more efficient while the computer heaved and groaned and sweated frank sighed and smiled it was too much for liza she sank to her knees again sobbing violently her hand opened and the crushed heart muscle fell to the crystal floor smearing it with blood she laughed as she cried the horrid sound of a woman losing her mind retreating deep inside herself because reality had become too awful to bear i gave her something to breathe in from my coat pocket and in a moment she was asleep i eased her down until she was lying full length on the floor her face was empty as a dolls i dont get it said dead boy honestly puzzled its just sex ive seen worse not for her i said she loved him and he loved this to be betrayed and abandoned by a husband for another woman or even a man is one thing but for a machine a thing a computer that meant more to him than all her love that could do things for him that she never could because for him simple human flesh wasnt enough he threw aside their love and their marriage and all their life together to have sex with a computer can you do anything for her said dead boy weve got to do something john we cant leave her like this you always were a sentimental sort i said i know a few things im pretty sure i can find a way to put her back the way she was when she came to us and this time make sure the memories stay repressed no memory at all of the nightside or silicon heaven ill take her back into london proper wake her up and leave her there shell never find her way back in on her own and in time shell get over the mysterious loss of her husband and move on its the kindest thing to do and the metal messiah said dead boy curling his colourless lip at frank in the computer we just turn our back on it why not i said theres never been any shortage of gods and monsters in the nightside whats one more wouldbe messiah i doubt this one will do any better than the others in the end hes just a tech fetishist and its just a mucky machine with ideas above its station everything to do with sex and nothing at all to do with love you can find absolutely anything in the nightside and every sinner finds their own level of hell or heaven the third death of the little clay dog by kat richardson team seattle and the denver mob trouble radiated from the black figurine like some kind of dark neon at the devils own fairground not that i could actually see any such thing even in the grey but an electric prickling sensation zipped up my arms and down my spine when i touched it and that was close enough i know human hair cant literally stand on end like a dogs but i would have sworn mine was trying to nanette grover was still standing at the side of her desk looking at me and the little statue her fanatically neat office flickered silver smudged with red and orange and sad shades of green she would never seethe emotional and energetic leftovers of her clients still hanging in the grey like smoke a ghost or two lingered in the corners with sour accusing faces and the odor of misery muttering their cycles of frustration they werent interested in me so i ignored them and put my attention back on nan she was impeccable as always her straightened javabrown hair was smoothed into a perfect french twist her stylish tweed skirt suit was unwrinkled even after shed been behind her desk since five am and her smooth dark skin was highlighted by delicate makeup that didnt show a single crease even her energy corona was cool and constrained to a narrow bright line except when she stepped onto the stage of the courtroom floor where it alternated between hypnotic pall and legal scalpel in spite of her beauty she had all the warmth of a copper pipe in the snow which was part of her appeal as a litigator but not as a human being one of her opponents in court had referred to her as the queen of nubia and it wasnt hard imagining nan on a war elephant chasing off alexander the greateven her allies found her intimidating well she asked the word leaving amber ripples in the air well what i responded shrugging off the commanding effect of her voice youre supposed to accept or reject the conditions what happens if i say no her energy closed back down to an icy line then i have instructions regarding the disposition of the item what are those none of your business yes or no harper what was it the client wants done with this again nan sat down on the other side of the desk the mistiness of the settling grey giving her a deceptively soft appearance and blinked once long and slowlike some kind of resetand explained again with no heat or change of inflection from the first time a colleague of mine in mexico city forwarded this item to me upon the death of his client his client marialuz arbildo left you a bequest in her will with conditions namely to personally handcarry the statuettethis little dog figurineto oaxaca city in oaxaca state in mexico and place it on the grave of hector purecete on the night of november first and attend the grave as local tradition dictates until daybreak of november second additional specific instructions for the preparation of the grave will be provided all this to be done in the first occurrence of november first following his clients death ms arbildo died earlier this month the twentieth of october i added a week ago nan nodded november first is the day after halloween doesnt that seem strange to you i asked nans icesmooth expression didnt change no and i never met this woman never heard of her but she sends this thing all the way to seattle so i can take it all the way back to mexicothe far end of mexico i might add still not sounding kind of weird i dont question the conditions of clients is this sort of thing even legal perfectly if it flew in the face of public interest then it would be illegal but this does not the conditions also do not require you to do anything illegal either here or there nor to violate your professional ethics nor take on unreasonable expenseseverything will be paid for by ms arbildos estate if you choose to follow the conditions of ms arbildos bequest you will receive the thirty thousand dollars once the conditions have been completely and correctly met sum to be paid through this office i was raised in los angeles county california so im not totally ignorant of mexican culturejust mostly i knew the first of november was the mexican equivalent of halloween but i didnt know the details my experience as a greywalker however makes me wary of any date on which the dead are said to go abroad among the living i know that ghostsand plenty of other creepy thingsare around us all the time its just that most people dont see them i do more than just see them i live with them and ive discovered that days associated with the dead are usually worse than most people imaginetheyre veritable carnivales of the incorporeal boiling pools of magical potential so being asked to take a folk sculpture to a mexican graveyard on the day of the dead sounded like a dangerous idea to me especially when the client is deceased on the other hand i can at least see whats going on as someone who lives half in and half out of the realm of ghosts monsters and magic i stand a chance against whatever strange thing may rear its head in such a situation and the money was attractive the work i regularly did for nan investigating witnesses and filling in the details of her cases prior to trial paid the majority of my bills but it wasnt an extravagant living even with all the rest of my work added in thirty thousand dollars was a major chunk of what i usually made in a year and it would only take about four days i looked back down at the statuette it was a hollow clay figure of a dog about a foot tall and longgive or takeand about four inches wide the shape was simplified not realistic with stumpy legs and tail a coneshaped muzzle and a couple of pinched clay points for ears it had been painted with a gritty black paint and decorated with dots and lines of red and white that made rings around the limbs and a lightning bolt on the dogs side it also had two white dots for eyes but no sign of a mouth peering at it i could see the little clay dog had been cracked and repaired at some point the casting hole in its belly covered up with an extra bit of clay and painted over with more of the black paint a hint of grey energy gleamed around the repair seam but beyond that i couldnt tell anything about what might be inside the dog the statue itself had only a thin sheen of grey clinging to its surface like old dirt as if whatever magical thing it came from had withered long ago there wasnt any indicative cloud of color or angry sparks around it as id seen with other magical objects yet i was sure there was something more to it than met the eye i looked back up at nan who hadnt moved so much as an eyebrow the silence in her office would have unnerved some people but i found it pleasant in contrast to the incessant mutter and hum of the living grey and its ghosts what about the lawyer i asked what about him is he legit nan didnt crack either a smile or a frown yes his name is guillermo banda he does a lot of maritime and international work i admit i had some reservations but i was also a little intrigued by the mystery of itim a sucker for mysteriesand the money was pretty good so i shrugged and said all right ill take the thing to mexico nan waved to the small shipping carton from which shed originally removed the dog at the start of our conversation you can put it back in its box while i get the papers ready ill need your signature on a receipt to prove that you picked it up and i have a copy of the instructions for you as well i nodded and wiggled the little clay dog back into the snowstorm of paper shred that had sprung from the box when nan had opened it we finished up quickly and i left with the papers in my pocket and the box full of probable trouble under my arm the aluminum and glass tower that houses nans office has lousy cell reception so i had to wait until i was just outside the lobby doors to make a call king county medical examiners office may i help you id like to speak to reuben fishkiller please i replied i was put on hold for a few moments while someone located the forensic lab technician for me id met him during an investigation into the deaths of homeless people in pioneer square and fishs connections to the local salish indians had certainly come in handy but hed been a bit upset when one of his ancestral legends tried to kill us and i hoped he wasnt still too freaked out to talk to me this is fish what can i do for you hi fish its harper blaine he paused oh hi harper you uh need something i do if youre willing to do it for me does it have anything to do with monsters in the sewer this time or salish holy ground because i really didnt enjoy the last time no monsters no salish no sewers i promise i just need an xray we only xray the dead this thing is inanimate is that close enough what is it he asked i could almost see him narrowing his eyes with suspicion its a clay statue of a dog youre sure its inanimate things act weird around you i promise its just a hollow lump of baked clay totally incapable of movement or pretty much anything else i just want to know if theres anything inside it fish sighed okay i can take a look but itll have to be quick get here at lunchtime and ill see what i can do i agreed to come while most of the staff was occupied with food and thanked fish before hanging up it would be just my luck to spark off an international incident and get arrested for drug smuggling if the dog had anything significant in its hollow innards i hoped fish and his xray machine would tell me if there was anything to fear the easymoney aspect of the situation bothered me i dont believe in harmless eccentric benefactors there was a sting of some kind in the little dogs tailor bellyand i wanted to figure it out before i got hit by it i killed some time at the library before heading down to pill hill where the major hospitals cluster like concrete trees fish met me at the front desk of the morgue and we walked back through the chilly chambers in the basement of harborview to the xray room his shaggy dark hair with premature streaks of white hanging over his square face still reminded me of a badger but a more wary and grumpy badger than hed been before hed become a bit nervous since our runin with living myths as if he too could now see the steambillow shapes of the dead that wandered through the old hospital or sense the tingling power that thrummed in the neonbright lines of magical power that shot through the grey what have you got he asked as we pushed through the door to the xray machine and other lab paraphernalia i put the white cardboard box down on the machines table and carefully removed the little dog statue he started to reach for it then stopped youum its ok to touch it without gloves isnt it i think so ive been handling it barehanded all morning i had supposed id know if there was anything toxic on the figures surface but there really wasnt any way that i would i looked at the small black dog as i clutched it by its middle and hoped it wasnt dusted with anthrax or the like fish paused to pull on a pair of purple gloves before he took the figurine from me then he scraped a bit of the black paint into a glass tube and repeated the scraping on the bottom of the dogs foot where the mellow orange clay was bare of glaze or paint the sheen of grey on the sculptures surface rippled and squirmed as he scraped but it didnt flare or change coloreither of which would have been bad signs he added some chemicals to the tubes and put them aside in a large white machine ill run a couple of tests on those while were at it he said he poked some buttons on the machine then he turned back to the xray table now lets look at this little guy altogether fish took three views of the dog since the morgue had updated to digital xray we didnt have to wait for the pictures to be developed but just viewed them on the computer screen behind the radiation barrier there was indeed something inside the clay dog whats that i asked pointing to a bundle of faint lines that showed on every picture it was in a different spot each time something loose in the hollow interior lets crank up the resolution fish poked a few keys and the image of the bundle got larger and more clear looks like hair or threads knotted together whatever it is theres not much of it fish observed i could pull it out and examine it if you didnt mind reopening that hole in the dogs belly one condition of the bequest was that the dog statue be put on the grave intact by me and only me i didnt think it would qualify as intact if part of its secret bundle were missing not to mention the plug of clay in the figures belly and i didnt have much time to sit around in seattle it was already october twentyeighth the trip was going to be a long one even by air and i didnt know where in oaxaca city hector purecete was buried i wasnt fool enough to think there was only one cemetery in town so id have to do some investigating in oaxaca before i could complete the conditions of the bequest as nan insisted on calling them i dont think it should be removed unless you suppose its something illegal i said frowning at the picture that small nah not likely to be anything drugrelated or human remains unless its hair like i said in which case it probably got in there while the dog was being painted its too fine to be plant matter and theres not enough of it to be worth much if its any other fiber its not dense enough to be metal strands either without actually seeing it with my own eyes and running tests my best guess is still human hair then he shrugged and added or a few strands of some really longhaired animals fur or tail maybe horse tail noises in the hallway and a sudden agitation among the ghosts indicated the postlunch return of fishs coworkers we packed up the figurine and fish led me back out promising to call when he had the result of the tests on the clay and paint i headed back to my office to clear off my schedule and check on the flights nan had promised to book for me on behalf of the estate only nans work had any specific deadlines on it so it wasnt difficult to rearrange my meetings and appointmentsi dont make that many anyhow the biggest hurdle was finding someone to look alter my pet ferret while i was gone and that was taken care of by tracking down quinton and depositing the tube rat with him i suspect chaos prefers him over me since he will happily carry her around with him all day in one deep pocket or another while i usually have to leave her at home anyhow she didnt look grieved to see me go even if quinton did we sat in the glass picnic shelter beside ivars acres of clams on the waterfront and talked while we ate our fish and chips chaos helped us with the chips and ignored the gulls screaming outside even in the lateoctober chill for their tithe of greasy fast food ivar haglund may have loved those damned birds but to me they were a nuisance worse than persistent spooks ghosts dont poop on you oaxaca quinton questioned why some nonsense with a bequest theres a set of instructions sorry conditionsthat have to be fulfilled like in one of those movies where you have to stay in the haunted house overnight or change your name to gaggleplox he asked those usually dont work out wellmost of the cast ends up dead or the inheritance turns out to be a stash of counterfeit bills i made a face thats in the movies this is just a job find the right grave put the dog on it and wait for daybreak and in between is when all hell could break loose which seems pretty likely considering your talents its possible i conceded but the money is pretty attractive and i dont get a sense of danger from the statuejust trouble he snorted just trouble and why did this woman pick you did you know her i shook my head and pinched off a bit of fried potato for the ferret no i didnt know her and i dont know why she picked me for this job i assume she somehow knew what i can do but how she knew thats the big mystery and why i agreed to go maybe theres some clue to be found about why this happened to me and not to every person whos ever had a neardeath experience there must be someone who knows more about all of this than i do or the danzigers do or every vampire from here to vancouver seems to i felt a flush on my face that didnt come from the space heater overhead and realized i was getting angry not at quinton but at the shifty fate that had yanked the rug out from under me when id died only long enough to have my life wrenched into a shape beyond my control but if it was this arbildo woman shes already dead quinton said then ill hunt her down in the grey at least my change of life had come with useful skills i was still figuring them out more than a year later but i no longer hated and resented them my flight was set for that evening with a fivehour layover in dallas before i could fly on to mexico city and from there to oaxaca but even with the delay id still have a few hours once i got to oaxaca city to find the records office and start looking for the grave of hector purecete i finished up my food and gave chaos a final scratch around the ears quinton got a lot more than an ear scratch which annoyed the ferret judging by the way she kept pushing herself in between us and snagging our kisses for herself jealous little furball the trip was smooth right up to mexico city where they broke the dog the customs agent was going through my bag when it happened there was the box with the little clay dog inside he held it up is this a gift he demanded in a crabby tired voice id have guessed he was near the end of his shift if it wasnt quite noon but maybe he was aware in his own way of the cranky dispirited overexcited motion of the grey as much as i was the customs area was aroil in the flashes and clouds of hundreds of passengers emotional energy giving shape and color to the loose power of the magical grid it chafed and roared and twisted through the space around us like angry lions in a toosmall cage the sound of the grey was a strong steady hum with a sharp edge like barbed wire under silk that sharpness was probably why my response was inappropriately flippant no its a dog i said one really shouldnt joke with security people of any kind while they are on the job most have had to leave their sense of humor in their locker with their civilian clothes he raised his eyebrow and opened the box rooting inside with his bluegloved handevery employee at airport security looks like theyre about to play doctor in some very unpleasant way these days he snorted in surprise and jerked his hand out with the figurine not quite gripped in his sweatsticky glove youd have thought the little dog had bitten him from the way he moved his hand yanked back jerking upward a little as the statuette cleared the edge of the box the black object moved up popping out of his loose grip and arced into the air ripping a slice of glove with one pointed ear as it went it was like slowmotion film watching it rise from safety and crash to the hard linoleum beneath our feet as it hit the floor it flashed a panicbolt of silver white into the grey the little clay dog shattered a tiny bundle of dark fibers bouncing onto the floor amid the terracotta shards with a silvery gasp the flash rushed back toward the broken figurine and coalesced into the ghost of a dog the ghost dog looked around then looked at me and whined piteously it was a rangy mongrel beast with the shape of a stunted greyhound and the coat of a shaggy pony it sidled up to me and leaned against my legs and i felt its cold grey shape press against me with its memory of weight the customs agent looked at the smashed figurine and bent to pick the tiny knot from the wreckage eh he mumbled what is this i shrugged hair i guessed he looked at it rubbed it between his fingers sniffed it then he motioned to one of his coworkers who walked over and rubbed a small cloth swab over the little bundle he put the swab into a machine while the first man moved me and my bags to another table deeper inside the security zone someone else swept up the bits of clay and put them in a plastic bag the dog stuck to me like a shy toddler nada said the man with the machine este es pelo they put a little of the clay dust from the broken figurine into the machine but that also yielded nada the customs agent looked sad as he finished inspecting my bag and closed it up handing it and the bag of shards back to me with what almost looked like a contrite bow and an apology for breaking my dog de nada i replied then i asked for the knot of fluff back which he thought was odd but he dug into the trash and retrieved it for me anyhow i dropped it into the bag of broken ceramicit wasnt intact anymore but better to keep it all together just in case i thought he handed me a claim form to fill out if the dog had been insured and i took it even though i doubted the figurine was valuable i was sure it was the ghost that was the important thing the spirits of mexico hummed and roared the ghost dog pasted itself to my heels and shadowed me around the halls of the mexico city airport as i tried to find a place to put down my bags and make a phone call of course the place i found was a bar i threw myself and my bags down and ordered a beer while i called nan on my cell phone seattle being close to the other border id had international calling added to my service long ago sometimes i wondered how id managed without a cell phone so long other times i wished i still had my pager it took a few minutes to get connected to nan hello harper hello nan mexican customs broke the dog is it reparable no but i have a major part of it i added looking at the cowering ghost at my ankles where are you mexico city airport banda is located there he may have instructions for that contingency she gave me his number i wrote it on my cocktail napkin as is traditional in that sort of situation if i call this guy i may miss my connection to oaxaca i warned her im already running tight because of the mess at customs ill have cathy reschedule you to a later flight and call you back with the information is there anything else no ill let cathy know if anything is still out of whack when she calls good stay in touch and she was off the phone as fast as that i finished my negra modelo and called the number on the napkin i felt itchy from annoyance and lack of sleepi dont get more than a fitful doze on planes since my long legs end up cramped and headrests are never in the right place for me i always longed to upgrade to first class but the pi business usually comes with a touristclass budget guillermo banda answered his own phone he spoke english like a new yorker as soon as he heard how bad my spanish was miss blaine youre here this is excellent how is the perrito the little dog customs broke it fuck pardon me my client would be very upset to hear it if she werent dead which is why im here at all talking to this guy was like talking to lou costello and i was afraid i might start laughing i do have part of the dog and i could take that up to oaxaca if you think that would be in the spirit intended i dont know there were noises in the background and he muttered away from the receiver something about puerto vallarta which was rejoined by a feminine giggle i tried to keep him on track well if you could tell me what it was your client had in mind with this condition im sure we can figure out a way to satisfy the spirit if not the letter of her request that i also dont know miss arbildo wasnt very forthcoming how long had she been your client mr banda oh years years and years but we never spoke she came in to update her will last year and before that wed only seen each other twice i inherited her account from my partner who died a few years back in a plane crash horrible did your firm do any work for her aside from the will well the specifics are confidential but yes we did a little background investigative work for her and for her fathermostly routine checks we managed her estateher fathers estateand of course wed been doing work for his company for many years we work primarily with international and maritime law and his company was involved in quite a bit of international shipping handling miss arbildos will and so on was more in line of a courtesy i see do you have any idea what her relationship was to hector purecete the guy on whose grave the dog was supposed to be put none at all damn i wish i knew what she expected this is kind of a pain in the butt you dont have any idea what her intentions were in the will instruction no like i said the woman was very strange i sighed maybe if i could see the will itself we could figure this out may i come to your office oh no he said youd never get here and back before your flight ive already called nan to change it no no you dont understandthe traffic heres what ill do ill bring it to you at the airport if you have time ill make the time i told him where i was and that he should bring as much of the paperwork as he bad he said it would take him an hour to get to the bar and i said that was fine after all i was still waiting for nans secretary to call me back i was thinking about ordering food when the phone went off showing me nans office number on the id it was cathy with my flight change and some additional information nans booked you into a guesthouse in oaxaca cityits one shes used before the owner speaks english and can help you with the records search if you need it thanks i only hope ill get there before the offices close i think youre going to have to rearrange your schedule the earliest flight i could get you was five fifty im sorry but the provincial offices should be open friday terrific my two days for research was now down to one id have to hope i got what i wanted the first time or could work up some local contacts very fast ill make it work i said then continued umm i talked to banda nan said he was reputable but he seems a little skittish is there anything i should know about him about guillermo i dont know much except that hes the biggest new york yankees fan in mexico and im not even sure thats unusual baseball yup baseball is big in mexico city a few years ago he had season tickets and flew up to watch the gamesi swear thats why he took his international courses at columbia so he could go to yankees gameshe even tried to take nan out to one but shes not a sports fan dont get him started on any conversation about baseball or youll miss your plane i said my goodbyes and started thinking while i waited for banda it was after one oclock already id have to get lunch at the airport and see what i could do by phone id miss the open hours in person today at whatever government office might have the burial records and id only have friday to do records searches before the holiday weekend hitif they didnt close early or not open at all id have to get to that office first thing on the thirtieth if i was going to stand much chance of finding the right grave i only hoped that whatever i could turn up about hector purecete in that time would help me get information from marialuz arbildo if she showed up at his grave definitely no time for whos on first discussions with guillermo banda that afternooni hoped he didnt look as much like lou costello as he sounded or i might lose it fish called me before i could get anything done with directory assistance saying there was not much to report on the scrapings hed taken from the clay dog except that the black paint was colored with crushed charcoal and volcanic sand with just a touch of human blood not your average pottery glaze no sign of dread diseases or drug residue no unusual clay substrate just plain terracotta i mentioned that the dog had broken and dropped the bundle of hair out so it is hair he asked it looks like it my spanish is lousy but i heard the inspector call it pelowhich i recognize from my shampoo bottle as the spanish word for hair i replied gazing into the plastic bag of shards five or six strands here dark brown and black with a red thread holding them together two different kinds of hair two different colors but they have the same look and texture interesting i wonder if the dna matches the blood in the paint id love to take a look at it when you get backif youre game i dont know if ill be able to bring it back it might have to stay here i added glancing down again at the phantom hound once the knot of hair had come free so had the dog and i wasnt sure if it was the hair or the sculpture that had held the spirit in the clay shell but i wanted to know more before i let any of the parts out of my hands the ghost dog leaned against me and seemed to doze i envied it the beer had made me feel more tired than ever resigned i stuffed the bag of pottery bits into my purse and went back to fruitless phone calls for the next hour outside of mexico city directory assistance most of the people i talked to had no better english than i had spanishand my spanish was embarrassingly poor the dog stirred and i could feel its low growl as it pressed against my leg a man of medium height with short black hair stopped beside me and looked me over as i tried to make myself clearwithout much successto a clerk in a provincial office somewhere in oaxaca the man carried a leather briefcase he wore a gray suit had a bland oval face made interesting only by a boxers crooked nose and bassethound eyes he smelled of laundry starch the aura around him jittered and jumped in flickers of vibrant orange and blue as his eyes moved over everything evaluating cataloging he seemed to have a hotsauce stain on his tie but it could have been part of the pattern his eyes flicked down toward my feet and he blinked but i wasnt sure if he saw the ghost dog or if he just didnt like my boots he turned his restless gaze back to me waited until i hung up in frustration and said you gotta be harper blaine he didnt look at all like lou costello not even a hispanic version he didnt look like an international law practitioner with an advanced degree from columbia either he looked like a guy who worked in an office eight to five like an insurance adjuster or a midlevel manager in a very expensive suit you must be guillermo banda i replied willy you can call me willy he hoisted himself onto the bar stool next to mine keeping his feet away as if i might kick him without warning considering my exboyfriend was named will that particular first name didnt sound like a good idea id rather not i said and wondered if he could see the ghost doghe seemed a little wound up he shrugged im sorry if i offended you miss blaine he put the briefcase on the bar and snapped it open it held a single manila folder and a businesssize envelope banda picked up the folder these are the last three versions of miss arbildos will i dont have to show them to you but since a will in probate is a public record here just as it is in the us you could get most of this information by searching the district probate records i cut him off mr banda im not offended with you and im not trying to put your back up im just at a loss to understand this i dont know why i was named in your clients willive never met her or heard of her i just want to understand what im doing i dont want to be stuck with some creepy mystery for the rest of my life i did not look at the dog but i could feel it still rumbling and pressing to me the conditions say im to put the dog on the grave intact what am i supposed to do now that the statue is broken he put the folder down in the case and picked up the envelope offering it to me thats easy you take the money and run im sure miss arbildo wont even know she inherited a truckload thirty thousand us is a drop in the bucket i was sure she would mind very much i shook my head and didnt touch the envelope i cant do that maybe if i knew why she wanted the dog put on purecetes grave i could agree but i dont what is with the dog banda laugheda tired laugh but genuinely amused its a tradition a really old one you dont see it around here much anymoreup in the mountains around michoacan and yunuen maybe in oaxaca but even there its dying out its from the aztecs they used to sacrifice a dog and burn the body on the funeral pyres because they believed the dog could lead the spirit of the dead to mictlan now we just use a statue see the mexican land of the dead is kind of like dantes geography of hellits got rings only nicer in the middle is mictlanwhere the dead live just like we do and from which they can someday be reborn but its a long way for a soul to go and theres a river you have to cross as well so you need a guide the dog because tradition says dogs can always find the way home every year the dead come back to visit us during el dia de los muertos the really traditional people put a statue of a dog on the ofrendathe offerings on the family altarso their dead relatives dont get lost coming and going ok i get the dog but why me why would your client want a perfect stranger from two thousand miles away to take the dog to purecetes grave banda shrugged again and dropped the envelope back into the briefcase glancing down i dont know before you ask i dont know who purecete was or what his connection was to miss arbildo either you want to see the will for yourself he asked looking back up at me i nodded he pulled a draft copy of the will from the folder and handed the long pages to me he pointed as he talked sec how she left her money to all these charities that was pretty much unchanged from the first version i ever sawone jimenez my partner drew up for her you can tell she was kind of an oddball when you look at the list he pulled out another version of the document in an earlier draft of this will shed designated jimenezs grave as the recipient of the dog as you can see she did it right after he died and she was very upset with him then she changed her mindout of the blueand named purecete just a few months ago she marched into the office and she handed me this he fished a creased scrap of paper out of the file it was the hard white of a cheap notepad torn along one side to make a ragged square from a longer piece of paper the handwriting was similar to the signature on the will but more crabbed and wandering harper blaine seattle wash usa the letters were cramped up against the left edge but became more expansive and arched as they moved to the right as if she hadnt thought shed have enough space when she started and tried to stretch the words out to fill the page as she finished each line it looked odd she just held it out to me and said this is the one and i knew better than to argue with marialuz so i wrote you in he offered me the collection of drafts take a look you can see she had pretty definiteif crazyideas about her money the woman was kind of loopy i glanced at the will again making mental notes of the recipients of her bequests they were mostly church charities for the unfortunate the homeless the poor the dispossessed there were a few odd animal charities as well such as support for retired racing greyhounds a rabbit shelter llama farms and cure for retired circus elephants none of them had conditions and there were no individuals named other than me and purecete didnt she have any family or friends employees even i asked banda laughed and pretended he was coughing miss arbildo no she was the last of a literally dying breedthe arbildo family died with her and as i said she was pretty strange and she wandered around a lot didnt settle down much after a certain age didnt make a lot of friends she was kind of fond of jimenez oncelike i said she put him in the will at one pointbut about the time he died she was furious with him she stormed into the office screaming about it why did he do it why why i almost thought that she would have dragged him back out of his grave and killed him if she could what was she so mad about well his dying on her she worked jimenez pretty hard he used to say if he died suddenly it would be her fault his death shook her up she was irrational you know how some people get mad instead of grieving i nodded i was familiar with that phenomenon arbildo sounded like a difficult client and i could understand not wanting to argue withor consoleone like her but there was something incredibly strange about both the wills and banda himself i just couldnt pin down what was bugging me as i pondered the problem under cover of checking the wills the ghostly dog at my feet began whimpering and moving restively then it got up and walked a few feet away from the bar toward a column of thick mist that was forming in the grey between the bar and the doorway i adjusted my position on the bar stool so i could watch the dog and still seem to be reading the documents the dog stopped near the smoky mass then looked back at me with that pleading look dogs have it looked at the illdefined shape whimpered then glanced back to me the form that interested the dog was vaguely human in size and shape but it had no features there was no face and after a few moments the dog turned and trotted back to me whimpering and scratching at my legs with its cold incorporeal paws the specter drifted out the door i didnt know what it was or where it was going but the dog seemed to be urging me to follow itor at least humor the dogs desire to do so banda would still be in mexico city in a day or an hour but whatever the ghost dog was after might not last another five minutes i wanted to ask him more about arbildo but i excused myself from banda and said id be right back let him assume i needed the washroom if he liked i stood up and the dog darted out of the bar and into the main concourse i hoped my luggage would be all right with the lawyer for the time it would take to chase the dog and it was fine since the dog only got a few feet farther into the concourse before the shape seemed to fall apart and drift into the clutter of thousands of passengers energy coronas moving through the silvery space of the air terminal a few shapes had no living person within them but most of those were simple repeating ghosts or fogs of happenstance and emotion left over from some altogether human interaction the shadowy dog trotted back to me and pushed against my legs again banda was looking impatiently at his watch when i returned to the bar i cant stay longer have some clients to meet in twenty minutes and the traffic is getting bad i have to go he took a card from his inner jacket pocket and offered it to me if you have any more questions call me my cell phone number is on here good luck miss blaine he added picking up his briefcase and heading for the door hey i called arent there any other documents and what am i supposed to do about the dog any other documents in miss arbildos file are none of your business miss blaine as to the dog the check is right hereyou could just turn right around with it in your hand and call this thing done as far as im concerned but if you feel you have to take the broken bits up to oaxaca and leave em stick em back together with superglue if you want what about the grave where is it damned if i know he called back pick one he waved and ducked out before i could ask him anything more it appeared that guillermo banda just wanted shut of marieluz arbildo and her nutty will and i was as convenient a way as any i followed him a few paces out the door saw him duck past the customs area waving to the guards on the other side as he went pastold friends something odd was going on with banda but i wasnt entirely sure what i did pause to wonder if the breaking of the dog was entirely an accident i shook off that thought and went back to my seat the grey dog scampering along in my wake i ordered some food and ate in a hurry before heading to the mexicana airlines desk to pick up my new boarding passes and check my luggage for the flight to oaxaca the phantom dog stuck to my side the whole time casting glances around the room and sniffing for signsof what i didnt know for just a moment as i boarded the little prop plane i wondered what to do with the dog before i remembered that no one hill me would even be aware of it it huddled under my feet the whole hour we were in the air and again on the ride from the airport which reminded me of the regional airports id grown up near in los angeles county with their pushcart stairs and windblown tarmac a white van was standing at the curb outside offering rides to downtown oaxaca city and the ghost dog and i shared the vehicle with a family of six and two couples who all seemed excited beyond my ability the van driver dropped each group off leaving me at a tall spanish colonial building on the edge of the downtown core as far as i could tell the whole area was late spanish colonial though at that elevation darkness had already fallen and it was hard to see details beyond the streetlamps the road was layered thickly with silvery ghosts and loops of memory playing like old movies in a twodollar theater i saw a discreet sign on the buttercupcolored plaster wall that indicated the carved wooden door before me led to my guesthouse i pulled the bell handle as instructed and was greeted with a flood of light and the odors of spicy cooking as the door was opened wide soy harper blaine i started oh miss blaine si come in you were bumped to a later flight the darkhaired woman in the doorway asked snatching my bag indoors with one hand as she waved me in with the other we have dinner for you if you like it she turned her head and called for miguelito who proved to be a teenager as tall as a professional basketball player and as dramatically emo as a cure album cover you are in manos de leon she continued to me while pointing at my suitcase without shifting her gaze from my face my nephew will take your bag you can wash and come back down to the sala for some food i was almost dizzy with exhaustion by then but i know better than to argue with whirlwind women i followed little miguel up the tiled stairs and around an open gallery to a door with a painting of a magenta coxcomb flower on it miguelito unlocked the door for me and put the suitcase just inside before handing me my key and slouching off with an insouciant nod i glanced down over the railing before i went into the room in the courtyard below i could see people gathered around a ceramic firepit that gleamed with heat serving themselves from a nearby table laden with food the cool mountain air settled gently from above through the open center of the buildings roof drifting down to meet the swirl of sparks and heat that rose from the gathering below i was so tired i didnt make it back down that night i woke up in the morning on october thirtieth with one boot on and one off and the ghost dog running in and out through the closed door whining someone was tapping on my door groggily i stumbled to it and opened up miguelthenotsosmall was slouching thereclad in black jeans black tshirt and black boots with his naturally dark hair hanging over his eyesprobably hoping i hadnt heard his timid tapping and he could lope off to whatever hed rather do than wait on me the energy around him was a duncolored cloud shot with red lightning bolts of annoyanceor something shorttempered and pissywhile thin gold lines trailed off his fingertips in a way id never seen before in the face of his determined gloom i smiled at him with perverse malice in spite of being still half asleep buenos dias miguel i chirpedfairytale princesses had nothing on me for chipper yeah yeah good morning to you too his accent was still pretty strong but his english was clear and abrasive i could almost see the expletive deleted from that sentence still hanging in the air in all its f bomb glory tia mercedes said im supposed to show you around the city cause you have some kind of business thing yup busyness busy busy gotta find a grave he frowned at me grave he asked as if i surely didnt know what id just said yup i have a mission to do something with a grave and i dont know where it is today no on sunday november first oh was that disappointment dia de los muertos yeah is today special or something i asked as he started to turn away yeah theres like a whole series of days of the dead todos santosnovember firstis just the big one the tourists are all crazy for todays like the day for the spirits that died by violence tia mercedes doesnt celebrate that in the housewe have to go outside so the mad ghosts dont come in and mess stuff up he shrugged and started to turn away having lost all interest in me now that i was no more interesting than the average tourist i grabbed his arm hey where ygoing miguel he huffed his hair out of his face and glared at me call me mickey not mike no like duuuuh i thought facetiously was i this snotty as a teenager mickey mouse fan then mickey mantle he snorted and pulled his arm out of my grasp tia mercedes has breakfast downstairs in twenty minutes then we can go look for your grave ok i didnt miss the implication of whose grave but i did ignore it ok be right down thank your aunt for me he skulked away as i retreated into my room i took a very fast shower and threw on clean clothes id been given a room with its own bath which i suspected was an unusual luxury in an antique house and there was no denying the buildingsome wealthy mans town home originally id have betwas exactly as old as its style indicated it didnt mimic spanish colonial it was spanish colonial downstairs the food was endless and lush eggs scrambled with corn tortillas green salsa and cheese fried plantains grilled tomatoes bread and sweet pastries only distantly related to the greasy churros found in american malls coffee chocolate and milk were all available as well as horchata and fruit juice my hosts the villaflores family felt that their guests during the holiday should be well fed before they faced a day of hiking up and down the mountainous elevations of oaxaca city and its environs midday meal would be on our own but dinner with the family was open to all mercedes informed meshe was the proprietress id met the previous night i thought id have to find an excuse to dodge it or i stood a good chance of gaining five pounds before november second hiking or no miguelcallmemickey was not so enthusiastic picking at his food and jumping up the moment i was finished telling his aunt we had to leave and get to the palacio de gobiemo that morning or wed never get in before they closed he sloped off to wait for me outside while i thanked mercedes for breakfast she smiled gracias i hope you wont mind miguelito too muchhe is bored here i dont know why he came at allsuch an odd boybut at least he can be some help to you if he doesnt make you scream and leave him in a ditch by the road oh i think well be ok i replied thinking there would be ample opportunities to knock a hole in mickeys attitude if i wanted to angsty teens arent much of a challenge after vampires and vengeful ghosts and monsters in the sewer stepping through the door the sound of the grey really hit me where mexico city had been a strong steady song of steel and silk oaxaca was a wild roar it sounded like the battle of the bands in which someone had forgotten to tell the musicians not to play all at once layers of contrasting melody and meter song and noise flooded the mistworld and made the lines of energy around me spark and throb strata of time and memory seemed to juggle and flow like einsteins river it was tiring just to stand in it mickey lounged against the wall outside smoking a noxioussmelling cigarillo and shifting his fakesleepy gaze around the street like a hoodlum looking for a chump in a blackandwhite film i stood on the doorstep for a minute while he ignored me then i tapped his foot with mine to get his attentionok maybe a little more insistent than a tap but not a fullon kick he jerked upright and muttered a phrase under his breath even i knew was an insult hey i thought you were in a hurry i said he grunted and threw down his smoke grinding it out under his toe with more malice than the horrid thing deserved yeah right a sentence that seemed to mean nothing when he said it he gathered himself after a final glance around and turned his back to me heading out into the street this way i wondered if his shoulders got tired carrying the weight of that chip i was there because of the holiday yet i hadnt thought of some of the implications of its presence beyond the possibility of office closures and an increased presence of the dead once out on the street with mickey it became obvious that el dia de los muertos was a much bigger thing than halloween and there was more to contend with both living and dead than bureaucrats on holiday we walked down the wide graybricked road hemmed in by a mix of adobe and buildings of pale green stone none newer than the late s many painted like the villaflores house in rich shades of red yellow orange or the native pale green the bricked street boiled with ghostly traffic on foot in cars on horseand donkeyback even a group of ancient spanish soldiers marching with pikes pointing at the sky i was startled to note that unlike the ghosts of seattle most of these looked like skeletons in clothing and not like the remembered shapes of live people skulls grinned and empty eye sockets gleamed with only the memory of eyes they were completely aware of us too watching us as we went and seeming amused it was unsettling to be observed through eyeless unblinking sockets and so much more closely than i was used to we scuffed through the legions of phantoms without talking for a while to a huge central plaza miguel paused and pointed into it saying in a bored voice thats our famous zocalo where the federales shot all those teachers a couple of years ago that was in front of the old palacio de gobierno but its a museum now well have to go through the market to get to the new onei hope you dont want to stop and go shopping he added with a sneer he didnt know me very well i rolled my eyes and ignored the jabfor now im not much of a shopper i just need to find this guys grave by november first you know which cemetery nope just have a name and a date of death yeah right well go to the registrar of deaths he said it with such relish i had to stifle a giggle we have to move it though cause theyll close early dia de los muertos is a major holiday its like your christmas only with dead guys the markets crazy full with old ladies like tia mercedes and all their kids doing the shopping for the ofrendas and all that and tourists and you want to get inside before the ghosts of the violently dead return he gave me a sly glance from the corner of his eye to see if id bite but i didnt then wed better get going was all i said we continued down the street to the market with the ghost dog tagging at our heels and the gold threads that dragged from mickeys fingertips spinning out through the crowds of spirits that thronged the streets already crowded with the living he seemed unaware of the vibrant threads spooling from his hands i wished i knew what that shiny energy strand was all about but id have to wait and see we threaded our way through the periphery of the market crowd and cut across the corner of the zocalopartially opened by the ruthless removal of towering trees the memories of which still threw phantom shade over the raised central kiosk where the state band played on tuesdays according to a notice nearby i could see the memory of the original plaza like a projection over the new design with huge thicktrunked trees and victorian iron benches set along the narrower shadier paths and the notsolongago stench of tear gas floating on the warm breeze and an echo of screams shadows of the dead protesters glimmered over the memory of blood on the stones in front of the old government building i could hear the shouts and the shots mingled with the scent of flowers and fresh spiced bread from the market nearby the combination made me queasy no one in their right mind would want to linger there that night we turned from the market the shops and the cafes that lined the sunbaked zocalo and headed down to the government offices a few blocks away we entered the usual bureaucratic maze of oncegrand rooms chopped into offices and cubicles with flimsy movable walls repulsively out of place in the building that predated world war i the man behind the registrars desk however fit in perfectly he had a small mustache with waxed points and wore his shirt collar buttoned up tight under his conservative tie hi i started hoping i could manage to make myself understood in english i need to locate a grave the clerks nostrils pinched in annoyance and he shook his head no habla ingles senora i cast a glance at mickey who was leaning against a wall again he shot me back a snotty look this was going to be fun mickey would you translate for me i asked with a sigh the teenager heaved himself upright and ambled to the desk he made a gesture at the clerk who gave him a look nearly as disdainful as the one mickey had given me la gringa busca un sepulcro he said la gringa well at least i wasnt puta this time the clerk heaved a shrug and spat back something that i imagined was yeah arent they all there was a bit more wiseass chitchat before i put a restraining hand on mickeys arm mickey just translate commentary isnt required he rolled his eyes yeah right then he gave me a blank look what i asked feeling the ghost dog brush past me to lie down on the floor near the door i didnt look down just stared at mickey so what am i supposed to translate maybe i should have kicked him harder ask him if theres a form i need to fill out and what it will cost for him to find the information right now mickey made with the rolling eyes again and looked back to the clerk who was glaring at us even though there was no one else waiting in his cubbyhole mickey seemed to be repeating my request but this time in a slightly singsong highpitched voice the man frowned at him forma para que he says a form for what yeah i figured that part out mickey i need to know if there is a form i am required to fill out in order to find out where a certain person is buried here in oaxaca if so i need that form and i wish to know what fee i have to pay to get that information immediatelywhile i stand here and wait now you think you can be that specific with him mickey he huffed and turned back to the clerk parroting my request in his mocking voice the clerk was annoyed by it too but he grunted an affirmative and handed over a form and said something about pesos he says itll cost a hundred dollars to do it right now no he didnt mickey he said cinco cientos pesos thats about fifty bucks my spanish sucks not my math yeah right and the eye roll i was getting too familiar with the routine already i filled in the form as best i could with mickeys nonhelp and fished a thousand pesos from my wallet i put it down with the form saying apesadumbrado and jerking my head toward mickey even as bad as it is i can manage a few important words in spanish please thank you beer toilet keys and sorry a smile almost cracked the mans wooden face as he accepted the form and the overpayment with an amused snort momentito he said taking the form away behind a screen i sat down on one of his two cracked green vinylcovered chairs to wait he only goes back to the computer mickey groused he just wants to make it look important i shot him a quelling glance but said nothing the phantom dog got up to chase a phantom cat around the room i ignored their antics and so did almost everyone else except a skeletal clerk who tried to give the dog one of his finger bones to dissuade it from barking the dog wasnt having anything to do with the clerks finger and backed away bristling leaving the ghost cat free to dash out of the room to the relative safety of the hall the fleshandblood clerk who looked nothing like his bony predecessor returned with a sheet of paper hmph he coughed then launched into a rattling discourse aimed somewhere in between me and mickey as if he couldnt decide which of us he was supposed to talk tomickey the brat or the illiterate gringa finally the clerk let out an impressively heavy sigh shrugged and shoved the paper forward for one of us to take buenos dias he added turning his back and stomping off to his sanctum in the hack mickey grabbed the sheet and held it out to me after a seconds perusal youre fucked there are three graves for your guy three not for the same date yeah look i took the page and looked it over and there were three grave sites given for hector purecete all with the same death date in thats gotta be wrongits not a common name is it no great i muttered i guess ill have to go look at all of them and see what shakes loose i stood up and walked out of the government offices with mickey and the dog trailing me wed started back across the zocalo passing closer to the site of the teachers fatal protest than i liked when mickey finally decided to talk again what do you want to find this guys grave for anyway mickey asked some kind of creepy ritual or something my turn to sigh no i told you before i just need to find it and leave something on it on november first yeah right i stopped burning in the highaltitude sun and the hot grey energy of the massacre mickey is it just for me or do you always have a bad attitude he turned his head and muttered under his breath starting to walk on i snatched his arm and dragged him back to me through a red blotch of remembered blood and pain he flinched a little and tried to wrench himself out of my grip spitting nasty spanish words damn thats a lot of endearing little nicknames you have for me how bout we make this easier on both of us you can just call me the gp huh the what the gringa puta and ill just call you bratboy itll be so much easier dont you think he glowered at me and pulled against my hold i let him go and sighed mickey look i appreciate the offer of help but your attitude is just not flying with me you can straighten up and stop acting like a punk or i can do without you whats it going to be my ghostly dog companion circled around us growling as if to keep something unpleasant at bay mickey seemed to consider my statement seriously sidling into the sun and away from the crying red energy of the teachers deaths ok gp well have to get to the panteones soon itll be a lot busier tomorrow and you really dont want to be out tonight youre serious about that ghosts of the violent dead thing he nodded you norteamericanos think el dia de los muertos is just a funny traditionnot realbut we dont not up here this is the ghost country were not afraid of deathnot like you we live with it you might be surprised he ignored me but we dont do foolish things like stand where people were murdered on their day to return from mictlan thats just fucking stupid i nodded all right lets get someplace better then like the panteona panteon is a cemetery right yeah its actually pretty safe right now but we should get the car those three arent close to each other i was surprised at his change of attitude he was still kind of surly but at least he seemed to be helping me instead of making more work we walked back to the house and mickey borrowed his aunts cara dusty silver chevy which amused me i took the passenger seat and held the door open for a moment the ghost dog stopped at the cars doorsill and sat on the ground looking pathetic and thumping its stumpy tail but wouldnt step up into the car mickey looked at me something wrong no no im fine i closed the door and the dog vanished from view we drove away without any sign of the phantom canine until we got out at the first panteon on the list the first stop was the municipal cemetery of san miguel we drove around a small carnival that was setting up in a courtyard in front and walked across drifts of flowers and greenery that had escaped from the bundles carried by a stream of people entering the panteon ahead of us the dog trotted up materializing out of the road dust and grey mist to rub against my legs and bump its head against me impatiently until we walked through the cemetery gates the dog ran ahead into the crowd of animate skeletons and live humans who filled the graveyard everyone was busy the living and the dead and i paused to stare there are a lot of people here i said yeah the graves have to be cleaned and decorated the family ofrendas made and the cooking has to be done before todos santos on november first its a sunday this year so they gotta be done today and tomorrowor the church might be offended most of these guys wont bring their feasts until after sundown on sunday i glanced at him with a curious frown feasts in a graveyard he snorted something that was almost a laugh his tone still left a bit to be desired however yeah i keep trying to tell you its like a party el dia de los muertos is a cycleoflife thing we have all this stuff at homethe ofrendas and stuffbut we come to the panteon in the evening to party with the family ghosts we know death but we dont worship it or freak out about it its just part of life we arent afraid of the old bony woman just look at the skeletons mickey added pointing at a pair of children waving paper skeleton puppets at each other in an elaborate pantomime punctuated with much chattering and laughing the puppets had jointed legs and arms controlled with strings the children pulled with their fingers while clutching the sticks to which the paper skeletons were mounted one was a musician with a guitar and a top hat while the other was a girl singer with a fur stole and long skirt the kids pranced ahead with their puppets the ghosts of several other children tagged behind giggling as the impromptu cabaret act headed for the family plot the group was herded along by an aging man carrying an elaborate ironwork cross under his arm and followed by a cold boil of silver and red energythe imminence of those who died by violence perhaps those guys are gonna clean the graves of their family and put that new cross up mickey lectured me he was almost spitting theyre not sadtheyre happy they work hard today they remember the dead cause they know were all gonna die thats the big deal you norteamericanos dont get you cant cheat death you just have to know its there and remember we all got a skeleton inside us the skeletons as i looked around the panteon i saw few ghosts of the type i was most familiar withthe memory manifestations of the dead nearly all the ghosts in this cemetery were skeletal with only the barest hint of faces or flesh a few were purely bones while a smaller handful had the shape of the living people they had once been these were the only ghosts i saw that seemed distressed or confused wandering among the raised graves as if desperate to find something theyd misplaced blind to the throngs of living and dead around them i got it the manifestations of the grey depended upon the minds of those who shaped it here where skeletons were the symbol of the dead embraced even beloved in all their bony glory as just another part of the cycle of life most of the spirits of the dead looked like skeletons in the us where death was the end of life most ghosts manifested with the memoryshape of their formerly living bodies but they could have been anything like the discorporate entities id met once or twice manifesting as changing shapes or inconclusive features on a mutable column of fog or the roiling anger of the slaughtered the ghost dog trotted back from its peregrinations through the crowd and sat at my feet tongue lolling looking happy for the first time since it had appeared i almost reached to pat its head before i remembered that most people dont see ghosts even as comfortable with death as the oaxaquenos were i doubted they would understand my stooping to pet a spectral hound mickey would probably think i was crazy and say so i didnt believe hed suddenly decided to respect me he just didnt want me to kick his ass but he wasnt above a few more needling comments i cleared my throat where do you think well find the grave this is a big place caretaker will have a list of the plots and tombs he was pretty savvy about graveyards but i supposed that wasnt unusual for the gothinclined we pushed through the crowds to a large stone building with colonnades filled with niches on one side and open to a large courtyard on the other the patio of the mausoleum was full of people walking or crawling on the paving stones to lay out pictures in mounds of colored sand cavorting skeletons virgins of guadalupe flowers and crosses and skulls mickey called these sand carpets we found one of the caretakers assisting a sand painter laying out a border of small bricks to keep the moist colored sand from dribbling into the walkways we picked our way closer careful not to disturb the developing sand carpets mickey called out to the caretaker as we got near the woman looked up from her bricks and said something i couldnt follow the caretaker was darkerskinned and had a more pronounced nose and cheekbones than mickeyprobably related to some local indian group mickey replied in a language i knew wasnt spanish the kneeling woman stood and began to talk very fast mickey pointed to the paper wed gotten from the registrar of births and deaths the woman frowned and pointed off across the cemetery making motions with her hands to indicate turns mickey nodded and seemed to be thanking her then turned and tugged me back into the mausoleums colonnade she says its out in the edge near the back fence but she thinks this is wrong the graves been around a long time you sure is right he added with a touch of sneering doubt at my brainpower yup mickey shrugged so hard his eyes rolled all right lets go look at it we set out through the graveyard trailed by the dog distracting myself from mickeys volatility i tried to imagine the scruffy mongrel as a skeleton i didnt succeed to my relief we found the grave under a pile of people who were busily scrubbing the headstone and stone fence clean of dirt with stiffbristled brushes as we watched the inscription came clear hector purecete died not even close mickey grunted and shot me a smug look oh yeah that showed me all right he started to turn back but before he could move away i waved to the oldest woman in the gravecleaning group she peered up at me and i tried to ask her if she knew of marialuzs hector purecete but her english was nonexistent groaning in disgust mickey stepped in after a rapid exchange he held her off with a gesture and glanced back at me his face creased with curiosity this is senora acoa she says this is the only hector purecete she knows about but she says a man came asking the same question a few years back senora acoa couldnt help him either she says hector here was a soldier sounds like a real pendajo shes his like great great greatniece she doesnt live here anymore and is going back to coyoacan tomorrow but she figured they should come and clean up hectors grave every year she didnt even know where he was buried until that guy showed up does she remember the mans name i asked looking at the elderly woman who stood by her ancestors grave mickey translated for me and this time he was dead serious the elderly senora acoa replied in a streak of words i couldnt begin to follow her voice wavering then she swayed putting her hand to her chest the energy around her shut down to a thin white line that grew more and more translucent then began to shift and rise away from her as a messy skein of gold and white light i started to jump between them knowing that the old woman was dying right in front of us overcome by heat and excitement her mortality rising off her corporeal form but mickey kept talking his tone going gentle and cajoling as the gold strands at his fingertips waved and stroked at the old woman calming her down smoothing the rising knot of her soul back into its body easing her back into herself it was an eerie effect coming from such a determined jerk and he didnt know he was doing it finally the old woman plumped herself down on the edge of the grave with a huff of breath and fanned herself with her hands until one of her staring family handed her a paper fan shaped like a grinning skull she cooled herself catching her breath and settling her life back into her oblivious body as my reluctant assistant returned his attention to me nothing in his demeanor showed he knew what had just happened any more than her family did he didnt know hed saved her life or that he seemed to have some kind of power he was just mickey the jerk again she wants to know why you want to know but i told her youre doing a family a favor i think she said the other guys name was jimenez a lawyer maybe shes kinda confused and a little locoshe thought she had seen this jimenez guy just today i gazed at the tired old woman who was still living in spite of everything i blinked slowly getting my thoughts back to the case maybe she did he died a few years ago in a plane crash i said and yes he was a lawyer hadnt banda said he knew nothing about purecete but his partner had been to this grave mickeys eyes flashed wider the word that dropped from his mouth was unknown to me but it was inflected just like cool he had no idea what was really cool here i wondered if senora acoa had actually seen jimenez maybe her proximity to death had made it possiblethis was the day for the violently dead to return and i couldnt imagine a death much more violent than his what else did she have to say i asked trying not to stare too much at the old woman not much she said hector didnt have any kids so theres only her and her family to look after his grave shes worn out but shes afraid her family will forget him after she dies so she makes them come here every year so he doesnt die the third death excuse me whats the third death the lecturing tone was back as he explained the first death is the death of the body the second is when they put us in the ground then we can go to mictlanthe land of the deadand yknow live among the dead but we can come back for the dia de los muertos feast with our families so long as they remember us thats the third deathbeing forgotten thats the real end when we dont come back cause theres no one here for us but we can be reborn once everyone forgets so its not so bad thats the three deaths how do you know all this stuff i asked he shrugged its tradition around here im kind of into the deathmagic thing and my like greatuncle was supposed to be a black sorcerer or something its cool typical goth fascination though i suspected his went a little deeper and from a more personal angle whether he understood that or not to me the lifemagic thing hed just done was a lot cooler we both looked at the family who had returned to sprucing up the grave of hector number one we watched in silence a while then we turned away letting them get on with their task as we headed back to the car with the ghostly dog in tow you said mexicans were not afraid of death i said i didnt want to ask him about what hed done yet that would only get us off our track but i hadnt forgotten it we arent but no one wants to be forgotten thats why we have all these parties in the graveyard we bring the dead all the stuff they loved in life so they can party with us and that way we remember them like they really were not like a body in a casket or some saint its kind of funny youre keeping the third death away but you didnt even know hector pureccte im not sure marialuz did either whos marialuz shes the woman who wanted a dog laid on hector purecetes grave we were nearly back to the cemetery gates deep in the twining boiling mess of the carnival and the confluence of the living and the dead mickey wheeled and stared at me not that dog he asked pointing right at the canine phantom panting at my heels startled i turned and looked for another corporeal dog just in case but there was no animal near enough to be the one he meant i pointed at the ghost this one mickey nodded yeah umm this dogs already dead he peered at it and the ghost dog let its tongue loll out in a huge yawn i could see right through its transparent silvermist skull to the ground below apparently mickey could too because he jumped a little and then looked back to me fuck me where did it come from ill tell you in the car on the way to the next cemetery we climbed back into the chevy and again the dog refused to come in we drove away the dog vanishing into the misty grey as we pulled out of the lot how is it that you can see the dog i asked as he started the car i justi just can he looked a little uncomfortable and hunched his shoulders why are you taking it to this guys grave i told him about the dog statueafter all there was no seal of secrecy or confidentiality on the bequesthow it had come to me and what had befallen it at customs i told him about marialuz arbildos odd last request that the statue containing the dogs spirit was to be placed on the grave for which we were searching on november first weird he said as we wound onto a narrow road why did she wait so long to give him the dog hes been dead since she didnt seem to know where he was buried mickey shook his head weird he repeated hey at least weve narrowed the search to just two graves that jimenez guy must have done the same thing so why didnt he put the dog on hectors grave i shook my head i dont know miss arbildo was still alive then so i assume she wanted to do it but didnt get around to it for some reason but if she had known which grave to put it on wouldnt she have given that information in the will i guessed that jimenez hadnt told her but why not mickey scowled thats messed up but he didnt say any more and we reached the next panteon in silence the dog greeted us at the gate to the cemetery of san antonio and ran ahead barking like a puppy chasing butterflies mickey watched it dash into the bustling crowds in the graveyard and shook his head maybe the dog knows where the grave is he suggested but it runs so fast im not even going to try to follow it i said if the grave is here maybe well find the dog nearby when we get there yeah right the courtyard of panteon san antonio was filled with people building elaborate table displays competition ofrendas mickey explained his sneer wasnt quite as pronounced now each group makes an offering in a traditional style and they compete to see whose is the most authentic or whatever home ofrendas are more plain they usually have more food and personal stuff this is mostly for the tourists he pointed at one table where a pair of men were lashing tall dusty green plants into a sevenfoottall arch attached to the front legs thats sugarcaneits traditional those guys are purepeche indians see the little clay dog thats really old school he stared at me hey was your statue like that one i glanced at the table and saw a small black figurine much like the one id started off with i walked closer and the men stopped work and stared at me one of them said something i couldnt translate he says can i help you mickey supplied ask him about the dog i replied pointing to the small clay figure sitting on the table with a pile of other items waiting for its place where did it come from are all the little dog statues the same mickey asked and translated his reply its from mitathats a village near here its a traditional design may i look at it the man listened to mickey then shrugged and picked up the clay dog he offered it to me with a half smile i smiled back and took the dog turning it over and studying the rough shape and paint it was the same shape but the black glaze was very ordinaryid bet there was no blood or volcanic sand in this ones finish the lines around the legs were the same but there was no lightning bolt on this one the hole in its belly was unpatched open and had a fine lip where the glaze had tried to drip around the rim i handed the dog back to the man who grinned at me showing gapped teeth stained by tobacco and coffee could you ask him if he ever met marialuz or hector purecete both men frowned and shook their heads apparently telling mickey theyd never heard of either we thanked them and headed off to find the caretaker and look for grave number two that statue is almost identical to the one i had that broke i said as we walked away but mine had a white lightning bolt on the side a glyph to keep the spirit inside the dog someone worked magic on it i guessed that but how do you know mickey shrugged like i said magic is kind of interesting mickey seemed to have been studying more than he admitted i decided to fish a bit i was thinking that the bit of hair that fell out was part of the magic too mickey shot a startled glance at me hair there was hair inside the dog yeah a little bundle of five or six strands tied with red thread it looked like human hair not animal tied with red thread inside the dog with the lightning bolt he looked both excited and scared thats witchcraft i frowned at him the only witch i knew was good but mickey was plainly not acquainted with the same sort of witchand like a lot of young morons he seemed to think it was kind of sexy its death magic he explained the darkside stuff i thought you guys werent into that deathworship thing not normal death the cycleoflife stuff deathcult stuff its black magic from the colonial dayshalf native magic half christian mysticism stuff its all about santisima muertemost holy death the reaper of souls death triumphant over man frightened reverence resounded in his tone and set his aura sparking red and gold your marialuz used black magic to hold the dogs spirit inside the statue trust me i know this shit it didnt feel like evil magic when it broke i said he shrugged pretending sudden disinterest he then undermined by saying i wonder why she wanted to put that thing on this guys grave i didnt know but i wanted to if i knew who hector purecete was to arbildo maybe i could figure it out but wed have to find his grave first once again we were directed to a grave and picked our way through the people who were cleaning and decorating throughout the cemetery here the families and friends of the dead were making sandcastle coffins over the graves mounding the wet sand up into caskets and even the archetypal long pentagon some were bordered with cement block or brick to retain the wet sand others were freestanding other groups were just beginning the process of clearing off the weeds and grasses that had invaded the cemetery during the year attacking the plants with hoes and hands and in one case a big knife to get down to raw earth panteon san antonio bore no resemblance to the carefully manicured cemeteries of seattle with their endless lawns or victorian markers this was a place of gritty brown earth punctuated with riots of gold and purple flowers and green foliage the plants and flowers were being arranged into patterns or pictures on the sand coffins or lashed into little huts and ofrendas that would straddle the graves when finished the scent of marigolds was thick and spicy on the air along with the smell of turned earth and green sap once we had cut a path through the crowd we found a short stone obelisk with a list of names carved on it hector purecetes was there but listed as one of a dozen men lost at sea in no grave wrong date wrong hector the grey was thick as oatmeal and the ghost dog gamboled around the base of the stone snapping at the marigold petals floating on the breeze it glanced up at me and seemed to laugh giving me a doggy smile mickey glowered and the energy around him pinwheeled orange sparks that looked just like the flower petals that guy at the registrars office just took the money and gave us a list of all the hector purecete graves he had he groused he didnt even try to get the right one yeah because your attitude was just so endearing i reminded him but i was looking at the dog which was now pawing around the base of the obelisk with incorporeal paws i crouched down to get a look at whatever had caught the dogs attention and saw a loop of blue energy protruding from the ground warily i caught it on my fingers and pulled it up it came like a longrooted weed from a flower bed and popped out of the ground with a small crackle of electricity a skeletal man wearing a yellow fishermans coat appeared where the blue bit of energy had left a hole in the ground i had the impression that he was blinking even though he had no eyelids or eyes to cover with them mickey stared and jerked back half a step but the skeleton man didnt notice he let out a glad exclamation i heard in my head and bent down to ruffle the ghost dogs fur iko look how big you got he wasnt really speaking english but the words seemed to come clearly into my head the dog frisked around and whined in glee taking slobbery licks at the skull in between joyous wiggles is that your dog i asked the skeleton in the slicker glanced at me he was the cooks dog but we all liked him he was just a puppy when the old dulcia went down so was hector purecete the cook hector no hector was a deckhand i suppose he must have saved iko neither of them drowned his names on the memorial i said the skeleton looked at the obelisk and laughed clacking his teeth its wrong martin ramirez got off in bermuda and was replaced by an american named lofland and see there i am but they spelled my name wrong he added pointing to the name ernesto sanchez it should say santara but my writing on the contract was so bad they had to guess no they must have just taken the crew list from senor arbildo and assumed we all died arbildo i asked surprised si he owned the boat so there was a connection but not a clear one what became of hector then the bony shoulders under the slicker shrugged i dont know he must have been picked up by someone he came and looked at the memorial once or twice and used to clean it up for us every year but then he stopped and people began to forget about us most of the crew are gone now since no one comes to remember us i have a sister who is building the ofrenda right now at home i can feel her thinking about me and i can go soon and see all my nieces and nephews he trailed off his empty eye sockets directed just over my shoulder as if he could really see them just there in the field of graves behind me ernesto i said hoping to recapture his attention just a little longer hey did hector have a family was he married had kids eh oh hector no he was our don juanalways charming the ladieshe couldnt make himself get married and settle down he said his family here was all gone he said i dont know we were shipmates and you know how sailors are with stories now he was pulled away drifting into the air like a dandelion puff and wafting toward the cemetery gates goodbye iko he called without looking back be a good dog he vanished into the crowd of living and dead heading for home i supposed i stood up dusting off my knees and butt thinking that the memorial must have been raised before anyone realized hector wasnt dead so it wasnt really wrong just premature i wondered how long hed been lost at sea before hed shown up again in oaxaca mickey was gaping at me but im used to that most people give me strange looks when they catch me talking to ghosts but mickey had seen ernesto also as well as the dog iko how long have you been seeing ghosts i asked he was too shaken to lie me ive always seen them but only during dia de los muertos you too no i see them all the time they arent usually so helpful though he didnt seem very helpful he identified the dog and it seems like a safe bet iko was rescued and raised by purecete but that doesnt really answer how arbildo had the dogs spirit or why she put it in the statue yeah maybe i agreed and started for the car mickey caught my arm hey how come you see ghosts mi madre says its because my birthday is todos santos are you i shook my head slipped his grasp and kept walking for the car i wasnt sure this was a good conversation or that i liked the sudden avid expression in mickeys eyes cmon tell me he yelled please ill tell you in the car this isnt a good place for it i conceded mickey nearly dragged me back to the parking lot flinging open the doors for both of us and sliding behind the wheel clumsily in his frenzy as soon as the doors were closed he turned to me again but i shut him down with a look start the car and drive its getting dark and i want to get inside before its full night but ill tell you as you drive if you dont kill us he ground the car to life and drove like mario andretti to get us out of the parking lot ok i started i died thats why i see ghosts died no way yeah way dont ask why cause i dont know it just is what it is he muttered prayers or curses i didnt know you dont look dead it was only two minutes but it was enough trust me but you didnt just talk to him what were you doing magic no i just pull them out if they want to talk they do sometimes they dont sometimes they try to kill me most of them are useless yeah i see those too they dont really know were here i nodded somehow she must have knownwho knew what marialuz arbildo she never met me but she put me in her will to do this job she must have known about me but i dont know why or how or what she expected me to do i hope i can figure it out before todos santos she must have been a bruja mickey muttered doing black magic and stuff ill bet she scryed you out somehow because of the ghost thing maybe i conceded how would i know umm the santisima muerte magic goes backward yknow right to left and down to up counterclockwise and stuff like that but i never saw the woman do any magic i reminded him i didnt know her bigeyed mickey nodded and drove but i could see his thoughts grinding and the gold strands from his fingertips wrapped the steering wheel like a frantic vine we approached the last grave on the list as the sun was beginning to paint its farewell on the slice of sky above oaxacas mountains wed taken a long drive into the hilly countryside to find the small panteon of san felipe del agua and then trudged through the crowds and the boiling grey to discover an abandoned burial plot far in the back under a stunted tree grass and weeds had grown over it undisturbed for years and no one was making an effort to clear it i heaved a sigh of annoyance and got down on my knees to rip up the corn stalklike growths obscuring the memorial stone mickey knelt down and helped brush the dirt aside scraping the carving clear enough to read in the dimming light this time the list was right hector purecete born died sixtyseven years old mickey sat back on his heels and studied the filthcrusted memorial stone hes been forgotten here marialuz remembered him i said i didnt know with what emotion she recalled hector however or what shed been up to with the dog and its blackmagic spirit bundle id have to take a look and see if the red thread wound counterclockwise around it thats an irony i said looking at the stone and thinking aloud the only person who seems to remember this guy is already dead and has been for years you mean that other ghost ernesto yeah and iko i nodded yeah thats a problem iko seems like a nice dog but who knows what will happenif there really is black magic involved here i was hoping to find hectors family or someone who knew him or marialuz but the registrar will be closed tomorrow and its not likely ill find anyone who knew what their relationship was at this point the ghosts know i rubbed my face breathing in the scent of the broken grasses the turned earth and the spicy odor of the marigolds that had already been placed onto the grave decorations and ofrendas proliferating throughout the burial ground i didnt enjoy interviewing ghosts even when i knew where to find them obstinate limited beingswhen they qualified as beings at allwith axes to grind and personal quirks more annoying and unhelpful than a ward full of recovering heroin addicts yeah but how would i find the right ghosts i asked tired and i admit disappointed this is going to suck purecetes grave wasnt even in oaxaca proper but way out in this little mountain village mickey jumped up beaming in the sudden magenta flare of mountain sunset you can call them here you know how and the ghosts will find you if you make the right offeringsits the day of the dead the living have forgotten this guy but the dead havent i stared at him im not sure im following you the instructions just said to clean the grave and put the dog on it yeah yeah clean the grave but you should do the whole thing decorate make an ofrenda put out food and drink and stuffthrow a party for old hector purecete and the ghosts of his friends will show up for it its not just the living who come visiting the graveyard you know tomorrow is for the angetitosthe little kids we can make an ofrenda and bring it here for them if he ever had any kids or if his family ever had any that havent died the third death theyll come then on sunday we can make the party for the rest of emand hector ill have to hang out with tia mercedes but i can help you first and come back later tias big on this stuff shell understandshell probably even cook extra food for you if we go shopping early enough i tried not to groan at the thought what about the dog i asked he frowned im not sure maybe if you dont bring the clay bits and hair it wont matter even if his ghost comes along the ghost dog had come back from a noseguided tour of the graveyard to sit down beside me and pant through his doggy grin he looked increasingly like a real dog and less like the remnant of one i wondered what hed be like come sunday night i looked around and saw the deepening colors of the sky shadows writhed with the spirits of the violently dead waiting to emerge once darkness fell i shuddered and hoped we wouldnt have to go past the zocalo tonight and its slaughtered teachers lets get out of here i suggested mickey jumped up and we nearly ran back to the car once in it he chattered half in excitement and half in relief of terror trying to persuade me his plan was solid i would never have thought of throwing a party for ghosts mickey waxing enthusiastic over it was downright creepy to watch he dodged silvery clots of horror as we barreled through the falling twilight back in the guesthouse normalcy reigned and most people would have no idea of the gruesome sights and sounds playing out in the night beyond the doors over dinner mickey wheedled his aunt into agreeing to cook extra food for my ghost party he finally let me go at the door of my room with a warning to be up early for our shopping trip i hate shopping especially in the morning the surreal quality of the whole day left me dizzy and grateful to crawl into bed bundled up against the chilly morning we had to shed our coats by the time we were carrying home the third load of the stuff on which mickey had insisted colored paper and strings of paper banners armfuls of flowers incense cones food sweets candles tiny toys papiermache skeletons going about their daily business including one lady called catrina in an elaborate hat and a set of combs and brushes for the dead to tidy themselves with once they arrived for the party if i didnt know better id have thought he was enjoying himself but of course mickey managed to drag me thither and yon with disgusting amounts of energy while still slouching glowering and shooting barbed comments though almost none of them were now directed at me i bought him a sugar skull with his name on it as a birthday present getting a twisted uncertain smile in return iko followed us back and forth barking and running through the stalls playing with skeleton children and chasing skeleton rats the odors of food and flowers and cones of copal incense waiting to be burned mingled with the odor of wet streets and warm bodies color rose in dust devils from the power grid of the grey and spun off mickeys shape like the golden spines of a religious icon i felt lightheaded and found it difficult to tell the grey from the real if not for the hard shapes of skulls and bones where i would normally expect flesh more than once i excused myself to a specter after stepping on it and each time they nodded to me as any living person would mickey stared at me with a strange yearning expression that disappeared under the glower as soon as he noticed my attention i wasnt sure this crazy plan was going to work but it was the best thing either of us had come up with and frankly it was nice to get out of the guesthouse before the smells of food overwhelmed me mercedes villaflores and her daughters had been cooking since before dawn starting with the pan de muerto traditional loaves of bread that smelled of orange and spices and had dough bones crossed on top by the time id gotten up thered already been half a dozen of them set on the patio counter to cool excess seemed to run in the family after our shopping mickey dropped me off at the cemetery in san felipe del agua to clean the grave site promising to come back with the ofrenda supplies later then he dashed back down the hill to join his family for their own work party as i crossed the cemetery gate iko the ghost dog appeared and followed me to hector purecetes plot making scentled loops and discursions across the path as we went the morning was giving way to afternoon and in the thin air at fiftyfive hundred feet the sun warmed the graveyard and set the odors of earth and work flowers and food toward the blue crown of the heavens above iko performed an inspection of the site and gave it his doggy approval as i rolled up my sleeves and began clearing weeds hearing the chatter of others working at family plots or setting up vendor booths in the square and street nearby some musicians started practicing in the distance serenading our labors in fits and starts after a while the ghost dog hied off to hunt ghost rodents leaving me alone with the weeds a while later i paused to wipe the sweat off my face and found an old man in a widebrimmed hat squatting at the edge of my efforts grinning at me i had to look hard through the thickened and colorful grey to be sure he was no ghost for he looked more like a vision than a man but that might have been the elevation and my own sleepdeprived brain talking he held out a clear glass bottle agua i took the bottle gratefully muttering my gracias and sipped the warm water it tasted of deep rock wells i never see a gringa working out here before he said watching me drink never been here before i replied pushing my clinging hair back and returning the bottle to him he put the bottle down digging its bottom into the dirt id softened with my weeding at the edge of the grave you come for this mans angelitos i dont know if he had any did you know him the darktanned old man shook his head no i live here all my life and i never hear of him until they bury him here and no one comes to this grave for a long time until you why a woman named marialuz arbildo died last week and she wanted me to come here and take care of the grave huh but she never come here i never see any woman here before no she didnt know where the grave was i had to find it you ever heard of her he narrowed his eyes and searched the ground for his memory brushing pebbles and bits of weed away from the headstone no antonio arbildo lived here long time ago but he moved away old man then he get rich the whole family go to the df distrito federal mexico city he explained with a nod im a little boy thenso tall he added holding his hand up about two feet from the ground and cackling he shot an amused glance at me from the corner of his yellowed eyes the ghost of iko trotted back from his hunting and threw himself down in the dirt about two feet from the old man with a contented dog sigh the old man made no comment i nodded another interesting connection but not complete are there arbildos buried in this panteon maybe marialuz again he shook his head his gnarled stick fingers digging into the ground to pull a weed not her some a long time ago si not now he pointed to a group of equally abandoned graves nearby there hector purecete had been buried within sight of the arbildos of san felipe yet it seemed marialuz had never found him on her trips to oaxaca but with the two false graves mickey and i had found maybe that wasnt so strange of course the arbildos of san felipe and those of mexico city werent necessarily the same family but i doubted it i nodded to the old man and got up unkinking my workstiff knees and back to go look at the graves of the arbildos the most recent had been buried in when i got back to purecetes grave the old man was gone but his water bottle still stood in the soft earth between the gravestone and ikos napping form sprawled in the dirt i looked around for the man a dozen hats identical to his bobbed in the field of graves but i couldnt spot the old man under one i took another sip of the water and went back to work thinking iko had it good by two oclock id gotten the weeds cleaned up and the plot squared away some helpful live children helped me find stones to replace the missing border around the grave begging in return for mi calavera which confused me until mickey showed up he made a face at them and started digging into one of the boxes of ofrenda decorations they want these he explained dragging out a box of small sugar skulls coffins and lambs wed purchased in the market that morning like your trick or treat but with skulls he handed me the box and snapped at the kids to go away as soon as they had their calavera in their sticky fists need to work here he added to me unfolding a small card table hed snatched from the guesthouse usually the ofrendas at home but yours will have to be here the ghost dog sat up and watched us work we got a few odd looks from the humans too as we put up the decorations but no one came to ask what we were doing mickey helped me bend long slender poles into arches over the table and attach them to the legs then we put colored paper over it all and hung up the paper banners which were decorated with punched silhouettes of skeletons dancing riding bicycles eating and generally carrying on we made patterns on the grave with the marigolds magenta cockscomb flowers and greenery edging it all with white candles in tiny glass jars mickey looked around you should go wash while i put out the foodand bring back water in the big bowl for the spirits to wash in too i shrugged not minding a pause to clean the dirt and sweat off my face and hands while mickey took overhe had managed to avoid the really filthy work of weeding edging and shoring up the grave after all iko dogged me to a standpipe where a few other people were washing up and filling containers with water for flowers or washing the old man was standing near the water spigot and grinned at me as i approached it is going well your ofrenda i think so does it look ok he glanced toward purecetes grave si is very nice for the angelitoswhite is good mickey picked the color really the old guy said raising his eyebrows surely for him red is more likely i turned to glance back at mickey he did have a lot of red in his aura you mean mickey i asked your amigo joven si so very angry he shook his head i stared at the old man what is it about oaxaca is everyone around here tuned in to the freaky frequency i asked his laugh was like sandpaper only you pequena faisan but you are staying to see the angelitos si i answered turning back to the immediate task putting my hands under the cold water that streamed from the pipe and then throwing several handfuls onto my sticky face iko stuck his muzzle into the water and tried to drink it but i wasnt sure any was making it down his ghostly throat no matter how fast his spectral tongue was going maybe its not so bad that mickeys supposed to be home with his family tonight maybe the old man nodded i also must go tonight so i bid you buenas noches dress warmthe night takes the heat away and give your amigo good wishes from tio munoz eh i will gracias i replied filling the washbowl for the spirits of dead children my hands full i nodded again to him and turned to head back to the plot wondering what mickey was up to buena suerte the man said with a chuckle as i started off i turned my head to look back at him over my shoulder and saw him scratch ikos head smiling i guess i wasnt even surprised then he turned and walked away vanishing into the crowd with a golden glitter in his wake i stood a moment staring after him not sure what he was nothing about him seemed ghostly yet in the mess of the active grey of oaxaca i hadnt noticed he had no aura what was he i frowned holding the heavy bowl of water iko pawed at my knee and barked prancing impatiently on the path i shook off my surprise and walked to rejoin mickey while id been gone mickey had laid out a small feast of sweets soda pop and pan de muerto as well as some more substantial foodall provided by his aunt small plastic toys were scattered among the cockscomb flowers that wed piled up around a stack of empty boxes at the back of the table and an arc of small teacups and saucers surrounded a dish for the copal incense a dozen more white candles now stood on the boxes it looked like an album cover for something gothic and creepy nice huh umm yeah these ghosts eat a lot mickey shrugged they eat the spirit of the food my cousins say the food they leave behind has no calories he barked a derisive laugh he pointed to the end of the table put the water comb and towel where the hot bottle is i saw a large vacuum flask where he pointed tia mercedes made hot chocolate you can put it on the ground till you need it he said pour some for the angelitos after you light the candles and the incensethey should come when they smell it and theres a box under the ofrenda with some food and a blanket and stuff for you think you can make it its not as cold as a stakeout during a seattle winter he snorted gonna be empty up here most people do this at home mickey gave me an assessing look that clearly found me a bit wanting i think i can handle it i said yet another shrug as he started gathering up the excess supplies the angelitos come at four and stay until the morning youll have to do it all again tomorrow for the adults too ill pick you up when the sun comes up hey mickey tio munoz says happy birthday he jumped back from me what an old man near the water said i should tell you he sends his good wishes he stared at me tio munoz mierda hes a legend in my family hes a a ghost didnt look like a ghost mickey was shaking his head and gathering the excess stuff in a hurry no no hes the oneyou know i said about my greatuncle whats the word a bad wizard warlock he shook his head no not a brujo hes a black sorcerer undead he threw the last of the materials into a box and snatched it up against his chest eyes wildwhich was not what id have expected im going back to tia mercedes youll be fine yeah yeah i said not sure why he was freaking so thoroughly since his tio munoz wasnt any kind of undead i knew yeah right ok ill be back for you in the morning dont go talking to tio munoz dont believe what he says iko and i followed him with the rest of the boxes and loaded them into the chevy under the weight of mickeys redandorange brooding then we watched him drive away leaving the ghost dog and me in the emptying panteon as the hour of dead children approached the last of the homewardbound walked out of the gatetwo small children in slightly rumpled clothesstrewing a path of marigold petals for the dead i watched them lay the deep orange line down the road until they disappeared around a bend in a mood of strange solemnity i walked back to the grave iko dancing before me all the way the ghost dog seemed more real than ever if still a bit translucent as the long shadow of the mountain began to steal the light that became less apparent but a new oddity began to show around him a blue glow like marshlight that flickered over the dog shape and cast it into strange silhouette against the pockets of twilight forming in the cemetery as night crept forward i unfolded a camp stool from the box and set it aside paused to put on my coat and dug deeper for a box of kitchen matches as the church bell began pealing four i lit the candles and the copal sending the sweet musky scent into the cooling air the breeze stirred the grasses near the fence to rattling smoke and grey mingled sparking with gold and white lights and i could hear the grey humming the shapes of the mountains glowing in the silvery mist as great bulks of power something splashed into the water bowl and i turned with a jerk to see nothing no small shape lurking near the table end as id half expected i shivered as my skin prickled with a premonition of movement nearby the darkness was still only a threat but a presence seemed to gather with it though nothing stepped forth yet forth yet i poured hot chocolate into one of the teacups and sat down to wait while afternoon advanced toward evening the ghost dog lay down beside me and smiled with secret thoughts we waited swirled in the dizzying odors of the night and the sound of distant music from houses just out of sight alone in the hush of sacred anticipation in the doorway to the land of the dead something brushed past me giggling iko barked and chased the formless whisper of laughter across the burial ground toward the iron gates then nothing the ghost dog returned and threw himself down on the ground with a dog sigh candles smoked and the stream of incense swayed upward like a charmed cobra the muttering emptiness of the cemetery held sway long past sunset past the eight oclock peal from the church tower i renewed the hot chocolate in the cup and sipped a little myself finding it more bitter and spicy than american chocolate it went better with the sandwich mickeys aunt had packed for me than the coffee did but i thought id better save it in case of tiny haunts maybe it was because i was thinking of it but that was when a little cup of chocolate on the table rattled and i looked again at the ofrenda one of the cups was moving in its saucer tilting forward and back tiny silvermist hands clutched for it and missed again and again i stood up and picked up the cup saying here let me help you i held the cup low and filled it to the brim then i offered it down around my knees holding it still until i felt something tug on it i let myself slip all the way into the grey looking for whatever was pulling on the cup a skeleton child barely as tall as the table reached for the cup its bony incorporeal hands met the porcelain but couldnt grip i tipped the cup and watched the steaming chocolate dribble onto the ground while the foggy skeleton seemed to nibble at the edge of the cup it pushed the cup away and clacked its teeth in satisfaction the toys on the table moved smears of color hovered around the ofrenda lined up in front of the other empty cups i poured chocolate into all of them and watched shadows of the cups tilt and rise as spectral hands reached for the sweets there was a burst of chatterlike radio staticand a dozen small skeletons dressed in the memories of their best clothes appeared around the table they werent as well formed as the adult ghosts id seen as if they hadnt had time to get the knack of being alive before they were dead none of the chatter was quite understandable to meunlike the adult ghosts id talked tocoming through to my mind only in spanish iko jumped to his feet again and began trotting around the little ghosts sniffing them but he returned disgruntled and disappointed to my side and sat down with a huff of breath apparently none of the skeletal kids was familiar i felt small hands on my knees and plucking at my sleeves i looked down and found two small skeletons dressed in cloudy white dresses looking back up at me with empty eye sockets im not much of a kid person so i never know what to say or do when faced with children i had no idea if the ghosts of children knew any more than they had when alive but even children have information i squatted down feeling my bad knee popno hablo espanol muy bien i said probably mangling what little i remembered from years living in los angeles with my luck they didnt speak anything else but sometimes ideas came through with ghosts even when the language was foreign as they had with the ghost of ernesto santara ustedes habla ingles they turned their skulls on their slender spines in unison no they didnt bother to talk at all but with a shiver i knew they were twins then and they wanted to know why i was in their graveyard no one had come for them in a long time and they were lonelywas i a relative of theirs how i knew these thoughts i couldnt begin to tell you i shook my head and pointed to purecetes memorial stone im looking for him and for marialuz carmen arbildo marialucy hector two skulls tilted in curiosity as if to say why those two while a toy truck pushed its way across the dirt nearby guided by a misty skeletal boy umm i started not sure how to explain como marialuz umm knows i stumbled through the language tapping the side of my head and hoping the sign translated somehow hector the skulls consulted each other with a glance of unseen eyes they turned back to me and spoke as one the words pushed the concept into my head naked and complete but not in english el es su padre her father whose burial place she did not seem to know whose name she did not have oh i breathed the situation both more clear and less why the blackmagic present then what was the nature of that paternity that she sent such a dubious gift the twin ghosts beckoned me to follow and they drifted to ward the arbildo plot leaving the chocolate and the ofrenda behind i followed them and iko followed me the graves of the arbildos were crowded with tiny skeletons and strange halfformed shapes of silvery energy thick as clay moving in some somber dance the two skeletal girls floated through the weird party and stopped before a grave with an unusual double cross of gilded iron from which the gold had flaked until only shreds remained nuestra madre nosotros this was the grave of dulcia mariacarmen ochoa arbildo wife of antonio and her two daughters carmen and lucia who had all died in april of the girls had been four years old dulcia had been twentyfive por que i started but the ghosts of carmen and lucia pointed their bony fingers at the crowd of small spirits vea nuestros hermanos y hermanas i looked beside the grave huddled a knot of unformed shapes the features of lives they never lived flickered and changed fluid as water over half faces the size of my fist id seen this before they were transient souls in flux between one life and the next grave upon grave across the plot was littered with the reminders of children who had never been born or died while still infants and toddlers they were everywhere generation after generation of the familys bad genetic luck and horrific accident it seemed as if the arbildos of san felipe had been cursed maybe against all tradition this was something the family preferred to forget hardly a wonder then if antonio arbildo had removed his family from this place as soon as he had the money to do so not too surprising if he had named a boat for his illfated wife or that the boat had been lost with everyone aboard except a single man and a dog a dark shape started to push the grid into some new form struggling against the strength of the greys energy lines iko barked suddenly and the deep humming of the grey hit a sour note the ghosts flickered out with a collective gasp the shape collapsed back into darkness and i was alone again in the graveyard i still didnt have all the pieces but an idea was forming in my head dead children and a daughter by the wrong father i returned to my camp stool and sat again beside purecetes grave pouring out the last of the chocolate and wondering if the ghosts would return they didnt dawn came up slowly in cold shades of blue while i huddled expectant and ultimately disappointed in the empty panteon it was still lit only by candles and drifted with copal smoke when mickey arrived he avoided my glance and packed up the food and chocolate the toys and gewgaws in glowering silence i let him my body was too tired and my brain too full of strange threads weaving slowly and incompletely into a tapestry i didnt yet understand to want to add the frustration of crossexamining my volatile escort to the mix i followed him back to the chevy hardly noticing that iko had disappeared with the dawn and didnt follow us to the car this time back at the guesthouse i fell into bed and slept six hard hours i was still a bit groggy when i turtled out of my bedroom and down to the empty sala about noon the visitors had all gone out most of the family was at church or in the kitchen mercedes villaflores glanced out of the kitchen window and waved to me to come inside buenos dias did you enjoy your evening she asked immediately putting a cup of coffee and a plate of food on the counter for me yes i replied not sure if enjoy was the right word but certain id learned something if i could shake it into clarity wheres mickeymiguel i sipped the coffee and felt it kick my system back up to speed i looked for iko but didnt see him and was just wondering about that when mercedes replied oh hes still asleep she shrugged and returned to her stove chatting over her shoulder teenagers you know thinking about the missing ghost dog and mickey made me think of the cemetery mercedes whos tio munoz tio munoz where did you hear of him mickey mentioned him ah that boy hes such a trouble munoz is the family bogeyman you know the crazy uncle your mama tells you will take you away in the night if you dont finish your supper totalmente loco en la cabeza she added knocking a knuckle against her temple as if sounding a melon for ripeness he was accused of working black magic long ago but he run up into the hills and disappeared i think if he is alive he is no trouble to anyone just a crazy old man if not maybe hell come to dinner tonight eh she laughed clearly she didnt feel the same horror as her nephew but then she wasnt fascinated with black magic as mickey was do you know anything about the arbildo family that used to live in san felipe del agua i asked she just shook her head i poked at my food and thought i was seeing a picture that was not at all pretty i wished i was sure what had turned marialuz from sweet on jimenez to sour why hadnt jimenez told her where purecete was buried was that the key or had she discovered something else i fished the little baggie of statue shards from my jacket pocket and stared at the bundle of hairs tied with red thread wound counterclockwise the magic goes backward like the writing on the paper i could see the slip of notepaper clearly in my mind the letters cramped on the left expansive on the right as if it had been written backward running out of space shed scryed me out through the grey talking to ghosts through a blackmagic connection as mickey had described death magic blood magic had marialuz sacrificed the dog no iko was dead long before she knew about mepossibly before i was a greywalkerback when jimenez died in a plane crash just how long had she had the statue waiting for the right grave why had she wanted to put ikos spirit wound in black magic on jimenezs grave tio munoz seemed more interested in mickey than in me but if he wasor had beena black sorcerer maybe he was interested in the black magic i was carrying in my pocket as well as his greatnephew you cant count on much about black magic or bogeymen though he didnt seem to approve of mickeys personal darkness i needed to talk to marialuz or hector purecete i hoped one or both would show up once darkness fell at san felipe del agua mickey scuffed into the kitchen looking morose and wan we still on for tonight mickey i asked huh tonight yeah my little ghost party at the panteon remember youre going to help me with the setup right he looked relieved i hadnt said anything about tio munoz yeah right setup sure what time do we need to head up the mountain four dusk whatever tia mercedes wont mind if im back late for the party here she said something in spanish that sounded like shed be happier the later he was ok he replied we can leave at four with the food and stuff cool see you down here then i agreed carrying my empty coffee cup to the sink and allowing mickey to escape i walked down to the zocalo and found a cafe table to occupy while i made a phone call the layers of spirits and magic were thicker and brighter than ever surging like an ocean in the plaza and spilling into the streets leading to it i dialed quintons pager and waited for him to call me back quinton was still paranoid about the possibility of being rediscovered by his exboss so the easily tracked technology of cell phones was one he chose to do without about half an hour later as i was working on a sunburn he returned my call hey hey yourself need a favor shoot i dont have internet access here so can you run some searches for me and get back with information before four pm here thats two here yeah i can do that what are the search terms i need everything you can find on the death and bio of a mexico city lawyer named jimenez sorry i dont know the first name but he was the partner of a guy named guillermo banda jimenez died in a plane crash a few years ago also anything on the arbildo family that owned a ship or boat called the dulcia that sunk in based out of mexico and look for any connections between jimenezs firm and arbildoespecially anything shady or questionable arbildo thats the woman who left you the dog her family and her lawyer yeah theres something strange going on between them and so far death hasnt proved to be much of a barrier im also wondering if marialuz was adopted but its doubtful thered be any record of that on the internet you never know ill see what i can get and call you back i thanked quinton and hung up before going out to walk around the zocalo and take a closer look at the grey grid of oaxaca there were a lot of things about the way energy flowed here that were different from seattles grid and i didnt want to be surprised that night i needed a little local practice with the power lines before i felt comfortable about my ability to deal with the potential conflicts that might be in store i tried a variation of the ghostpull that had brought up ernesto santara and got iko as id hoped i was pretty sure id be able to banish him again if i had to i still had no idea what part he had been intended to play at hectors grave quinton called back and i took notes about the perfidy of lawyers hard financial times an unhappy schoolgirl with bad black habits and the sinking of insured boats while leaning against an old church wall cooled by the shade of the stones and the icewater feeling of the rising tide of ghosts the ghost dog panted at my feet tongue lolling onto the bricks of the plaza a silvery skeleton dressed in a dark vest and trousers paused to pet the dog and raised his head to me este ex tu perro hang on i told quinton my dog no i replied to the skeleton man you know this dog uh listed uh i stumbled through the language as badly as ever but the ghost seemed to know what i meant he shook his skull and clacked something i didnt catch but the meaning seemed clear enough it wasnt his dog but it might have been estancio riveras dog i pointed at iko esta perro the skeleton nodded his skull vigorously si es iko iko rolled over in the spectral dust and offered his belly for rubbing i returned to my phone call while the skeleton man gave iko some attention is there any mention in those files of an estancio rivera i asked quinton not that ive seen but rivera is about the most common name in mexico after garcia this is in oaxaca right i could hear his fingers speeding on a keyboard yeah huh this is kind of weird a guy named estancio rivera disappeared from a mexico city hotel room in presumed dead wallet id and clothes were found but not his money or the man id was from oaxaca he worked in a mezcal distillery and guess who owned it arbildo give the little lady a cigar damn i muttered did i have it was it that easy hector was the missing estancio as well as marialuzs real father hed vanished in mexico city where the arbildos lived then changed his name and taken a post on an arbildo ship that sunk hed been dead twice before he died for good the skeleton ghost stood up tipped his hat and walked off after wishing me a buenas noches i nodded at him and noticed the shadow of the church was nearly across the plaza now the tower bells began tolling four i have to run thanks for the help no problem but i would like to hear the story ill take you to dinner when i get back and tell you the whole thing right now i have an appointment in a graveyard i shut off the phone and ran back toward the villaflores guesthouse iko barked and ran along beside me we skittered into the doorway together and straight into a glowering mickey thought youd ditched me no i panted just lost track of time you ready to go he frowned at me clearly teetering on a decision come on mickey you didnt come up here just for the family celebration i leaned in close to him and breathed my words into his ear you want the magic he bit his lip i wanted all the help i could get and even if mickey didnt know what he could do he could still be useful if things went bad and a plain please was not going to work with him he gave a sudden hard nod im coming we grabbed our coats and boxes and bundled into the car as fast as possible iko sat and waited patiently then vanished to meet us at the graveyard the sun was already gone by the time we reached the panteon at san felipe del agua a procession by candlelight was wending to the cemetery carried on a wave of music we parked and joined the crowd that surged into the cemetery iko reappearing as before just inside the gates the ofrenda and decorations were untouched and it took only a few minutes to put out the food and drink trinkets cigarettes mezcal and wash water to light the candles and the copal we both sat down to wait while the ghost dog circled the graves sniffing the odors of food flowers incense and alcohol floated into the air on mariachi music and the chatter of living humans while the grey hummed like a generator nearing overload the thin silver mistworld seemed to quake as the ghosts flooded out eager hungry happy they rushed into the gap between the worlds with a roar i gasped at the explosive upheaval of the grey and mickey stared crouching on his stool like an angular gargoyle how many do you see i asked thousand more than ever and theres stuff like worms everywhere everyone who can see it sees it differently i guess wheres our man mickey looked around shivering maybe the dog yeah maybe its time iko i called reaching down to pat the ground on top of the grave sending up a sudden gust of marigold scent and the odor of earth iko ran onto the grave and sat down nothing changed remembering the children and their chocolate i put out my hand hand me that mezcal mickey quivering mickey picked up the bottle and slapped it into my outstretched hand you want a drink no but i think senor purecete mightor estancio rivera if he prefers i twisted the bottle open and spilled an ounce or two onto the grave next to iko the ground seemed to swallow it groaning and heaving a cloud of yellow and gold sparks into the air someone crawled up from the grave he was probably a slim man in life judging by the narrowcut clothes his skeletal form wore in death he had a jaunty hat on his skull and a scarf tied around the absent circumference of his neck a shadow of flesh clung over the skeleton giving it a blurry outoffocus look iko whined and wriggled at the ghosts feet rolling in the dirt and showing his belly oh iko the shade breathed the words coming clear into my head where is your mistress he scratched the dog as it quivered in delight not here yet i offered but i think shell show up soon mickey glanced around and i followed his lead but no one was paying us any particular attention they were all busy and the sounds of the fiesta ramping up to last the whole night through drowned the oddness of any conversation we might have i held out the bottle and the ghost took it gracias senora it is a long time since i had a drink with a lovely lady a spectral twin of the mezcal bottle rose to his mouth and he poured a long shot down his transparent throat ernesto said you were a ladys man i said the ghost of hector perecete belched and lowered the bottle ernesto from the dulcia poor fellow goodhearted not so goodheaded im sorry about the crew it was only me arbildo wanted drowned so it wasnt an accident that the boat sank when you were on it jimenez found a way to sink it for arbildo the insurance company wasnt sure but they suspected it you know they paid off eventually right oh si it was an old boat kill two birds with one stoneheh or two problems with one hole in the hull he didnt want her to know or hed have just had me cut to pieces in an alley in the distrito leon arbildo you mean si hector replied taking another gulp of ghostly mezcal leon had a head for business what was her name who leon arbildos wife you met her at the mezcal distillery didnt you ohhhh consuela no we met at a party she was very bored so was i but of different things hector drew closer to the table and looked it over pausing to scratch iko behind the ears and pat his sides roughly i imagined i was so very suave she fell at my feet but i suppose it was truly that i was new and not like leon he laughed and his yellow teeth snapped together with a sound like castanets youth is arrogant and full of folly he put out a skeleton claw for the towel and water mickey and i watched him in silence as the ghost washed his nonexistent face and combed his memory of hair then the specter straightened his scarf and resettled the hat on his head before surveying the spread of food mickeys eyes couldnt stretch any wider without the orbs falling out i thought they never speak he whispered i never hear them speak get used to it i muttered back once they know you can hear them they dont shut up the boy jerked his head toward me drawing a breath that shook in his throat he was more excited than the dog hectori couldnt think of him as estancio after all this timehad torn off a hunk of phantom bread and sat on the edge of his grave munching it his teeth clicked and ground together i thought i would never taste pan de muerto again its very good mimi tin lo huzo mickey stammered replying in spanish since he heard hector in that language just as i heard him in english hector looked at him for the first time and the boy flinched back at the uncanny gaze from the ghosts empty eye sockets your aunt you must thank her for me my carmencitamy little girl leon called marialuzcould not bring me food and drink for these many years she was afraid the lawyers would discover her knowledge of me and of what they would do if she came here i left my home to be with consuelaher mother and i hid myself as a longdead man hector purecete who would not mind at first i did it to be near consuela and later when they thought theyd killed me to watch over my daughter bones and wings rustled in the darkness and a sigh of unearthly wind brought another ghost to the party papa we all turned to look at the smaller spirit that had walked up to hector purecetes grave she wouldnt have been very tall in life but she had probably had her fathers build a gleaming oilblack nimbus surrounded her shivering off the white surface of her dress the memory of her face was still strong creating a translucent veil of phantom flesh and expression over the visible bones of her skull so this was marialuz carmen arbildo the dog jumped into the air and barked in joy running to tangle under her feet the ghost woman laughed and patted the dog then she looked sharply at me you brought him but what happened he should not be loose already the statue was broken at customs i answered i think guillermo banda paid someone to do it that bastard i hate him more than i ever hated jimenez for what he did i opened my mouth to ask her how shed known what jimenez had donethough i thought i knewbut was cut off by a shriek of eldritch wind dont dare dare what to tell the truth marialuz screamed turning to the latest arrival this skeleton ghost was dressed in a suitpossibly the one hed died inmuch like bandas suit i guessed this must be jimenez since hed come when named and he was royally pissed about it bruja your father knew what you were up to we followed you for your own good liar she shouted smacking him across his grinning naked jaw with her boneclaw hand leon arbildo was not my father thats why you followed me thats why you spied on me and my real father you said you were looking for him but you werent you tried to hide him from meyou tried to take him from me when i was still a child thats why you wrecked the boat why you killed all those people to get rid of my father so she had known about jimenez about arbildos sinking of the boat and about the graves jimenez had not reported to her no wonder shed been mad when he died you dont know the truth luzita the dulcia sank because it was old still more ghosts flooded toward our little huddle of misery perhaps a dozen all drenched in seawater i spotted ernesto santara but he didnt look at me he kept his empty gaze on the ghost of jimenez he was no longer a pleasant haunt but an angry one the drowned crew moved toward the dead lawyer and iko stalked along with them hackles raised teeth bared my dog maria luiz screamed at me give me my dog i held up the bundle of hair and pot shards this i asked marialuz lunged at me mickey leapt to his feet but id already pulled a bit of the grey between us and the furious womans shade recoiled with a screech mickey keep her back i said in the calmest voice i could muster me how just like you kept senora acoa from dying just put out your hands and send that feeling toward marialuz jimenez was backing away starting to fade but i grabbed him sinking my fingers into the stinging electrical fire of his ghostly form no no you have to face the music counselor i said mickey was talking as fast as he could crooning and holding his hands between himself and marialuz the gold strings spun out from his fingertips stroking over her making her more solid more aliveseeming she began to cry jimenez struggled in my grip let me go puta local i waved the bundle of ikos figurine at him you want me to give this to her you dodged this bullet before but i can make sure it hits you this time i was guessing but i knew marialuz had not meant any comfort for jimenez when shed tried to have iko sent to him before iko jumped and snapped at him snarling jimenez froze and the crew gathered tight around him i let him go so they could hold him prisoner themselves they muttered to him and the sound raised the hair on my arms mickey shot me a panicked look over his shoulder and i stepped closer to him marialuz was still standing in front of him looking almost solid while hector hovered just behind her clucking and making the soothing noises people murmur to upset children its all right mickey you can stop butiwhat ask tio munoz mickey jerked his gaze back and forth searching for the bogeyman we were creating a ruckus the other partiers in the cemetery were beginning to look our way with curiosity i sat down on my stool and tried to act like there was nothing at all strange at our feast of souls i bobbed my head and let my feet tap in time with the brass and strings of the mariachis nearby i motioned to marialuz who wafted closer jimenez was still petrified in the circle of dead sailors all right i started you tried to give the dog to jimenez before then you decided to give it to hector and then you gave it to me to give to hector why she hung her head at first i was angry iko never liked those lawyers a good judge of character hector injected iko was all i had after papawent away and when iko died that was all i knew how to do all i could think of to keep him for a little longerto take me to mictlan someday some people think this is a very bad kind of magic its not its just the dark kind the death magic what is death but part of life and my dog was dead i had done bad things with the magic when i was angry at that man who called himself my father she spat but i never meant harm with keeping iko but i found out jimenez had lied to me he had never tried to find out what happened to my father he spied on me and he took the information to leon and they tried to kill my father a third time so he had to run here and hide i was so angry when i found out what he had done i wanted to punish him i thought iko would keep him from mictlan keep him in limbo and torment forgotten but never released to the third death wandering the way he had done to the sailors on the dulcia tell the rest pequena hector urged she sobbed for a moment mickey sat next to me wideeyed and still watching the ghostly woman weep until she raised her head and looked at him you understand the magic you know how hard it is to be good it was so hard but i thought i should do a better thing i changed my will so iko would go to my father to help him find the road and i gave all the money for the families of the sailors leon and the insurance company gave them nothing i thought i could repair the wrong even if the magic was a little dark but the will i saw doesnt give the money to the families of the dulcias crew no she hung her head ashamed banda changed it i dont know why i thought he was different than jimenez they were both charming liars banda forged your will she nodded he is my fathers man even after death just like that pig she added spitting in jimenezs direction her spittle hissed and raised a red spark on the ground where it hit jimenez recoiled but kept silent hector tapped her again and motioned her on marialuz sighed the smell of earth and copal the spirits told me of you i was sick with the cancer that killed me but they came when i called and they said you could fix the horrible mess of this i believed them i told banda to give the dog to you thought you could solve my puzzle of the graves find out what had happened and make it right and my papa and iko could be together again so this bit of junk controls ikos soul marialuz and hector nodded together i studied the bit of hair and thread i glanced at mickey what do you think eternal torment for jimenez or can we do something else with this the boy was trembling why are you asking me he demanded because you have the magic and marialuz doesnt anymore shes dead mickey she cant change the things she did i dont have any magic just the ghosts thats why i read up on the santisima muerteso i could use the ghosts for magic he finished in a harsh whisper you already have the magic you do look at your hands theyre just hands look at them the way you look at the ghostssideways through the worms and lights and crazy mist look softly he stared down at his gangling oversized paws flexing them slowly in and out of fists and turning his head side to side tears began to well and fall over his lower lids as he stared without blinking itstheres something on my fingers yeah thats it that glowy stuff real magic bratboy live magic he stared at me do you i shook my head no i dont have anything like that i just see ghosts that wasnt strictly true but that wasnt the time for messy little details but i can tell you thats life magic not death magic if you die it goes away thats whats happened to marialuz he glanced all around the panteon taking note of the ghosts the living the dead and tio munoz who sat on the ground among the tombs of the arbildos and smiled at us glimmering with a golden sheen what do you think i asked again should we sic iko on jimenez for eternity poor old iko faithful unto death and beyond im not sure he deserves an eternity spent snapping at the heels of this scum no the lawyer agreed and was silenced again by the drowned crew that surrounded him marialuz and hector hung on the moment watching mickey what what about the other one the guy who faked the will banda i supplied yeah hes a piece of work can you you mickey i can deliver the bomb but only you can build it iko hates him all you have to do is make the magic go the right way so its alive if the magic is tuned for banda iko will seem to be alive to him but hell still be a ghost dog to everyone else i cut a glance at marialuz then all we have to do is tether iko to banda she nodded i think it can be done if you rewind the thread just right but what will happen to the dog will it be doomed to eat lawyer in hell i added mickey nodded but he was looking at marialuz now wind the thread the other way wind it to the life of the man marialuz whispered beginning to fade iko will come to me when his job is done or when you break your binding was it so late or so early that the night was ending already no i could see it was still dark but she was tiring her energy fading after such an eveningher first and probably last return from the land of the dead only the sailors and jimenez were as present as ever hector and his daughter had started to slide away youd better start before marialuz is all gone or you might lose the chance i prompted mickey but try it whats the worst that can happen you let the dog go right yeah right i handed mickey the bag of ikos shards he took the bundle of hair out and began picking the red thread loose he concentrated pulling the thread loose unwinding it with care iko began to fade with a whimper no iko hector called to the dog in a singsong voice thin as steam no perrito stay good dog think of the man marialuz whispered think of him jimenezs partner banda the lawyer the thief the fraud she pointed toward the thread a stream of her knowledge flowing out of her skeletal fingertips touching the boy and the bundle of hair mickey rewound the red strand the other way muttering under his breath the gold threads from his fingers caught on the hairs in the bundle caught in the twist of the thread and bound up muttering with mickey singing magic alive and golden and hot as the sun hector and marialuz stepped backward back back fading as they went until they were only a whisper and a shred of smoke on the air iko stopped whining a hush fell as if all the spirits of san felipe del agua held their breath mickey tied off the string there ok you think he asked holding it out but there was no one left to see it but me and tio munoz the old man had come up on us without any warning or apparent movement muy bien he cackled mickey started with surprise jumping to his feet the old man backed away chuckling where did they all go mickey asked bewildered back where they came from id guess the sailors took jimenezi think he may be in for some trouble in the afterlife i said good mickey spat and marialuz and her father went wherever to mictlan mickey corrected i think not so sure now iim not sure about much well that was a change but i didnt comment instead i said i think we can go now if you want to i guess we can leave the ofrenda no one will steal from ghosts we started back through the crowds the music and laughter jarring against the strangeness of the night mickey handed me the bag of clay pieces and the knotted bit of hair magic and string as we approached the gate wheres iko i pointed at the gate where the dog had appeared again looking more like a real dog than ever mickey grinned and went to pat the little mongrel carefully as if he wasnt sure his hand could really touch it gracias senorita blaine i turned not at all surprised to find tio munoz behind me for what i asked for helping him find a better path he was headed for bad things i just do what the choreographer tells me what are you going to do now he laughed i think that is up to miguel what about you you are finished here i nodded yeah here but theres one thing left in mexico city munoz shook his head justice may be hard to serve with only the word of ghosts that depends on which sort of justice youre talking about he seemed pleased by that and nodded his head then he turned and walked away into the night mickey and iko ran up to me the dog grinning a satisfied doggy smile not nearly as tentative as mickeys we walked back to the chevy and got in this time iko jumped in and curled on the floorboards at my feet as we drove back down the hill mickey cleared his throat and glanced at me what uh so what now now im done i get to go home by way of mexico city and mr bandas office marialuz and hector still have a little payback coming and the guys from the dukia i nodded i think i have a way to set things up as marialuz wanted them and i wont mind giving banda a good scare i lows it going in work ill give the bundle to banda so he becomes the vesseli can figure out how then hell be stuck with iko until he dies or you let iko go can i do that yeah youll figure it out i had he made a thoughtful frown and was silent for a while then he said i think i must have missed something why did they kill the sailors that was an accident but it didnt matter to arbildo and jimenez that they died the boat was old and the company was in a temporary financial crisis so arbildo decided to sink ithave a little accident at seaand collect the insurance the sailors were just in the way except for hector whod been having an affair with arbildos wife yeah i got that marialuz was hectors daughter really thats right he followed her mother to mexico city i think arbildo must have caught on and so hector did his first disappearing act he abandoned his real identity as estancio rivera and took on the name hector purecete senora acoas longlost relative estancio was from oaxacahe worked in the mezcal distillery down the mountainand hed seen the name on the headstone in the panteon san miguel just like we did he got a job with the arbildo shipping company as hector so he could still be near consuela and their daughter while he was at sea consuela died and she probably let his new identity slip as she was dying so arbildo decided to get rid of his wifes lover once and for all but hector called his daughter carmencita that was marialuzs middle name carmen they probably called her that so it was less likely theyd trip up in front of leon arbildobut he knew mickey continued to frown im still not sure i get it arbildo sank his ship with the help of his trusty henchman jimenez and he didnt let on to anyone that marialuz was not his daughter why didnt he just have another kid last night i saw hundreds of dead kids in the cemetery they were all arbildo children im not sure what the problem is genetics bad luck a curse but whatever it is the arbildos dont have healthy kids they die young only one or two make it to carry on the family name consuela had four children but only marialuz made it past the age of three leon arbildo didnt have any surviving brothers or sisters or any other kids he had to have marialuz and she had to be his daughter unequivocally he was a very proud mana jealous man too i continued and catholic the illegitimacy thing was not acceptable he had marialuz watched the same way hed had consuela watched she must have known she was watched and been resentful she started doing black magic to hurt himshe got thrown out of school for it a couple of times when she finally met hector and found out he was her real father thats when the hate started but arbildo got even he died and he left the estate in the hands of the lawyers whod helped him in the past and they kept on watching her and manipulating her right yeah and they kept right on doing all the same things theyd done for her father and not telling her they did it they drove hector into hiding and when he died marialuz had nothing left but the dog and her hate she started trying to find out about her real father so she went to oaxaca a lot looking for his family or his grave or whatever she could get she laid that false trail for us with the registrar of deaths to confuse her lawyers in case they were keeping track of her we know jimenez had tracked the graves but so long as she didnt show up there hed never know shed discovered the truth and hed never be able to stop her plans for revenge but she changed her mind yeah she did because she found out about the dulcia she decided justice was better than vengeance and again she left a puzzle for someonemeto solve that would reveal the truth she was devious that marialuz i smiled yeah we pulled into the tiny covered carriageway of the guesthouse and i stumbled out of the car suddenly exhausted mickey caught my arm hey uh you leaving soon cause i still got a lot of questions sorry mickey i have to go tomorrow oh the church bells from the zocalo rang the quarter hour i checked my watch it was still early for oaxaca on el dia de los muertosonly ten fifteen but it felt like two am we walked up the stairs to my room the house still quiet while everyone was at the cemetery i stopped and studied mickey as he waited for me to unlock my door he was tired but standing straighten his sullen look had changed into a thoughtful frown as he tried to understand what had happened and what might happen next hey he said again is iko going to chew on the lawyer in hell i dont think so when banda dies the dog gets to go free mickey grinned it was really a nice grin i smiled back then i stumbled into my room and fell onto the bed and into sleep in the morning i returned to mexico city with only a short pause to lay some plans and then say goodbye to mickey and his aunt mickey was grinning again though this time there may have been more malice in it than the night before it was pretty early but i managed to call bandas office and get an appointment through his secretary if he skipped out on me i would hunt him down but he didnt he was there when i arrived even if he seemed a little puzzled about my appearance in his office with a dog he looked at the strange dog and frowned did you pick up a stray in oaxaca no dont you recognize this dog mr banda a former client of yours was sure you would iko began to growl like he had at the airport and stalked toward the desk banda stood up looking nervous i think you should call off your dog hes really not mine i said closing the door behind me if you take a good look at him i think you might recognize him hes marialuzs dog and hector purecetes who used to be estancio rivera you know the guy your partner tried to kill by sinking the dulcia i think you should be more careful what you say miss blaine thats slander he didnt look at me just at the dog the dog his secretary hadnt noticed nor anyone else we passed on the street or at the airport truth is a complete defense im told and the insurance company was never that convinced it was an accident i replied but you know that because you helped cover it up and still are which is how a guy in a twoman office can afford to fly to new york to watch the yankees all season every season because you steal and you blackmail and you pay people off like you paid off the guy at customs to break the dog so id go home didnt you he was backing up as iko kept coming inexorable as death dont know what youre talking about oh yeah you do and so do the federal investigators who drop in to chat with you once in a while and the petty officials and everyone else you pay off so they wont pull your license and throw you in jail to rot theres a long list of your transgressions if you know where to look like i do what the hell do you want miss blaine im sure we can settle up and go our ways you and your dog he added as if hed like to spit but didnt dare he was sweating and turning pale will you be happy if i admit i paid to have the dog broken is that it no i do like hearing you say so but its not enough what will make me happy is if you were to suddenly remember miss arbildos amended will the one where she leaves everything to the families of the sailors who died on the dulcia theres no such will there was no there wasnt just the ones i showed you whose word are you taking mine or some informant living in the hills i walked closer to him iko had backed him to the wall i am taking marialuzs word for it and in a few minutes ill take yours because i think youll want to make a clean breast of the whole thing youre crazy just as crazy as she was i gave him a cold look iko rip his throat out the little dog let out a banshee howl and leapt for bandas chest banda screamed and tried to cover his face and neck with his hands falling over his desk chair as he flailed at the ghost dog the secretary pounded on the door yelling i stuck my head out he fell hes ok i added pointing to the thrashing man on the floor or not i shrugged the secretary stared at her boss shrieking and writhing on the floor and backed away muttering about the police and the doctors i wasnt too worried they wouldnt find a scratch on him iko was biting savagely at banda who seemed to be feeling every snap of the little dogs incorporeal jaws i have to hand it to mickey and marialuz they did fine work iko was only alive to the man whose life he was tied to banda iko i called get off that piece of trash i clapped my hands for the ghost dogs attention iko reluctantly the dog jumped to the ground and stood on stiff legs in front of the lawyer growling banda dragged himself up the wall panting and shaking he stared at the apparition with horror whawhat is that its retribution mr banda that is iko he was on board the dulcia when it sank but hector purecete saved him i dont think theres ever been a dog in this worldor the nextwho hates you the way this one does and hes all yours i elbowed him sharply in the gut and he gasped i pushed the bundle of hair into his mouth and shoved his jaw shut convulsively he swallowed then he gagged for a moment staring at me until he caught his breath again jesus what was that its iko its the little bit of magic that was in the dog you were so scared of and now its yours for the rest of your life and maybe a little longer he ran for his washroom and tried to throw up but there was nothing to toss he shook and prayed and babbled for a moment as iko circled him hackles raised and teeth bared paybacks a bitch isnt it he glared at me as a renewed pounding started on the door i backed up and leaned against it you want to talk to these guys or do you want to get out of this mess i asked i want to get the hell rid of you and your damned dog your damned dog now banda but i can tell you how to get rid of him if you do what i want ill have you arrested he growled rubbing his throat as he staggered out of the washroom oh come on you know my lawyer you think thats going to fly and if you think you can arrange an accident for me like jimenez did for purecete consider that you currently have a dead dog waiting for a word from me to start biting the living hell out of you it wont kill you but id bet youll wish it would whoever is on the other side of this door is going to think youve gone insane when they see you rolling on the floor with an invisible dog because only you and i can see iko if hate were a living thing it would have leapt for my throat from his eyes saiga he shouted at the door salga estoy bien the knocking died away what do you want ms arbildos real will i want it registered and entered for probate or whatever you need to do to execute it today i dont have it he spat its gone i burned it then forge it like you forged the ones you showed me be fore the estate is to be divided among the families of the crew of the dulcia there is no estate to divide dont you get it estupida gringa its all gone the estate is bankrupt the money is gone you told me marialuz was loaded that thirty thousand us was a drop in the bucket and it didnt disappear until you were the sole controller so you can unbankrupt it the same way you broke it in the first place banda and if you dont you wont just have an angry ghost dog on your ass because even you and your dead partner and your cheap secretary cant possibly have blown that much money and certainly not without leaving a trail wide enough to march the mexican army down so you still have it which means it can be returned to its rightful owners he glowered iko i said he threw himself into his chair saying no no please he snatched his keyboard and began to type i came and stood over his shoulder watching while iko growled nonstop i looked the finished document over thats pretty good banda i see youll still be able to feather your own nest if less regally than before i added glancing around his very nice office he muttered under his breath knock it off you lost man up and live with it i hung around while he finished up printed the forms forged the signatures and got warily to his feet eyeing the threatening little hound that dogged him unceasingly stifling his fury he led me on a long damned walk around downtown mexico city to register the will and rescind the previous one just outside of the courts building he stopped and turned back tome satisfied mostly but i know you can walk right back in there and pull that paperwork by saying you were coerced but this is the thing you need to remember banda the dog is forever and once im gone youre not off the hook because there is someone in oaxaca who knows all about the will the dulcia the dog and all the rest another of your ghosts i laughed oh no a very real solid living person i know you can find out who it is but dont be hasty remember i said there was a way to get rid of the dog yes he snapped that person knows how to set you free but they wont if you screw over the survivors of the dulcias crew and they cant if you decide to kill them that personand powerful friendswill be keeping an eye on you if that person dies or if that person chooses not to help you you and iko get to spend this life together and the next one and the next one until there is no one left on the planet who remembers you or the dog until the third death he howled and threw himself at me i just stepped back as iko lunged i walked to the edge of the plaza and flagged a cab ignoring the crowd that had gathered around the convulsing screaming man on the ground airport i said turning on my cell phone i waited for an answer to my call and finally someone picked up villaflores hey bratboy its the gp its done he laughed ill be on the next flight dont want iko to have to chew on that lawyer for too long yeah poor faithful iko its rare for justice and vengeance to stand in the same place but i thought this time maybe they would at least for a while until the will was executed and bandas embezzlements were restored to the proper owners i hadnt told banda the truth but that wasnt bothering me too much whether he lived with iko for a day or a lifetime whether anyone remembered banda or gave a damn in a years time or thirty there was at least one thing that made me smile it would be a long time before the third death of the little clay dog noahs orphans by thomas e sniegoski one remy knew it wasnt real the product of some strange dreamlike state but he didnt mind in the least seeing her this wayit was almost as if she were still with him almost as if she were still alive she had called to him from inside their maine summer home and hed gone to her climbing up the stairs to the second floor standing in the doorway to one of the spare rooms he watched her her back was to him as she looked out one of the open windows onto the expanse of backyard verdant with grass that would need a lawn mowers attention sooner rather than later she was wearing a white cotton dress that billowed and moved in the warm summer breeze coming in through the window and as he silently stared from the doorway he was reminded of how much he loved her and how incomplete he would be without herremy she called out again he answered startling her she laughed that amazing laugh and turned to face him there you are she said eyes twinkling brighter than the highest spires of heaven sorry i didnt mean to scare you he stepped into the room no fear she said with a slight shake of her head as she reached out to take his hand deep down he knew that this was all wrong that madeline had passed away three long weeks ago from cancer but he couldnt help it eagerly wrapping himself in the warmth of a lie her hand was cold and wet and he was about to ask if everything was all right when he realized how dark it had become in the room black like the inside of a cave and from outside he heard the sound of heavy rain a dog barking pulled remy from his fantasy and he left his wife the darkness and the rain to find himself sitting on the porch of the summer home now in the grip of winter it was snowing and the wind had carried the fluffy white stuff up onto the porch it had even collected on him as he had sat unmoving remy brushed the snow from his arms and the top of his head and marlowe barked again for his attention hey remy said sorry about that mustve dozed off no sleep the black labrador retriever said reminding him that angels did not sleep angels of the heavenly host seraphim were not supposed to have human wives summer cottages in maine or work as private investigators either but he did i know but i was dreaming he said remembering his wifes beautiful face and how the sudden darkness had tried to claim it rabbits the dog asked no rabbits remy said snow had accumulated on the dogs shiny black coat and remy started to brush it away madeline marlowe lowered his gaze miss he grumbled in his canine tongue as a member of gods heavenly host remy was able to understand the myriad languages of every living thing on earth but even if he could not there was no mistaking how the animal was feeling for remy felt the very same way i miss her too he said reaching down to rub behind one of marlowes velvetysoft ears since madelines passing remy and marlowe had felt more than a bit lost remy had hoped a trip to the house in maine might have been good for them both a change of scenery a needed distraction he took a deep breath and gazed out over the porch rail at the falling snow im not sure how great this idea was he said and sighed it had been spring the last time theyd come before everything had been thrown on its ear before the cancer theyd had a wonderful weekend taking the day off from the office and driving up early thursday afternoon hed felt something special even then remembering how hed experienced a weird kind of euphoria as hed gotten out of the car and hauled their bags from the trunk madeline had already gone inside leaving the door to their getaway wide open and as he had climbed the stairs to the front porch watching his wife move about pulling up shades and opening windows to air away the winter staleness remy had experienced a moment of perfect contentment this was what he had been waiting over a millennium for it wasnt as though he hadnt been happy until then hed been on the earth for hundreds of thousands of years and there had certainly been moments of happiness but right then and there at that specific moment remy chandler was fulfilled since leaving heaven after the great war against the morningstar hed been searching for something hed always known he would find it on the almightys greatest experiment among his most complex creations and he didit had just taken a little while it had all started to fall into place when hed made the decision to live as a human suppressing his angelic nature remy had walked among themlearning from themtrying so desperately to be one of them but it had taken a purpose a job to finally set him on the right path choosing the name remy chandler the angel remiel now worked as a private investigator and had at last found what he had been searching for the job allowed him to see every facet of humanity the depravity the cruelty the kindness the passion it allowed him to observe and to learn from them and for three hundred dollars a day plus expenses he helped them hed been around humans for what seemed like forever but they still had so much to teach him and that was never more obvious than when he had first met the woman who would eventually become his wife madeline shed shown him what it truly meant to be human she be came the anchor that allowed him to keep the nature of the divine being he truly was at bay after all he had lost in the great war madeline had become his island she had become his heaven now she was gone and he feared that the skin of his humanity would begin to slip away to slough off like that of a reptile revealing what he had always been beneath we could have stayed in boston and been just as miserable he said to his companion while rubbing the top of the dogs blocky head and as if in response the wind picked up blowing snow across the porch showing that the harsh new england season still had plenty of bite left marlowe turned his nose into the breeze cold he said softly but loud enough for remy to hear is it remy answered not having allowed himself to feel much of anything since his wife had died the labrador placed his face in remys lap marlowes pack was now incomplete and remy could only imagine how difficult it was for him to understand that madeline wasnt coming home it was like attempting to explain the concept of death to a very young child sad the dog said and it just about broke remys heart i know im sad too he bent forward to whisper softly lovingly into the animals ear what would make you happy madeline come back marlowe lifted his head excitedly his ears perked up and his thick tail wagged so hard that remy thought for sure the dog would topple over no madeline cant come back he remembered the strange experience hed just had and the feeling of his wifes hand in his it was almost as if she had been with him again he kissed the bony top of the dogs hard head i wish she could but she cant is there anything else that would make you happy remy asked his fourlegged friend marlowe thought for a moment pigs ear he said an excited little tremor in his voice a pigs ear remy asked pretending to be surprised thats just gross pigs ear good the dog answered his muscular tail continued to wag ythink remy wrinkled his nose in an expression of distaste yes marlowe barked stepping back at full attention now all right then remy pushed himself up from the chair lets go get you a he sensed it at pretty much the same time that marlowe did and the promise of a pigs ear was momentarily forgotten marlowe started to growl low and rumbling the thick black fur around his neck and above his tail rising in caution remy walked across the porch to the top of the stairs he looked out at the woods surrounding the property the cold wind causing the little vegetation that was able to survive the winter to sway and rustle in spite of how it looked he knew that they were no longer alone there was a disturbance in the air near the driveway and remy watched as a human figure gradually materialized in a walk toward them the male figure was tall dressed in a finely tailored gray suit but wasnt a man marlowe was by remys side now barking crazily quiet he ordered its all right greetings remiel the angel sariel said with the slightest hint of a bow the angel was tall his features pale and perfect as if sculpted by a master from the finest italian marble he adjusted the sleeves of his suit jacket as he looked around him sariel was the leader of a host of angels called the grigori messengers sent by heaven in the earliest days of humanity to guide gods latest creations they had became corrupted by the early decadence of man and soon found themselves on the receiving end of the lords wrath the grigori had been robbed of their wings and banished to earth there to await the almightys forgiveness before being allowed to once more pass through the gates of heaven sariel and his brothers had been waiting for a very long time what can i do for you remy asked the angel marlowe continued to growl his eyes locked upon the immaculately dressed angel standing in the snowcovered pathway leading up to the house is this where youve come to mourn sariel asked excuse me remy felt his anger begin to rise i heard about your mates passing the grigori leader stated flatly and i wonder if this is where youve come to mourn your loss the dog was becoming extremely upset and remy reached over to place a calming hand atop his head shhhhhhhhh now remy said hoping to quiet his own growing anger as well this is a private place remy told the angel which poses the question of how youve come to find me here forgive the intrusion sariel said without an ounce of sincerity it was very difficult for sariel to even pretend to understand what it was like to be human the grigori and many of the other angelic beings that had come to walk the earth viewed the human race as just one more example of the myriad animal species that existed upon the surface of the world refusing to acknowledge how special they truly were refusing to acknowledge that they had been touched by god remy was a rarity among heavenly beings one who actually embraced humanity and strived to be a part of it i do not wish to intrude upon your bereavement but a matter of grave importance has arisen since last we saw one another sariel continued just three weeks ago the grigori had helped remy to avert the apocalypse although their motive was selfishfor their fate if the world should die was uncertain at bestsariel had gathered his grigori brothers to help remy prevent the release of the four horsemen a matter of grave importance remy repeated seems to be quite a bit of that going around these days sariel stared not understanding remys sarcasm why are you here sariel remy asked not even trying to hide his exasperation the old man is dead he replied the old man who what old man remy was confused but then it dawned on him the connection with the grigori the old man noah remy asked noah is dead how sariel adjusted his suit jacket again tugging on his sleeves the cruel winter wind blew again and with the chilling breeze came a taint of change in the air a taint of something menacing he was murdered remiel sariel said the ark builder was murdered before the flood unbeknownst to them remiel watched as they toiled building the great wooden craft day after day he observed the old man noah and his sons work on what gradually took the form of an enormous roofed ship an ark remiel had not been on the world of man for long and he knew there was much still to explore but he found that he could not leave the angel was fascinated that fascination becoming even more pronounced when in the early hours before dawn he watched the old man approach the enormous vessel and begin to paint the magickal sigils upon its hull unable to contain his curiosity remiel drew closer he allowed himself to be seen approaching the old man as he wrote with crimson fingers upon the hull of the great wooden craft what are you doing remiel asked studying the marks feeling the arcane energies radiating from the strange symbols of power you startled me noah said and remiel felt the mans ancient eyes scrutinizing him peeling away the deception that he was but a nomad from the desert that he was but a man noah dropped to his knees and immediately averted his eyes messenger of heaven i have done as he has asked of me all nears readiness the old man professed as soon as i have completed the symbols we will be ready to accept the beasts of the land you mistake me for someone else old father remiel said reaching down to take the mans hand and pull him to his feet are you not one of his winged children noah asked remiels suspicions were correct the old man could see through his disguise you can see me he asked noah slowly nodded truly this human has been touched by god the angel thought remiels attention returned to the ark and the sigils that the old man was painting on its surface these are powerful magicks you play with he said as he brought his hand close to one feeling the energy emanating from it and did the almighty bestow this knowledge upon you as well as the gift of sight the old man dipped his fingers into the wooden bowl of bloodred paint and began to draw upon the ark again as your brethren have brought me this most holy mission they have also delivered unto me the means to achieve this enormous task noah went on the symbols of power leaving his fingers in strange patterns of scarlet two my brethren remiel repeated thoughtfully why do you do this he asked he walked around to what would be the bow of the great ship why have you built such a craft you test me angel the old man said furiously painting a great storm is coming a storm remiel asked he spread his wings and floated gracefully into the air to inspect the great ship further the magick had begun to work upon the craft the angel flew closer to an open passage leading deep into the bowels of the ship the darkness was limitlessthe space within the belly of the ark endless it is a storm to wash away that which offends him noah said as the angel returned to his side and the ship remiel questioned folding his powerful wings behind him it is needed to hold all life that has been deemed worthy to survive noah said the beasts of the land no matter how large or small it is my task to be certain that they live as they are the lords children so are they mine remiel was fascinated had this old man actually received a message from the lord of lords telling him of an approaching cataclysm did the almighty truly intend to wash away his own creations he had known his creator as a being of intense emotions but he questioned the notion that the almighty could be capable of destroying what he had once been so proud of what had been the primary reason for the great war against the forces of the morningstar remiel pondered this quandary for many days and nights all the while watching noah as he and his family performed the tasks supposedly assigned by god eventually the skies grew dark and pregnant with storm remiel observed the beasts deemed worthy herded aboard the great ark it was the magick that called to them drawing them to the place that would be their sanctuary against the coming doom it seemed not to matter how many there were the belly of noahs craft welcomed them all and gave them safety it took seven days for noah and his sons to complete their miraculous task and when the last of the animals was finally herded aboard there was the most awesome of sounds from the sky a clap of thunder like nothing remiel had ever heard before a sound that signaled the beginning of the end and then the rains began it was a terrible rain the water falling so quickly the wind blowing so fiercely that it soon began to obscure the land a great and terrible hand in the form of a storm had descended upon the world to wipe away its imperfections remiel stood at the foot of the gangplank used by the beasts to climb to safety aboard noahs ark and looked out into the storm from the corner of his eye he thought hed seen something peering intently through the torrential downpour he scanned what little was left of the land until he found them hooded shapes their skin the color of dusk standing perfectly still in front of the caves that spotted the hills as the rain fell around them and the waters rose within moments they were gone swallowed up by the deluge remiel turned to board the craft and came facetoface with one of his own the angel sariel stood with his grigori brethren one by one they climbed the ramp to board the ark remiel was surprised to see that they had been found worthy soon only he and the grigori leader stood upon the gangplank did you see them remiel asked above the howling storm sariel did not answer instead he turned and began the climb to board the ark remiel grabbed hold of the departing grigoris arm i asked you a question he said sternly turning his gaze toward the nowempty hills his will be done sariel said pulling his arm away and the rain continued to fall ancient teachings said it lasted for forty days and forty nights but the angel remiel recalled that it took far less time than that to drown the world three remy left the ancient memories behind returning to the here and now murdered he asked how do you know i saw it sariel said stepping closer to the porch marlowe started to growl again the grigori leader stared at the labrador with cold unfeeling eyes i know murder when i see it remy was about to ask more questions but stopped no he told himself this time i will have nothing to do with their affairs the affairs of angels im sorry he said slowly turning his back and walking toward the door cmon marlowe where are you going sariel asked from the foot of the porch steps im going inside remy replied to get away from you i dont understand the grigori leader stated im through with this remy stood in front of the door but turned slightly to address sariel again im done with all of it with murder floods apocalypses and angels just leave me alone he opened the screen door and then the door behind it letting marlowe inside first youre not human sariel called out after him no matter how hard you try or how much you pretend you will never be anything more or less than what you are one of the patriarchs of humanity has been slain sariel continued when remy didnt respond i thought this is what you do remy chandler the grigori leader taunted i thought this is what you play at while living among them remy remained silent stepping into the cottage and closing the door behind him marlowe waited on the rug just inside the door square head cocked inquisitively okay the labrador asked fine remy answered why dont we see about getting you some supper the dog bounded toward the kitchen and remy chanced a quick look through the sheer curtain over the window in the door sariel was gone remy decided that hed had more than enough distraction marlowe didnt mind it was pretty much all the same to him as long as he was fed and got his regular walks he could have been on the surface of the moon for all he cared it didnt take him long to pack into a shopping bag what little he had brought up with him deep down remy had always known that he wouldnt be staying long this was a special place he had shared with madeline their place to get away from it all and enjoy each other and now it only served to remind him that that life was over madeline was gone remy stood in the entry with marlowe beside him nose pressed to the front door he took a long look around he wasnt sure when hed be back and for a moment he just wanted to savor the memories of her when he did return would they still be so strong he could see her washing their dinner dishes at the sink in the kitchen down the hall hed often used that time to take the car to the tiny general store five miles down the road to buy ice cream for dessert going marlowe interrupted yeah were going remy turned away from the memory and opened the door to the winter night the snow had slowed leaving behind two inches or so of the fluffy stuff except for the patch of ground where sariel had been standing marlowe bounded down the steps happily frolicking in the snow snapping at the featherlike flakes that still drifted in the air remy stood over the barren spot he reached out passing his hand through the air above it there was most certainly a disturbance there the residual effects of angel magick he started to think of sariel and the disturbing news that he had delivered but quickly pushed it from his mind this time he wasnt going to get involved continuing on to the car he called out for marlowe who had gone into the woods to relieve himself lets go he said brushing the snow from his windshield marlowe came frantically running leave me the dog asked standing by the rear driversside door id never leave you remy reassured him as he opened the door allowing the dog to hop inside never leave the dog repeated settling into his place in the backseat the ride back to boston was uneventful the snow eventually turned to rain as marlowes snores wafted up from the backseat of the corolla and the talk radio hosts enamored with the sounds of their own voices rambled on about the topics of the day it was after midnight by the time they returned to beacon hill but the gods of parking had decided to smile on remy blessing him with a parking space near the state house only a couple of blocks from home home marlowe asked suddenly awake and sitting up his black nose twitching in the air home remy affirmed he got out of the car and opened the back door for the dog on his way to the trunk get on the sidewalk remy ordered as he removed their one bag the dog trotted over to a light post and lifted his leg remy waited until he had finished empty he asked empty the dog repeated joining his master as they began their trek to remys brownstone on pinckney street it was quiet on the hill the rain and damp cold keeping anyone with an ounce of common sense inside marlowe darted from lamppost to lamppost lifting his leg and proving that he was a liar they reached the brownstone and remy used his key to open the front door the dog bounded into the foyer and pressed his nose to the bottom of the inner door remy barely managed to get the door open as marlowe pushed his way inside nose to the floor on the trail of a particular scent remy walked down the small hall to the kitchen and set the bag down atop the counter he saw that the mail had been left on the table and he wondered when ashley marlowes frequent babysitter had been by shes not here remy called out knowing who marlowe was searching for he removed his leather jacket and hung it in the hall closet she probably stopped in just long enough to drop off the mail and he stopped and turned sariel was sitting in the living room marlowe standing perfectly still and silent before him had his eyes fixed upon the intruder the angel held one of remys favorite pictures it was of madeline when she was a little girl she sat atop a pony wearing a cowboy hat and smiling that same stunning smile he had fallen in love with her secret weapon he used to call it so full of life and promise the angel said tapping the photo with his manicured fingertips but its all so fleeting for them how dare you remy began feeling his anger surge and the angelic nature he worked so hard to contain setting his blood afire bite him marlowe growled his jowls twitching and revealing his yellowed canine teeth no remy ordered managing to get his own fury in check he snatched the frame from the grigori leaders hand you have no right to be here he returned the picture to its place on the television stand then turned to confront the angel i want you to leave remy told him speaking in the language of their kind the language of the messengers sariel stood adjusting his suit coat im not leaving without you remy glared feeling an unnatural heat start to burn behind his eyes i dont think you understand he said stepping menacingly toward the grigori sariel shook his head no it is you who does not understand the angel suddenly reached out and grabbed hold of remys arm he could feel the power in the grip the angel magick flowing from sariel into him marlowe began to bark wildly as a pool of shadow expanded beneath them and the two angels dropped swallowed by the darkness five they emerged in the middle of a storm the wind roared like some angry beast as it tried to rip them from their purchase on the hard concrete surface and if it could not succeed with its bestial strength it would try to destroy them with the ferocity of its tears as each drop of rain struck their exposed flesh like the sting of a wasp remy raised a hand to shield his eyes from the savagery of the cold whipping rain and quickly looked about from the comforting warmth of his beacon hill home to this where had sariel brought him it didnt take him long to realize that they werent on land at all they were in the middle of the ocean an undulating mass of whitecapped gray swirled all around his eyes darted about taking it all in heavy machinery and equipment and a familiar corporate symbol faded on the side of a forklift chained to the concrete so as not to be picked up by the wind and carried away an oil rig they were on an oil rig in the middle of the ocean remy looked at sariel who stood silently beside him the rain pelted the angels pale features leaving traces of red on his face where it stung him the grigori leader turned away from remy fighting the wind as he began to move toward a large boxy structure rising up from the platform remy had no choice but to follow struggling against the storm that seemed to grow even more agitated now that they were moving as if it were angry that they would even think they could escape it he followed sariel toward the square building and up multiple flights of rainslicked metal steps to a heavy metal door with the words level one stenciled on it in white paint the grigori leader pulled open the door fighting the wind as it attempted to tear it from his grasp remy reached out helping to hold it open as the two of them beat the fury of the ocean storm and made their way inside i should kill you for this remy snarled as he caught his breath in the shelter of the dark corridor he could still hear the storm outside its rage was muffled by the shelter of their new surroundings but it was still out there and still very angry perhaps you should sariel said disregarding remys threat and heading down the corridor past large glass windows that looked into empty office space then again you may want to wait and see why it is that i felt the need to resort to such desperate measures to bring you here remy remained quiet the anger inside him churning like the storm outside he followed the grigori to another flight of metal stairs and the two began to climb what is this place he asked besides an abandoned oil rig in the middle of the south china sea sariel asked this is his home noahs home he traded in his ark for an oil rig remy said still climbing and starting to wonder how many floors the structure had they reached what seemed to be the final level the floor was lit in the sickly yellow of emergency lights and shadow crammed on a ship with your entire family and almost every conceivable animal for an extended period of time can have a lasting effect the grigori said before proceeding down the corridor remy noticed that up here he could barely hear the storm he doubted that it had subsided and considered then that this level had been considerably soundproofed sariel had reached the end of the dimly lit length of hall and now stood before a closed door in here he said not even bothering to knock as he opened it and walked inside strains of classical music wafted out into the hall it was berlioz his symphonie fantastique it had been one of madelines favorite pieces remy flashed back to lazy summer mornings windows open wide in their kitchen as they drank cup after cup of coffee while reading the sunday globe the symphonie fantastique the mornings soundtrack remy couldnt have been further from that moment in here he heard sariel call out it was dark inside the room except for a beam of light flashing on a screen that hung from the ceiling a slide projector whirred at the opposite end of the room its fan humming to cool its inner workings as the next slide in the carousel dropped into place remy stood in darkness as the image of a bird appeared on the screen there was nothing special about it it was only a bird that slide was then replaced by the image of a frog with beautiful blue skin shielding his eyes from the harshness of the projector beam remy searched for sariel and found him in the far corner of the room he was standing beside the desk the slide projector rested on it sariel remy asked quietly crossing the room toward him the room itself was in a shambles papers and books were scattered about as if the storm outside had touched down in the cramped confines of the office sariel remained silent unmoving his gaze fixed to something on the floor behind the desk another slide fell into place as remy approached stacks of the plastic carousels littered the top of the desk all of them loaded with slides remy peered over the clutter to find what he had expected noah lay on the floor on his back his ancient eyes swollen to slits gazing up unseeing at the ceiling the old mans face was badly bruised as was his neck twin trails of blood from his damaged lips dried in the silvergray hairs of his beard he didnt look much different than he had that day so long ago when remy had watched him paint the mystic sigils on the ark the only difference was that he was dressed in brown corduroy trousers and a heavy fishermans sweater and he was dead it had been quite a few centuries since remy had come facetoface with the old man who had come to use the name noah driscoll hed read about him from time to time about how hed made his fortune as a shipping magnate before turning to oil how the family business had been handed down through the generations father to son but in truth it was noah assuming a new identity every few decades gods touch had a tendency to considerably increase the lifespan of a human and for noah that had most certainly been the case he was afraid that this might happen sariel said another slide was projected onto the screen remy glanced in that direction to see a photo of some kind of worm writhing in a patch of overturned earth maybe you should tell me what you know remy said the words leaving his mouth before he had the opportunity to catch them it was happening again as it always did he was inexorably pulled into the matters of the divine over the centuries hed become obsessed sariel started to explain his eyes still locked upon the battered corpse fixated on the mission that god had given to him another slide was projected onto the screen and they both looked toward ita bear in a tree looking as though it had actually posed for the shot they say he had millions of these sariel stated the bear was replaced by some kind of bright green insect photos of all the beasts that he was responsible for saving as well as those that evolved from them a monkey with a strange beaklike nose but his obsession eventually took a turn down a truly disturbing path the grigori continued remy looked away from a dolphin leaping happily in the ocean waves disturbing how he became obsessed with the things he was not able to save sariel explained the things that god had deemed unworthy the things that were destined to die beneath the waters of the great flood remy had never really understood why the lord god had decided to wipe clean the slate and start again it was almost as if hed realized hed made some sort of mistake and had wanted it done away with before anyone could notice whatever the reason the almighty had seen fit to destroy the planet and use the beasts chosen to survive as the seeds of a second generation of life in the world what kinds of things remy asked his curiosity piqued the slide carousel clicked past the image of a female tiger and her cubs and the room suddenly brightened as the light of the projector reflected off of the whiteness of the screen it continued to click away though the remainder of the tray was empty he called them his orphans sariel said with a sad laugh noahs orphans six sariel was about to continue when he suddenly turned toward the door were not alone he snarled and before remy could react sariel had traversed half the room with one powerful leap shadows shifted in the doorway someone fleeing now that they had been discovered remy followed the grigori in a run catching a glimpse of the fallen angel as he darted around a corner in pursuit of his prey the rig was a maze of winding corridors eventually coming to a stop at a set of swinging doors cautiously remy pushed one open inside was a large storage space the size of a warehouse ordinarily it probably housed the supplies needed to keep a rig this size in working order but now the space was nearly empty a few crates and pallets of machine parts were stacked about the poorly lit room but by the looks of them they had sat there unused for quite some time remy listened for a sign as to where sariel had gone but all he could hear was the wailing of the storm outside eager to come in remy a voice suddenly whispered from somewhere in the shadows his heart fluttered as he looked around he knew that voice and had to wonder if hed somehow slipped into another of the bizarre dreamlike states hed experienced while at the house in maine he blinked his eyes and shook his head had the chamber become darker a damp chill seemed to be emanating from the encroaching shadows remy i have something to show you said the voice of his wife and he found that he couldnt move standing perfectly still waiting for her to come to him and she did slowly emerging from the sea of black still wearing her flowing summer dress she smiled as she reached for him remy closed his eyes and did the unthinkable he wished the vision of her away madelines hand was deathly cold as it snaked into his and he started at her chilling touch opening his eyes he stared into hers feeling himself drawn into their depths but there was something wrong how many times had he looked into madelines eyes lost in the love that he found there these were not those eyes and remy fought to be free of them as much as it pained him he spoke the words as he tried to pull his hand from hers youre not her but the woman that appeared as his wife held fast refusing to let him go no she said plaintively please dont pull away i have something to show you the desperate look on her familiar features rendered him powerless and he allowed her to pull his hand closer a gift of our union she said and placed his hand upon the warmth of her stomach remy stumbled back with a gasp dispelling the eerily real vision the palm of his hand tingled strangely and he flexed his fingers a gift of our union he heard the visions voice say again but the mystery of the words was quickly dispelled by a bloodcurdling cry that echoed through the storage space sariel remy called out running in the direction of the scream as he grew closer he could hear the unmistakable sounds of a struggle and the grigori leaders voice raised in anger he came around a pallet stacked high with wooden boxes to see that sariel had caught his prey and had driven him to the ground the man struggled weakly as sariels fists rained down on his face what are you doing remy yelled sariel raised his fist to bring it down again upon the mans swollen and bloody features but remy caught his wrist the grigoris head spun toward him insane fury burning in his cold gray eyes enough remy commanded sariel tried to pull free of his grasp but remy held fast pulling the grigori off of his victim the mysterious man moaned bubbles of blood forming upon his lips who is he remy asked letting go of sariels wrist and kneeling beside the man the one responsible for killing noah i would assume the fallen angel answered with a snarl he was rubbing his wrist where remy had gripped it could he be one of noahs employees remy asked patting the man down looking for some form of identification as far as i know noah had no employees sariel answered the old man enjoyed his isolation he shut this rig down years ago who are you remy asked the man gently slapping his cheek to rouse him but sariel had done an exceptional job in beating him unconscious some of the mans blood got on remys hand and he felt the divine power of the seraphim locked away deep inside him stir with familiarity hes one of us remy stated wiping the blood on the leg of his pants hes an angel he turned to look up at sariel but the grigori wasnt paying any attention he was instead staring into the shadows around them whats wrong remy asked sariel raised a hand to silence him head tilted listening at first all remy could hear was the raging storm outside the rig but then he too heard the sounds something rustling in the shadows sariel immediately stiffened we need to go he said his hands already moving through the air as he began to weave a magickal passage a means for them to escape remy stood attempting to see what was there in the darkness half expecting his dead wife to step from the shadows what is it he asked as what little light they had within the warehouse space was suddenly extinguished sariel didnt answer continuing to focus on conjuring the magicks to take them away remy was about to demand an answer when the passage began to open a swirling vortex even blacker than the darkness that surrounded them sariel bent down hauled the unconscious angel up and dove through the doorway to safety remy paused his curiosity got the better of him he allowed the divine power within him to emerge channeling the angel fire just enough to illuminate his hand and dispel the encompassing gloom something squealed as if in pain fleeing into a pool of shadows it appeared almost human almost seven remy exited the magickal passage into the safety of an ornate ballroom he knew this place the grand room where sariel and his grigori held their countless parties from the outside the building located in the area of downtown boston known lovingly as the combat zone appeared abandoned rundown and decrepit but in actuality it hid one of the more opulent nests that the grigori had scattered around the world what the hell was that he asked stepping back from the gradually diminishing supernatural doorway eyeing the bubbling darkness in case whatever it was he had seen on the other side decided to follow your true nature is showing sariel spoke at first remy had no idea what the fallen angel was talking about but then remembered his hand its golden flesh still burned with the power of the seraphim his fist he pulled the fire back it didnt want to go but remy was persistent and the divine power finally bent to his will it was becoming harder to suppress his true nature since the near apocalypse but as of now he was still its master humanity reasserted remy flexed his fingers the flesh of his hand was bright red like the shell of a cooked lobster but already it was beginning to heal it appears what i feared most has become a reality sariel said ominously wiping liquid darkness from the front of his suit jacket his gaze was also fixed on the dissipating magickal passageway the unconscious angel moaned on the floor remy approached him as soon as he comes to well see what our mysterious stranger here can tell us about what noah was up to on that rig the other grigori suddenly entered the ballroom in a line as if responding to a silent command from their leader they pushed past remy and swarmed around the unconscious angel there you are remy said i didnt think you were home were always home one of them growled as they picked up the stranger from the floor and began to carry him away the grigori didnt care much for remy and truth be told the feeling was mutual he started to follow the parade but sariel blocked his path placing a hand against his chest to stop him remy looked down at the offending hand and the grigori leader quickly removed it they will see to him sariel said but we must talk remy watched the grigori pass through a doorway with their burden then lets talk he said at the end of the ballroom was a large wooden door leading into sariels sanctum remy followed the fallen angel inside the grigori leader closing the door behind them he gestured for remy to take a seat in one of the highbacked leather chairs on either side of the unlit fireplace remy sat eyeing sariel as he removed a diamondshaped stopper from a crystal decanter scotch he offered sure remy didnt feel much like drinking with the angel but the grigori always had very good scotch sariel poured one glass and then another replaced the stopper and carried the two tumblers of golden fluid to the chairs thanks remy said accepting his drink the grigori took the chair across from him casually crossing his legs he took a long sip from his scotch then leaned his head back and closed his eyes remy sipped his drink he hadnt been wrong the grigori still had some of the best scotch hed ever tasted it made him think of steven mulvehill his closest friend and how jealous he would be right then but remy doubted the homicide cop would have appreciated the company the poor guy tried to steer clear of the weird shit as he liked to call it you said you wanted to talk remy said breaking the eerie quiet i was just appreciating the silence sariel said swirling the golden liquid in his glass before the impending chaos now that makes me think you know more about whats going on than youve shared remy said before taking another drink of scotch i wasnt sure before sariel said apprehensively but now there can be little doubt the angel gulped the rest of his drink then stared into the empty glass why dont you start at the beginning remy suggested sariel chuckled yes the beginning eight so these orphans that noah obsessed about were talking about the figures i saw standing in front of the mountain caves when the rains started remy asked he stood at the liquor cart pouring two more drinks he thought another might help sariel get through what he had to say and he hated the thought of the grigori drinking alone noah referred to any life that he was unable to bring aboard the ark as his orphans sariel explained no matter how small or seemingly insignificant but yes those figures they are the cause for my concern remy returned with the drinks go on he said handing sariel his glass before sitting im listening when the earth was still young the lord god hadnt quite decided what would be the final model for humanity he experimented first with a species the grigori came to know as the chimerian they were different from the two he eventually created in the garden more primitive and far more cunning the fallen angel paused for a drink from his glass remy was surprised by the grigoris words he had never heard of this prototype for humanity so youre saying that there were two designs for what would eventually become the human race sariel chuckled he wanted to see which one worked the best why didnt i know any of this remy asked in disbelief there was no need for you to know sariel said it didnt concern you as seraphim yours was a more militaristic purpose it was the grigori who were assigned to the fledgling world and thus we were privy to all its imperfections so these chimerian were his first attempts at humanity they were and unfortunately they lost the contest sariel said flatly the two in the garden though disobedient captured his curiosity remy drank deeply from his glass it was all a bit overwhelming as he tried to fit the pieces of the picture together inside his head so god brought the rains to destroy this earlier try at humankind he stated part of him hoping that he was wrong yes sariel agreed but somehow the chimerian learned of their fate and were determined to survive in any way they could there was a soft knock at the door come the grigori said the door swung open and a blind man entered he was elderly his back slightly hunched and he was dressed in a butlers garb the grigori used the sightless as servants remy wasnt sure exactly why but the blind seemed to be drawn to these fallen angels as if the grigori somehow satisfied their deep yearnings to see would you and your guest enjoy a fire sir the old servant inquired perhaps a fire would be just the thing to take away the chill that has settled in my bones sariel replied very good sir the servant said as he carefully crossed the room gripping the marble mantel he slowly lowered himself to his knees before the open hearth we believe that the chimerian abandoned by their creator found something new to worship sariel continued ignoring his servant a false god remy asked running his finger along the rim of his glass of a sort sariel said he leaned his head back against his chair eyes closed weve surmised that they somehow managed to communicate with the nameless things that thrived in the darkness before our lord god brought the light of creation things that were old before even us sariel drank more and in exchange the chimerian received knowledge he said eyes still shut an understanding of dark arcane arts but it didnt help them remy watched the servant work on the fire slowly methodically the blind man felt for the cords of dry wood that were stacked alongside the fireplace selecting each piece carefully and laying it within the cold hearth they should have all been destroyed when the rains came remy said that was the point of the flood wasnt it sariel finished his scotch and straightened in his chair he let the empty tumbler fall to the floor it certainly was the point he said and for countless millennia we believed it successful then noah brought to my attention the fact that the deluge might have failed remy finished his own drink and seriously contemplated another how did he know he asked the old man was a tortured soul sariel said the longer he lived the more obsessed he became with the things he had left to die the guilt ate at him you kept in touch remy asked curious as to the grigoris relationship with noah we saw each other from time to time sariel said waving his hand vaguely we survivors of the deluge shared a kind of bond the grigori leader smile but there was little warmth in the expression when we spoke he told me of the expeditions that hed undertaken traversing the globe sparing no expense searching for signs of those that had been left behind signs that theyhis orphansmay have somehow survived the servant appeared to have finished preparing the wood and leaned back as if to admire what he had accomplished he said he could remember them all sariel said tapping the side of his skull each and every species that was deemed unworthy to board the ark he could see them in his head awake or asleep they were always with him i can see how that might drive you a little crazy remy acknowledged the last time we communicated noah told me that of all the doomed species he believed they might have survived they meaning the chimerian i tried to explain the danger if this was true but he couldnt see it sariel explained all he cared about was the alleviation of his guilt the servant had found the tin of fireplace matches and was attempting to ignite the fire so you think noah found the chimerian and that they are responsible for his death you saw his body sariel snarled you saw that thing scuttling away in the shadows yes remy nodded slowly i did see something although i have no idea what it was sariels thin bloodless lips pulled back in another attempt at a smile what you saw was potential doom for humanity the grigori said remy was surprised by the intensity of the words dont you think youre being overly dramatic the servant struck the match on the rough stone surface on the side of the fireplace it ignited with a hiss the flame growing so large that it consumed the matchstick in an instant leaping down to the old mans fingers and then to his clothes a cry of surprise and pain escaped him as he fell backward the sleeve of his jacket afire remy reacted immediately dropping to the floor and leaning across the thrashing old man to suffocate the flames with his hands and all the while sariel sat calmly watching it all unfold that was dramatic he stated what will happen to humanity if the chimerian are allowed to thrive that will be tragic the servant seemed to shrug off the pain of his burns and returned to the fireplace taking another match from the tin remy couldnt believe it that will be enough sariel ordered the old man stopped sorry for the delay my master but i said that will be enough the grigori leader interrupted without another word the servant hauled himself to his feet using the marble mantel and clutching his injured hand to his chest shuffled from the room remy had had just about enough of the fallen angels company perhaps you should tell me exactly why youve decided to involve me in this he said as he got to his feet you care for them a great deal sariel stated those outside these walls he gestured with his chin to the world beyond his lair i thought you would want to save them what can i do remy asked this is much bigger than i what can i do asks the soldier of heaven the grigori mocked you sell yourself short my brother no remy stated with a definitive shake of his head thats not me anymore im not going to allow you to drag me sariel had closed his eyes again clearly not interested in remys rant we must hunt and destroy them the grigori proclaimed his eyes opened and held remy in an icy stare we must find where they nest and finish what the deluge should have you cant be serious remy said sariel glared at him they were never supposed to survive they should have died when the earth was young and the flood waters rose but youre talking about exterminating a species we know nothing about remy said we cant just if the current kings and queens of the world are to survive we must you dont know that do you wish to take that chance sariel asked remy should have known better it always came to this passing judgment and death i wont kill for you he said moving toward the door but the humans will you kill for them the grigori leader asked remy stopped and turned why did you drag me into this he asked you know how i feel about you and your brethren you know i want nothing more than to live my life peacefully and to not be bothered with you are the powerful remiel sariel said a seraphim warrior that as much as you are loath to admit still retains the full extent of its heavenly might remy shook his head i told you thats not me anymore sariel smiled i could have sworn i saw your old self driving back the four horsemen of the apocalypse a few short weeks ago but i must have been mistaken remy pulled open the door hed heard enough this isnt just for us remiel sariel called after him the chimerian will hate humankind as much as they hate us well need your strength if we are to succeed remy didnt even turn around allowing the door to slam shut behind him as he strode across the ballroom just outside the grand room he saw a gathered crowd of grigori and remembered the angel they had brought with them from the rig the angel he said to one of the grigori has he regained consciousness he craned his neck trying to catch a glimpse of where they had taken him hes resting the grigori said remy tried to move past and felt a hand suddenly pressed to his chest he glanced down at the hand i said hes resting the grigori repeated more forcefully i know your kind despises me for one reason or another but i strongly suggest that you remove your hand from my person or ill be more than happy to provide you with something to really hate me for the hand stayed there a moment longer before it was withdrawn he considered pushing past the grigori lackey to find the angel and ask him what he knew but right then he didnt have the energy he gave the fallen angel a final nasty look then quickly turned and left it was cold outside on the earlymorning streets of boston but remy didnt feel a thing nine remy wandered up tremont street onto arlington ending up in the lobby of the old ritzcarlton hotel now the taj he glanced at his watch and figured that ashley would probably be up by now getting ready for school finding a phone he dialed the number and got ashleys mom he explained that he was working on a case and would she or ashley mind zipping over to the apartment to give marlowe his breakfast and take him out the woman said that there would be no problem and remy thanked her and hung up now what to do all the way up from the zone hed thought about what sariel had proposed and how freaked he was by what the grigori had believed hed do the sad thing was that no matter how disturbed he was he couldnt really see much of a choice if these creatures these chimerian were as dangerous as sariel said there could very well be human lives at stake remy headed into the club lounge and bought a large coffee the scotch had worn off a while ago and he needed something more stimulating to get his brain functioning the way it should he took the coffee and returned to the bank of phones in the lobby digging through his pockets for change in this particular instance he didnt worry about waking anybody upthis person never slept and was almost always home wishing for his cell phone he fed the machine with change and dialed the number listening as it rang on the third ring the phone was picked up but only silence greeted remy its me he said hey me replied a voice on the other end whats up ive got a bit of a problem and i want to run it by you this doesnt have anything to do with the apocalypse does it the voice asked not exactly remy responded good ive pretty much had my fill of the apocalypse meet me at the taj for breakfast my treat remy told him sounds yummy give me about a half hour and ill be there half hour remy asked the voice on the other end lived less than ten minutes away finishing up once upon a time in the west he said didnt you watch that last month remy remembered their conversation about henry fondas performance in the leone masterpiece new month was the answer it made perfect sense see you in a half hour then remy said and hung up the former guardian angel said nothing as he strolled into the lobby of the taj hotel with his balding head hornrimmed glasses and usual gray suit white shirt and maroon tie francis looked like any other whitecollar business type employed in the city of boston how was the movie remy asked getting up from the sofa where he had been awaiting his friends arrival better with every viewing francis said remy nodded even though the good the bad and the ugly was his own personal favorite of the leone westerns are we going to eat francis asked looking toward the cafe lets go remy said as the two walked toward the entrance i could use a pot of coffee waffles francis said and remy turned his head to look at him what was that waffles he repeated i could really go for some waffles knowing what remy did about the being called francis statements like that only made him smile francis was once the angel fraciel of the guardian angel host virtues a bad choice on his part had left him on the outs with the lord god after the rebellion realizing the error of his ways fraciel had thrown himself at the mercy of the almighty begging for forgiveness surprisingly the almighty did not banish the guardian to the hell prison tartarus but instead made him watchman over one of the gates between the earthly realm and the hellish a gate that just so happened to be in the basement of the newbury street brownstone that francis now owned when he wasnt taking care of his duties to the doorway to tartarus the former guardian angel worked as one of the worlds most soughtafter assassins if you could afford his fee and he decided after careful review that the victim did in fact deserve to be taken down there was little that could be done to prevent the inevitable but this morning the inevitable was that francis was going to have waffles they were seated at a table by the window overlooking the lower end of newbury street and while the hostess went off to get coffee for remy and tea for francis they quietly perused the menu remy really didnt have to eat although he often did so to maintain his guise of humanity this morning however he realized he had no desire for food francis had already closed his menu and placed it on the table beside him so remy did the same first off how are you doing the former guardian asked as he straightened his silverware francis had always been fascinated by remys relationship with madeline observing the many facets of their marriage like a scientist watching some new kind of germ beneath a microscope im doing remy replied concerned by the bizarre visions hed been having but not yet ready to share francis already thought he was nuts to live the way he did and the mutt hes doing too francis accepted that with a pause and a nod so what seems to be the problem he asked changing the subject the waitress appeared then bringing remy a carafe of coffee and francis a metal pot of hot water and a small wooden box filled with flavored teas she took their order bagel with cream cheese for remy and waffles topped with strawberries and whipped cream for francis so francis prodded after shed gone he was dunking an english breakfast tea bag in a cup of hot water hed just poured remy took a long drink from his coffee cup before replying its getting weird again again francis questioned with a laugh he removed the tea bag and placed it on the side of his saucer then he added two heaping teaspoons of sugar and a splash of milk has it ever stopped especially since the whole apocalypse business the crazy train has been running flatout remy didnt like to hear that he had hoped that once theyd driven back the four horsemen the world would have settled back into some semblance of normalcy but it really hadnt he wondered how much that had to do with his current dilemma first off noahs dead he began francis was stirring his tea he removed the spoon and set it down on the white tablecloth where it left a brownish stain the former guardian took a slurping sip from the rim of his cup as he digested remys statement why am i already guessing that he didnt die peacefully in his sleep he was murdered remy confirmed remembering what he had seen aboard the oil rig the horrible condition of the old mans body as if hed been beaten to death color me surprised francis said sarcastically remy drank his coffee allowing the caffeine to work its magic upon him sariel was the one who showed me remy continued that one is such a creep the former guardian said with a nod but he does have some damn fine scotch it seems that noah was trying to make contact with a species called the chimerian the lords first attempt at creating man that were supposed to be wiped out during the great flood but somehow werent francis was silent as their breakfasts were delivered is there anything else i can get you the waitress asked remy shook his head with a smile just some syrup and ill be good to go francis said she quickly darted away and returned with the syrup placing it on the table in front of francis let me know if you need anything else she offered as she moved on to her other tables there was a first attempt at humanity francis asked as he poured syrup on the waffles careful not to get any on the whipped cream thats what sariel said remy was relieved to know that he wasnt the only one unaware of the early prototype think i mightve caught a glimpse of one on noahs oil rig so thats true then francis asked breaking off a piece of waffle with his fork id heard he was living alone in the middle of the ocean the former guardian took a bite of his breakfast so these he began with a mouthful chimerian chimerian you think they offed the old man francis asked remy paused to think about the question and realized at this stage of the game he didnt really know possibly he answered no wonder our fairhaired boy sounded like he was in such a tizzy francis commented eating more of his breakfast remy set his bagel down and wiped at his mouth wanting to be sure he wasnt mistaken about what hed just heard who sariel you talked with him francis nodded as he chewed called about ten minutes before you did said he was going to need my skills for a matter of grave importance did you already know what i just told you francis shook his head no when i asked him what was up he said it was a hunting expedition and you agreed to this he shrugged business has been sort of slow and there are these bavarian warhammers coming onto the market that im really jonesing for francis had a thing for weaponry he collected it obsessively like a nerdy kid and comic books you agreed to this remy repeated resigning himself from question to statement yeah francis said breaking off another piece of waffle and shoveling it into his mouth do you understand what he wants you to do remy asked he wants you to help them kill these creatures these survivors he said that you were on board too francis told him reaching for his teacup of course he did remy had picked up the other half of his bagel but placed it back on his plate he couldnt even pretend to be hungry anymore i just cant wrap my brain around the idea of wiping them out he said think of it this way theyre murderers francis said flatly and they shouldnt even be alive the flood shouldve erased them from the world remy poured himself another cup of coffee not buying the guardians justification think of it as tidying up francis stressed wed be setting things right wed be committing murder is it murder when you put a rabid animal down francis asked these things are likely dangerous can we take a risk on them maybe breeding and getting around remy knew that his friends points were accurate but something nagged at him something that he couldnt quite put his finger on we dont know anything about them other than what sariel has told us and francis asked when have we ever trusted anything sariel has said good point francis took a sip of his tea im not comfortable with this remy said removing the cloth napkin from his lap and placing it on the table so does that mean youre not in francis asked remy fished fifty dollars out of his wallet and put it on the table i dont know what it means do you want a lift francis asked let me finish here and think ill walk remy told him itll give me a chance to think this through ill call you later sounds like a plan francis said as he continued to eat and thanks for breakfast everything all right the hostess asked as remy passed her on his way out he smiled tempted to tell her the truth no things werent all right not in the least it was a nice day not that remy noticed at all he walked across arlington street and through the public garden heading toward the boston common people were just starting to hit the streets on their way to work flowing up from the park street t station and trickling down from the many small streets that made up beacon hill remy wandered against the tide heading to downtown crossing the financial district and government center making his own way home up through the common to joy street as he walked the same thoughts bounced around inside his head he didnt want to be like them like the grigori and even francis he would have been perfectly content to live like those bustling along to work around him ignorant to the matters of the preternatural but he wasnt and no matter how hard he tried he couldnt ignore what he knew especially when liveshuman as well as angelicmight be at risk to say that marlowe was happy to see him was an understatement but that was one of the most glorious things about dogs they were always happy to see you the black lab met remy at the door panting like a freight train tail wagging so fast that remy thought he was going to take off for sure remy the dog barked remy remy remy hello hello remy said with a laugh pushing the dog aside so that he could get in and close the door thought gone the dog said eagerly licking remys hand yep i was gone but now im back he reassured the animal remy walked down the hallway excited dog by his side did ashley stop by to feed you he asked already knowing that she had no the dog said standing at attention in the kitchen the dogs answer took him by surprise no he asked no feed he growled hungry remy glanced around the room noticing the empty food bowl and the full water dish he also saw the note on the counter near the coffeepot and ashleys unmistakable scrawl telling him that marlowe had been fed and taken out shed even drawn a smiley face at the bottom of the note then whats this remy asked picking up the note and showing the dog paper the dog answered tail wagging rip no you cant rip it its a note from ashley telling me that you already ate remy said youve been nabbed good sir nabbed good sir marlowe repeated sadly remy laughed the lab had a bottomless pit for a stomach and often tried this trick to get an extra meal it had worked a few times with madeline but never with remy his wife had been too trusting he flashed back to the last vision hed had of her aboard the rig the sensation of warmth on his hand as it was placed upon her stomach a gift of our union she had said what does it mean he wondered at first hed believed it all part of the process of grieving but now he was beginning to suspect otherwise there was some kind of connection between the visions and noahs murder but what he hadnt a clue and that was what he was going to have to find out hed planned on returning home cleaning up a bit and heading to the office to catch up on paperwork but not now there was little chance of turning this boat around he might as well throw himself headon into the madness the quicker he dealt with this business the quicker he could return to the life hed worked so hard to build but now that seemed to be crumbling at the foundation noahs office would be the place to start it had been in a shambles and he hadnt had a chance to really go through it there might be something still lying about waiting to be uncovered shit he muttered beneath his breath that meant returning to the rig and the only way he would be able to do that would be with the help of certain skills that he had used far too freely lately he knew that there wasnt much of a choice but it still pissed him off he walked into the living room to explain to the dog that he was leaving again marlowe lay in the middle of the floor sphinxlike tail thumping remy knew what that particular look meant and felt bad sorry buddy he said but i cant take you for a walk right now have to go to work for a while the dog looked as though hed just been told that he was going to the pound guilt almost got the best of remy but then he remembered something that was even better than a walk to the park would you like a pigs ear instead he asked marlowe jumped to his feet and bolted toward the kitchen by the time remy caught up to him he was standing in front of a lower cabinet door staring intensely as his tail wagged in anticipation i guess thats a yes remy said as he pulled open the cabinet and reached for the bag that contained the disgusting treats you work on this and ill take you for a walk when i get back he told the dog who wasnt even listening marlowes dark brown gaze was transfixed on the bag remy removed one of the greasy treats and held it out marlowe carefully plucked it from his hand then darted from the kitchen to his roomhis lair as madeline used to call itto consume his prize that taken care of remy walked into the living room and stood on the spot where sariel had used his unique skills to take him from his home he closed his eyes carefully he stirred the angelic essence lying inside him it didnt take more than a gentle prod to awaken it the divine power surged through him coursing through his blood his senses at once awakened coming alive with a vengeance his hearing became preternaturally acute and the voices of millions in prayer assaulted his ears as though they were all in this very room with him and the smell the smell was strong nauseatingthe smell of magick opening his eyes he looked down at the spot where the pas sage had opened he could see the residue of sariels traveling spell wafting up from the rug on his living room floor rolling his shoulder blades he allowed his wings to emerge he could feel the appendages moving beneath his flesh growing in size as they worked their way toward the surface there was a brief flash of pain and then enormous relief as his golden wings unfurled gently he fanned the air as he prepared for his journey now is as good a time as any remy thought as he pulled his wings about him wrapping himself within the tight embrace of the golden feathers the scent of sariels magick was still fresh in his nostrils and by closing his eyes he could see the path he would need to travel he thought of his destination and then he was gone ten like electricity moving through a wire he was there the heavy smell of salt in the air was the first thing he became aware of remy opened his wings and exposed himself to the new environment he had appeared exactly where sariels magick had dropped them before the weather this time was far more hospitable although the wind still whipped across the broad expanse of concrete trying desperately to catch his golden wings it was pitch black on the ocean but security lights drove back the darkness of night from the vast deck of the oil rig remy pulled his wings back then headed for the metal staircase head bowed against the humid breeze once inside it didnt take him long to find noahs quarters the slide projector still hummed from the desk but the bulb had burnt out and the room was immersed in shadow allowing his eyes a moment to adjust remy carefully approached the desk mapping out in his mind where he remembered most of the mess to be as well as the old mans body he recalled a bankers lamp and leaned over across the desktop until his fingers found the dangling chain and pulled it dispelling the darkness the office was still in chaos but noahs body was gone remy moved around the desk to study the spot where the body had lain telltale spatters of dried blood proved that it had been there he recalled the vague image of the paleskinned thing skittering back into the darkness of the warehouse and wondered if that had anything to do with the bodys disappearance turning his attention to the desk remy pulled out the chair rolling it over stray pieces of paper and slides that covered the floor where do i start he asked himself staring at the disheveled surface of the desktop deciding that the journey of a million miles begins with the first step remy dove right in selecting the first random piece of paper and giving it a onceover it was nothing special a bill for food supplies for the months of january and february there were more bills and receipts and an amazing number of charitable mailers all of them from animal organizations many of which remy had never heard of he found a recent fax from a shipping company confirming the pickup of four transport containers from the rig in two days time what in the world would an old man alone in the middle of the ocean have been shipping remy made a mental note to find them before leaving as the surface of the desk became organized the paperwork he found beneath became more interesting it appeared that noah driscoll had been looking into real estate in the boston area and had found something he liked by the looks of a recent purchase and sale agreement the property was in lynn north of the city remy jotted down the address to check out later transport containers purchased propertythe old man had certainly been up to something before his untimely demise remy left the office heading back outside to find the transport containers he could not help but be impressed by the view from the rig undulating gray waters in every direction as far as the eye could see if one wanted peace and quiet total isolation this was certainly the place but if that was the case why had noah bought property in a north shore city curiouser and curiouser remy thought he found the transport containers at the back of the rig stacked one on top of the other and secured to the deck by woven steel cords these babies arent going anywhere remy observed as he approached one of the powder blue steel containers it wasnt locked he placed his hands on the cold metal latch and pulled it up and into place so he could open the first of the two doors the chemical smell of new wafted out as the dim outside light flooded into the carrier illuminating its contents the container was filled with all manner of things that would be needed to set up a living space remy couldnt help but think of the furnishing of a college dormitory as his eyes moved across the plasticwrapped mattresses chairs and thick blankets still wrapped in their clear packaging stacked in the corners in the corner with the blankets were boxes and as remy moved closer he saw that they were filled with toys picture books and brightly colored blocks stuffed animals stared out at him from inside a large clear plastic bag in one box there was even a toy noahs ark he reached down and took it from the container not even close he thought looking at the toy mockup of the great craft the plastic toy rattled loudly as he moved it and he discovered that the top of the boat could be removed to reveal plastic animals inside remy put the top back on the boat and placed it with the other toys he looked about the transport container until something caught his eye in the far corner of the container he found an unwrapped blanket and a stuffed animal there was also an opened package of crackers and crumbs on the floor somebody the image of what he had seen running from the light again appeared in his head or something has taken up residence here he thought looking around with a more cautious eye certain that he was alone remy decided that hed seen enough he left the container and returned to the spot on the deck where hed arrived again he found the residue of sariels magick opened his wings and prepared to go home thinking of the place he wanted to be remy let the wings close wrapping him in their natural magick and as he felt himself slip away drifting between time and space he realized that he was leaving with more questions than answers remy returned with little more than a whisper one second he was on board an abandoned oil rig in the middle of the ocean the next in the living room of his beacon hill home it was something he could get used to and something that would gradually leach away his humanity until all that remained was a cold unfeeling instrument of violence forged in heaven he had escaped being that a very long time ago and would do everything in his power to never be that way again the wings wanted to stay to be part of his everyday attire but remy told them no this was how the divine nature that he kept locked away worked reminding him of what he had once been trying to tempt him with memories of a glorious time when he soared above the spires of heaven but those times were gone sullied by the violence of war remembering what he did could any of themthese socalled creatures of heaveneven remotely be considered divine remy didnt think so and exerting his will upon the wings he forced them away burying the nature he had come to abhor and assuming the guise of humanity marlowe im back he announced glancing at the clock on the dvd player hed been gone for close to two hours odd he thought as the normally curious beast did not come to see him hey marlowe remy called out again leaving the living room and heading down the hallway to the dogs lair do you want to go out remy asked then stopped as he saw that marlowe was not alone the creature appeared human almost childlike its body pale hairless and incredibly thin it was dressed in swaths of filthy cloth that hung in tatters from its scarecrowlike frame remy had no idea what it was it bore no resemblance to the indigoskinned figures hed seen perched on the rocks so long ago it squatted on its haunches in front of marlowe toys were scattered about the floor and the two were staring at each other intensely eyes locked as if playing a game victory going to the one who managed not to blink first the tension in the air was palpable like an elastic band just about stretched to capacity before marlowe barked slapping his paws on the hardwood floor and all hell broke loose the trancelike state between the two beasts suddenly broken the creature reacted pulling its pale lips back in a catlike hiss remy was afraid and as if suddenly catching the scent of his fear the whiteskinned being turned its gaze to him its eyes were black like shiny pools of oil and remy felt himself drawn toward their inky depths marlowe run he managed looking away before the intruder sprang it moved incredibly fast and collided with remy knocking him back against the wall as it tried to escape down the hall the dog was barking like crazy now remy dove wrapping his arms around the creatures thin waist driving them both to the floor the invader let out an unpleasant squeal a strange mixture of a babys cry and the screech of brakes as it struggled in his grasp stay back remy commanded the dog as the labrador started to slink from the room marlowe retreated the strange beast was much stronger than it appeared easily breaking remys grip and scrabbling to its bare feet in a frantic run it skidded around the corner into the living room and remy was right behind it but it was waiting for him the creature charged slashing at him with razorsharp claws remy leapt back feeling the claws snag the front of his shirt and graze the smooth flesh beneath the beast had retreated deeper into the living room and crouched there watching him remy was about to charge after it but something stopped him something in the monsters gaze is that fear still crouched on the living room rug the creature let out another of its disturbing cries and remy watched in surprise as it began to convulse hunching its back as if bending over to vomit but instead the pale flesh on its bony back tore with a wet ripping sound and two leathery batlike wings popped from beneath the skin remy watched dumbfounded as the creature cloaked itself in its new leathern appendages then squeezed itself smaller and smaller until it was no longer there leaving behind only the telltale scent of magick angel magick remy was still staring at the spot where the intruder had been trying to understand what was going on when he heard a soft whimper behind him he turned to see a trembling marlowe standing in the hallway clutching a filthy stuffed monkey in his mouth hey remy said going to the shaking animal are you all right he asked running his hands over the black labradors body searching for injuries did he hurt you marlowe let the toy drop to the floor licking the side of remys face affectionately no hurt marlowe said nice remy stopped inspecting the dog and looked into marlowes dark brown eyes what do you mean nice nice no hurt marlowe explained give toy the dog pawed the filthy stuffed monkey nice give toy remy reached down to pick up the monkey this isnt yours he asked the dog mine now the dog said playfully snatching it from remys hands and giving it a savage shake images filled remys head as things became more clear like jagged rocks suddenly visible through wafting holes in thick ocean fog terribly clear he remembered the contents of the transport containers on the oil rig furnishings for a home blankets and toys stuffed animals peering out at him from their clear plastic packaging nice marlowe said again happily tossing the new toy into the air no hurt friend eleven remy called francis on the way to lynn the former guardian angel turned assassin wasnt home so he left a message hey its me heading to lynn on the north shore to check out a piece of property that the old man purchased a few weeks ago he told his friend debating if he should explain further or wait until things had crystallized a little bit more give me a call when you get this there are some things i need to run by you before you accept the grigoris offer later remy ended the call and slipped the phone into the pocket of his leather jacket hed reached the rotary in revere and veered right onto the lynn marsh road it was a straight shot from there across the long stretch of causeway that connected revere to lynn his thoughts were wandering again to the paleskinned creature sprouting wings in his living room he remembered its eyes moist dark and shiny like the cold ocean water of the marshlands he was passing by now but there had been something else in the blackness of its stare ferocity fear intelligence he passed over the foxhill bridge into the city of lynn the sprawling general electric jet engine plant was to his right the citys major employer since it lost the shoe industry to foreign shores back in the s remy fished the piece of paper hed written the address on from his pocket and gave it another glance according to mapquest he wasnt too far away he continued on down western avenue thinking of the silly little rhyme that just about everybody on the north shore seemed to know lynn lynn the city of sin you never go out the way you came in it wasnt long before he found river street it wasnt one of the citys better neighborhoods most of the buildings were boarded up and empty many blackened and charred as if by fire he parked his car beneath the dim light thrown by the single working streetlight and stepped out onto the street he could still catch the musty smell of smoke in the air most of the buildings were missing numbers and it took a little while to figure out where he needed to be looking and on what side but as he walked the lonely stretch of river street it soon became obvious where he was heading he could see it ahead of him the tall spire reaching up into the dingy night sky the abandoned remains of saint mathias church she appeared to have been let go quite some time ago the cruel years having their way with her remy always felt a tinge of sadness when he saw buildings like this places of worship no longer carrying the prayers of the devoted faithful up to the heavens it was a sign of the times he told himself but it didnt make it any less sad to see saint mathias was more than just a church it was a sort of compound an alley separated the church from a rundown rectory and an old brick elementary school it seemed that noah had bought it all at the back of the church a frame from one of the elaborate stainedglass windows depicting the stations of the cross had fallen away allowing remy to look inside the building was empty anything that would have made it recognizable as a place of worship had pretty much been removed the only things serving as a slight reminder were wooden pews stacked in a far dark corner as if waiting to be used as kindling he saw nothing out of the ordinary nothing to pique his curiosity so he turned his attention to the rectory directly across from the church remy climbed the three chipped and broken concrete steps to the side door it appeared that new locks had been recently installed remy knew how to do the whole lockpicking thing but seldom remembered to bring his tools looking aroundas if thered be anyone around here to raise an alarmhe placed his hand against the door he utilized a little bit of his divine strength to force it open and went inside he pulled a small flashlight from his jacket pocket and turned it on the thin beam of light cutting through the murk he was in a small hallway that led to a kitchen the room appeared cleantoo clean it had been used recently not like the rest of what was around him covered in thick dust the place looked to have been abandoned more than a few years ago across the kitchen was a swinging door and he went through into a corridor there was a flight of stairs leading up to the next level on his right and a short hallway that led to the rectorys main office he checked out the office next all he found was an old grimecovered desk and a broken wooden chair remy returned to the stairs and climbed to the next floor he stood on the landing shining his light across closed doors to rooms that would have once housed the priests of the saint mathias parish there was a strong musty smell of dampness on the second floorand something else as remy approached the first door he tried to convince himself that in a building this old and in such disrepair the offending smell could have come from a number of sources a dead mouse or rat maybe even a pigeon he turned the oldfashioned metal knob the first door swung open a rusty box spring lay on the floor in the rooms center there was a clean spot on the yellowed wallpaper where a crucifix had once hung at the next door the smell was stronger and remy prepared himself he opened the door and found a rat its withered carcass caught in a trap he let the beam of light linger on the desiccated rodent corpse surprised at the amount of stink that still emanated from the remains the third room proved to be the charm this knob was warm to the touch but he barely noticed as he swung the creaking door wide moving the beam of his light around the nearly empty room nearly empty at first he thought it was a sleeping bag the encampment of some vagrant who found shelter from the harsh new england cold but then he realized otherwise remy entered the room his light trained upon the unmoving shape on the bedroom floor it took him a moment to process what it was that he was looking at it was a body wrapped up in strips of heavy cloth like a mummy only the face was left exposed a face that remy knew he held the light on noahs face somebody had cleaned him up washing the dried blood from his battered face and white beard preparing him for burial around the old mans body somebody had dropped slides as if in some sort of tribute pictures of all the animal species the old man had saved escorting him on his way to the afterlife the sudden sound of a floorboard creaking behind him caused him to spin around his flashlight beam searching out the source but he found only an empty doorway the door slowly closing on its own the ringing of his cell nearly gave him a heart attack he lowered his flashlight and fished the phone from his pocket it was francis that was when the creatures chose to make their move there were three of them their pale flesh glowed translucently in the darkness of the room as they emerged from the shadows they were lightning quick swatting his cell from his hand remy could hear the faint voice of francis calling out his name as the phone slid across the floor remy opened his mouth to try and communicate to experiment with the theory that perhaps these creaturesthese chimerian which he was pretty convinced they werewere not as threatening as sariel had painted them to be but he didnt get the chance their strikes against him were savage relentless driving him to the floor beside the wrapped corpse of noah just as he was about to call on the destructive forces that resided within him he felt a taloned hand grip his hair savagely the creature slammed his head back against the hardwood floor and as the flood of darkness rushed in to drag remy down he heard a voice cry out no do not harm this one it said he isnt one of them a mysterious voice that saved his life twelve i have something to show you said the whispering voice sounding very much like his madeline but he knew that it wasnt something someone was attempting to communicate with him to show him something of great importance all he had to do was accept the offer show me remy said aloud suddenly finding himself awake at once he realized that he was no longer in the dusty old room of the saint mathias rectory there was cold stone beneath him numbing his human flesh with its freezing temperature remy climbed to his feet squinting in the darkness he did not want to do it but no longer in possession of his flashlight he had no real alternative carefully he called upon the power of the divine once more igniting his hand with the fires of heaven in the illumination of its golden flame he found that he was in some sort of vast underground chamber its walls covered in thick glacial ice are you cold asked a voice from somewhere close by remy directed the light of his hand toward an outcropping of jagged rock a figure wrapped in a blanket sat on the ground leaning back against a wall of ancient stone youre welcome to share my blanket he offered remy walked toward the man and the light thrown from his hand revealed a somewhat familiar face i know you he said as the identity of the stranger came to him youre the angel we brought from the rig were you there the angel asked i thought sariel had returned alone the angel was a mess looking worse even than he had after sariels beating did he do that to you remy asked the angel brought broken and scabbed fingers to his horribly bruised and swollen face he did the angel said for not telling him what he wanted to know who are you remy asked and whats your part in all of this i am armaros the angel said pushing himself up using the stone wall for support and i was supposed to be sariels spy the angel stepped closer and the light from remys hand showed him the extent of how badly hed been beaten remy hadnt seen injuries this savage since noah when noah started talking about how the chimerian had survived sariel became worried he assigned me to be the old mans assistant to help him with the search armaros pulled the blanket tighter around his shoulders but i was really there to keep tabs on noahs expeditions and to alert sariel and my brothers if anything was ever found which it was remy stated a strange almost beatific expression came over the fallen angels bruised face yes he said yes we found a small number of them but i couldnt bring myself to tell sariel i knew why he wanted to know if the chimerian had survived remy stared already guessing the answer he wanted to destroy them armaros stated his voice trembling with emotion he wanted to complete what the deluge had failed to something moved in the darkness behind them and remy turned toward the sound pushing back the darkness with the light of the divine three of the chimerian hissed angrily scurrying back to the protection of the shadows they dont mean you any harm armaros reassured him moving around remy to get to the creatures theyre just afraid armaros knelt down calling them to him remy had lowered his hand the light thrown now at a minimum he watched as they emerged cautiously moving toward armaros at his urgings they came to the grigori and he put his arms around the paleskinned creatures they clung to him with their clawed hands nuzzling in the crook of his neck remys suspicions had been right these werent savage beasts to be put down how could i tell sariel about them armaros asked kissing one of them atop its bald veiny head theyre only children armaros hugged the children lovingly and they hugged him back we were going to try to save themnoah and i he explained transporting them to a place in the modern world where they could learn and adapt remy recalled the transport containers and the abandoned church property in lynn noah had it all worked out the angel continued as soon as he spoke the old mans name the chimerian children immediately reacted they became very still throwing back their overly large heads their mouths emitting a strange ululating howl that echoed through the vast chamber i know i know armaros said pulling them closer to him they miss him the angel explained they loved their noah very much it was the most heartbreaking sound remy had ever heard triggering some bizarre paternal instinct he wanted to go to them to hold them in his arms as armaros did and comfort them from the pain of the world he had returned to the rig for some final preparations when sariel found him the angel explained drawing the chimerian children closer to him the scene of the crime flashed before remys eyes noahs beaten and battered body lying on his office floor and for what he was going to do sariel killed him remy said armaros nodded im not sure if that was his intention but he was so enraged that noah could even consider what he was doing the angel looked at remy but how could we not he asked somehow they had survived the deluge survived all the years following doesnt it mean that theyd earned their right to live remy stepped closer keeping his burning hand at his side the children grew nervous at his approach shhhhh armaros comforted he means you no harm one of the chimerian looked at him with deep cautious eyes and remy knew that this was the one that had found its way to his home remy knelt down near armaros reaching out with the hand that did not burn with the fire of heaven the child at first studied what was offered and then cautiously reached for it gripping one of remys fingers in his thats it armaros said hes our friend with the childs touch the images flowed through his brain and his suspicions were confirmed he knew these children of the flood and why the grigori were so desperate for them to be gone the bastards remy whispered the miserable coldhearted bastards seeing that he wasnt a threat the two other children became interested in him leaving armaross arms to come to him and with each touch of their clawed hands or the feel of their warm breath on his cheek remy knew them more and what they had gone through to live i couldnt let noahs death be in vain armaros went on i was going to try and accomplish our goals alone the grigori laughed but i was sloppy and sariel caught me i tried to tell him that they meant us no harm that they only wanted to live but he would hear nothing of it im surprised that i didnt share noahs fate right then and there but that must be where you came in the chimerian children were crawling all over remy now completely unafraid armaros chuckled they know you the fallen angel said they know what you are remy laughed the first real laugh that hed had since his wife had died with the thought of madeline the chimerian children stopped they stared at him with their intense dark eyes and one by one they drew back their heads and sang their sad sad song for him sariel tried to make me talk armaros explained defiantly but i wouldnt tell him he shook his head from side to side i thought i would die but still i kept their secret he wanted to know about this place but i held my tongue remy was holding the children now each of them completely comfortable with the other how did you escape he asked there are some among themthe grigorithat feel as i do they let me go so that i could try and get the children to safety before remy felt it inside his head like fingers gently running across the surface of his brain it wasnt an entirely unpleasant sensation angel of heaven said the voice like a gentle summer breeze tickling inside his ear i have something to show you armaros must have heard it as well because he smiled she wants to talk with you the fallen angel said he opened his arms calling the children to him go to her who remy asked feeling a psychic tug upon him turning in the darkness like the needle of a compass pointed toward where he needed to go the mother armaros said there wasnt a moments hesitation this was what he had been waiting for remy headed off into the vast underground cave system she was calling to him the mother was calling and he had no choice but to answer thirteen it felt as though hed been walking for days but he knew that wasnt the case the chamber went on and on up and over hills of ice older than recorded history the only source of illumination being the divine fire that burned around his hand dripping stalactites like the teeth of a giant beast hung over his head as he slid down from the other side of a black rock wall and onto a path that seemed to be taking him even deeper into the cavernous surroundings at first he had not the slightest idea what it was that loomed out of the darkness in front of them believing it to be another enormous wall of rock and ice an obstruction that could very well prevent him from going any farther remy lifted his burning hand staring at the obstruction and realized that he was looking at something else altogether that he had reached his destination remy nodded in satisfaction taking it all in absorbing the sight of the ancient craft that appeared to have become part of its rocky underground surroundings it mustve been swallowed up by changes in the earths surface pulled farther and farther beneath the ground as time passed he thought as he looked upon what was left of the ark the remains of noahs ark over the passage of time the wood had ossified becoming like stone blending with its geological surroundings the front of the once gigantic ship protruded from the stone as if sailing through a monstrous ocean swell that had been frozen in time it made sense that this was where theyd be remy thought as he was drawn toward the ancient transport denied passage on the great craft but now wedging his fingers deep into cracks between the rock and ice remy started to climb the gentle voice of the mother driving him on the answers are inside remy told himself the alltoohuman flesh of his fingers feeling the rigors of the harsh elements and remy needed answers from the beginning when sariel had first come to him he had sensed that something wasnt right that he wasnt getting the entire picture it was all so much bigger than what the grigori leader had cared to share remy reached the top of the ark jumping from an icy ledge to the side of the craft and climbing over onto what had once been the deck countless millennia of shifting geological change had done its job on the ship holding the vessel in its cold rocky clutches like a prized toy in the mouth of a playful dog there were gaping holes in the surface of the deck and remy could feel the tingle of something ancient and magickal wafting up from the darkness below moving toward one of the holes he peered down into the ships hold memories from days long past exploded inside his head of the ships bowels filled to bursting with life of every conceivable size and shape life that had been deemed worthy to survive the coming storm no real thought went into his next action the mother was waiting for him and he simply lowered himself through the hole and into the waiting darkness below using protrusions of rock and ancient ossified wood remy climbed down into the ships limitless hold touching bottom was like being on the ocean floor not a lick of light to be found he let the fire of divinity burn brighter from his hand to light the way he walked where they had kept the animals remembering how it had looked then the pens primitive tanks corrals and stalls as far as the eye could see built to hold the myriad varieties of life that the old man and his family had been instructed to save remiel whispered the voice of the mother yes he said aloud walking farther into the cavernous belly of the ark remember the days long past when the makers world was young as he trudged along images flooded his mind rapidfire pictures across the surface of his brain as the mother began to show him he saw the world as it had been young and vibrant fertile with life a dark indigoskinned peoplethe chimerianmade their homes among the rocky hills of the primordial world they were a beautiful people their skin the bluish color of dusk somehow they knew that the maker did not favor their continued survival and they begged him to have mercy on them but the all powerful had already made up his mind already created something to replace them but the chimerian did not give up hope continuing to pray and to make sacrifices in hopes that their maker would not forsake them that he would see that they were worthy to live and they believed themselves saved when the emissaries came living among them living like them teaching them but the emissaries had come only for their own selfish reasons immersing themselves in the earthly pleasures of food drink and carnal acts knowing that it was only a matter of time before the chimerian were extinct remy saw the emissaries inside his mind saw their leader in the midst of revelry as he and his brethren partook of all mortal excesses he saw sariel and his grigori and then he saw a chimerian woman her belly swollen with life the fallen angel became enraged it cannot be the grigori leader ranted and the woman cowered your kind were supposed to be barren and she looked to him with hope in her eyes hope for her and all her kind as well as the children to be born of chimerian women and fallen angels a gift of our union the beautiful woman with the nightcolored skin said to sariel she reached out took sariels hand and placed it on her stomach a gift to show the maker we are worthy to live a final image was burnt into remys mind it was of the chimerian women clad in hooded cloaks stitched from animal skins clutching bellies swollen with life they stood upon the rocky hills as the rain fell in torrents and the waters rose watching as those deemed worthy to live filed aboard the ark unworthy to exist forsaken remy came away from the sad vision in an area of the ark darker than even the light of the divine could illuminate he knew that she was here somewhere in the ocean of night hiding herself away how he asked the darkness how did you survive the feeling inside his head was immediate like a long sharp finger slowly pushing into the soft gray matter of his brain but he did not fight it remy let the answers come it was like looking out through dirtcovered windows the scenes unfolding desperate to find a place inside his already crowded skull remy stumbled and fell to the ground fighting to stay conscious the chimerian people bobbed upon the waters one by one taken by the merciless sea but some survived the women of the tribe those who had been touched by the grigori somehow they had been changed by their experiences with the fallen ones their bodies evolving making them able to endure the catastrophe the impregnated women clung to the side of the great ark their bodies enshroudedprotectedby thick cocoons made from magick and sorrow and they survived like that hiding from those who wished them gone sleeping through the passage of ages waiting for a timea safe timeto emerge through a thick gauze of webbing remy watched as a man clad in heavy winter garb protected from the harshness of the elements moved toward them noah sensing changes in the world and in him they had reached out drawing him to their hiding place and begging their forgiveness he pulled them from their womb of shadow noah at last finding his chimerian orphans remy felt the hold on him released and he peered again into the limitless depths of the darkness searching for the one who had called to him he got to his feet and moved farther into the nebulous embrace the light of his hand nearly useless in the supernatural environment are you here he asked show yourself to me the mother responded to remys request her form as well as the forms of the other chimerian survivors gradually moved into focus it was as if they were lying in a great nest crafted from the stygian gloom six of them several still pregnant with the fruit of their union with the emissaries they appeared to be asleep but their minds were active remy could feel them all reaching out to him attempting to communicate but one voice remained the loudest the mother remiel she spoke inside his mind he looked down into the nest and for a moment he saw the love of his life as he had watched her so many times fast asleep the picture of a sleeping madeline quickly changed to that of the chimerian mother she appeared smaller than the others having already borne her young the children that hed encountered i felt you out there the mother whispered wearily a compassionate consciousness to hear our plea what would you have me do remy asked kneeling down beside the nest will you speak for us warrior of heaven she asked when we are at last gone driven from existence will you remember us ill help armaros remy told her well continue what noah began and too late for that she said resignedly our time draws near tell me that you will remember us for what we were and not as some blight upon the early land ill help you he said the words leaving his mouth just as the mother began to scream remy didnt know what to do reaching down he took her hand in his whats happening he asked it has begun the end of us what can i do he demanded there had to be something the other women began to moan and writhe as if held in the grip of some terrible nightmare the smell of magick was suddenly in his nostrils and remy turned in the darkness something was appearing behind him a jagged lightningbolt tear was ripped in the shroud of shadow that had protected the chimerian women remy sensed the danger at once rising to his feet and allowing the warrior side of him to bubble to the surface the grigori spilled from the open wound into the chamber their eyes gleaming with bloodlust no remy screamed in the voice of the messengers his wings of feathered gold spreading from his back forming a barrier between them and the chimerian women and then he felt her touch again pulling him back drawing him down the mother had brought him into a vision they were at the maine cottage standing inside the extra room wearing the image of his wife she attempted to console him theres nothing that you can do she said standing before the open window the wind pulling at her clothes it had become like night outside the air electric with the coming storm dont let them do this remy said unable to keep the tremor of emotion from his voice we always suspected that it could end this way the mother wearing the guise of madeline said she reached out and cupped the side of his face remember then the storm was upon them and the rain began to fall remy awoke to the smell of blood he could still feel the mothers touch restraining him from the inevitable there is nothing you can do but remy did not want to believe it fighting the grip that held him in the womb of darkness he heard the sounds of their excitement and looked to see the grigori attackers their fine italian suits spattered black with blood as they murdered the defenseless survivors of the great deluge something snapped inside remy and the power of i leaven rushed forward with a terrible fury he let it come letting it trample his humanity in its excitement to emerge the light thrown from his body burned like the heart of the sun and he heard the grigori squeal like frightened animals as they were driven back away from their murderous acts but it appeared he was too late the chimerian women were dead their defenseless bodies bearing the bloody wounds of the fallen angels shame remiel a voice called from behind him he turned to see sariel coming toward him through the darkness a pale hand raised to shield his eyes from the heavenly light we feared for your safety in his other hand the grigori held a sword an ancient blade that had been forged in the fires of the lord gods love and had once glowed like a star but now was only a thing of metal tarnished and stained by needless violence what have you done sariel remy asked barely able to contain his emotion as he looked upon the women savagely brutalized by the grigori we suspected you might be in danger sariel spoke and came at once to your aid the seraphim laughed a low rumbling sound more like a growl your concern for my wellbeing is touching remy said and then he turned his cold gaze upon the grigori leader you used me sariel he said repressed fury dripping from every word i have no idea what youre talking about the grigori leader responded indignantly you made me part of this remy hissed the glow from his body had dwindled the darkness of what had transpired draining away the intensity of his light dont you see remiel sariel asked you were part of our test all remy could do was stare at the sight of something once holy now but a twisted reflection the almighty provided you for us to complete our penance the grigori leader went on his brothers stepped cautiously into the light to join their leader you were a tool of our redemption redemption remy said the word like poison on his lips you actually believe that after all youve done his eyes were pulled to the chimerian bodies and he stopped the lord god provided us with a way to consummate a task that had remained incomplete for countless millennia sariel continued to explain how could we not respond and noah remy asked he has been avenged sariel proclaimed raising his sword as if in victory you murdered him remy raged he turned his gaze back to the grigori master the fire of heaven burned in his stare sariel started to speak but remy did not want to hear it he charged at the fallen angel grabbing the lapel of his suit jacket and pulling him closer you killed him in a fit of rage remy accused his teeth clenched in anger you beat a defenseless old man to death with your fists i lost my temper the grigori admitted followed by a sigh of exasperation he was just so damned stubborn wracked with guilt over what he believed he had done you should have seen how excited he was when he thought that hed found them remy felt himself becoming sick as the fallen angel attempted to justify his twisted actions he didnt see the danger no matter how hard i tried to explain it the grigori said his words fervent he told me that he was going to beg god to let them live that because they had survived the flood he should allow them to exist that they had earned the right to life sariel actually seemed to believe what he was saying and that remy found even more disturbing here was our chance remiel the grigori leader emphasized something to bring us that much closer to going home to be allowed back to heaven but you killed him remy reminded the grigori leader with a shake yes i did sariel admitted not sure exactly how that will be received but at least were finishing what the flood began that has to count for something i wasnt about to allow anything to prevent me from completing what should have been finished ages ago sariel glanced at the hand still holding his lapel its done remiel sariel said this is how it was supposed to be for us to finish what had already been put in motion it was a test for us penance for one of our greatest misjudgments misjudgments remy asked scorn in his words but the children sariel looked to the corpses distaste upon his pale perfect face an error better left forgotten he snarled removing remys hand from his suit coat they were twisted things remiel neither of heaven nor earth they were yours he searched the fallen angels eyes looking for even a small sign of mercy or compassion it was like staring into a deep dark hole there was nothing there and remy knew that sariel and his grigori brothers were lost what they believed of the chimerian was true of themthere was no place for the grigori in heaven or on earth remy heard a sound a howl of mourning from the throats of children born of grigori and chimerian women he turned toward the song to see them squatting at the edge of darkness clinging to one another as they ached over the fate that had befallen their mother the chimerian lament filled the shadows becoming louder and their sadness became palpable one by one the grigori dropped to their knees supremely affected by the woeful song perhaps i am wrong about them remy thought all were affected except for sariel the grigori leader looked upon his brothers with horror get up he screamed but either they did not hear him over the sad song or they chose to ignore his words for they continued to kneel upon the ground soaked with the blood of innocents listen to it remy yelled over the forlorn sound listen to the pain youve caused blood started to seep from sariels ears his body grew stiff and began to tremble slowly his knees began to bend bringing him closer and closer to the ground i sariel grunted stabbing the blade of his sword into the ground to halt his progress hear he fought the gravity of sorrow pushing down upon him to struggle to his feet nothing and he sprang across the floor murder in his gaze as he raised his tarnished blade to strike at those who would keep him from achieving that which he most desired that which would keep him from the gates of heaven remy sprang into sariels path grappling with the fallen angel and driving him to the cold hard ground the grigori flailed lashing out with the pommel of his sword striking remy across the temple with a savage blow there was a searing flash of pain and color as remy felt the grigori squirm out from beneath him he fought back the descending curtain of oblivion flapping his powerful wings to rise to his feet the chimerian babes had ceased their song as they watched the scene unfold with wide frightened eyes they hissed baring razorsharp teeth as sariel loomed sword raised above his head ready to fall the seraphim emerged with a roar pushing aside the fragile shell of humanity remy wore burning it with the fire of heaven and remy let it he was tired of all the pain and death tired of being manipulated in others pursuits of heaven with hands burning white with divine heat he grabbed the grigori leader pulling him back away from his objectives away from his children sariel struggled in the grasp of the seraphim and his fine suit and the flesh beneath it burned with the supernatural fire he spun on remy swinging his sword with a cry of fury and pain but the seraphim was not impressed capturing the blade in midswing causing the weapon to warp and bend and finally to melt sariels screams were entirely of pain now as his immortal flesh blackened and smoldered but the seraphim held him tight refusing to set him free allowing the power of god that seethed at his core to flow through him and into the fallen angel you wanted to see heaven again brother the seraphim spoke in the language of gods first creations see it now the grigori leader still lived but his body had begun to crumble pieces of charred angel flesh breaking away to drift on the air like black snow see it and burn and soon the angel sariel was no more as the last of him was consumed by the voraciousness of heavens fire the seraphim flapped his powerful wings dispersing his fallen enemys ashen remains and turned his attention to the others they had risen to their feet weapons in hand staring at him with intense hatred and the seraphims mouth twisted in a cruel smile that told he was ready to share their masters fate with them none moved having no fear of them the seraphim remiel turned his back on the grigori to face the children of the deluge they looked away from him with a hiss the intensity of his light searing their sensitive eyes diminishing his holy glow he knelt upon the ground opening his arms to them without hesitation they came to him the three orphans crawling into the safety of the angels embrace its penchant for violence more than satisfied remy was able to usurp control from the seraphim putting the genie back into the bottle for another time he didnt know how much longer he could continue to do this for the essence of the divine grew more powerful each time it was called upon but that was a worry for another time he had the safety of the children to concern himself with now walking through darkness in the bowels of the ark he held the quivering offspring tight consoling them with words that everything would be all right having no idea if he was lying to them or not stopping he allowed the fire to burn from his hand again to see how far theyd come to say that he was shocked by the sight of dead grigori bodies strewn about the ground was an understatement even more shocking was the sight of francis and armaros hey the former guardian angel said he clutched what looked to be a bavarian warhammer in one hand while supporting armaros with the other sorry im late didnt think theyd start the party without me armaros pulled away from francis and opened his arms to the chimerian orphans you saved them he said as the three children leapt from remys arms to go to the grigori but theyre the only ones remy said sadly francis was staring at the chimerian children and by the look on his face he clearly was not sure what to think how does sariel feel about that he asked sariels dead remy said coldly francis nodded then reached out a tentative hand to pat one of the bald chimerian heads the child growled swatting at the offending hand with its razorsharp claws cute francis said as he quickly pulled his hand back he has his daddys charming disposition he was going to kill them remy said speaking of sariel because they had the audacity to survive francis nudged one of the grigori corpses with the toe of his shoe and he wasnt the only one with that bad attitude the wayward guardian then sighed and slung the medieval weapon over his shoulder so what now he asked anything else that needs to be killed remy looked to armaros for an answer sariel is dead but the grigori still live he said holding the chimerian children they were falling asleep their large heads bobbing they wont give up that easily were going to need a safe place until some of this dies down troublemaker francis said from the side of his mouth his comment directed at remy you know me remy responded with a shrug francis nodded rolling his eyes where will you go remy asked armaros who had already started to turn away from them perhaps it is better that you dont know the fallen angel said carrying the sleeping orphans farther into the darkness perhaps its time for the chimerian to again become lost to the world to be swallowed up by the gloom fourteen remy returned to the cottage in maine not really sure why it seemed as good a place as any at the moment he wasnt ready to resume his life to pick up where it had left off with madelines passing it was all too fresh he didnt know if there would ever come a time when it wouldnt still be too fresh there had been a few inches more of snow the winters flailing last attempts to hold on before the inevitable he knew the feeling sitting in the wicker chair on the front porch marlowe lying beside him he tried to imagine life without her she had been his hold on the world the thing that kept him from becoming like the grigori and the others of his heavenly ilk she was his soul and now with her gone remy tried to think of something elseanything else a few days past as much as he was loath to admit it the fallen angel sariel had provided him with something he desperately needed something that took him away from his thoughts and pain distraction if there was one thing for which he owed the grigori leader it was that he had temporarily taken remy from his sadness and he had liked how it felt he crossed his legs pulling the cuff of his jeans down below his ankle covering the top of his work boot from the porch he stared out over the driveway into the dark woods at the snowcovered trees and beyond staring into the future what marlowe asked suddenly alerted following remys gaze probably hoping that his master had seen some food attempting to escape the dog scrambled to his feet with a bark walking to the edge of the porch and sniffing the cool air just in case do you see it remy asked feeling the darkness calling to him wo marlowe grumbled turning back to him his thick black tail starting to wag nervously remy smiled placing both feet on the floor and leaning forward in the chair hands open to marlowe marlowe came to him happily eating up the affection it mustve been nothing he told the dog allowing the animal to lick his face but remy knew it was there waiting to take him away a diversion from the heartache a distraction found in the affairs of angels
