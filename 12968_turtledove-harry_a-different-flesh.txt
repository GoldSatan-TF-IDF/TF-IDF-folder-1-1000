a different flesh by harry turtledove synopsis how would we treat our cousin neanderthal man if he were alive today in this alternate history bands of homo erectus had crossed the siberian land bridges to america but no modern humans made the same trip later the world where sims the european settlers name for homo erectus rather than indians live is different from ours north america would have been easier for europeans to settle than it was in our history where the indians were strong enough to slow if not to stop the expansion the presence of sims intel igent beings but different from and less than us shaped european thought those sims were enough like us to be very useful different enough from us to be exploited with minimal guilt and too weak to resist effectively for themselves the urge to treat them better would have to come from the ranks of humanity and to compete against the many reasons some of them arguably valid for continuing exploitation this is the story of europeans conquoring the new world and the story of the sims as theyy move from slavery to true humanity this is a work of fiction al the characters and events portrayed in this book are fictional and

newyork ny when two organisms overlap too closely in a single environmental niche they compete it may not be purposeful the organisms may not have the kind of brains that will make anything at al purposeful but they will compete just the same they will try to use the same habitats live on the same food and it is very likely that one will prove a bit more efficient than the other the stronger will beat off damage or kill the weaker the better hunter or forager will leave the poorer to starve it is one of the mechanisms of evolution usually expressed by the cliche survival of the fittest except that you define the fittest as the one who survives so that you have a nice circular argument to get a bit closer to home we dont know exactly what killed off the australopithecines after their having lived in eastern and southern africa for two million years but it may well be that genus homo wittingly or unwittingly helped and homo erectus may have been done in at least to some extent by homo sapiens while the neanderthal variety of the latter was in turn done in by the modern variety we cant put ourselves into the minds of homo erectus or australopithecus africanus let alone into what might pass as the mind of trannosaurus rex but we know very well what our own minds are like we have minds that make it possible for us to know what we are doing when we cal ously mistreat others who are very much like ourselves and do you know what we do we rationalize our cruelty and justify ourselves and even make ourselves sound moral and noble here is the first example i know of immediately after the flood according to the bible noah planted a vineyard made wine drank it and was drunken and his youngest son ham the father of canaan didnt show the old man the proper respect the bible doesnt go into detail noah therefore said cursed be canaan a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren genesis in the time of king david and king solomon the israelites control ed al of canaan and enslaved the canaanites and put them to forced labor it was not because the israelites were a master race and did as master races always do not at all they did it they said because of a biblical curse on canaan one that was undoubtedly inserted into the bible after the fact very well then that was ancient times and people were primitive and knew no better however in modern times it was suggested that ham the youngest son of noah was a black and the ancestor of all the blacks that have existed since this of course is entirely wrong ear the canaanites if we go by linguistic divisions were as semitic as the israelites the arameans the babylonians and the arabs they were not blacks however it suited the slavemasters of europe and america to pretend that ham was black because that made black slavery a divine institution and placed the blacks under that same curse the israelites had made use of three thousand years before when preachers from the slave states said that the bible enjoined black slavery noahs curse was what they referred to in fact you dont have to refer to a particular biblical verse to make yourself sound moral and noble after all when you enslave a black you free him from his slavery to his superstitions his false religions his primitive way of life and you introduce him to the benefits of christianity and save his soul since his soul is worth infinitely more than everything else he possesses or can possess you are doing the slave an enormous favor by enslaving him and youre earning for yourself kudos in heaven and flights of angels will sing you to your rest for being a noble slaveowner if you think that slaveowners didnt use this argument to justify themselves you are very naive in fact to slaveowners slaves were always responsible for their own slavery to aristotle that great greek thinker those people who werent greeks were slaves by nature these barbarians socalled because they didnt talk peopletalk the way the greeks did but made uncouth incomprehensible sounds like barbar being natural slaves were natural y enslaved you do them a favor obviously by letting them be what they naturally are the very word slave comes i believe from slav since to the romans and the germans slavs were slaves by nature its not even just slavery the german nazis killed hosts of jews poles russians gypsies and others did they do it because they were bloodthirsty ravening beasts not to hear them tel it they were purifying the race and getting rid of disgusting submen for the benefit of true humanity im sure they thoroughly expected the gratitude of al decent people for their noble deeds and we americans as well there is a story that the turkish sultan abdul hamid ii a bloody and villainous tyrant visited the united states once and was tackled over the matter of the armenian massacres in response he looked about him calmly and said where are your indians yes indeed we wiped them out it was their land but we didnt enslave them we killed them we kil ed them in defiance of treaties we kil ed them when they tried to assert their legal rights under those treaties and we killed them when they submitted and did not defend themselves and we had no qualms about it they were savages and we were doing gods work by ridding the earth of them there is a possibly apocryphal story that after custers last stand the massacre at little big horn its only a massacre when white men get kil ed a comanche chief was introduced to general sheridan a northern hero of the civil war the comanche said me tachaway me good indian to this general sheridan is reported to have replied the only good indians i ever saw were dead a very nice genocidal remark the history of human cruelty is revolting enough but the history of human justification thereof is infinitely more revolting would it be any different in an alternate world where homo erectus still existed alongside of us would we treat our evolutionary cousins any better than weve ever treated our own kind harry turtledove takes a hard look at this question in a different flesh and comes up with some answers wed probably just as soon not hear preface where doyou get your ideas ive never known a science fiction writer who hasnt been asked that question a good many times im no exception and as is true of most of my col eagues the answers i give often leave guestioners unsatisfied ive had ideas doing the dishes taking a shower driving the freeway i dont know why they show up at times like those they just seem to sometimes ideas come because two things that by rights ought to be wildly separate somehow merge in a writers mind i had just finished watching the winter olympics when i happened to look at a voyager picture of saturns moon mimas the one with the enormous crater that has a huge oentral peak i wondered what skijumping down that enormous mountain under that tiny gravity would be like a story followed shortly and sometimes ideas come because you look for them like most sciencefiction writers i read a lot in late i was idly wondering how we would treat our primitive ancestor australopithecus if he were alive today what i think of as my storydetector light went on how would we treat our poor notquitesobright relations if we met them today i soon dismissed the very primitive australopithecus as far as anyone knows he lived only in africa but homo crectus modern mans immediate ancestor was widespread in the old world what if i thought bands of homo erectus had crossed the siberian land bridges to america and what if no modern humans made the same trip later that whatif was the origin of the book you hold in your hands the world where sims the european settlers name for homo erectus rather than indians inhabit the new world is differem from ours in several ways for one thing the grand fauna of the pleistocene mammoths sabertooth tigers ground sloths glyptodons what have you might well have survived to the present day sims would be less efficient hunters than indians and would not have helped hurry the great beasts into extinction human history starts looking different too north america would have been easier for europeans to settle than it was in our history where the indians were strong enough to slow if not to stop the expansion central and south america on the other hand would have been more difficult spanish colonial society was based on the ruins of the american indian empires and spain without the loot it plundered from the indians probably would not have dominated sixteenthcentury europe to the extent it did in our history also the presence of sims intel igent beings but different from and less than us could not have failed to have a powerful effect on european thought where did they come from what was their relationship to humans having these questions posed so forcefully might well have led thinkers toward the idea of evolution long before darwin sims might also make us look rather more careful y at the differences between various groups of ourselves to return to goulds question how would we treat sims i fear that the short answer is not very well they are enough like us to be very useful different enough from us to be exploited with minimal guilt and too weak to resist effectively for themselves the urge to treat them better would have to come from the ranks of humanity and to compete against the many reasons some of them arguably valid for continuing exploitation the proper study of mankind is man true enough sims can i hope help us look at ourselves by reflecting our view at an angle different from any we can get in this world come to think of it thats one of the things science fiction in general can do thats why its fun viled bead simia quam similis turpissama hestia nobis the ape vilest beast how like us ennius quoted in cicero de natura deorum found the new world a very different land from the one they had left no people came down to the seashore to greet their ships before the arrival of european settlers there were no people in north or south america the most nearly human creatures present in the americas were sims in the old world sims have been extinct for hundreds of thousands of years fossils of creatures very much like presentday sims have been found in east africa on the island of java and in caves not far from pekin china sims must have crossed a land bridge from asia to north america during an early glacial period of the ice age when the sea level was much lower than it is now at the time when humans discovered the new world smal hunting and gathering bands of sims lived throughout north and south america their lives were more primitive than those of any human beings for they knew how to make onty the most basic stone and wood tools and were not even able to make fire for themselves although they could use and maintain it if they found it paradoxically this very primitiveness makes them interesting to anthropologists who see in them an il ustration of how humanitys ancient ancestors must have lived despite their lack of weapons more formidable than chipped stones and sticks with firehardened points sims often proved dangerous to colonists in the early days of european settlement of the new world as they learned to cope with attacks from bands of sims the settlers also had to learn new farming techniques needed for soils and climates different from those of their native lands hunger was their constant companion in the early years of the colonies another reason for this was the necessity of bringing al seed grain across the atlantic until surpluses could be built up the americas offered no native equivalent of wheat rye or barley for settlers to use sims of course knew nothing of agriculture nevertheless the spaniards and portuguese succeeded in establishing colonies in central and south america during the sixteen century the first english settlers in what is now the federated commonwealths was at jamestown virginia in from the story of the federated commonwealths by ernest simpson reproduced by permission a different flesh after thirty mild english summers july in virginia smote edward wingfield like a blast from hell sweat poured off him as he tramped through the forest a few miles from jamestown in search of game it clung greasily in the humid heat he held his crossbow cocked and ready he also carried a loaded pistol in each boot but the crossbow was silent and accurate at longer range and it wasted no precious powder the guns were only for emergencies wingfield studied the dappled shadows a little past noon he guessed before long he would have to turn round and head home for the colony he had had a fairly good day two rabbits several small birds and a fat gray squirrel hung from his belt he looked forward to fal and the harvest if al went well this year the colony would final y have enough wheat for bread and porridge and ale how he wished how al the europeans wished that this godforsaken new world offered wheat or barley or even oats of its own but it did not so al seed grain had to cross the atlantic jamestown had lived mostly on game and roots for three years now lean and leathery wingfield had forgotten what a hot fresh loaf tasted like he remembered only that it was wonderful something stirred in the undergrowth ahead he froze the motion came again he spied a fine plump rabbit its beady black eyes alert its ears cocked for danger moving slowly and steadily hardly breathing he raised the crossbow to his shoulder aimed down the bolt once the rabbit looked toward him he stopped moving again until it turned its head away he pressed the trigger the bolt darted and slammed into a treetrunk a fingers breadth above the rabbits ear the beast bounded away hellfire wingfield dashed after it yanking out one of his pistols he almost tripped over the outflung branch of a grapevine the vines main stock was as big around as his calf virginia grapes and the rough wine the colonists made from them were among the few things that helped keep jamestown bearable the panicstricken rabbit instead of diving into the bushes for cover and losing itself there burst past a screen of brush into a clearing your last mistake beastly wingfield cried in triumph he crashed through the brush himself swinging up the gun as he did so then the rabbit was almost to the other side of the clearing he saw it thrashing in the grass there wingfiel paused puzzled had a ferret torn out its throat as it scampered along oblivious to everything but its pursuer then his grip tightened on the trigger for a sim emerged from a thicket and ran toward the rabbit it had not seen him it bent down by the writhing beast if smashed in the rabbits head with a rock undoubtedly it had used another to bring the animal down sims were deadly accurate throwing sharpened stones wingfield stepped into the clearing the colony was too hungry to let food go the sim heard him it rose clutching the bloody rock in a large knobbyknuclcled hand it was about as tall as the englishman and naked but for its own abundant hair its long chinless jaw opened to let out a hoot of dismay wingfield gestured with the pistol sims had no fore heads to speak of above their boneridged brows but they had learned the colonists weapons slew at a distance greater than they could cast their rocks usually these days they retreated instead of proving the lesson over again this one though stood its ground baring broad yellow teeth in a threatening grimace wingfield gestured again more sharply and hoped he seemed more confident than he felt if his first shot missed or even wounded but failed to kill he would have to grab for his other gun while the sim charged and pistolrange was not that much more than a stones throw then the bushes quivered on the far side of the clearing and a second sim came out to stand behind its fel ow this one carried a large sharpedged rock ready to hurl it shook its other fist at wingfield and shouted angrily it was the englishmans turn to grind his teeth if both sims rushed him he would never have the chance to reload either a pistol or his crossbow the odds of stopping them with just two shots were not worth betting his life on not for a rabbit and if they did kil him they would not content themselves with the game he carried they would eat him too raising the pistol in a final warning he drew back into the woods the sims mocking cries followed him he hated the filthy animals if they were animals close to a century had passed since the spaniards brought the first pair back to cadiz from their coastal fortress of veracruz churchmen and scholars were still arguing furiously over whether sims were mere brute beasts or human beings at the moment wingfield was ready to hate them no matter what they were he found the tree where he had shot at the rabbit the sims were now doubtless gulping down raw he managed to cut himself while he was digging out the crossbow bolt with his knife that did nothing to improve his temper had he shot straight in the first place he would not have put himself in the humiliating position of backing down from sims thinking such dark thoughts wingfield turned back toward jamestown he scratched at his nose as he walked along and felt skin peel under his nails one more annoyance he was too fair not to burn in this climate but found wearing a hat equal y intolerable on his way home he knocked over a couple of quail and one of the native beasts that looked like giant widefaced rats but tasted much better that improved his mood a little he was still grumbling when allan cooper hailed him from the edge of the cleared ground thinking of the guards misery made him ashamed of his own bad temper cooper wore a gleaming backand breast with thick padding beneath a heavy plumed morion sat on his head in that armor he had to be steaming like a lobsoer boiled in its own shel yet he managed a cheery brave for wingfield good bag you have there he called it should be better by one hare wingfield replied pique flaring again he explained how he had lost the beast to the sims aye well no help for such things sometimes not two on one cooper sighed and wingfield felt relief at having his judgment sustained by a professional soldier the guard went on the thieving devils are robbing us again too henry dale came in emptyhanded this afternoon swearing foul enough to damn himself on the spot if swearing damns a man henry was smelling brimstone long years ere this wingfield observed cooper laughed you speak naught but the truth there though i dont blame him for his fury this time sims are worse than foxes ever were foxes have no hands he hefted his matchlock musket without guns wed never keep them from our own animals and how often have they raided the henhouse too many times wingfield turned to a less goomy subject how is cecil doing splendidly cooper said his voice ful of pride the lad will be three months tomorrow cecil cooper was jamestowns oldest child the first ship carrying women had reached virginia only a year before wingfield had a daughter joanna only a few weeks younger than the guards son he left cooper and walked down the muddy path through the fields several rows of thatchroofed cabins stood by the log stockade that mounted cannon on the other side of the fortress were longer rows of graves more than half of the orginal three shiploads of colonists had died from starvation or disease a couple of the newest burials were pathetically smal even back in england so many infants did not live to grow up and life was far harsher here but the marker that grieved wingfield most was one of the oldest the one showing where captain john smith lay always eager to explore he had set about learning the countryside from the day the english landed until the sims killed him three months later without him the settlement seemed to have a lesser sense of drive of purpose still it went on as people and their works do several colonists swung the gates of the fortress open so others could drive in the pigs goats and oxen for the night to protect them from the sims and other predators the pigs and goats which ate anything they came across throve in this new land the oxen had the same gaunt look as most of the colonists wingfields cabin was in the outer row closest to the forest smoke rose from the chimney as he approached the door stood open to let in what air would come hearing her husbands step anne wingfield came out to greet him he hugged her close so glad she had chosen to spend her life with him she had had her pick of suitors as was true of all the women in virginia men outnumbered them four to one she exclaimed in pleasure at how much game he had brought home back in london she would have been nothing special to look at a rather husky darkhaired girl in her early twenties with strong features if anything handsome rather than pretty on this side of the atlantic though she was by definition a beauty and how is joanna wingfield asked as his wife skinned and disjointed his two rabbits and tossed the meat into the stewpot the rabbits shared it with a small piece of stale venison from a couple of days before and a mess of wild onions beechnuts mushrooms and roots the smell was heavenly asleep now anne said nodding toward the cradle but very well she smiled at me again this morning maybe next time she will do it in the night so i may see it too i hope she will while they waited for the rabbits to cook they dealt with the rest of wingfields catch cutting the meat into thin strips and setting them on racks over the fire to dry and smoke after what seemed an eternity anne ladled the stew into wooden bowls wingfield licked his clean though matters were not so grim as they had been the first couple of dreadful winters he was always hungry i would have had another cony but for the sims he said and told anne of the confrontation her hand jumped to her mouth those horrid beasts they should al be hunted down and slain ere they harm any more of our good englishmen what would i have done here alone save only for joanna had they hurt you no need to fret over mighthavebeens im here and hale he reassured her and got up and embraced her for good measure as for the sims if they be men slaying them out of hand so would burden us with a great weight of sin when we are cal ed to the almighty they are no creatures of his anne returned but rather of the devil the best he could do toward making true humankind ive heard that argument before to me it smacks of the manichean heresy only god has the power to create not satan then why did he shape such vile parodies of ourselves his finest creatures the sims know nothing of farming or weaving or any useful art they cannot even set fires to cook the beasts they run down like dogs but they know fire though i grant they cannot make it yet whenever lightning sets a blaze some sim will play prometheus and seize a burning brand they keep the flames alive as long as they may till they lose them from rain or sheer recklessness anne set hands on hips gave wingfield a dangerous look when last we hashed this over as i recol ect twas you who reckoned the sims animals and i the contrary why this reversal why yours save your concern for me he came back i thank you fort but the topics fit to take from either side i tell you frankly i cannot riddle it out in certain but am changeable as a weathervane ever thinking now one thing now the other and i and everyone anne sighed but if they put you in danger my heart cannot believe them true men no mater what my head might say he reached out to set his fingers gently on her arm the tender gesture was spoiled when a mosquito spiraled down land on the back of his hand the swamps round al jamestown bred them in throngs worse than any he had known in england he swatted at the bug but it flew off before the deathblow landed outside someone struck up a tune on the mandolin and someone else joined in with a drum voices soared in song the settlers had only the amusements they could make for themselves wingfield looked out saw a torchlit circle dance forming he bobbed his head toward his wife would it please you to join them another time she said joanna will be waking soon and hungry we could step outside and watch though wingfield agreed at once any excuse to get out of the hot smelly cabin was a good one suitors were buzzing as avidly as the mosquitoes round the few young women who had not yet chosen husbands some of those maids owned distinctly fragile reputations with no others to choose from this side of the sea they were courted nonetheless oh my dear what would you have me do cried a roguish lad as she turned herback on him go off to the woods and marry a sim laughter rose hearty from the men who heard him halfhorrified squeals from the women al an cooper says the spaniards do that or anyway cohabit wingfield told anne spain held a string of outposts down to magel ans strait and then up the western coast of south america to serve her galleons plying the rich trade with the indies have they not read deuteronomy anne exclaimed her lip curling in disgust then curiosity got the better of her and she whispered can there be issue from such unions in truth i dont know as al an says whos to tell the difference betwixt the get of a spanish sire and that of a sim anne blinked then burst into giggles at the bawdy slander against englands longtime foe before long both she and her husband were yawning the unnremitting labor of building the colony left scant energy for leisure or anything else still wingfield hesitated before he blew out the last lamp in the cabin he glanced toward anne and saw an answering flush rise from her throat to her cheeks she was recovered now from the ordeal of childbirth perhaps tonight they might start a son he was about to take anne in his arms when joanna let out a yowl he stopped short his wife started to laugh she bared a breast let me feed her quickly and put her back to sleep then why we shall see what we shall see indeed we shall wingfield lay down on the lumpy strawstuffed bed to wait he knew at once he had made a mistake but fell asleep before he could do anything about it anne stuck out her tongue at him when the sun woke him the next morning she skipped back when he reached for her this even she promised we have too much to do of the day to waste it lying abed he grimaced you have a hateful way of being right he scrambled into trousers and boots set a plumed hat on his head to shield him from the sun the plume was a bright pheasants feather from england now sadly battered soon he would have to replace it with a dul er turkey tail feather he was finishing a bowl of last nights stew strong but stil eatable when someone knocked on the cabin door there you see anne said hush he opened the door henry dale came in he was a short fussy man whose ruddy complexion and tightly held jaw gave clues to his temper after dipping his head to anne he said edward what say we set a few snares today mayhap if fortune favors us in spots where no knavish sims will come on them to go apoaching good enough allan cooper told me how you were robbed yesterday annes presence plainly was the only thing keeping dale from exploding with fury he limited himself to a single strangled aye after a few moments he went on shall we be about it then wingfield checked his pistols tucked a bundle of cross bow bolts into his beltpouch nodded after a too brief embrace with his wife he followed dale out into the bright morning colonists were already weeding hoeing waoering in the fields caleb lucas shooed a goat away from the fresh green stalks of wheat speeding it on with a kick that brought an indignant bleat from the beast and the very same to you lucas cal ed after it damned impudent beast you can find victuals anywhere so why thieve your betters meals belike the foolish creature thinks itself a sim dale grunted watching the goat scurry for the edge of the woods where it began browsing on shoots it lacks the accursed losels effrontery though for it will not turn on its natural masters the sims now those whoreson beetle headed flapeard stinkards without pausing but to draw breath he continued in that vein until he and wingfield were surrounded by forest as had annes remarks the night before his diatribe roused wingfields contentious nature were they such base animals as you claim he said the sims would long since have exterminated one another and not been here for us to find on our landing dale gave him a look filled with dislike for all we know they wel nigh did twas not on us they began their habits anthropophagous if they were eating each other henry and you style them anthropophagous does that not make men of them wingfield asked mildly his companion spluttered and turned even redder than usual a robin twittered among the leaves so the colonists named the bird at any rate but it was not the redbreast of england it was big and fat and stupid its underparts the color of brick not fire it was however easy to kill and quite tasty there were other sounds in the woods too somewhere far off wingfield heard the deepthroated barking cries of the sims so did henry dale he spat deliberately between his feet what men speak so he demanded even captured and tamed as much as one may tame the beasts they do but point and gape and make dumb show as a horse will seeking to be led to manger those calls have meaning to them wingfield said oh aye belike a wolf in a trap will howl so piteously it frightens its fellows away has he then a language having no good answer to that wingfield prudently kept silent as the two men walked they looked for signs to betray the presence of smal game dale who was an able woodsman when amiable spotted the fresh droppings that told of a woodchuck run a good place for a snare he said but even as he was preparing to cut a noose his comrade found a track in the soft ground to the side of the run the mark of a large bare foot leave be henry he advised the sims have been here before us whats that you say dale came over to look at the footprint one of the settlers might have made it but they habitual y went shod with a disgusoed grunt dale stowed away the twine rot the bleeding blackguards id wish their louseridden souls to hell did i think god granted them any the spaniards baptize them tis said good on them dale said which startled wingfield until he continued a papist baptism by jesus is the most certain highroad to hell of any i know they walked on wingfield munched on late ripening wild strawberries larger and sweeter than any that grew in england he spotted a woodchuck ambling from tussock to tussock this time he aimed with special care and his shot knocked the beast over dale grunted again now in approval he had bagged nothing more than a couple of songbirds they did find places to set several new snares simple drag nooses hanging snares made from slip nooses fasened to the ends of saplings and fixed snares set near bushes the latter were especially good for catching rabbits they also visited the snares already set a horrible stench announced that one of those had taken a blackandwhite new world polecat skinned and butchered to remove the scent glands the beast made good eating wingfield and dale tossed a copper penny to see who would have to carry it home wingfield lost two traps had been sprung but held no game there were fresh sim footprints around both dales remarkes were colorful and inventive the englishmen headed back toward jamestown not long after the sun began to wester they took a route different from the one they had used on the way out several traps remained to be checked a small brownandwhitestriped ground squirrel scurried away from wingfields boot it darted into a clump of cockleburs a moment later both hunters leaped back in surprise as the little animal was flung headhigh kicking in a noose when a bent sapling suddenly sprang erect marry dale said i dont recall setting a snare there perhaps it was someone else at al odds good luck we happened along now wingfield walked over to retrieve the ground squirrel which now hung limp he frowned as he undid the noose from around its neck who uses sinew for his traps no one i know dale said twine is far easier to work with hmm wingfield was examining the way the sinew was bound to the top of the sapling it had not been tied at al only wrapped around and around several twigs until finaly in place have a look at this will you henry dale looked grunted turned away wingfields voice pursued him what animals make traps henry aye well this is the first weve seen in all the time weve been this side of the atlantic i take that to mean the sims but ape us as a jackdaw will human speech without having the divine spark of wit to devise any such thing for themselves damn and blast man if a dog learns to walk upon his hinder feet is he then deserving of a seat in parliament more than some who have them now wingfield observed both men laughed dale reached for the ground squirrel tossed it into the bag with the rest of the game he carried his crooked teeth flashed in a rare grin it does my heart good to rob the vermin this once instead of the other way round his good humor vanished when he and wingfield returned to the settlement they found not only allan cooper and the other three guards armed and armored but also a double handful more men that morning a sim had burst out of the woods smashed in a goats skull with a rock flung the animal under an arm and escaped before the startled englishmen could do anything i shot but i missed cooper raid morosely its a poor trade for a ground squirrel henry wingfield remarked his hunting partners scowl was midnight black the mangy pests grow too bold just the other night they slaughtered a hound outside the stockade hacked it to pieces with their stones and were eating the flesh raw when at last the sentry came round with his torch and spied them he missed too dale finished with a sidelong look at cooper and would you care to draw a conclusion from that the guard asked his hand caressed the hilt of his rapier henry dale hesitated as a gentleman he was trained to the sword but liverish temper or no he was not a fool cooper had learned in a harsher school than his and survived at last dale said i draw the same conclusion as would any man of sense that our best course is to rid ourselves of these pestiferous sims forthwith as wolves and other vicious creatures have long been hunted out of england i hold to war henry on being attacked but not to murder cooper said mind we must seem as outlandish to them as they to us killing a sim is no more murder than butchering a pig dale retorted the endless debate started up again having no desire to join in another round wingfield took his share of the game back to his cabin anne was changing joannas soiled linen she looked up with a wan smile theres no end tot the baby kicked her legs and smiled toothlessly at her father he felt his own tight expression soften he plucked the songbirds skinned the polecat set the hide aside to be tanned he gutted the birds and tossed their little naked bodies into the stewpot whole he threw the offal outside for the pigs or dogs to find the black and white polecat required more skil ful butchery for it had to be cut into pieces before the scent glands were removed thank you dear anne rocked joanna in her arms shes getting hungry arent you sweet one what say i feed you now so you let us eat in peace afterwards can you tend to the stew edward of course he stirred the bubbling contents of the pot with a wooden spoon now and again he tossed in a dash of dried powdered herbs or a pinch of grayish seasalt joanna nursed lustily then fel asleep the stew began to smell savory anne was about to ladle it into bowls when the baby wet herself and started crying again her mother gave wingfield a look of mingled amusement and despair go on with what you were about he told her ill tend to joanna anne sighed gratefully wingfield tossed the soggy linen into the pile with the rest for tomorrows washing he found a dry cloth wrapped the babys loins and set her in her cradle anne rocked it while they ate joanna tolerated not being held but showed no interest in going back to sleep she squawked indignantly when anne made the mistake of trying to turn her onto her belly and remained irritated enough to stay awake even after her mother picked her up her fussy cries rang loud in the small cabin after a while wingfield thrust a torch into the fire lets walk her about outside he suggested that often seems to calm her anne agreed at once she rocked the baby in her arms while her husband held the torch high so they would not stumble in the darkness with his free hand he batted at the insects the torch drew the james river splashed against the low swampy peninsula on which jamestown sat and murmured as it flowed by unimpeded to the south above it on this clear moonless night the milky way glowed like pale mist among the stars of the scorpion and the archer elsewhere but for silver points the sky was black even blacker against it loomed the forest to the north suddenly wingfield felt how tiny was the circle of light his torch cast as tiny as the mark the english had made on this vast new land the comparison disturbed him from the edge of the forest came the cries of sims calling back and forth wingfield wondered how much meaning lay behind them those bestial ululations could hardly be true speech henry dale was right there but they were much more varied more complex than a wolfpacks howls anne shivered though the night was warm let us go back i take fright hearing them so close i mislike it also wingfield said turning round we are not yet here in numbers enough to keep them from drawing nigh as they wish be glad though you were stil in dear england those first two years when they thought us and ours some new sort of prey for their hunting he touched the knife on his belt weve taught them better than that at any rate ive heard the tales anne said quietly wingfield nodded as was the way of things though not all the tales got told he had been one of the men who brought john smiths body back for burial he knew how little of it rested under its stone awaiting the resurrection to his mind the sims maneating habits gave strong cause to doubt they had souls if one man devoured anothers flesh to whose body would that flesh return come the day of judgment as far as he knew no learned divine had yet solved that riddle such profitless musings occupied him on the way back to the cabin once inside anne set joanna back in the cradle the baby sighed but stayed asleep she probably would not rouse till the small hours of the morning the embers in the fireplace cast a dying red glow over the single room wingfield stripped off his clothes in the sultry virginia summer nightwear was a positive nuisance anne lay down beside him he stroked her smooth shoulder she turned toward him her eyes were enormous in the dim light here it is evening he said at the same time as she was whispering this even is it not they laughed until he silenced her with a kiss afterwards he felt his heart slow as he drifted toward slumber he was hotter than he had been before and did not mind at all the warmth of the body was very different from that of the weather he did not know why that was so but it was anne was already breathing deeply and smoothly he gave up thought and joined her he was never sure what exactly woke him some hours later he usual y slept like a log til morning even joannas cries would not stir him though anne came out of bed at once for them and this noise was far sofoer than any the baby made maybe what roused him was the breeze from the open cabin door his eyes opened his hand went for his knife even before he consciously saw the two figures silhouetted in the doorway thieves was his first thought the colonists had so few goods from england that theft was always a problem the threat of the whippingpost not withstanding then the breeze brought him the smel of the invaders the englishmen bathed seldom they were of often rank but this was a thicker almost cloying stench as if skin and water had never made acquaintance and the shape of those heads outlined against the night ice ran through wingfield sims he cried bounding to his feet anne screamed the sims shouted one sprang at wingfield he saw its arm go back as if to stab and knew it must have one of its sharpened stones to hand that could let out a life as easily as his own dagger he knocked the stroke aside with his left forearm and felt his hand go numb the sims were devilish strong he thrust with his right and felt his blade bite flesh the sim yammered but the wound was not mortal the sim grappled with him they rol ed over and over on the dirt floor each grabbing for the others weapon and using every fighting trick he knew the sim might have had less skil than wingfield but was physically powerful enough to make up for it a tiny corner of wingfields awareness noticed the other sim scuttling toward the hearth he heard anne shriek mother mary the baby bold as a tigress she leapt at the sim her hands clawed but it stretched her senseless with a backhand blow at almost the same moment the sim wingfield was battling tore its right arm free from the weakened grasp of his left he could not ward off the blow it aimed but partially deflected it so that the flat front of the stone rather than the edge met his forehead the world flared for a moment then grayed over he could not have been unconscious long he was already aware of himself and of the pounding anguish in his head when someone forced a brandy bottle into his mouth he choked and sputtered spraying out most of the fiery liquid he tried to sit hands supported his back and shoulders he could not understand why the torch caleb lucas held was so blurred until he raised his arm to his eyes and wiped away blood lucas offered the brandy again this time wingfield got it down healing warmth spread from his middle then he remembered what had happened with one sim while he fought the other and he went cold again anne he cried he looked about wildly and moaned when he saw a blanketcovered form on the floor not far from him no fear not edward she is but stunned said allan coopers wife caite a strong steady woman a few years older than anne we cast the bedding over her to hide her nakedness no more oh god be thanked wingfield gasped but cooper began then looked helplessly at his wife not sure how to go on he seemed to make up his mind he and lucas bent by wingfield together they manhandled wingfield to his feet guided his stumbling steps over to joannas cradle he moaned again it was empty anne sat on a hard wooden chair her face buried in her hands she had not stopped sobbing since she returned to her senses she rocked back and forth in unending grief god god god have mercy on my dear joanna she wailed i will get her back wingield said or take such a vengeance that no sim shal dare venture within miles of an englishman ever again i want no vengeance anne cried i want my darling babe again the colonists first efforts at pursuit had already failed they had set dogs on the sims trail less than an hour after the attack with the blood wingfield had drawn the trail had been fresh and clear only for a while though the ground north of jamestown was so full of ponds and streams that the dogs lost the scent further tracking had to wait for daylight and with every passing minute the sims took themselves farther away why anne asked the question was not directed at anyone why should even such heartless brutes snatch up a defenseless babe what are they doing to her wingfields imagination conjured up a horde of possibilities each worse than the one before he knew he could never mention even the least of them to his wife but her first agonized question puzzled him as well he had never heard of the sims acting as they had that night they kil ed but they did not capture he felt heartsick anew as he worked out the implications of what caleb lucas said i fear me they but sought special y tender flesh he spoke softly so anne would not hear wingfield shook his head the motion hurt why take so great a risk for such small game he gritted his teeth at speaking of joanna so but went on they would have gained more meat by waiting until one of us stepped outside his cabin to ease himself striking him down and making away with him if they had been cunning they might have escaped notice till dawn wherefore then lucas asked wingfield could only spread his hands what do you purpose doing now al an cooper added as i told anne wingfield said rising his head stil throbbed dreadfully and he was wobbly on his feet but purpose gave his voice iron i will search out the places where the sims encamp in their wanderings and look for traces of joanna if god grant i find her living ill undertake a rescue if it be otherwise henry dale stuck his head in the cabin door his lips stretched back in a savage grin then kill them all he finished for wingfield twere best you do it anyhow at first encounter no wingfield said nor anyone else on my behalf i pray you until i have oertain knowledge my daughter is dead i needs must act as if she yet lives and do nothing to jeopardize her fate a wholesale slaughter of sims might well inflame them al what cares one pack of beasts what befalls another dale asked scornful y allan cooper had a comment more to the pointshould you fare forth alone edward i greatly doubt youd work a wholesale slaughter in any case more likely the sims would slay you that set off fresh paroxysms of weeping from anne wingfield looked daggers at the guard i can but do my best my hunting has taught me somewhat of woodscraft and bul et and bolt strike harder and farther than stones he spoke mostly for his wifes benefit he knew too well cooper was probably right still he went on youd try no less were it your cecil oh aye so i would cooper said you misunderstand me though my thought was to come with you and i henry dale said caleb lucas echoed him a moment later tears stung wingfields eyes anne leapt from her chair and kissed each of his friends in turn at any other time that would have shocked and angered him now he thought it no less than their due yet fear for his daughter forced expedience from him he said henry i know your skill amongst the trees but what of you al an stealth is paramount here and clanking about armored a poor preparation fort fear not on my score cooper said or ever i took the royal shilling i had some nodding acquaintanoe with the crowns estates and the game on them he grinned slyly wingfield asked no more questions if cooper had made hisliving poaching he would never say so straight out what will the council say though allan dale demanded they will not take kindly to a guardsman baring off at wild adventure then damnation take them cooper replied am i not a free englishman able to do as i will rather than harken to carping fools every subjects duty is to the kings but every subjects soul is his own wel spoken imitate the action of the tiger cried caleb lucas giving back one quote from shakespeare for another the other three men were careful y studying him wingfield said you will correct me if i am wrong caleb but ist not so your only forays into the forest have been as a lumberer the young man gave a reluctant nod he opened his mouth to speak but dale forestalled him then you must stay behind edward has reason in judging this a task for none but the woodswise wingfield set a hand on lucass shoulder no sense in anger or disappointment caleb i know the offer came in al sincerity and i anne echoed softly lucas jerked his head in acknowledgment and left lets be at it then cooper said to our weapons then meet here and away wingfield knew the guard had no hope of finding joanna alive when he heard cooper warn henry dale fetch plenty of powder and bullets dales brusque nod said the same before noon the three men reached the spot where the dogs had lost the sims scent as wingfield had known it would the trail led through the marshes that made up so much of the peninsula on which jamestown lay by unspoken consent he and his companions paused to rest and to scrape at the mud clinging to their boots his crossbow at the ready wingfield looked back the way he had come then to either side for some time now he had had a prickly feeling of being watched though he told himself a sim would have to be mad to go so near the english settlement after the outrage of the night before but cooper and dale also seemed uneasy the guard rubbed his chin saying i like this not im all ajitter as ive not felt since the poxy spaniards snuck a patrol round our flank in holland wed best push on henry dale said well cast about upstream and down in hopes of picking up tracks again were things otherwise id urge us separate one going one way and two the other to speed the search now he bared his teeth in frustration twere better we stayed in a group the bushes quivered about fifteen paces away three weapons swung up as one but instead of a sim bursting from the undergrowth out came caleb lucas you young idiot we might have shot you cooper snarled his finger was tight on the trigger of his pistol as a veteran soldier he always favored firearms lucas was even filthier than the men he faced his grin flashed in his mudspattered face send me back now if you dare my good sirs these past two hours ive dogged your steps betimes close enough to spit and never did you tumble to it have i not then sufficient of the woodsmans art to accompany you farther wingfield removed the bolt from his bow released the string i own myself beaten caleb for how should we say you nay the damsels back in town though will take your leaving hard theyll have plenty to company them whilst im gone and shall be there on my return lucas said cheerfully and in sooth edward are we not off to rescue a fair young damsel of our own not wondrous fair perhaps since the little lass favors me but i take your meaning wingfield considered well do as henry proposed before your eruption and divide at the streambank caleb youll come with me this way henry and allan shal take the other half a mile either way then back here to meet a pistolshot to signal a find otherwise we go on as best we can agreed everyone nodded a sergeant to the core cooper mutted as well i dont have caleb with me i want a man to do as hes told unabashed lucas came to such a rigid parody of attention that the others could not help laugh caleb and wingfield hurried along the edge of the creek their heads down herons and whiteplumed egrets flapped away frogs and turtles splashed into the turbid water there lucas said his finger stabbed forth the print of a bare foot was pressed deeply into the mud good on yout wingfield clapped him on the back drew out one pistol and fired it into the air he reloaded in the few minutes before dale and cooper came trotting up dale who was red as a tile grunted when he spied the footprint the brutes did not slip far enough aside eh my hearties well after them the trail ran northwest almost paral eling the james river but moving slowly away it became harder to follow as the ground grew drier and the effort of sticking to it meant the four trackers had to go more slowly than the sims they pursued by evening the englishmen were beyond the territory they knew well explorers had penetrated much farther into the interior of america of course but not all of them had come back and with the colonys survival hanging by so slender a thread exploration for its own sake won scant encouragement at last the thickening twilight made wingfield stop well soon lose the trace he said smacking fist into palm yet i misdoubt the sims push on stil what to do again caleb lucas came to the rescue look there between the two pines ist not a pil ar of smoke mayhap marking one of the sims nests marry it will wingfield turned to allan cooper the most experienced of them at such estimations how far away do you make it the guards eyes narrowed as he thought the sims favor large blazes as being less likely to go out hmm perhaps two twoandahalf miles too far to reach before dark al the better dale said id liefer come on the accursed creatures with them unawares it was too dark to see his face reappear but his whisper was smug the bugss there just so here hands and knees now after me and hell never be the wiser that were so in any case dale retorted but he lowered himself with the others again wingfield caught the thick warm stench from the sim it never sensed him or his comrades who crawled past downwind another proof cooper knew his business the englishmen peered through a last thin screen of bushes at the band of sims perhaps twentyfive were there several slept close to the fire from time to time a grizzled male threw a fresh branch onto it the sim would let it get low but never close to going along with the odors of smoke and sim the air stil held the faint flavor of roasoed or rather burnt meat bones from small game lay about every so often a sim would pick one up and gnaw on it the sims ate anything a female turned over stones and popped the grubs and crawling things it found into its mouth or handed them to the toddling youngster beside it the firekeeper grabbed moths out of the air with praniced skil crunching them between its teeth another younger male was using a hammer made from a piece of antler to chip flakes from a rock it held between its knees wingfield studied the sims with growing disappointment none bore a knife wound and he saw no sign of joanna the three or four infants in the band all bore a finer coat of the dark brown hair that covered their elders one was nursing at its mothers breast and fell asloep in its arms the female sim set it down on a pile of leaves it woke up and started to yowl the mother picked it up and rocked it til it was quiet again allan cooper let out the ghost of a chuckle looks familiar that aye wingfield whispered back we may as well be off weve not found here what we sought to his surprise henry dale said wait he had been watching a pair of sims grooming each other hands scurrying through hair after ticks fleas and iioe the scratchings and pickings had gradually turned to caresses and nuzzlings then the sims coupled by the fire like dogs the male behind the female the rest of the band paid no attention shameless animals dale muttered but he watched avidly until they were through he was wingfield recalled unwed and with his temper had enjoyed no luck among the single women at the settlement unslaked lust could drive a man to madness wingfield remembered the sinful longing with which his own eyes had fol owed a pretty cabin boy aboard the godspeed but even if sure the prohibitions in deuteronomy did not apply he would have let sim females alone forever no matter what vile rumor said spaniards did one could close ones eyes to the ugliness hold ones nose against the stench but how in an embraoe could one keep from noticing the hair the sound of the edge of a hand striking a wrist and a harsh whispered curse snapped wingfield from his lascivious reverie be damned to you right back henry caleb lucas said hotly edward said no kil ings whilst his daughter remains stolen and if you come to his aid you can do his bidding dale picked up his pistol which by good luck had fal en on soft grass and neither made a betraying noise nor discharged the filthy creatures all deserve to die he growled barely bothering to hold his voice low his face was pitiless as a wolfs wingfield abruptly realized dale had never expected to find joanna alive but was along only for revenge if by some stroke of fortune they should come across the baby his comrade might prove more dangerous to her than the sims all he said though was my thanks caleb away now quick as we can come morning well hash out what to do cooper led them away from the sims by the same route they had taken in again they passed by the lone watcher close enough to catch its reek they camped without fire which would have brought sims at a run after gnawing leathery smoked meat they divided the night into four watches and seized what uncomfortable bugridden sleep they could when morning came they took council it makes no sense henry dale complained where was the sim you fought edward none of the beasts round their blaze showed the knifemark you said you set in him i thought the same and again find myself without answer wingfield said if dale was willing to let last nights quarrel lie he did not intend to bring it up himself hold i have a thought caleb lucas said somehow he managed to seem fresh on scanty rest when we spied the sims fire we bared straight for it and gave no more heed to the track wed fol owed could we pick it up once more the very thing al an cooper exclaimed sblood were stupider than the sims for we acted on what we thought theyd done when the truth was laid out before us had we only the wit to look on it shorn of the windy philosophizing the point is well taken dale said before cooper had time to get angry wingfield said hastily could you find the spot where we saw the smoke al an maybe his royal highness there would sooner lead us the guard snapped dale opened his mouth to reply but wingfield glared at him so fiercely that he shut it again at length cooper said yes i expect i can he proved good as his word though the trip was necessarily slow and cautious to avoid foraging sims when the englishmen returned to the place by the two pines they cast about for the trace they had pursued the day before cooper found it first and could not help sending a look of satisfaction at henry dales back before he summoned his companions they eagerly followed the track which to their growing confusion ran in the same direction they had previously chosen cooper weve already seen the brutes did not come this way dale said with an ominously false show of patienoe no all weve seen is that they did not reach the band tracks have no flair for lying cooper held his course dale fuming had no choice but to follow a few minutes later the guard stiffened look here all of you of a sudden they spun on their heels and headed northeast why i wonder wingfield said he glanced toward the column of smoke from the sims fire pointed they could easily see that from here what does it matter that was henry dale lets hunt down the beasts and have done with this pointless chatter pointless it is not wingfield said if it will help us in the hunting were you coming to a camp of your friends henry why would you then avoid it who knows why a sim does as it does or cares if it amuses you to enter the mind of an animal go on but ask me not to partake of your fatuity hold henry cooper said edwards query is deserving of an answer in war now id steer clear of a camp did it contain the enemy are sim bands nations writ in small dale scoffed i tell you honestly i do not know for a fact cooper replied nor henry do you dale scowled cooper stared him down the country rose as they traveled away from the james the sims they were fol owing stuck to wooded and brushy areas even when that meant deviating from the chosen course after seeing the fourth or fifth such zigzag cooper grunted nation or no that pair didnt relish being spotted soldiers travel so behind the foes lines even if you have reason caleb lucas said a while later ruefully rubbing at the thorn scratches on his arms why did the wretched creatures have to traverse every patch of brambles they could find not for the sake of hearing your whining surely had cooper given henry dale that rebuke he would have growled it with the irrepressible young lucas he could not keep a twinkle from his eyes aii the englishmen were scratched and bleeding wingfield stopped to extract a briar that had pierced his breeches the bushes around him were especially thick and thorny their ieaves a glistening venomous dark green only against that background would the white bit of cloth have caught his notice he reached out and plucked it from its bramble without realizing for a moment what it meant then he let out a whoop that horrified his comrades they stared at him as at a madman while he held up the tiny piece of linen from joannas shift he said when he had calmed enough to speak clearly again it must be the sims know thing of fabric nor even pelts to cover their loins save their own pelts that is lucas grinned then the excitement took him too proof were on the right track and proof or at least hope my little girl yet lives he said as much to himself as to the rest had they sought no more than meat theyd not have left the shift round her so long would they he looked to the others for reassurance it were unlikely edward cooper said gently caleb lucas nodded henry dale said nothing wiping his florid face with his sleeve he pushed ahead late that afternoon near the edge of a creek the englishmen came upon the scaly tail of a muskrat al that was left of the beast save for a bloodsoaked patch of grass allan cooper found close by here the sims stopped to feed the guard judged further casting about revealed a sharpened stone that confirmed his guess this making of tools on the spot has its advantages caleb lucas said one need never be without oh aye indeed if one has but three different tools to make henry dale said sourly wingfield did his best to ignore the continual bickering he went over the ground inch by inch searching for signs of joanna he final y found a spattering of loose yellowbrown muck on some chickweed not far from the edge of the stream his heart leaped the others came rushing over at his exclamation dale and lucas stared uncomprehending at the dropping but allan cooper recognized it at once the very same as my little cecil makes edward he said slapping wingfield on the back this far your baby was alive aye wingfield got out giddy with relief his greatest fear had been that the sims would simply dash her against a treetrunk and throw her tiny broken body into the woods for scavengers to eat they have her yet i must grant it dale said do they take her back to their fellows for tortures viler than those they might perform in haste shut up damn you wingfield shouted and would have gone for dale had cooper and caleb lucas not quickly stepped between them have you not cal ed them beasts all this while henry lucas said beasts kill aye but they do not torture that is reserved for men leave be al of you cooper ordered in a paradeground voice yes you too caleb such squabbling avails us nothing the more so when a lifes at stake the guards plainspoken good sense was obvious to everyone though wingfield could not help adding see you remember we know it is a rescue now henry i charge you do nothing to put joanna at risk dale nodded gruffly the englishmen hurried on hope put fresh heart in them and sped their weary feet soon they were going down into marshier country again as they approached the york river which paral eled the james to the north they al kept peering ahead for a telltale smudge of smoke against the sky darkness fell before they found it they had to stop for fear of losing the sims trail wingfield drew first watch he sat in the warm darkness wishing he had some way to let anne know what he had found his wife would still be suffering the agony of fear and uncertainty he had felt until that afternoon and would keep on suffering it until he brought their daughter home he refused to think of failing he had before when he thought joanna dead but having come so close he felt irrationally sure things would somehow work out he fought that feeling too it could make him careless and bring all his revived dreams to nothing when he surrendered sentry duty to lucas he thought he would be too keyed up to sleep as it had back in his own bed though exhaustion took its tol the damp ground might have been a goosedown mattress ten feet thick if henry dale spotted the sims fire first the englishmen were much closer to it than they had been to the one a couple of days before for it was smaller and not as smoky the hour was just past noon we wait here allan cooper decreed so we may approach by night and lessen the danger of being tdiscovered they soon found that danger was real a sim on its way back to the fire walked within a double handful of paces of their hiding place by luck it was carrying a fawn it had kil ed and did not notice them ah venison caleb lucas sighed softly gnawing on smoked meat tough enough to patch the soles of his boots the wait seemed endless to wingfield the sun crawled across the sky to be so close and yet unable to do anything to help his daughter ate at him but getting himself kil ed with an illconsidered rush would do her no good either the englishmen made lowvoiced plans all had to be tentative so much depended on where joanna was around the fire what the sims were doing to her wingfield would not let himself consider henry dales notion how many sims there were how much surprise the rescuers could achieve at last the birds of day began to fall silent the sky went gold and crimson in the west deep blue and then purple overhead when stars came out not far from where the sun had set al an cooper nudged his fellows now we move cannily mind the guard led them as they crept toward the fire he was humming a spanish tune under his breath wingfield did not think he knew he was doing it but he had learned his soldiering against spanish troops and a return to it brought back old habits this band of sims dwelt in more open country than had the other the englishmen could not get very close half their plans the ones involving unexpectedly bursting from the woods and snatching up joanna evaporated on the instant they whispered curses and watched from the nearest shrubbery at first glance the scene in front of them did not seem much different from the one they had watched a couple of nights before there were more sims here perhaps as many as forty three or four males were roasting roots and bits of meat on sticks over the fire and passing the chunks of food to sims who stood round waiting another male was cutting up an animal that with its skin removed wingfield could not identify he stiffened that was no stone tool the sim used it was a good steel knife henry dale noticed that at about the same time he did damned thieving creatures he muttered a female set the young one it was holding down on the ground then rose and ambled away from the fire probably to relieve itself the infant followed it with its eyes and shrieked in distress the adult came back and played with it dandling it in its arms rol ing it about and making faces at it after the child was quiet the female left it again this time it stayed quiet until its mother returned this band did not have one firekeeper as the other had from time to time a female or young male would come up to the blaze and toss on a branch or a shrub the system seemed haphazard to wingfield but the fire never looked likely to go out a group of sims had gathered on the far side of the fire around something their bodies kept wingfield from making out whatever it was it mightily interested them some stood others hunkered down on their haunches for a closer look they pointed and jabbered once one shook another as if to get a point across wingfield could not help chuckling to himself they reminded him of so many englishmen at a public house then the chuckle died in his throat for he saw that one of the males there had a great glob of mud plastered to the hair from its rib cage the sim moved slowly and painfully wingfield touched coopers arm on my oath that is the one i fought i knew i marked him with my knife then we tracked truly as i thought good now we wingfields hand clamped down tight on the guards wrist silencing him from the center of that tightly packed bunch of sims had come a familiar thin wailing cry joanna how do you know tis not one of their cubs yowling t henry dale demanded all brats sound alike only to a single man wingfield retorted too full of exaltation and fear to care how he spoke against al hope his daughter lived but how was he to free her from her captors and what the question ate at him as it had from the onset what had prompted the sims to steal her in the first place a couple of sims stepped away to take food opening a gap in the crowd there do you see wingfield said triumphantly no matter how dirty she was quite at the moment smooth pink joanna could never be mistaken for a baby sim as if to make that pikestaffplain one of the sim infants lay beside her on a bed of grass and leaves terror stabbed wingfield as an adult ran its hand down his daughters chest and bel y but then it did the same to the hairy baby next to her it stared at its palm as if not believing what it had felt the sim wingfield had wounded held up one of joannas hands then that of the infant of its own kind then it held up their feet in the same way the other sims grunted some looked at their own hands and feet then toward joannas except for size and hairiness there was not much difference between their members and hers but then the sim patted joannas smooth rounded head and that was nothing like what the tiny sim next to her had already its brow beetled bonily and above it the skull quickly retreated noticing that one of the adults rubbed her own receding brow she scratched for all the world as if lost in thought what are they playing at henry dale whispered harshly wingfield at a loss could only shrug caleb lucas said if a tribe of devils set up housekeeping outside london and we wished to learn of what they were capable were it not wise for us to seize on a small one knowing ful well a grown devil would drag us straight to perdition why are you dragging in devils dale did not have the type of mind that quickly grasped analogies allan cooper did youngster meseems youve thrown your dart dead center he said to the sodding sims we must be devils or worse he stopped then went on sounding surprised at where that line of thought was taking him which would make them men of a sort not so id notve believed it wingfield paid more attention to joanna than to the argument she was still crying but did not seem in dreadful distress it was her hungry cry not the sharper shriller one she used when gas pained her or something external upset her the female sim that had scratched its head might have been the mother of the infant with whom joanna was being compared it took joanna away from the wounded sim and lifted her to a breast the baby nursed as eagerly as if it had been anne wingfield told himself that was something his wife never needed to know he invented and discarded scheme before scheme for rescuing his daughter the trouble was that the sims would not leave her alone even while she was feeding they kept coming up to stare at her and touch her she ate on blissful y oblivious to everything but the nipple by god i shal get her back wingfield said he spoke loud enough to distract allan cooper what how the guard said and then wingfield knew what he had to do do you three cover me with your weapons he said and should the sims harm joanna or should i fall do as you deem best otherwise i conjure you not to shoot before his comrades protests could more than begin he got up from his concealment and walked into the light of the sims fire the first sim to see him let out a hoot of alarm that made the rest of the band whip their heads around he walked slowly toward the fire his hands empty and open he had left his crossbow behind when he rose had the sims chosen to they could have slain him at any instant he knew that his feet hardly seemed to touch the ground they were light with the liquid springiness fear gives but the strange unreality of the moment gripped the sims no less than him never before had an englishman come to them alone and unarmed or so they must have thought for the pistols in his boots did not show in truth he had forgotten them himself but then the sims had never stolen a baby before females snatched up youngsters and bundled them away in their arms as wingfield passed lucas had it right he thought wryly it was as if satan had appeared all reeking of brimstone among the jamestown cabins he stopped a few feetin front of the male he had fought that one had stooped to grasp a sharp stone many of them lay in the dirt round the fire but the sim made no move to attack it waited to see what wingfield would do the englishman was not sure if the sim knew him he pointed to the plasteredover cut he had given to the bruise and scab on his own forehead to joanna who was still nursing at the female sims breast he repeated the gestures once twice the sims broad nostrils flared its mouth came open revealing large strong teeth it pointed from wingfield to joanna gave a questioning grunt aye thats my daughter wingfield said excitedly the words could not have meant anything to the sim but the animated tone did it grunted again wingfield dug in his pouch found a strip of smoked meat and tossed it to the sim the sim sniffed warily then took a bite its massive jaw let it tear and chew at the leathery stuff where the englishman had to nibble and gnaw and made its smile afterward a fearsome thing when joanna finally relinquished the nipple the sim holding her swung her up to its shoulder and began pounding her on the back the treatment was rougher than wingfield would have liked but was soon rewarded with a hearty belch the female sim began to rock joanna much as anne would have wingfield pointed to his daughter to himself and then back in the direction of jamestown as best he could he pantomimed taking joanna home when he was done he folded his arms and waited expectantly trying to convey the attitude that nothing but going along with his wishes was even conceivable had he hesitated faltered for an instant he would have lost everything as it was that aura of perfect confidence gave him his way none of the sims moved to stop the female when it came forward and set joanna in his arms he bowed to it as he might have to a great lady of the court to the sim he had fought as to an earl holding joanna tightly to him he backed slowly toward the brush where his companions waited he expected the tableau to break up at any moment but it held the sims watched him go the firelight reflecting red from their eyes he was close to the place from which he had come when caleb lucas said from the bushes splendidly done oh splendidly edwardi his voice was a thread of whisper none of the sims could have heard it aye you have the girl and good for you henry dale did not try to hold his voice down indeed he rose from concealment now to teach the vermin who stole her the price of their fol y he aimed a pistol at the sims behind wingfield no you fool lucas shouted he lunged for dale at the same moment the sims cried out in fear fury and betrayal too late the pistol roared belching flame and smoke the lead ball struck home with a noise like a great slap the sim it hit shrieked briefly with a lithe twist dale slipped away from caleb lucas his hand darted into his boottop for his other pistol the second shot was less deliberately aimed but not a miss this time the screams of pain went on and on by then wingfield was among the bushes behind him the sims were boiling like ants whose nest has been stirred with a stick some scrambled for cover others bolder came rushing after the englishman a stone crashed against greenery mere inches from his head no help for it now henry dale said cheerfully bringing up his crossbow the bolt smote a charging sim square in the chest the sim staggered hands clutching at the short shaft of death it pitched forward on its face more rocks flew wingfield turned to one side to try to shield joanna with his body allan cooper got to his feet god damn you to hel for what you make me do he snarled at dale he fired one pistol then a second then his crossbow a sharpened stone tore wingfields breeches cut his thigh had it hit squarely it would have crippled him the sims were howling like lost souls lost angry souls dale was right no help for it now wingfield saw his pistol bucked when he fired onehanded he did not know whether he hit or missed in a way he hoped he had missed that did not stop him from drawing his other gun you purposed this all along henry he shouted above the din aye and own it proudly dale dropped another sim with a second crossbow bolt he turned to kick caleb lucas in the ribs fight em curse you theyll have the meat from your bones now as happily as from mine no need for this no need lucas gasped swearing and sobbing by turns but whether or not that was true he realized as wingfield had that there was no unbaking a bread his pistols barked one after the other but the sims on their home ground were not the skulking creatures they were near jamestown though half a dozen lay dead or wounded the rest male and female together kept up the barrage of stones their missiles were not so deadly as the englishmens but they loosed them far more of often one landed with a meaty thud allan cooper his face a mask of gore crumpled slowly to the ground he turned to wingfield who was struggling to fit another bolt into his weapons groove go on he shouted you have what you came for ill hold the sims as you say i am to blame here but dale whipped out his rapier its point flickered in front of wingfields face gal aye and you caleb i promise i shal give the brutes enough fight and chase to distract em from you he sprang into the clearing rushing the startled sims one swung a stout branch at him graceful as a dancer he ducked then thrust out to impale his attacker the sim gave a bubbling shriek blood gushed from its mouth gal dale yelled again without joanna wingfield would have stood by the other englishman no matter what he said when she squalled at the rough treatment she was getting though he scrambled away into the woods lucas fol owed a few seconds later for as long as they could they looked back at henry dale after that first one no sim dared come within reach of his sword he stayed in the clearing for what seemed an impossibly long time stones flying al around him at last he turned catch me if you can he shouted brandishing his rapier wingfield saw how he limped as he ran not every stone had missed dale dashed through the undergrowth going in a different direction from his comrades and making no effort to move quietly his defiant cries rang through the night so did the sims bellows of rage as they pursued him you make for home caleb lucas urged wingfield i will give henry such help as i may they will surely slay you wingfield said but he knew he would not hold lucas back had their positions been reversed he would not have wanted the youngster to try to stop him just then the sims shouts rose ina goblin chorus of triumph screams punctuated it not al from an english throat as dale had promised he did not die easily caleb lucas sobbed come wingfield said softly his own voice breaking now we have but to save ourselves any way we may and so to bed sims made people look at themselves and their place in nature differently from the way they had before they showed the link between humans and animals far more clearly than any creatures with which euro peons had been familiar before had there been no sims had the americas been populated by native humans say or only by animalsthe development of the transformational theory of life might have been long delayed this would have slowed the growth of several sciences biology being of course the most obvious of them speculating on mighthavebeens however is not the proper domain of history the transformational theory of life was first put forward in ii after that humans view of their place in the world would never be the same from the story of the federated commonwealths may ii a fine bright morning small beer and radishes for to break my fast then into london for this day the shambles on newgaoe street stinking unto heaven as is usual but close to it my destination the sim marketplace our servant jane with too much for one body to do and whilst i may not afford the hire of another man or maid two sims shall go far to ease her burden success also sure to gladden elizabeths heart my wife being ever one to follow the dame fashion and sims all the go of late though monstrous ugly them formerly not much seen here but since the success of our virginia and plymouth colonies are much more often fetched to these shores from the wildernesses the said colonies front upon they are also commenced to be bred on english soil but no hope there for me as i do require workers fullgrown not cubs or babes in arms or whatsoever the proper term may be the simsel er a vicious lout near unhandsome as his wares no the truth for the diary such were a slander on any man as i saw on his conveying me to the creatures have seen these sims before surely but briefly and in their masters livery the which by concealing their nakedness conceals as well much of their brutishness the males are most of them well made though lean as rakes from the ocean passage and i warrant poor victualing after but al are so hairy as more to resemble rugs than men and the same true for the females their fur hiding such dubious charms as they may possess nigh as well as a smock of linen nought here god knows for elizabeths jealousy to light on this so were the said females lovely of feature as so many aphrodites they are not nor do the males recall to mind adonis in both sexes the brow projects with a shelf of bone and above it where men do enjoy a forehead proud in its erectitude is but an apish slope the nose broad and low the mouth wide the teeth nigh as big as a horses though shaped it is not to be denied like a mans the jaw long deep and devoid of chin they stink the simsel er full of compliments on my coming hard on the arrival of the gloucester from plymouth him having thereby replenished his stock in trade then the price should also be not so dear says i and by god it did do my heart good to see the ferretfaced rogue discomfited rogue as he was though he dickered with the best for i paid full a guinea more for the pair of sims than i had looked to spending in all sd the coin once passed over and bitten for to ensure its verity the simseller signed to those of his chattels i had bought that they were to go with me his gestures marvelous quick and clever and those the sims answered with too again i have seen somewhat of the like before whilst coming to understand in time the speech of men sims are without language of their own having but a great variety of howls grunts and moans yet this gesturespeech the which i am told is come from the signs of the deaf they do readily learn and often their masters answer back so to ensure commands being properly grasped am wild to learn it my own self and shal meseems it is in its way a style of tachygraphy or shorthand such as i use to set down these pages having devised varying tachygraphic hands for friends and acquaintanoes twill be amusing taking to a hand that is exactly what its name declares as i was leaving with my new charges the simseller did bid me lead them by the gibbets on shooters hil there to see the bodies and members of felons and of sims as have run off from their masters it wondered me they should have the wit to take the meaning of such display but he assured me they should and so reckoning it good advice if true and no harm if a lie i chivied them thither a filthy sight i found it with the miscreants flesh all shrunk to the bones but boo quoth my sims and looked close upon the corpses of their ownkind which by their hairiness and flatskul ed heads do seem even more bestial dead than when animated with life home then and elizabeth as delighted in my success as am i an excellent dinner of a calfs head boiled with dumplings and an abundance of buttered ale with sugar and cinnamon of which in celebration we invited jane to partake and she grew right giddy bread and leeks for the sims and water it being reported they grow undocile on stronger drink after much debate though goodnatured it was decided to style the male tom and the female peg showed them to their pallets down cellar and they took to them readily enough as finer than what they were accustomed to so to bed right pleased with myself despite the expense may an advantage of having sims present appears that i had not thought on both tom and peg quite excellent ratters finer than any pusscat no need either to fling the rats on the dungheap for they devour them with as much gusto as i should a neats tongue they having subsisted on such smal deer in the forests of america i shall not try to break them of the habit though training them not to bring in their prey when we are at table with guests the reverend mr milles quite shocked but recovering nicely on being plied with wine may peg and tom the both of them enthral ed with fire when the work of them is done of the day or at evening ere they take their rest they may be found before the hearth observing the sport of the flames now and again one will to the other say boo this noise i find they utter on seeing that which does interest them whatsoever it may be now as i thought on it i minded me reading or hearing i recall not which that in their wild unpeopled haunts the sims know the use of fire as they find it set from lightning or other such mischance but not the art of its making no wonder then they are vulcanolaters reckoning name more precious than do we gold considering such reflections i resolved this morning on an experimtnt to see what they might do rising early for to void my bladder in the pot i put out the hearthfire which in any case was gone low through want of fuel reired then to put on my dressing gown and once clad returned to await developments first up from the cellar was tom and his cry on seeing the flames extinguished heartrending as romeos over the body of fair julia when i did see that play acted this december past in a trice comes peg who moaning with tom did rouse my wife and she much upset at being so rudely wakened when calm in some small measure was restored i bade by signs in the learning of which i proceed apace for the sims to sit quiely before the hearth and with flint and steel restored that which i had earlier destroyed they both made such outcry as if they had heard sounded the last trump then doused i that second fire too again to which distress from peg and tom elizabeth by this time out of the house in some dudgeon no doubt to spend money we lack on stuffs of which we have no want set up in the hearth thereupon several smal ares of sticks each with much tinder so as to make it an easy matter to kindle a brisk striking of flint and steel dropping sparks onto one such produced a merry little blaze to the accompaniment of much booing out of the sims and so to the nub of it showing tom the steel and flint i clashed them once more the one upon the other so he might see the sparks engendered thereby then pointed to one of the aforementioned piles of sticks i had made up bidding him watch close as indeed he did having made sure oft i did start that second pile alight again put the fires out the wailing accompanying the act less than heretofore for which i was not sorry pointed now to a third assemblage of wood and tinder but instead of myself lighting it i did convey flint and steel to tom and the with signs essayed to bid him play promeheus his hands much scarred and cal used and ugler their hair knobbyknuckled as an irishmans he held at first the implements as if not taking in their purpose yet the sims making tools of stone as is widely reported he could not fail to grasp their utility and indeed ere long he did try parroting me when his first clumsy attempt yielded no result i thought he would abandon such efforts as beynd his capacity and reserved for men of my sort but persist he did and at length was rewarded with scintil ae like unto those i had made his grin so wide and gleeful i thought it would stretch clear round his head then without need of my further demonstration he set the instruments of rite production over the materials for the blaze him in such excitement as the sparks fell upon the waiting tinder that beneath his breeches rose his member indeed to such degree as would have made me proud to be its possessor and peg was i think in such mood as to couple with him on the spot had i not been present and had not his faculties been directed elsewhere than toward the lectual for at his success he cut such capers as had not been out of place upon the stage were they but a trifle more rhythmical and less unconstrained yet of the making of fire even if by such expedient as the friction of two sticks which once i was forced by circumstance to attempt and would try the patience of job as of every other salutary art his race is as utterly ignorant as of the moons of jupiter but lately found by some italian with an optic glass no brute beast of the field could learn to begin a fire on the technique being shown it which did tom nigh readily as a man but despite most diligent instruction no sim yet has mastered such subtler arts as reading and writing nor ever will meseems falling in capacity thus between men and animal the sims do raise a host of conundrums vexing and perplexing i should pay a pound or at the least ten shillings merely to know how such strange fusions came to be so to the admiralty full of such musings which did occupy my mind i fear to the detriment of my proper duties may i supper this evening at the turks head with the other members of the rota club the fare not of the finest being boiled venison and some few pigeons al meanly done up the lambs wool seemed naught but poor ale the sugar nutmeg and meat of roasted apples hardly to be tasted miles the landlord down with a quartan fever but il served by his staff if such is the result of his absence the subject of the clubs discussions for the evening much in accord with my own recent curiosity to wit the sims cyriack skinner did maintain them creatures of the devil whereupon was he roundly raped by dr croon as having in this contention returned to the pernicious heresy of the maniches the learned doctor reserving the power of creation to the lord alone much flinging back and forth of biblical texts the which all struck me more as being an exercise of ingenuity of the debaters than bearing on the problem for in plain fact the scriptures nowhere mention sims when at length the talk did turn to matters more ascertainable i spoke somewhat of my recent investigation and right well received my remarks were or so l thought others with experience of sims with like tales finding them quick enough on things practic but sadly lacking in any higher faculties much jollity at my account of the visible manifestation of toms excitement and whispers that this lady or that the names to my vexation i failed to catch owned her sims for naught but their prowess in matters of the mattress just then came the maid by with coffee for the club not of the best but better i grant than the earlier wretched lambs wool she a pretty yellowhaired lass called i believe kate a wench of perhaps sixteen years a goodbodied woman not over thick or thin in any place with a lovely bosom she did display most charmingly as she bent to fillthe gentlemens cups having ever an eye for beauty such that i reckon little else beside it i own i did turn my head for to follow this kate as she went about her duties noticing which sir william henry called out much to the merriment of the club and to my chagrin see how samuel apes him no mean droll and loosed a pretty pun if at my expense good enough but then at the far end of the table someone i saw not who worse luck thought to cap it by braying like the donkey he must be not half the peeping i warrant as at his sims of nights such mockery clings to a man like pitch regardless of the truth int which in this case is none oh the thing could be done but the sims so homely twould yield no titillation of that i am practical y certain may i the household being more infected this past week with nits than ever before resolved to bathe peg and tom which also i hoped would curb somewhat their stench and so it proved albeit not without more alarms than i had looked for the sims most loath to enter the tub which must to them have seemed some instrument of torment the resulting shrieks and outcry so deafening a neighbor did cal out to be assured all was well having done so l saw no help for it but to go into the tub my own self notwithstanding my having bathed but two weeks before i felt i think more hesitation stripping down before peg than i should in front of jane whom i would simply dismiss from consideration save in how she performed her duties but i did wonder what peg made of my body reckoning it against the hairy forms of her own kind hath she the wit to deem mankind superior or is our smoothness to her as gross and repel ent as the peltries of the sims to us i cannot as yet make sign to enquire as may be my example showing them they should not be harmed they bathed themselves a trouble arose l had not foreseen for the sims being nearly as thickly haired over all their bodies as i upon my head the rinsing of the soap from their hides less easy than for us and requiring much water lucky i am the well is within fifty paces of my home and so from admiral of the bath to the admiralty hoping henceforward to scratch myself less may i a pleasant afternoon this day carried in a coach to see the lions and other beasts in the menagerie i grant the lions pride of place through custom immemorial but in truth am more taken with the abnormous creatures fetched back from the new world than those our people have known since the time of arthur nor am i alone in this conceit for the cages of lion bear and camel had but few spectators whilst round those of the american beasts i did find myself compelled to use hands and elbows to make shift to pass through the crowds this last not altogether unpleasant as i chanced to brush against a handsome lass but when i did enquire if she would take tea with me she said me nay which did irk me no little for as i say she was fair to see more time for the animals then and wondrous strong ever they strike me the spearfanged cat is surely the most horridest murderer this shuddering world hath seen yet there is for him prey worthy of his mettle what with beavers near big as our bears wild oxen whose horns are to those of our familiar kine as the spearfanged cats teeth to the lions and the great hairy elephants which do roam the forests why such prodigies of nature manifest themselves on those distant shores does perplex me most exceedingly as they are unlike any beasts even in the bestiaries which as all men know are more flights of fancy than sober fact amongst them the sims appear no more than one piece of some great jigsaw yet no pattern therein is to me apparent would it were also another new creature in the menagerie which i had not seen before at first i thought it a caged sim but on inspection it did prove an ape brought back by the portuguese from afric lands and styled there the keeper made so good as to inform me shimpan it flourishes not in englands clime he did continue being subject to sickness in the lungs from the cool and damp but is so interesting as to be displayed whilst living howsoever long that may prove the shimpanse is a baser brute than even the sim it goes on al fours and its hinder feet more like unto monkeys than mens having thereon great toes that grip like thumbs also where a sims teeth as i have observed from tom and peg are uncommon large in shape they are like unto a mans but the shimpanse hath tushes of some savagery though of course paling alongside those of the spearfanged cat seeing the keeper a garrulous fellow i enquired of him further about this shimpanse he owned he had himself thought it a sort of sim on its arrival but sees now more distinguishing points than likenesses gait and dentition such as i have herein remarked upon but also in its habits from his experience he has seen it to be ignorant of fire repeatedly al owing to die a blaze though fuel close at hand nor has it the knack of shaping stones to its ends though it will he told me cast them betimes against those who annoy it once striking one such with force enough to render him some time senseless hearing the villain had essayed tormenting the creature with a stick my sympathies lay all for the shimpanse wherein its keeper concurred and so homewards thinking on the shimpanse as i rode whereas in the lands wherewith men are most familiar it were easy distinguishing men from beasts the strange places to which our vessels have but lately fetched themselves reveal a stairway ascending the chasm and climbers on the stairs some higher some lower a pretty image but why it should be so there and not here does i confess escape me may i a savage row with jane today her having forgotten a change of clothes for my bed her defense that i had not so instructed her the lying minx for i did plainly make my wishes known the evening previous the which i recollect most distinctly yet she did deny it again and again final y raising my temper to such a pitch that i cursed her right roundly slapping her face and pul ing her nose smartly whereupon did the ungrateful trul lay down her service on the spot she decamped in a fury of her own crying that i treated the sims those very sims which i had bought for to ease her labors with more kindlier consideration than i had for her own self so now we are without a servingmaid and her a dab hand in the kitchen her swan pie especially being toothsome dined tonight at the bell and expect to tomorrow at the swan on the hoop in fish street for elizabeth no artist over the hearth nor am i myself and as for the sims i should sooner open my veins than indulge of their cuisine the good lord only knowing what manner of creatures they in their ignorance should add to a pot now as my blood has somewhat cooled i must admit a germ of truth in janes scolds i do not beat tom and peg as a man would servitors of more ordinary stripe they being but new come from the wilds are not inured tot as are our servants and might well turn on me their master and being in part of brute kind their strength does exceed mine toms most assuredly and that of peg perhaps and so say i better safe no satisfaction to me the sims on shooters hill gallows were i not there to seet may today to my lord sandwichs for supper this doubly pleasant in enjoying his fine companionship and saving the cost of a meal the house being still without maid the food and drink in excellent style as to suit my lord the broiled lobsters very sweet and the lamprey pie which for its rarity i but seldom eat of the best ever i had many other fine victuals as well the tanzy in especial and the wine all sugared afterwards backgammon at which i won ere my luck turned ended it in my lords debt which he did graciously excuse me afterwards a generosity not looked for but which i did not refuse then to aambo wherein by tagging and rich to sandwich i was adjudged winner the more so for playing on his earlier munificence thaeafter nigh a surfeit of good talk as is custom at my ords he mentioning sims i did relate my own dealings with peg and tom to which he listened with much interest he thinks on buying some for his own household and unaware i had done so perhaps it was the wine let loose my tongue for i broached somewhat my disjoint musings on the sims and their place in nature on the strangeness of the american fauna and much else besides lord sandwich did acquaintanoe me with a new world beast found in their southerly holdings by the spaniards of strange outlandish sort big as an ox or nearly and all covered over with armor of bone like a man wearing chain i should pay out a shilling or even more for to seet were one conveyed to london then coffee and it not watered as so often at an inn but full and strong as i and elizabeth making our departures lord sandwich did bid me join him tomorrow night to hear speak a savant of the royal society it bore said he on my prior ramblings and would say no more but looked uncommon sly even did it not i should have leaped at the chance this written at one of the clock for so the watchman just now cried out too wound up for bed what with coffee and the morrows prospect elizabeth aslumber but the sims also awake and at frolic meseems from the noises up the stairway if they be of human kind is their fornication sans dergy sinful another vexing question by their existence they do engender naught but disquietude nay strike that they may in sooth more sims engender a pun good enough to sleep on and so to bed may i all this evening worrying at my thoughts as a dog at a bone my lord sandwich knows not what commotion internal he did by his invitation all kindly meant set off in me the speaker this night a spare man dry as dust of the very sort i learned so well to loathe when at cambridge dry as dust happy words which did spring al unbidden from my pen for of dust the fellow did discourse if thereby is meant as commonly things long dead he had some men bear in bones but lately found by swanscombe at a graveldigging and such bones they were and teeth or rather tusks as to make it all i could do to hold me in my seat for surely they once graced no less a beast than the hairy elephant whose prototype i saw in the menagerie so short a while ago the doublecurving tusks admit of no error for those of all elephants with which we are anciently familiar form but a single segment of arc when his discourse concluded he gave leave for questions i made bold to ask to what he imputed the hairy elephants being so long vanished from our shores yet thriving in the western lands to this he confessed himself baffted as am i and admiring of his honesty as well before the hairy elephant was known to live such monstrous bones surely had been reckoned as from beasts perishing in the flood whereof scripture speaks yet how may that be so them surviving across a sea wider than any noah sailed meseems the answer lieth within my grasp but am balked from setting finger tot the thwarting fair to drive me mad worse even i think than with a lass who will snatch out a hairpin for to defend her charms against my importuning may grand oaks from tiny acorns growt this morning came a great commotion from the kitchen i rushing in found tom at struggle with a cur dog which had entered the door being open on account of fine weather to steal half a flitch of salt bacon it dodging most nimbly round the sim snatched up the gammon and fled out again him pursuing but in vain myself passing vexed having intended to sup thereon but tom al downcast on returning so had not the heart further to punish him told him instead him understanding i fear but little it were well men not sims dwelt in england else would wolves prowl the london streets still stood stock still some time thereafter hearing the greater import behind my jesting speech is not the answer to the riddle of the hairy elephant and other exotic beasts existing in the new world but being hereabouts long vanished their having there but sims to hunt them the sims in their wild haunts wield club and sharpened stone no more they are ignorant even of the bow which from time out of mind has equipt the hunters armory just as not two centuries past we englishmen slew on this island the last wolf so may we not imagine our most remotest grandsires serving likewise the hairy elephant the spearfanged cat they being more cunning than sims and better accoutered this should not have surpassed their powers such beasts would survive in america then not through virtue inherent of their own but by reason of lesser danger to them in the sims than would from mankind come put this budding thought at luncheon today to my lord sandwich he back at me with marvelled to his coy mistress the most annoyingest sort viz had we but world enough and time who could reckon the changes as might come to pass and going on laughing to say next will be found dead sims at swanscombe though meant but as a pleasantry quoth i why not against true men they could not long have stood but needs must have given way as round plymouth and virginia even without battle they must soon have failed as being less able than mankind to provide for their wants there we let it lie but as i think more ont the notion admits of broader application ist not the same for trout as for men or for lilacs those best suited living reproduce their kind whilst the trout with twisted tail or bloom without sweet scent die all unmourned leaving no descendants and each succeeding generation being of the previous survivors constituted will by such reasoning show some little difference from the one as went before seeing no flaw in this logic resolve tomorrow to do this from its tachygraphic state bereft of course of maunderings and privacies for prospectus to the royal society and mightily wondering whatever they shall make of it may closeted all this day at the admiralty yet did it depend on my diligence alone i fear me the fleet should drown still a deal of business finished as happens when one stays by it three quills worn quite out and my hands all over ink also my fine camlet cloak with the gold buttons which shall mightily vex my wife poor wretch unless it may be cleaned i pray god to make it so for i do mislike strife at home the burning work at last complete homeward in the twilight it being washingday dined on cold meat i do confess felt no small strange stir in my breast on seeing tom taking down the washing before the house a vision it was almost of his kind roaming england long ago till perishing from want of substance on vying therefore with men and now they are through the agency of men returned here again after some great interval of years would i knew how many the writing of my notions engrossing the whole of the day had no occasion to air them to lord brouncker of the society as was my hope yet expound i must or burst elizabeth then at dinner made audience for me whether she would or no my space at last exhausted asked for her thoughts ont she said only that holy writ sufficed on the matter for her whereat i could but make a sour face to bed in some anger and in fear lest the royal society prove as closeminded which god prevent did he not purpose man to reason on the world around him he should have left him witless as the sim may to gresham college this morning to call on lord brouncker he examined with great care the papers i had done up his face revealing naught felt myself at recitation i once more before a professor a condition whose lack these last years i have not missed feared also he might not be able to take in the writing it being done in such haste some shorthand characters may have replaced the common ones then to my delight he declared he reckoned it deserving i knew not how to make answer and should have in the next moment fled but up spake to my great surprise lord brouncker reciting from second chronicles the second verse of the fourth chapter wherein is said of solomon and his temple also he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim round in compass and the height thereof was five cubits and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about this much perplexed the puritan and me as well though i essayed not to show it lord brouncker then proceeded to his explication to wit that the true compass of a tencubit round vessel was not thirty cubits but above one and thirty i misremember the exact figure he gave those of the royal society learned in mathematics did agree he had reason and urged the puritan make the experiment for his self with cup cord and rule which were enough for to demonstrate the truth i asked if he was answered like a gentleman he owned he was and bowed and sat his face ful of troubles felt with him no small sympathy for once one error in scripture be admitted where shal it end the next query was of different sort a man in periwigg enquiring if i did reckon humankind to have arisen by the means i described had to reply i did our forefathers might be excused for thinking otherwise them being so widely separate from al other creatures they knew but we moderns in our travels round the globe have found the shimpanse which standeth nigh the flame of reasoned thought and more important still the sim in whom the flame does burn but more feebly than in ourselves these bridging the gap twixt man and beast meseems do show mankind to be in sooth a part of nature whose engenderment in some past distant age is to be explained through natural law someone rose to doubt the variation in each sort of living thing being sufficient eventually to permit the rise of new kinds pointed out to him the mastiff the terrier and the bloodhound all of the dog kind but become distinct through mans choice of mates in each generation surely the same might occur in nature said i the fellow admitted it was conceivable and sat then up stood a certain wilberforce with whom i have some small acquaintance he likes me not nor i him we know it on both sides though for civilitys sake feigning otherwise now he spoke with smirking air as one sure of the mortal thrust he did grant my willingness to have a sim as greatgrandfather said he but was i so willing to claim one as greatgrandmother a deal of laughter rose which was his purpose and to make me out a fool had i carried steel i should have drawn on him as was rage sharpened my wit to serve for the smallsword i left at home told him it were no shame to have ones greatgrandfather a sim as that sim did use to best advantage the intel ect he had better that quoth i than dissipating the mind on such digressive and misleading quibbles as he raised if i be in error then i am let him shew it by logic and example not as it were playing to the gallery came clapping from all sides to my delight and the round dejection of wilberforce on seeking further questions found none took my own seat whilst the fel ows of the society did congratulate me and cry up my essay louder i thought than either of the other two lord brouncker acclaimed it as a unifying principle for the whole of the study of life which made me as proud a man as any in the world for all the world seemed to smile upon me and so to bed ii around the salt lick europeans soon settled theatlantic seaboard of north america settlement was slower in the spanish and portuguese colonies further south as the harsh tropical climate of much of central and south america posed a serious chal enge to immigrants in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries only new granada and argentina the most northerly and southerly of the hispanic settlements tnuly flourished the british north american colonies however soon outdistanced even the most successful settlements farther south because the land was more like that to which the settlers had been accustomed european farming techniques needed less adaptatbn than was the case in central and south america moreover the establishment of a divineright monarchy on the french model in england made political and religious dissenters eager to leave the island and the crown happy to see them go thus a constant stream of settlers was assured as the seventeenth century drew toward a close explorers were beginning to penetrate the mountain passes and push west into the north american heartland bands of wild sims made sure some would not find their way home and others fel victim to spearfangs and other wild beasts but neither sims nor beasts could halt or even slow the steady westward push of people into north america still as has always been true the first humans to go west of the mountains faced no smal danger and had to show extraordinary resourcefulness in unfamiliar and dangerous circumstances from the story of the federated commonwealths thomas kenton paused to look westward at land no man had seen before the gap in the mountains revealed an endless sea of deep green rolling woods ahead virginia had been such a wilderness once before the english landed eightyodd years ago but no more eh charles he said to the sim at his side virginia fills with farmers and the time has come to find what this western country is like find charles signed like most of the new worlds native subhumans he understood speech well enough but had trouble reproducing it signals based on those used by the deaf and dumb came easier for him the sim was close to kentons own rangy six feet one his eyes in fact were on a level with the scouts but where kentons forehead rose his sloped smoothly back from beetling brow ridges his nose was low broad and flat his mouth wide his teeth large heavy and yellow his jaw long and chinless as an englishman he would have been hideous kenton did not think of him so by the standards of his own kind he was on the handsome side on charles signed adding the fingertwist that turned it into a question at the scouts nod he strode ahead his deerskin buskins silent on the mossy ground his only other clothing was a leather belt that held water bottle hatchet knife and pouches for this and that his thick brown hair served him as well as did kentons leather tunic and trousers a turkey called from a stand of elms off to one side kenton felt his stomach rumble hungrily and an instant later heard charless they grinned at each other hunt the scout signed not wanting to make any noise to alert the bird the sim nodded and trotted toward the far side of the trees kenton gauged distances if all went well the shot would be only about fifty yards a halfcharge of powder should serve he poured it into the little chargecup that hung from the bottom of his powderhorn then down his musket barrel it went working with practiced speed he set a greased linen patch on the guns muzzle laid the round ball on it and rammed it home til it just touched the powder then he squeezed down on the first of the muskets two triggers setting the second so it would go off at the lightest touch the whole procedure took about fifteen seconds and it was al needless kenton waited expecting the frightened turkey to burst from cover at any moment what emerged however was charles carrying the bird by the feet in one hand and his bloody hatchet in the other he was laughing good hunting kenton said he careful y reset the first trigger making sure he heard it click back into place he did not begrudge the sim the kill he welcomed anything that saved powder and bul ets stupid bird charles signed i get close throw he pantomimed casting the hatchet it had a weighted knob at the end of the handle to give it proper balance for the task even wild sims were dangerous flinging the sharpchipped stones they made the sun was going down over the vast forest ahead we may as well camp kenton decided when they came to a smal cool quickflowing stream he and charles washed their heads and soaked their feet in it they drank til they sloshed preferring the streams water to the warm stale stuff in their canteens then they scoured the neighborhood for dry twigs and brush for the evenings fire kenton was careful to make sure trees and bushes screened the site from the west when he took out flint and steel to set off the tinder at the end of the fire charles touched his arm me please the sim kenton passed him the metal and stone charles briskly clashed them together blew on the sparks that fell to the tinder soon he had a small smokeless blaze going when he started to pass the flint and steel back to l kenton the scout said you may as well keep them you use them more than i do anyway the flickering firelight revealed the awe on charless face that awe was there even though he was of the third generation of sims to grow up as part of virginia in the wild sims used fire if they came across it and kept it alive as best they could but they could not start one to charles kentons simple tools conveyed a power that must have felt godlike the scout burned his hands and his mouth on hot roasoed turkey but did not care blowing on his fingers he chuckled better than going hungry eh charles the sim grunted around a mouthful he did not bother with any more formal reply he took his eating seriously they tossed the offal into the stream charles had taken the first watch the night before so tonight it belonged to kenton the sim stripped off his shoes and belt curled up by the fire with his hair he needed no blanket and fel asleep with the ease and speed kenton always envied charles and his breed never brought the days troubles into the evening with them were they too simple or too wise the scout often wondered he let the fire die to red embers that hardly interfered with his night sight the moon rounding toward ful spilled pale light over the forest ahead smoothing its contours till it resembled nothing so much as a calm peaceful sea the ear pierced the il usion that lulled the eye somewhere close by a field mouse squeaked briefly as an owl or ferret found it farther away kenton heard a wolf howl to salute the moon then another and another until the whole pack was at cry the eerie chorus made the hair prickle upright at the nape of the scouts neck charles stirred and muttered in his sleep no one human or sim was immune to the fear of wolves the pack also disturbed the rest of a hairy elephant whose trumpet call of protest instantly silenced the wolves they might pull down a calf that strayed too far from its mother but no beasts hunted ful grown elephants not more than once anyway kenton thought the normal small night noises took a while to come back after the hairy elephants cry the scout strained his ears listening for one set in particular the grunts and shouts that would have warned of wild sims no camp was in earshot at any rate hunting males ranged widely though and these sims would from long acquaintance not be in awe of men and thus doubly dangerous a coughing roar only a couple of hundred yards away cut short his reverie on the sims the scout sprang to his feet his finger darting to the trigger of his musket that cry also roused charles the sim stood at kentons side hatchet ready in his hand the roar came again this time fiercely triumphant spearfang charles signed with kil yes kenton said now that the beast had found a victim it would not be interested in hunting for others such as for instance himself and the sim in dead of night he welcomed that lack of interest all the same excitement prickled in him the big cats were not common along the atlantic seaboard and relentless hunting had reduced their numbers even in the hinterlands of the virginia colony not many men these days came to the governor at portsmouth to col ect the pound bounty on a pair of fangs kenton imagined the consternation that would ensue if he marched into the hal of burgesses with a score of six inchlong ivory daggers most of the clerks he knew would sooner pass a kidney stone than pay out fifty pounds of what was not even their own money the scout snorted contemptuously id sooner reason with a sim he said charles grunted and made the questionmark gesture never mind kenton said you may as well go back to sleep charles did with the same ease he had shown before nothing troubled him for long on the other hand he lacked the sense for longterm planning kenton watched the stars spin slowly through the sky when he reckoned it was midnight he woke charles stripped off his breeches and tunic and rolled himself in his blanket despite exhaustion his whirling thoughts kept him some time awake this once he thought he would not have minded swapping wits with his sim sunrise woke the scout seeing him stir charles nodded his way all good the sim signed spearfang stay away aye thats good enough for me kenton said charles nodded and built up the fire while kenton sighing stretched and dressed jokes involving wordplay were wasted on sims though charles had laughed like a loon when the scout went sprawling over a root a couple of days earlier the turkey was still almost as good as it had been the night before munching on bulbs of wild onion between bites went a long way toward hiding the slight gamy taste the meat had acquired the way west was downhill now the explorer and his sim had passed the watershed not long before they made camp the little stream by which they had built their fire ran westward not comfortably toward the atlantic like every other waterway with which kenton was familiar the scout strode along easily working out the kinks a nights sleep on the ground had put in his muscles his mouth twisted a few years ago he would have felt no aches no matter what he did but his lightbrown hair was beginning to be frosted with gray and to recede at the temples kenton was proud the governor had chosen him for this first western journey rather than some man still in his twenties oh aye a youngster might travel faster and see a bit more lord emerson said but youre more likely to return and tell us of it he laughed out loud he wondered what lord emerson would have said after learning of his spearfanghunting plans something pungent and memorable no doubt charles stopped with a perplexed grunt very much the sort of sound a true man might have made ahead strange sound he signed kenton listened but heard nothing he shrugged his eyes were as sharp as the sims but charles had very good ears they were surely not a match for a hounds nor was the sims sense of smel but charles could communicate what he sensed in a way no animal could match far or close the scout asked not close well go on then kenton decided after a few hundred cautious yards he heard the rumble too or perhaps felt would have been the better word for it he thought of distant thunder that went on and on but the day was clear he wondered if he was hearing a waterfall far away kentons falls he said trying out the sound he liked it charles turned to look at him then made as if to stumble over a root the sim got up with a sly grin on his face kenton laughed too charles had made a pun after all even if unintentionally the game path they were following twisted southward bringing the edge of a large clearing into view kenton stared in openmouthed wonder at the teeming milling burlo the break in the trees revealed there were more of them than virginia herds had cattle the beasts were of two sorts the shorthorned kind with its hump and shaggy mane was also fairly common east of the mountains it closely resembled the familiar wisent of europe the other variety was larger and grander with horns sweeping out from its head in a formidable defensive arc only stragglers of that sort reached virginia they were notoriously dangerous to hunt being quicker and stronger than their more common cousins the rumble the sim and scout had heard was coming from the clearing it was the pounding of innumerable buffalo hooves on the turf charles poinoed to the herd signing good hunting good eating good hunting indeed kenton said its meat smoked over a fire a single buffalo could feed charles and him for weeks but the scout saw no need for that much work with the big beasts so plentiful it would be easy to kil one whenever they needed fresh meat good hunting in another way also the scout realized a herd this size would surely draw wolves and spearfangs to prey on stragglers kenton smiled in anticipation he would prey on them lets get some meat kenton said matteroffactly charles nodded and slipped off the trail into the trees the scout followed he could just as well have led the sim and he were equal y skilled in woodscraft but he would not go wrong letting charles pick a spot from which to shoot once away from the trail the scout felt as though the forest had swallowed him the crowns of the trees overhead hid the sun light came through them wan green and shifting shrubs and bushes grew thick enough to reduce vision to a few yards but not enough to impede progress much the air was cool moist and still with the smell of earth and growing things steering by the patterns of moss and other subtle signs charles and kenton reached the clearing they had spied in the distance it was even larger than the scout had thought and ful of buffalo more entered by way of a game track to the north that was wider than most virginia roads others took the trail south and west out charles picked a vantage point where the forest projected a little into the clearing giving kenton a broad view and a chance to pick his target at leisure good job the scout murmured charles wriggled with pleasure at the praise like a patted hound but kenton knew there was more to the sims glee than any dog would have felt charless reasoning was slower and far less accurate than a mans but it was enough for him to understand how and why he had pleased the scout people who treated their sims like cattle or other beasts of burden often had them run away kenton shook his head slightly as he aimed at a plump young buffalo not thirty yards away if gharles wanted to flee on this journey he had his chance every night the flintlock bucked against the scouts shoulder though the long barrel of soft iron reduced the recoil buffalo heads sprang up at the report the animals startled snorts filled the clearing then the buffalo were running and kenton felt the ground shudder under his feet if the sound of the beasts hooves had been distant thunder before now the scout heard the roar as if in the center of a cloudburst charles was shouting but kenton only saw his open mouth his cry was lost in the din of the stampede the cow the scout had shot tried to join the panic rush despite the blood that gushed from its shoulder just below the hump and soaked its shaggy brown hair after half a dozen lurching strides blood also poured from its mouth and nose it swayed and fel several other buffalo most of them calves were down trampled when kenton and charles went out into the clearing which was now almost empty the scout took the precaution of reloading this time with a double charge before he emerged from the woods in case one of the buffalo stil on their feet should decide to charge crows and foxes began feasting while charles was still cutting two large chunks of meat from the tender fatrich hump soon other hunters and scavengers would come spearfangs perhaps or wolves or sims kenton preferred meeting any of them on ground of his own choosing not here in the open he drew back into the woods as soon as charles had finished his butchery they got well away from the open space before they camped and kenton made sure they did so in a small hollow to screen the light of his fire from unwelcome eyes after he had eaten he wiped his greasy hands on the grass then dug into his pack for his journal pen and inkpot he wrote a brief account of the past couple of days of travel and added to the sketch map he was keeping as always charles watched with interest talking marks he signed aye so they are how do marks talk the sim asked punctuating the question with a pleading whimper kenton could only spread his hands regretfully several times he had tried to teach charles the abcs but the sim could not grasp that a sign on paper reprented a sound no sim had ever learned to read or write then the scout had an idea maybe his map would be easier than letters for charles to understand recall the creek we walked along this morning how it bent north and then southwest the sim nodded kenton pointed to his representation here is a line that moves the same way the creek did charles looked reproachful y at the scout line not move line there no i mean the line shows the direction of the creek dyou see first it goes up then down and over like the stream did so in their deep shadowed sockets beneath his brow ridges charless eyes were full of pained incomprehension line not like stream how can line be like stream the line is a picture of the stream the scout said line not picture charless signs were quick and firm picture like thing to eyes line not like stream kenton shrugged and gave up that had been his last best try at getting the idea across sims recognized paintings even penandink drawings abstract symbols though remained beyond their capacity the scout sighed got out his blanket and slept instead of returning to the clearing kenton decided to parallel the game track down which the buffalo had fled mockingbirds yammered in the treetops high overhead while red squirrels and gray frisked along the branches pausing now and then to peer suspiciously down at the man and the sim an englishman i met at portsmouth told me there are no gray squirrels in england only red ones kenton remarked no grays who ate them kenton smiled then sobered there was more to the question than charles in his innocent ignorance had meant people on both sides of the atlantic were still hotly debating the notion someone had put forward a generation before that the struggle of predator against prey determined which forms of life would prosper and which would fail the scout liked the idea to his mind it explained why such beasts as spearfangs and hairy elephants lived in america but not in europe though their ancient bones had been found there humans even savages were better hunters than sims already after less than a century spearfangs were scarce in virginia no doubt they had been exterminated east of the ocean so long ago that even the memory of them was gone the thought of life changing through time horrified folk who took their scripture literal y kenton could not fathom their cries of protest america had shown so many wonders the bible did not speak of sims not the least that using scripture to account for them struck him as foolish like most colonists he preferred to judge truth for himself not receive it from a preacher a little past noon the scout began hearing the low rumble of many buffalo hooves again he found a herd gathered at a salt lick pushing and shoving each other to get at the salt like so many townswomen elbowing their way to a peddlers cart he took out his journal and noted the lick when settlers eventual y came they could use the salt to preserve their meat he had not intended to hunt that day not when he and charles were still carrying some of the buffalo hump but a tawny blur exploded from the far side of the clearing and darted toward a yearling cow at the edge of the herd the spearfangs roar sent the buffalo scattering in terror and made ice walk up kentons back the spearfangs powerful forelimbs wrapped round the buffalos neck despite the beasts panicstricken thrashing and bucking the spearfang wrestled it to the ground excitement made the big cats short stumpy tail quiver absurdly the struggle went on for several minutes the buffalo trying desperately to break free and the spearfang to hold it in place with front legs and claws at last the spearfang found the grip it wanted its jaws gaped hugely it see its fangs slashing across the buffalos throat blood fountained the buffalo gave a final convulsive shiver and was still the spearfang began to feed tearing great hunks of dripping meat from the buffalos flank kenton swung up his musket glad he had a double charge in the gun luckily the spearfang was exposing its left side to him he released the set trigger took a deep breath and held it to steady his aim touched the second trigger his flint and gunpowder were french and of the best quality only a farmer would use virginiamade powder along with the twin triggers they ensured that the musket would not misfire or hang fire the spearfang screamed it whirled and snapped at its flank but the wound was not mortal for the spearfang bounded into the woods the way it had come oh a pox kenton said the shot had struck too far forward to pierce the heart he paused to reload before pursuing the big cat he was not mad enough to follow a wounded spearfang armed only with a brace of pistols as he had been trained charles trotted ahead to find the trail kenton soon waved him back to a position of safety the spearfang had left a bloodspattered spoor any fool could follow that overconfidence almost cost the scout his life once in the forest the spearfang doubled back on its trail kenton did not suspect it was there till it burst from the under growth a bare ten yards to his left those yawning jaws seemed a yard wide big enough to gulp him down at a single bite he had not time to turn and shoot afterwards he thought himself lucky to have got off a shot across his body his musket cradled in the crook of his elbow with a lighter gun he probably would have broken his arm but one of the reasons he carried a fivefoot eleven pound rifle was to let him take such snap shots at need because of its weight it had less kick the spearfang pitched sideways as the ball which weighed almost a third of an ounce slammed into its face just below a glaring eye an instant later charless hatchet clove the beasts skull kenton thought his bullet had already killed it but was honest enough to admit he was never quite sure his narrow escape made his hands shake so much he spilled powder as he reloaded something he had not done since he was a boy charles had to set a foot on the spearfangs carcass to tug his hatchet free he used it and his knife to worry the fangs from the cats upper jaw handed kenton the bloody trophies thanks the scout wiped his sweatbeaded forehead with the back of his hand that by god is pounds earned the sim shrugged with his simple wants money meant little to him ever practical he signed good meat back there here in this unexplored territory pounds was of no more immediaoe use to kenton than to charles the scout nodded made his wits return to the business at hand so there is lets get at it he and the sim walked back toward the buffalo the spearfang had kil ed kenton made a semipermanent camp near the salt lick building a leanto of branches and leaves for protection against the warm summer rain he went back to the lick for both deer and buffalo and added three more sets of spearfang teeth in less hair raising fashion than he had col ected the first the hunting was so easy it required only a small part of his time he ranged widely over the countryside adding to his map and journal the more he traveled the richer he judged the land not only was it full of game but the rich soil and abundant water were made for farming sometimes charles accompanied him on his journeys sometimes he went alone the sim traveled too though not as widely as kenton often he would bring back to camp smal game he had slain himself rabbits turkey a beaver a porcupine that proved amazingly tasty once it was skinned they made a welcome change of diet saw strange thing charles signed after one of his solitary jaunts many buffalo bones he opened and closed his hands several times indicating some number larger than he could count he led kenton to the spot the next morning the scout whistled in surprise as he looked down into a dry wash at the tangle of whitened bones there must be a hundred head easy he said charles repeated the sign for an indefinitely large number together they scrambled down the steep side of the ravine going slowly and often grabbing at bushes for support kenton tried to imagine what could have made a herd plunge down such a slope even at fuii stampede the buffalo should have turned aside then the scout was among the bones scavengers had pul ed apart many skeletons bushes were pushing through rib cages climbing over skulls the herd had met disaster at least a year ago kenton judged many great legbones were neatly split lengthwise almost al the skul s smashed open when kenton found a fist sized lump of stone with an edge chipped sharp it only confirmed what he had already guessed he tossed the handaxe up and down charles recognized it at once sims wild sims aye no animal couldve gone for the beasts brains and marrow so likely kenton thought the subhumans had driven the buffalo into the gully he glanced round as if expecting to see a sim crouching behind every shrub he had never doubted sims lived west of the mountains but this was the first sure sign of it and a sobering reminder big killing charles signed his eyes traveling the scatered bones kenton wondered what was going through his mind wondered if he was proud of the slaughter his distant cousins had worked some englishmen trained their sims to hate and fear the wild ones the scout had never seen the need for that finding out he was wrong might prove costly he did his best to keep his voice casual let me know before you join them eh charless face was troubled joke he signed at last kenton dimly realized how hard it had to be for sims to keep track of mens vagaries they could not share joke he said firmly charles nodded they spent a while longer investigating the ravine kenton turned up a few more stone tools but nothing to show that the sims had come back to this immediate area since the year before that was some relief if not much when charles wanted to go off for some purpose of his own kenton said only ill see you back at the camp this evening the last thing he wanted was the sim thinking he mistrusted him he wished he had kept his mouth shut instead of letting his stupid wisecrack out thinking such dark thoughts the scout decided to return to the salt lick the chunk of venison he had cached in a tree probably would not be fit to eat by nightfal not in this heat and game was so easy to come by west mountains that he did not have to put up with meat even a little off he wormed his way to his familiar cover excitment coursed through him as he looked into the clearing of the lick a spearfang had just slain a plump doe dragging the carcass back into the bushes to feed without conscious volition his rifle sprang to his shoulder and spoke the spearfang yowled with anguish as it staggering from its kill kenton reloaded hurried after it he held the gun at the ready although he did not think he would need it for such desperate work as before the big cats gait reflected a wound that would soon be fatal so it proved less than a furlong from the fallen doe the scout found the spearfang dead its mouth gaping in defiant snarl insects were already lighting on the cat they buzzed away as kenton stooped beside it he set down his rifle used his knife and a stone out the beasts fangs they were a fine pair not much shorter than the gap between his thumb and little finger when he splayed them wide he bound the two long teeth with a rawhide thong slipped them into his pouch rest he caught a slight motion out of the corner of his eye still on his knees he turned see ill be rich yet the words caught in his throat the sim behind was naked and shorter and stockier than his companion and hefted a stone in its right hand the tableau held for several seconds the sim looked at kenton as if unsure it believed its eyes he beratted himself for putting his musket to one side the sim might hurl its rock before he grabbed the gun and at twenty feet he might miss with a pistol all the same his right hand was easing towardthe musket when three more sims all adult males slid silently out no chance now he could frighten them off he drew a pistol that alone would have sent wild virginia sims running they knew what guns could do but these sims did not know filearms one drew back its arm to cast its stone into the air at the report and the noise the sims shouted in fright the scout could flee but the one that had its rock ready and that rallied the others they rushed at him the missile snatched out his other gun and at blank range as happens too mournful y outside of action romances he missed he brought the gun down clubfashion on a sims head the stunned sim stil surged forward to grapple him as they had thicker skulls than humans the scout was just as glad not to remember the fight with the sims what he could recal hurt he soon lost consciousness the sims were not sophisticated enough to use deliberate cruelty but when four of them beat him into submission the result came close enough to foolall but the most exacting critic when he came back to himself one sim was carrying his gun and another with its hands dug into his pack why the sims had not killed him on lug his head he saw that the four he had fought with were part of a larger band there mwt have xber mose of them bearing big joints lwdeer the spearfang had killed and from the her food he thought they could afford curiosity about him humans were as wsaa the leverse indeed sims had kidnapped his grandmother when she was a baby which proved interesting enough to distract a good part of the troop from his person the fine black grains of gunpowder made the sims sneeze some tasted the stuff and made faces at the result the scout hoped they would toss the powderhorn onto the fire the blast might scare them away long enough for him to get free of course afoer a pound of gunpowder went off close by he might not be in any condition to try given his present predicament though he was willing to take the risk the sims poured the powder out onto the ground scotching that chance his tin water jar enthral ed them a good deal more like his belt it was an idea they had not thought of one rushed over to a tiny creek a few hundred yards away filled the jar and brought it back the sim that had bound the stone to the vine belt suddenly snatched up the powderhorn it hurried to the streamlet and filled the powderhorn with water adapting a tool from one use to another showed quicker wit than most sims could boast they came to his shotpouch next the bul ets cascaded out as soon as the sims discovered they were not some queer kind of fruit their youngsters pounced on the musket balls which made toys unlike the sticks leaves and stones they had known before the older sims went on exploring the scouts gear he ground his teeth as they opened the leather bag that held the canines of the spearfangs he had killed the sims recognized the fangs at once surprised hoots arose the sims stared wideeyed at kenton unable to imagine how he had slain so many of the big cats last of all the sims pulled his knife from its sheath the only sharp edges they knew were the ones they laboriously chipped and flaked onto stone they did not recognize the gleaming steel blade as something familiar until one of them closed her hand round it she shrieked at the unexpected pain gaped to see blood streaming down her fingers one of the males seized the knife then by the hilt more through luck than design the sim brandished the weapon wildly then suddenly stopped realizing what it was for again kenton fought panic men likely would have tested the blade on his flesh but sims had minds more strictly utilitarian the male squatted in front of one of the joints of meat the hunting party had brought back it screeched in pleasure at the ease with which the knife slid through the flesh another sim stuck the carvedoff gobbet on a stick and held it over the fire the first smel of roasting meat made most of the sims forget about kenton they armed themselves with sticks and dashed over to the butcher who grinning was cutting chunk afkr chunk from the does hindquarters the males jostled round the fire such a feast did not often come their way females and youngsters beseechingly held out their hands with so much food the males were generous in sharing the wind had shifted til it came out of the west fil ing the sky with clouds and blowing smoke from the fire straight into kentons face it made him cough and his eyes water mixed with it though was enough of the aroma of cookery to drive him nearly wild he could hear his stomach growling above the racket the sims were making he loudly smacked his lips a signal sims gave one another when they were hungry the sims who heard him sent him the same curious look they had when he imitated their greetingcal but they did not feed him taking a captive was so unusual for them that they had no idea how to treat one any being outside their troop was not one of them and so was entitled to nothing things might have been worse kenton decided instead of begging for food he could have been food that the sims showed no signs of moving in that direction was mildly heartening enough at any rate to help him resist his hunger pangs he wondered what charles was doing by now the sim should long since have returned to their camp and it was late enough for him to be wondering what had happened to kenton he might the scout decided be clever enough to visit the salt lick kenton went there most often the scout could not guess what charles would do after that he was used to the company of humans maybe he would try to go back to virginia kenton wondered if the men at portsmouth would believe his explanations or kil him for doing away with his master he hoped they would believe him charles deserved a better fate than disbelief would get him the sim might have a better chance here west of the mountains he was an able hunter he would have no trouble feeding himself eventually he should be able to find a home among the wild sims here suspicious though they were of al strangers charles would be able to show them so much that he could prove himself too valuable to exclude apart from the knife and hatchet he carried he had learned a great deal in virginia that wild sims were ignorant of even something as simple as the art of tying knots was unknown here these sims if they were like the ones along the atlantic would not know how to set snares charles might even be able to show them how to tan leather which would give them footwear and many new tools all that would make the wild sims harder to push aside when english settlers began coming over the mountains kenton found he did not much care he and charles had been a team for years now he could not find it in his heart to wish the sim anything but good no matter what resulted afterwards the wind was blowing harder now bringing with it cool moist air it must have felt wonderful to the sims who because of their thick hair suffered worse than humans from the usual run of summer weather that dislike of heat though did not keep them from feeding the fire with branches and dry shrubs whenever it began to get low the amount the sims could eat was astonishing because they spent so much time hungry they were extravagantly able to make up for it when the chance came they also let nothing go to waste eating eyes tongues and lungs from carcasses smashing big bones and sucking smaller ones to get every scrap of marrow at last a sort of happy torpor came to the encampment females nursed their infants youngsters gradual y lost intrest in throwing kentons musket balls at each other and bedded down in nests of dry grass and leaves most of the atults followed them before long singly or in pairs a few males stayed awake one kept the fire going three more went to the edge of the clearing as sentries one of those carried a club another a couple of chipped stones the third a large hulking sim bore kentons rifle it carried the gun by the muzzle end of the barrel and swung it menacingly every minute or so as if daring anything dangerous to come close the clever sim sat crosslegged by the fire not far from the scout it stared down at the dagger it held in its lap from time to time it would run a hand along its chinless jaw the very image of studious concentration kenton felt a touch of sympathy the sim could study the knife till doomsday without learning how it was made at that moment the sim looked his way it shook its head exactly as a frustrated man might it was full of questions and had no way to ask them some of the wild virginia sims had learned signspeech from runaways and used it among themselves but it had not come over the mountains the wild troops had so little contact with one another that ideas spread very slowly among them the sim picked up a stone chopper took it in its left hand and the knife in its right the crudeness of its own product next to the other must have infuriated it for it suddenly scrambled to its feet and hurled the stone far into the night all three of the males standing watch whirled at the sound of the rejected tool landing in the bushes the clever sim let out an apologetic hoot the others relaxed the clever sim came over to glare at kenton the scout thought what a man would be feeling confronted with skil s and knowledge so far ahead of anything he possessed and confronted with a being like and yet unlike himself sims were less imaginative than humans but surely some of that combination of anger fear and awe was on the subhumans face anger quickly came to predominaoe kenton uselessly tightened his muscles against the knife thrust he expected he hardly noticed the first raindrop that landed on his cheek or the second even when a drop hit him in the eye it distracted him only briefly from his fearful focus on the blade in the sims hairy hand the sim shook its head in annoyance as the rain began to it too the early sprinkles were but an irritation as the rain kept up though it forgot kenton forgot the knife it held its cry of alarm brought the rest of the troop bounding from their rest for a moment kenton wondered if the clever sim had gone mad but soon he understood its concern for the rain grew harder the fire began to hiss as water poured down on it and no wild sim could start a fire once it went out because that was so the sims had had to learn to keep their flames alive even in the face of rain some of the males held hides above the fire to shield it from the storm females dug ditches and built little dams of mud so the water on the ground would not get the fuel wet their efforts worked for a time the sims with the hide shield coughed and choked on the smoke it trapped but they did not leave their post the fire continued to crackle kenton all but ignored it his mouth was wide open to catch as much of the rain as he could the sims had given him no more water than food and his throat felt raspy as a file it took a while to get enough for a swallow but every one was bliss the downpour grew heavier the wind stronger soon it was blowing sheets of water horizontal y the sims hides were less and less use they wailed in dismay as the fire went out kenton could hardly hear them over the drumming of the rain he was glad they had not dumped him face down he might have drowned the storm lasted through the night and began to ease only when light returned drenched kenton was relieved the rain was warm had the cloudburst come say in fal he would have been all too vulnerable to chest fever he imagined it carried off many of the sims they huddled together sodden and miserable around their dead fire their arms up to keep some of the rain from their faces now and then one would let out a mournful keening cry that several others would echo it reminded the scout eerily of a wake when the rain was final y over the clever sim raked through the ashes searching for hot coals that might be coaxed back to life but the storm had been too strong everything was soaked as the sims saw they were indeed without the heat to cook their food and in days to come to keep them warm they broke out in a fresh round of lamentation kenton wondered if they would seek to have him restart the blaze if that meant getting free of them he would do so in an instant he would have offered if they understood his speech or if he could have used his arms to gesture but they did not even look his way it did not occur to them that anyone could start a fire his strangeness and the curious tools he bore were not enough to overcome that automatic assumption slowly morosely the sims began to pick up the usual business of the camp a grizzled male chipped away at a chunk of flint to shape a new handaxe females dug roots with sticks and went into the nearby forest after early ripening berries youngsters turned over rocks and popped whatever crawling things they found into their mouths a hunting party set out armed with an assortment of wooden clubs and sharp stones the sim with kentons musket apparently decided the long gun would be too clumsy to swing in tight quarters for it exchanged the rifle for a stout bludgeon the scout shook his head relieved that the sim did not grasp what the musket could do the clever sim did not go with the band of hunting males its arms were filthy to the elbows from grubbing in the ruins of the fire it kept staring at kenton as if he were a puzzle to be pieced together when a couple of toddlers came over and prodded him it bared its formidable teeth and shouted so fiercely that they tumbled backward in fright it came over and squatted by him it made squelching sounds as it sat in the mud i am not your enemy kenton said as he had the night before it grunted he thought it sought to converse with him but his words meant nothing to it sims came to understand human speech but their own calls in the wild even eked out by gestures did not make up a language the clever sim felt the lack yet was powerless to remedy it had his arms been free kenton might have but he needed dumb show to ask to be released and could not use it until he had been contemplating that paradox led only to discomfiture if the sim and he could not converse though only one thing was likely to happen to him no sims he knew kept captives and the treatment he was getting here showed this troop to be no different his flesh might not be so toothsome raw as roasted but he did not think that would save him the way the clever sim was licking its lips now as it looked at him told him it had come to the same conclusion the only reason he could find for its not kil ing him immediately was to keep his meat fresh for the hunting party when they came back that did little to improve his spirits he was getting thirsty again too and very hungry the day dragged on the clever sim no longer bothered to keep the troops youngsters away from kenton the small indignities they inflicted in their curiosity added to his misery still human children would have done worse he heard a rustling in the woods from the direction in which the hunters had gone the old male who had been making tools gave the grunted greetingnoise kenton turned his head as the clever sim moved toward him his knife in its hand he expected the returning hunters would be the last thing he ever saw then the old sim and several females cried out in alarm the clever sim sucked in its breath in a harsh gasp coming into the clearing was not one of the hunters it was charles instead charless eyes went wide when he saw kenton lying tied in the mud by the drowned fire he was too far away for the scout to read his expression clearly kenton wondered what was going through his mind observing his master bound and helpless in the hands of his wild cousins was he tempted to throw in his lot with them how could he help it with the scouts vulnerability so displayed superior wit was not all that let humans rule sims their aura of might played no little role if kentons weakness gave charles qualms the sim from virginia was as disturbing to the wild sims the scouts clothes and possessions were strange to them but so was he himself charles was of their own kind yet he too wore a belt and buskins and bore tools of the same alien sort as kentons the clever sim glanced from the knife he was holding to the one swinging at charless belt and to the bright steel head of the hatchet charles carried the clever sims face was the picture of bewilderment kenton could hardly blame it it had seen its world turned upside down twice now in two days raising the hatchet in a plain warning gesture charles advanced into the clearing females and young scurried away from him he was more frightening than kenton and not just because he was free the familiar turned bizarre is always harder to face than something wildly different charles strode toward kenton the hatchet still held high the scout spoke through lips dry from thirst and fear good to see you again he had all he could do to hold his voice steady nothing he knew might more quickly ingratiate charles with the wild sims than slaughtering him charles surveyed the encampment the clever sim was the only male there of vigorous years when it saw that charles understood kenton it scowled fiercely and tightened its grip on the scoouts knife kenton had no choice but to wait to see what charles would do but charles also seemed unsure staring from the scout to the clever sim and back again at last his left hand moved in a sign kenton understood trouble trouble indeed kenton said though he could not tel whether charles meant the sign for him or it was simply the sims equivalent of talking to himself daring to hope hurt as an arm that has fallen asleep will tingle when the blood rushes in again then charles signed i help and squatted over him to cut his bonds the clever sim shouted angrily and brandished the scouts knife charles shouted back but drew away from kenton had it just been the clever sim and he the hatchet would have given him all the advantage he needed but though none of the other sims was his match individual y togther they could overwhelm him give them something to think about kenton exclaimed suddenly the storm put out their fire start it again the way charless face lit was almost enough to kindle a blaze by itself he deliberately turned his back on the clever sim doing it with as much aplomb as any nobleman scoring off some rival in spite of everything kenton could not help smiling here was something unexpected that charles had learned in virginia charles knelt and took out his tinderbox the scout heard him strike flint and steel together several times saw him bend further to blow to life the sparks that had fallen on his tinder then with a satisfied snort charles stepped away because he had no dry fuel close by he had made a pile of all the powdered bark and lint in the tinderbox the little fire crackled briskly the wild sims stood transfixed as if turned to stone then one of the old males hooted softly the most nearly awed sound kenton had ever heard from a sims throat the old male scrabbled through the remains of the dead fire for wood dry enough to burn having found a couple of sticks it approached the blaze charles had set glancing at him as though for permission when he did not object it set the sticks on the fire after a while they caught half a dozen wild sims dashed off after more fuel the rest crowded toward the blaze drawn to the flames like moths not even the clever sim was immune to the fascination this time it did not object when charles stooped and began cutting kentons bonds the scout grimaced at the sting of returning circulation he had imagined a few minutes before he clenched and unclenched his fingers and toes trying to work feeling back into them all the same it was some minutes before he could stand when he finally did he had to clutch undignifiedly at his trousers their sueded leather had stretched from the soaking it had taken he did not think he could get his knife back from the clever sim but did go over to where the other male had discarded his musket with his powder spilled and bul ets scattered he had only the one shot till he got back to his pack but that was better than nothing and the wild sim had been right in its way at need the rifle would make a good club kenton also gathered up the spearfang canines although to his annoyance one had disappeared in the mud he had come by them through hard dangerous hunting and they represented wealth too great and too easily portable for him to abandon though the scout hurried charles waited with barely concealed impatience we go he signed adding the emphatic gesture to the questioning one indeed we do kenton wanted to be as far from the encampment as he could when the hunting party returned the clever sim watched them withdraw its massive jaw muscles worked the scout could all but taste its frustration it had met beings and found tools and skil s beyond any it could have imagined and here afoer only a brief moment they were vanishing from its life again that proved more than it could bear with a harsh cry it rushed kenton and charles the scout flung his musket to his shoulder but hesitated with his finger still on the first trigger the males in the hunting party had heard gunfire before the sound of a shot would surely bring them on the run charles had no such worries his arm went back then forward the hatchet spun through the air it buried itself deep in the clever sims chest the clever sim shrieked it wrenched the hatchet out heedless of the blood that gushed from the wound the clever sim flung the hatchet back at charles but its throw was wild it staggered on rubbery legs sat heavily kenton could hear how its breath bubbled in its throat the rest of the wild sims came out of their trance round the fire they shouted and hooted hands groped for stones to throw saving his single bullet against desperate need kenton ran charles fled with him stopping only to get the hatchet from where it lay on the ground red streaked the gray steel blade kenton never found out whether the clever sim lived or died he was everlastingly grateful it was the only robust male at the encampment he and charles outdistanced the grayhairs and youngsters that tried to pursue them they might not have had such good fortune if tested against the members of the hunting band the more so as the scouts abused limbs could not carry him at full speed kenton knew the troops hunters would be expert trackers they would have to be living as they did from what they could run down and so no matter how urgently he wanted to put distance between himself and the camp he and charles did not neglect muddling their trail doubling back on their tracks and splashing down streams so they would not leave footprints a large bullfrog sat on a halfsubmerged log staring stupidly as kenton and charles drew near too late it decided to leap away the scout grabbed it and broke its neck a bit farther on they came upon clumps of freshwater mussels growing on some rocks charles used his knife and kenton borrowed his hatchet to sever the foot by which the shellfish moored themselves by then it was nearly dark neither of them knew the countryside well enough to head back toward the camp by night they would have to shift camp anyway kenton realized it was too close to the salt lick the wild sims would surely scour that whole area in search of them the scout hoped he could recover his pistols from the spot where he had kil ed the spearfang all that though could wait finding a hiding place for the night came first a hollow with a rock pile down one side proved suitable after kenton stoned to death a fat rattlingsnake that had been nesting among the rocks fire charles signed the scout considered the lay of the land yes he said a small one if the wild sims came close enough to spot a tiny blaze by night they would be on top of him anyway and while he did not mind eating raw shellfish even hungry as he was he wanted to roast the frog and snake his stomach stil growled when he was done with his share but he felt better for it he licked his fingers clean of grease and looked across the fire at charles who was still worrying tiny fragments of meat from a frogleg with his tongue in the dim flickering red light the sims eyes were sunk in pits of shadow unreadable charles kenton began and then stopped unsure how or if to go on charles tossed the bones by now quite naked to one side he gave a lowvoiced questioning hoot i thank you the scout said charles grunted a noncommittal sound kenton almost let it rest there his curiosity though was too great people had been trying to understand sims and to see how close sims could come to understanding them for close to two centuries and so the scout asked why did you decide to rescue me the skin moved on charless browridges a man would have been wrinkling his forehead in concentration you i come here together he signed we go back together the scout wondered if that indeed was the whole answer because they were less imaginative than men sims rigidly fol owed plans kenton had often talked about the return trip perhaps charles had simply been unable to conceive of anything else happening and had acted as he did more for the picture of the future the scout had outlined than for kentons sake kentons lips twisted wryly there was a thought to put him in his place he persisted it would have been easier and less risky for you to join the wild sims he knew he was treading on dangerous ground back in virginia many sims fled to the wild troops that still lurked in the backwoods there was always the risk of putting ideas in charless head that had not been there before the sim surprised him with an immediate gesture of rejection not leave you charles signed you me together good years and years not want end i thank you kenton said again had he followed the course of some colonists who treated their sims as much like beasts as possible he was sure he would have been shared among the wild sims in raw gobbets with charles likely joining the feast but the sim to his surprise was not done signing not want to live with wild sims want to live with people wild sims boring an enormous yawn rendered that not know houses not know music not know knives not know bread charles sniffed with the same disdain a portsmouth grandee would have shown on learning his daughters prospective bridegroom wore no shoes and shared a cabin with his mule kenton burst out laughing charles snorted indignantly the scout apologized both in words and with the customary sim gesture he smacked his lips loudly and spread his hands meaning he had intended no harm charles accepted once more with a lords grace inside though kenton kept chuckling though he was careful not to show it he did not want to hurt charless feelings but how on earth he wondered was he going to explain to lord emerson that he had been saved because his sim was a snob i the iron elephant the americas proved to possess a number of animals unlike any with which europeans had been familiar the ground sloth the spearfang and the several varieties of armadillo of which the largest was bigger than a man others such as the hairy elephant had counterparts in distant areas of the old world but still seemed exotic to early generations of settlers just before the american colonies broke away from english tyranny and banded together to form the federated commonwealths of america however efforts began to exploit the hairy elephants great strength in a new way the first rail systems with waggons pulled by horses appeared in england at about this time to haul coal from mines to rivers and canals hairy elephants began their railroad work in this same capacity but soon were pulling other freight and passengers as well in the decades fol owing the creation of the republic railroads spread across the country because the federated commonwealths is so much larger than any european nation such a web of steel was a vital link in knitting the country together by i tracks had reached across the new nile the mighty river remained unbridged but ferry barges joined the settled east with the new lands that were just beginning to be farmed but the hairy elephants trumpet was not destined to remain the characteristic sound of the railroads coal mining also resulted in the development of the steam engine at first used only in place to pump water from the mines the steam engine soon proved capable of broader application soon the hairy elephants that had been for more than a generation the mainstay of the american railway system began to feel the effects of mechanical competition from the story of the federated commonwealths the train rattled east across the prairie toward springfield preen chand kept his rifle across his knees in case of sims from his perch atop caesar the lead hairy elephant he could see a long way over the grassland we should make town in another hour paul tilak called from hannibal the trail beast an easy trip this one preen chand turned around so it is for which i am not sorry he and tilak were both small lightbrown men with delicate features their grandfathers had come to america when the english decided to see if elephant handlers from india could tame the great auburnhaired beasts of the new world the two dozen waggons stretched out behind the pair of elephants showed that the answer was yes though the federated commonwealths had been free of england for a generation with people even then beginning to settle west of the new nile no country aaoss the sea could hope to enforce its will on its onetime colonies sim tilak shouted suddenly there to the north preen chands head whipped round he followed his friends pointing finger sure enough the subhuman was loping along paral el to the train about three hundred yards away preen chand muttered something unpleasant under his breath sims might have no foreheads to speak of but they had learned how far a gun could shoot with hope of accuracy shall we give him a volley tilak asked yes let us preen chand said three hundred yards was not quite impossibly long range not with more than a dozen rifles speaking together and the sims arrogant confidence in its own safety irked the elephant driver he waved a red flag back and forth to make sure the brakemen posted on top of every other car saw it tilak peered back over his shoulder theyre ready preen chand swung the flag down snatched up his rifle it bellowed along with the others and bucked against his shoulder the acrid smell of gunpowder fil ed his nose the hairy elephant beneath him started at the volley it threw up its trunk and let out a trumpeting roar almost as loud as the gunshots preen chand shouted choro caesar choro stop stop elephant commands were the only urdu he still knew his father had preferred them to english and passed them on to him he prodded caesar behind the ear with his foot spoke soothingly to him being on the whole a goodnatured beast the elephant soon calmed tilaks hannibal was more excitable the other driver had to whack him with a brass ankus to make him behave hannibals ears twitched resentfully preen chand peered through the smoke to see whether all that gunfire had actual y hit the sim it hadnt the subhuman let out a raucous hoot shook its fist at the train and bounded away preen chand sighed i do not like those pests not at al one day i would like to unharness caesar and go hunting sims from elephantback men only began settling hereabouts a few years ago tilak said resignedly sims will be less common before long yes but they are so clever its almost impossible to root them out altogether even on the eastern coast where the land has been settled for a hundredfifty years wild bands still linger not so many as here west of the new nile true but they exist mere vermin fail to worry me paul tilak said he put a hand to his forehead to shade his eyes we should be able to see springfield soon oh not yet preen chand said but he also looked ahead and saw the thin line of black smoke against the sky alarm flashed through him fire he shouted the town must be burning he dug his heels into caesars shoulders yelled maiimal go ant he heard tilak using the elephant goad to urge hannibal on the two beasts had to pull hard to gain speed against the dead weight of the train preen chand hoped the brakemen were alert if he had to slow suddenly they would need to halt the waggons before they could barrel into the elephants ahead of them the line of smoke grew taller but no wider preen chand scratched his head funny kind of fire he thought whats burning a farmer called as the train rolled by farms sprouted like mushrooms along the tracks close to town though they were still scarce farther away preen chand shrugged even then in the back of his mind he might have known the truth but it was not the sort of truth he felt like facing before he had to then he could see springfield in the distance its wooden buildings looked quite intact the smoke had stopped rising the prairie breezes played with the plume dispersing it houses stables a church warehouses passed in swift succession preen chand guided caesar gto the last turn before the station choro he called agalg caesar slowed the brakemen worked their levers sparks flew as the waggons iron wheels squealed on the track the train pulled to a halt seventeen minutes ahead of schedule paul tilak said with satisfaction checking his pocket watch no one will be able to complain we are late on this run preen no indeed preen chand said but where is everybody their being early was no reason for the eastbound side of the station to be empty they had been in sight quite a while where were the men and tame sims to unload the trains freight where were the people coming to meet arriving passengers where were the ostlers with fodder and water and giant currycombs for the elephants come to think of it where had the smal boys who always gawked at the train disappeared to preen chand tapped caesars left shoulder as far down as he could reach the hairy elephant obligingly raised its left leg preen chand shinnied down to the broad leathery foot then dropped to the ground a passenger stuck his head out the window of a forward wagon see here sir he cal ed to the elephant driver what is the meaning of this i am an important man and expect to be properly greeted i have business to transact here before i go on to cairo he glared at preen chand as if he thought everything was his fault i am very sorry sir preen chand said politely which was not at all what he was thinking i will try to find out at that moment a door in the station house opened finally preen chand thought someones come to take a look at us it was george stephenson the stationmaster a plump little man who always wore a stovepipe hat that went badly with his build what is the meaning of this preen chand shouted at him stealing the pompous passengers phrase where are the men to take care of the elephants to a driver everything else was secondary to that stephenson should have felt the same way instead he blinked the idea did not seem to have occurred to him ill have wil ie and jake get round to it he said grudgingly get round to it preen chand clapped a hand to his forehead in extravagant disbelief how else will they make enough money for their whiskey what is wrong with this town today has everyone here gone out of his mind not hardly stephenson said he was looking at caesar and hannibal in a way preen chand had never seen before was that pity in his eyes weve just seen the future is al maybe you better take a peep too preen so as you and paul there can start hunting out a new line of work then preen chaud did know what had happened knew it with a certainty that gripped his guts even so he had to make stephenson spell it out you mean ayah thats right preen one o them newfangled steam railroad engines has done come to springfield how do you propose outdoin a machine the pennant tied to the front of the steam engine called it the iron elephant to preen chand the name was an obscene parody the upjutting smokestack reminded him of caesars trunk yes but that trunk frozen inrkgor mortis painting the boiler redbrown to imitate a hairy elephants pelt did not disguise its being made of non and the massive gears and wheels on either side of that boiler seemed to preen chand affixed as an afterthought not parts of the device in the way caesars great legs were part of the elephant besides the thing stank used to the clean earthy smel of elephant preen chands nostrils twitched at the odors of coal smoke and damp cooling iron had he been able to get closer he thought he probably would have been able to find other things to dislike about the iron elephant as it was he had to despise the contraption at a distance almost everybody in springfield had jammed into the westbound side of the station to stare at the steam engine stephenson turned to preen chand saying i know youll want to meet mr trevithick the engine handler and compare notes hes been waiting here for you come on ill take you to him he plunged into the crowd using his weight to shove people aside meeting this trevithick person was the last thing preen chand wanted he also had a schedule to keep he grabbed stephenson by the shoulder of course hes been waiting he only has that damned engine me i have an entire train to see to you have my elephants fed this instant you have them watered you unload what comes off here and get your eastbound freight on board get your passengers moving if i am one minute late coming into cairo on the new nile i will complain to the company yes i will and with any luck we will bypass springfield afterwards he knew he was bluffing likely stephenson did too but he could not afford to ignore the threat without a rail stop springfield would wither and die with poor grace he started pul ing station hands out of the crush and shouting for passengers to get over to the eastbound track the press of people thinned a little satisfied the stationmaster asked ironical y better at any rate preen chand said one fine day soon you wont be able to throw your weight around just on account of you drive elephants preen when steam comes in we wont need stables we wont need the big hay yards this operationll run on half the people and a quarter the cost stephenson rubbed his hands at the prospect and what do you do pray tell me when one of these engines breaks down whom will you hire how much will you have to pay him more than your ostlers or a leech i would wager and how long will the repairs take caesar and hannibal are reliable what sort of schedule will you be able to keep up the iron elephants reliable too stephenson insisted though preen chands objections made him sound as if he were also trying to convince himself but his voice steadied as he went on its steamed all the way out from boston in plymouth commonwealth without coming to grief i reckon that says something in spite of himself preen chand was impressed that was more than i miles still he said scornfully yes hauling nothing but itself and its coalwaggon no passenger coaches or freight waggons stood behind the iron elephant how will it do pulling a real load i dont know anything about that like i told you before fellow you want to talk to is the engine handler come on preen you may as well you know theyll be a good while yet over on the other side oh very well preen chand followed stephenson as the stationmaster forced his way through the crowd which had thinned more while they argued mr trevithickl stephenson called and then again louder mr trevithickl a pale almost consumptivelooking young man standing by the traveling stem engine lifted his head inquiringly mr trevithick this here is mr preen chand the elephant driver you wanted to see ahl the engine handler broke oft the conversation he was having came hurrying over to pump preen chands hand they spoke very well of you in cairo sir when i was arranging permits to travel this line said your caesar and hannibal were firstrate beasts i see they were right youre here a good deal ahead of schedule like any railroad man trevithick always had a watch handy thank you so very much sir preen chand saw he was going to have to work to dislike this man trevithick was perfectly sincere looking into his intense blue eyes preen chand suspected he was one of those people who always said just what they thought because it never occurred to them to do anything else call me richard couldnt stand going as dick trevithick you know and youre preen shouldnt be any stuffiness between folks in the same line of work again preen chand realized that he meant it as gently as he could he said richard it is a line of work that you and that thing he could not make himself call it the iron elephant are trying to get me out of am i how trevithicks surprise was genuine which in turn surplised preen chand who better to work the railroads under than someone long familiar with them as an elephant driver everything about them will be the same except for what pulls the waggons and richard with all respect everything about iron and wood is the same except when i need to start a fire ive spent a lifetime learning to care for elephants what good will that do me in dealing with your boiler there a child could manage the throttle and we have a whole new kind of boiler in the iron elephant with tubes passing through it to heat the water more effectively and the cylinders are almost horizontal they work much betoer than the old vertical design did trevithick glowed with enthusiasm and plainly wanted preen chand to catch fire too why on level ground with the extra power the new system gives we can do close to thirty miles an hour practically flying along the ground had stephenson named the figure preen chand would have cal ed him a liar on the spot he did not think trevithick a man given to exaggeration though thirty miles an hour he tried to imagine what the wind would be like whipping in his face as if he were on a madly galloping racehorse but for some long time not just the few minutes the beast would take to tire how about that preen stephenson put in nudging him in the ribs only way youd get caesar and hannibal moving that fastd be to drop em off a roof preen chand grunted he thought of the stationmasters boasts about how much he could cut back his operation the elephant driver smiled sardonically at trevithicks naivete everything would be the same would it thirty miles an hour is a marvelous speed richard it is most marvelous indeed but that is unloaded i take it what can your steam engine he would not call it the iron elephant not even for politeness sake do pul ing a load of say fifty tons tel him mr trevithick this time the engine handler was the recipient of stephensons conspiratorial elbow he did not seem to notice the gleam in his eyes turned inward as he calculated at last he said that is a great deal of weight does your team real y pul so much for the first time his voice held a trace of doubt they can yes preen chand said proudly truth to tell i hate to wonder if the machinery could stand it but i think we should be able to do something on the order of three miles an hour not counting stops for water or for any breakdowns that might happen three miles an hour is that all george stephenson sounded more betrayed than disappoinoed if that trevithick looked amused now you see why i tend to put more stress on the engines top speed preen chand though was still impressed and worried his beloved elephants were faster but they were only flesh and blood they had to rest where the steam engine could go on and on and on and yet he thought if i can show everyone how the elephants outdo this stinking contraptionrichard load your train up and i will load mine and i will race you from here to carthage a race eh trevithicks bright eyes glowed how far is this carthage place from here fiftythree miles atiny bit south of west the railroad ends soon after it hmm preen chand watched the engine handler go into that neartranoe of conoentration again when he emerged from it he gave the elephant driver a respectful look that will be a very close thing preen you know how embarrassing and i mean financially as well as in the sense of a blow to my pride it would be for me to lose preen chand returned a bland shrug youve come all this way from plymouth richard to show off your ironmongery how embarrassing would it be for word to get out that you refused a challenge from your competition trevithick laughed out loud you misunderstand me i have no intention of refusing when shall we start tomorrow morning what george soephenson let out a howl youre eastbound for cairo tomorrow morning preen what about your precious schedule wel what about it if this steam engine comes in and replaces caesar and hannibal then i will have to do as you suggested before and find other work so it will not matter if the company fires me but if elephants are better than machinery the company should know that too they will thank me more for finding that out than they will be angry with me for being late and besides george why should you worry dont you own the town hotel stephenson suddenly looked crafty well yes now that you mention it i do here is a man who thinks of everything trevithick said admiringly i wonder if i ought to race against you after all no my friend only a joke but tomorrow morning will be too soon we will have to load up waggons so both our trains carry equal weight george you live i here unlike either preen or myself can you hire some sims from the locals to help the ones at the station here with that work reckon so stephenson gave trevithick a sidelong glanoe so long as i aint payin for it that is preen chand gulped he was never going to be rich on an elephant drivers salary but trevithick said ill cover it never fear what i dont make up on bets will come back in the long run through the ballyhoo this race will cause whatever you say all i know is you cant put no bal yhoo in the bank them folks are partial to gold who isnt trevithick chuckled preen chand went back to the other side of the station to stop the unloading of his train the less that came off the less that would have to be put back tomorrow the straw boss who oversaw stephensons gang of sims looked at him as if he were crazy first you was in a hurry to unload and now you want them put back cant you make up your fool mind truly i am sorry mr dubois preen chand had always thought the straw boss more capable than stephenson and treated him accordingly dubois only grunted in disgust then turned and shouted to the dozen sims that were unloading sacks of grain from the waggons he gave hand signals to back his oral instructions sims could fol ow human speech but had trouble imitating it they much preferred to use gestures and many overseers gave orders both ways taking no chances on being misunderstood that care paid off now one of the sims gaped in disbelief at the overseer its long chinless jaw fell open to reveal yellow teeth bigger and stouoer than any mans it ran a hand over what would have been a humans forehead but was in the sim only a smooth slope behind bony browridges back it signed adding the little gesture that turned the word to a question preen chand usual y had some trouble following handtalk but the sim made the sign so emphatic the way a man might shout an objection that he understood it with ease back dubois signed firmly put bags back the sim scratched its hairy cheek let out a wordless hoot of protest it signed bad very bad work all gar e from its point of view preen chand supposed it had a point but under duboiss uncompromising eye it and its comrades began putting the produce back aboard the train what are they doing preen paul tilak demanded that should go in the warehouses here look at the bill of lading and why were they so slow getting here in the first place where was everyone and why is everyone so excited very much the same set of questions preen chand thought wryly that he had thrown at george stephenson they had the same answer too steam engine damnation tilak shouted so loudly that hannibal let out an alarmed snort and swung its shaggy head to see what was wrong with its driver it is all right real y it is tilak reassured him the elephant snorted again doubt ful y but subsided these accursed engines will be the ruination of us tilak said i hope not of course they will tilak was gloomier by nature than preen chand he noticed duboiss gang of sims again what are they doing preen preen chand told him tilaks jaw dropped he frowned i do not know if we can beat this trevithick preen if his machine performs as he says it will he does not know if he can beat us either which makes for a fair trial cheer up paul even if we lose how are we worse off what will happen the company will buy engines just as it would without any race at all but if we win perhaps they will not tilak looked unconvinced before the argument could go further the passenger who had bothered preen chand from the coach window now grabbed him by the arm see here sir do i understand you to mean that this train will not proceed to cairo but rather is returning to carthage i am afraid that is correct sir as gently as he could preen chand shook free of the mans grasp i am so very sorry for any inconvenience this may inconvenience the man exclaimed his face was al most as red as his waistcoat do you know sir that i stand to lose out on a very profitable investment opportunity if i am delayed here that was too much for preen chand the deference that was part of his railroading persona went by the board he stuck his face an inch from the pasngers nose and bel owed god damn you to hel do you know that i stand to lose out on a job i have loved for twentyfive years and that my father and grandfather held before me i piss on your investment opportunity and for a copper sester id black your eye tool tilak quickly stepped between them before they could start a fight the passenger stamped away still yelling threats preen chand looked toward his beloved elephants the ostlers had set out big wooden tubs of water for them derrl he shouoed to caesar splash he thrust out his arm pointing to the obnoxious fellow with whom hed been quarreling caesar snorted up a big trunkful of water and let it go in s a sudden shower that drenched preen chand tilak and dubois got wet too and hopped back swearing the fellow the elephant driver had intended to soak got off unscathed it has been that kind of day preen chand sighed fetch me a towel please someone instead of starting the next morning as preen chand had proposed the race did not begin until three days later part of the delay was from loading waggons so that the elephants and the steam engine would pul about the same amount of weight the rest came from dickering over conditions since the fleshandblood elephants were ready at once while the iron elephant had to build up steam trevithick wanted preen chand not to start until the engine could move this the elephant driver indignantly refused on the grounds that the startup delay was an inherent part of the mechanical devices function public opinion in spring field backed him and trevithick gave way but preen chand had to yield in turn on the load the iron elephant would have to haul he wanted the weight of the waggons added on to that of the engine and coalwaggon trevithick though neatly turned the tables on him pointing out that the iron elephant natural y got lighter as it traveled and consumed its fuel the coal he said should count as part of its initial burden he won his point most of springfield was there to see the race begin the iron elephant was on the regular westbound track caesar and hannibal took the track usually reserved for eastbound trains trevithick doffed his dapper cap to preen ghand the elephant driver returned a curt nod trevithick was not a bad sort if anything that made matters worse the mayor of springfield cried are all you gentlemen ready he held a pistol in the air it would have taken more pul than a steam engine or a couple of hairy elephants put out to keep his honor away hearing no objections he fired the starting gun caesars ears flapped at the report mal mall preen chand shouted behind him he heard paul tilak give hannibal the same command and emphasize it with a whack of the elephant goad the hairy elephants surged forward as far as their harness would al ow then grunting with effort they lowered their heads dug in their big round feet and pulled for al they were worth fifty tons of dead weight was a lot even for such powerful beasts to overcome from the other track preen chand heard the clatter of coal being shoveled into the iron elephants firebox he did not look over he knew his train would get rol ing first and inoended to wring every inch out of his advantage mallmal he shouted again the spectators started to slide out of his field of vision were moving he and tilak shouted in the same breath mallmal in his urgency preen chand used the anhus on caesar the elephant shook his head reproachfully each step caesar and hannibal took came more easily than the one before horses paral eled the twaek as riders came along to watch the race preen chand kin d back over his shoulder the iron elephant stil had not moved we may do this yet he called to paul tilak he hoped so he had bet as many big silver denaires as he could afford and perhaps a few more on the great animal straining beneath him we shall see was all tilak said as far as preen chand knew he had not made any bets for the elephants hie had not made any against them either had he done so preen chand would have kicked him off hannibal even if it meant putting an unschooled oxherd aboard the beast he had already filed one brakeman he wanted no one with him who had a stake in losing buildings hid the iron elephant as caesar and hannibal pul ed their train round a curve they had made a good quarter of a mile and were approaching the outskirts of town when tilak said the machine is coming after us preen chand looked back again sure enough a plume of steam and smoke was rising above the train station the elephant driver grunoed sounding very much like caesar whatever trevithick does we are stil faster so long as we are moving what worries me is that he will go al night do you want us to try that tilak asked no preen chand said regretfully he had thought long and hard about it if we do caesar and hannibal will be worth nothing tomorrow even as is i am not sure they will be able to match todays pace and i am so afraid they will have to if trevithicks engine works as he hopes we will have to catch him from behind soon they were out among farms once more cows and sheep stared incuriously as the hairy elephants tramped past rifletoting farmers guarded their stock even so close to springfield sims were a constant nuisance they might not have the brains of humans but they were too clever to trap preen chand decided he was going to get a stiff neck if he kept turning around to look back but he could not help it he had to see the iron elephant in action here it came with its train behind it he put a spyglass to his eye for a better view he thought it even uglier moving than stationary shafts connected to its pistons drove small gears at either side of the back of the engine those in turn meshed with larger gears in front of them and the larger gears joined with the ones on the outside of the engines four wheels smoke belched from the stack as the contraption crawled along even from close to half a mile away preen chand could hear it chug and wheeze and rattle it reminded him more of a flatulent iron cockroach than an elephant when he said that out loud tilak chuckled remarking the farm animals would agree with you it seems preen chand had been too busy studying the iron elephant to pay atoention to them a quick glance showed his fellow driver to be right the livestock had reacted to their own train as they would have toward a couple of mules hauling a waggon past which is to say they did not react at all the noisy smoky stinking steam engine was something else again animals ears went up in surprise then back in alarm terrified flocks pounded across the fields farmers trying without much luck to halt them and now and then pausing to shake their fists at the iron elephant i never thought of that preen chand exclaimed how can these machines ever accomplish anything if sheep and cattle and horses will not go near them trevithick has come this far paul tilak pointed out which made preen chand give him a dirty look the sun climbed the sky one by one the townsfolk who had ridden out to watch the race began turning back for springfield it was not the sort of event to be easily watched neither contestant moved very fast and they were drawing steadily farther apart the only drama lay in who would finish first but the answer to that was stil more than a day away this time tilak was the one who looked back what he saw raised even his unsanguine spirits they have broken down he shouted preen chand slapped the spyglass to his eye sure enough the iron elephant was barely limping along less smoke poured from the stack and what there was had changed color the brakemen raised a cheer come on caesar go hannibal gal run that hunk of tin back to the blacksmiths shop where it belongs but preen chand kept watching as he had been certain richard trevithick was rot a man to yield tamely to misfortune the engine handler worked furiously on his machine once he leaped away preen chand saw one of his henchmen rush up to help him bandage his hand together they plunged back to their repairs after a while the iron elephant picked up speed again all the same caesar and hannibal gained on the steam engine with every soep they took they were pul ing magnificently now their heads down their doublecurved tusks bigger by far than those of the indian elephants preen chands grandfather had fondly remembered almost dragging the ground a small stream ran not far from the tracks they should water themselves tilak said preen chand haoedto stop for any reason but knew his friend was right he raised a signal flag to warn the brakemen to stop cal ed choro to caesar tilak echoed him the brakes squealed as they halted the two elephant drivers unharnessed their beasts and rode them over to the creek id like to see trevithick do this when his boiler runs dry preen chand said tilak nodded caesar and hannibal lowered their trunks into the water they squiroed it down their throats a good gal on and a half at a squirt tilak had been right they were thirsty they drank close to thirty gallons each before they slowed down their exertion had also made them hot detttol preen chand cal ed squirt water on your back caesar did preen chand scrambled forward onto the hairy elephants head to keep from getting soaked as the elephant drivers led their charges back to the train caesar and hannibal used their trunks to uproot a couple of bushes and stuff them into their mouths they had eaoen well before the race staroed and would be fed again come evening but they were not the sort of animals to miss any chance for a snack mallmal preen chand shouted and the train headed west once more behind them the smoke that marked the iron elephant sank lower and lower in the east finally preen chand had to use the spyglass to see it it never quite disappeared though any more than an aching tooth that has stopped hurting for the moment ceases to give little reminders of its prence the farms that ran west along the railway from spring field began to peoer out not many ran east from carthage the tracks had reached it only a few years before between l the two towns was a broad stretch where the four bands of iron ran through stillvirgin prairie a herd of bighorned buffalo grazed north of the tracks it was not one of the huge aggregations of spring or fall when migrating throngs made the ground shake and could delay a train for hours or days as they crossed the rail line preen chand knew some of his brakemen were swearing becau the buffalo were out of rifle range he did not care e l himself he did not eat beef l a pronghorn pranced daintily by a good deal closer than i l the buffalo a gun barked caesar jerked beneath preen chand he heard paul tilak cursing and pounding hanni hal back under control s a when preen chand could spare a moment he saw the pronghorn lying in the grass kicking he raised an eye brow impressed at the shooting the little antelope was at least as r away as the sima whole volley had missed on the way to springfield several men swung down from the waggons to pick up the pronghorn all but one presumably the felbw who had kil ed it had rifles at the ready the waisthigh plains grass could hide almost anything sims wolves a spear fanged cat the brakemen had to run hard to catch up to the train with their booty none of them cal ed to preen chand to slow down they knew what the odds were for that the elephant driver had his cap pulled low to shield his eyes from the westering sun when the train went by anoner creek what do you say we stop here tilak called hannibal is tired preen chand did not want to stop for anything but he could feel that caesar was not pul ing as powerfully as he had earlier in the day the hairy elephants were so large making the same mental calculations he was we stay he said at last we can catch them before noon a few miles outside carthage and if we race them now we risk running the elephants into the ground they worked hard yesoerday and they need as much rest as they can get the brakemen accepted his decision without argument as he would have taken their word over anything concerning the waggons tilak though took him aside and said quietly i hope we can catch them hannibal was flagging badly there at the end yray caesar too preen chand hated to make the admission as if saying it out loud somehow made it more real he was however far from giving up hope the steam engine has its problems too i thought it would if it were running as well as trevithick claimed it could it would have been here hours ago and if it had we could have waved goodbye to the race that is true but it passed us now not then we at least know how far we can hope to go on any given day what will that smel y piece of ironwork do to schedules it has certainly played the very devil with mine tilak yawned i am going back to bed there for once my friend i cannot argue with you preen chand said his only consolation was reflecting that trevithick probably needed sleep even more than he did afoer eating enormously at sunrise caesar and hannibal seemed eager to pull the train rattled forward at a pace betoer than preen chand had expected the iron elephants plume of smoke which had shrunk behind them the day before now grew larger and blacker and stood tal er in the sky as they gained only a couple o what do you say we stop here tilak called hannibal is tired preen chand did not want to stop for anything but he could feel that caesar was not pul ing as powerfully as he had earlier in the day the hairy elephants were so large making the same mental calculations he was we stay he said at last we can catch them before noon a few miles outside carthage and if we race them now we risk running the elephants into the

preen chand had expected the iron elephants plume of smoke which had shrunk behind them the day before now grew larger and blacker and stood tal er in the sky as they gained only a couple of hours passed until the steam engines train became visible a long black centipede stretched out along its track go ahead and run richard preen chand called though trevithick of course could not hear you cannot run fast enough the engine handler must have seen his rivals train and disliked the raoe at which it was gaining he must have tied down a safety valve for more smoke poured from the iron elephants stack all the same the fleshandblood beasts continued to gain closer and closer they came now they were only a mile behind now half a mile and there heartbreakingly they stuck caesars and hannibals morning burst of energy faded however much preen chand and paul tilak urged them on they could come no closer and as the elephant drivers watched and cursed the iron elephant began to pull away once more preen chand felt like weeping from frustration through his spyglass the men aboard the iron elephant seemed close enough to reach out and touch yet as he watched helplessly they drew ever farther from him he refused to lower the spyglass cherishing the illusion it gave of a neck andneck race and so he was watching stil when the iron elephant slid into a pit preen chand stared not believing what he saw he knew how hastily this stretch of the railbed had been laid it had only gravel underneath it not a good solid foundation of stone rammed earth all the same he had crossed the same stretch of track only a few days before and there had been no storms since to undermine it but something had paul tilak saw what it was sims he shouoed suddenly and most uncharacteristically he burst out laughing their trap caught a harderskinned elephant than they bargained for once preen chands attention was diverted from the train ahead he too saw the subhumans rushing to the attack some carried wooden spears their points firehardened others bore clubs still others held stones chipped sharp that they could throw a long way he spied the glint of a few axeheads and steel knives perhaps stolen perhaps gotten in trade tilak was right the sims would not gorge on hairy elephant as they hoped but they were not fussy about what they ate brakeman would do well enough and with everyone thrown in a heap by the iron elephants sudden and unexpeted stop only a couple of men were able to shoot at the charging hunoers after that it was a melee and the sims were stronger fiercer sometimes even better armed than their foes preen chand threw up the red flag to warn his crew then yelled choro as loud as he could the train stopped get hannibal out of his harness he told paul tilak preen chand was already unbuckling the thick leather straps that linked caesar to hannibal he stood up on his elephants back cal ed to the train crew grab your rifles and climb onto the two beasts it is a rescue now the brakemen scrambled down from their waggons and rushed forward hairy elephants were better haulers than carriers caesar and hannibal could bear only five men apiece as he had at the springfield station preen chand made caesar lift a foreleg to serve as a step you you you and you he said pointing at the first four men to reach him they swarmed onto the elephant just behind them tilak was making a similar chant hannibal trumpeted at taking on unfamiliar passengers but subsided when tilak thwacked its broad head with the elephant goad fol ow us as closely as you can preen chand told the disappointed latecomers from the back of the train then he dug in his toe behind caesars ear mallmal he shouoed forward even with the burden it was carrying the hairy elephant shot ahead as if relieved to be free of the burden of the train its gait shifted from its usual walk to a pounding rack with hind and foreleg on the same side of its body advancing together most of the brakemen had ridden elephants before but not under circumstances like these they clutched at caesars harness to keep from being pitched off in spite of everything one did fall he rol ed away clutching his ankle the hairy elephants left hind foot missed his head by inches they were a bit more than half a mile from the iron elephant three or four minuoes at the elephants best pace which they were certainly making when they had covered about half the distance preen chand told one brakeman you shoot no chance to hit at this range the fellow protested yes but we will remind the sims we are coming and you will be able to reload by the time we get there never tried reloading on top of an elephant before the brakeman said darkly but he raised the rifle to his shoulder and fired caesar trumpeted in surprise so did hannibal a moment later some of the subhumans had already started to break and run two carried a mans corpse between them while another fled with a body slung over its shoulder but others were still fighting and one stubbornly kept trying to shove a spear into the metal side of the trapped steam engine preen chand had to stop himself from giggling paul tilak had certainly been right about that against men even men carrying firearms the sims might have kept up the battler at least for a little while but the hairy elephants were the most fearsome beasts on the plains the sight of two bearing down like an angry avalanche was too much for the subhumans they took to their heels hooting in dismay the last to run off was the one that had tried to slay the iron elephant baring its teeth in a furious grimace it hurled a sharp stone at caesar before seeking to get away the rock fell far short but by then the sim was within easy rifle range preen chands bul et sent it sprawling forward on its face he felt more like a general than like an elephant driver with gestures and shouted commands he sent hannibal and the men he thought of as his foot soldiers after the retreating sims he walked caesar up to the head of the rival train the brakeman to the contrary reloading on elephant back was possible but then preen chand had more practice at it than the other man did he fired at a sim to his disgust he missed many sims were down now either dead or under cover in hollows the tal grass concealed the railroad men moved up cautiously a couple went ahead to reclaim a body the sims had dropped in their flight preen chand was dismayed to see no sign of the corpse the pair of sims had been carrying the subhumans who survived this raid curse them would not go altogether hungry the elephant driver wondered if the body was trevithicks he had yet to spot the steamengine man and he was close to the upended iron elephant after digging their pit under the rails the sims had covered it with branches and then covered them over with dirt and gravel so they looked like the rest of the roadbed preen chand shivered he might well have led caesar straight into the trap he got down from the hairy elephant walked over to the hole in the ground the rails had buckled as they tried and failed to support the iron elephant it was tilted at a steep angle almost nose down in the pit a real elephant which did not carry its weight on the rails would have taken a worse fall a dead sim lay half in half out of the pit preen chand looked down into it hel o preen very good to see you indeed richard trevithick said he held a pistol clubfashion in his bandaged left hand his right arm hung limply im afraid youll have to help me out of here i think i broke it oh and congratulations you seem to have won the race i had not even thought of that preen chand said blinking he turned to his crew get me a length of rope tie one end to caesars harness and toss the other down to me he slid into the pit in india he thought hazily remembering his grandfathers stories there would have been sharpened stakes sticking up from the bottom luckily the sims had not thought of that he got to his feet brushed off himself and trevithick you shot the sim up there the engine handler nodded yes and then spent the rest of the fight hiding under the iron elephant while another of the creatures tried to kil it he laughed ruefully not very glorious im afraid but then neither was falling out of the cab when the engine went down if i hadnt been ieaning back for another shovelful of coal i never would have got this he tried to move his arm winced and thought better of it but you would have been out in the open then and the second sim might have speared you instead of your machine preen chand poinoed out something to that i suppose a rope snaked into the hole preen chand tied it around trevithicks body under his arms is it hooked up to caesar he cal ed sure is a brakeman answered good mallmal the rope went taut preen chand helped trevithick to scramble up the sloping side of the pit while the elephant pulled him out the engine handler yelped once then set his teeth and bore the jouncing in grim silence preen chand yelled choro as soon as trevithick was out then crawled slowly after him you didnt need to get us clean the first time trevit hick remarked you are quite right my apologies i will dirty you again if you like preen chand said deadpan trevithicks expression was half grin half grimace then he looked around and dismay replaced them both down in the pit he had not been able to see the fight that had raged up and down the length of his train most of the bodies spilled on the ground most of the blood splashed on waggons and grass belonged to sims but not all oh the poor lads the engine handler exclaimed some of the survivors of his crew had joined preen chands men in pursuit of the sims which made his losses appear at first even worse than they were but trevithick pointing with his left hand counted four bodies and one of his brakemen added pat bailey and oneeye jim is dead but we cant find em nowheres filthy creatures trevithick muttered preen chand knew he was not talking about the missing men trying to give what consolation he could he said this sort of thing will not happen hereabouts much longer soon this part of the country will be too thickly settled for wild sim bands big enough to attack a train to flourish yes of course thats been happening for more than i years since settlers came to virginia and plymouth it does little good for me at the moment however and even less for oneeye jim and patrick bailey preen chand had no good answer to that he led trevithick over to paul tilak who knew enough first aid to splint a broken arm ignoring an injured mans howls tilak was washing a bleeding bite with whiskey dont be a fool he told the fellow do you want it to fester couldnt hurt moren what you just done the man said sullenly that only shows how little you know tilak snorted he moved on to a brakeman with a torn shirt and blood running down his chest you are very lucky that spear could as easily have gone in as slid along your ribs he soaked his rag at the mouth of the whiskey bottle the brakeman flinched theres one attention i wont regret being spared trevithick said waiting for tilak to get round to him i do not doubt that preen chands eyes slipped back to the iron elephant richard may i ask what you will do next the engine handler fol owed his rivals glance i expect well be able to salvage it preen with the help of your elephants the damage shouldnt be anything past repair his face lit with enthusiasm and back in boston my brother is working on another engine twice as powerful as the iron elephant if id had that one here you never could have stayed close to me in which case you and your crew probably would al be dead now preen chand said tartly but in spite of his sharp comeback he felt a hollowness inside for he saw that the future belonged to trevithick as surely as humans displaced sims steam engines were going to replace hairy elephants it was much easier to make an t engine bigger and stronger and faster than it was an elephant a way of life was ending he let out a long sigh trevithick understood him perfectly i told you once preen it wont be so bad there will always be railroads no matter what pulls the trains it will not be the same what is ever he has you there preen tilak put in maybe so maybe so preen chand said our grand fathers who sailed halfway round the world to come here would have agreed with you i am certain but do you know what hurts worst of al trevithick and tilak shook their heads when that second engine comes into springfield i am going to have to admit george soephenson is right i though the fall heavens largescale agricultural production was very important in several southeastern commonwealths indigo hemp and cotton especially the latter with its vast export market were grown on plantations that because they natural y did not have modern farm machinery required a great many laborers to raise and gather in the crops most of these field laborers were sims the number of sims in north america had increased greatly since europeans began settling in the new world simply because agriculture is so much more efficient a way of producing food than the nomadic hunting life the native subhumans had formerly practiced there was enough to feed both the swelling human population and the sims which now sometimes for many generations had been tamed to serve humans large labor forces of sims were not the only characteristic of eighteenth and early nineteenthcentury southeastern plantation agriculture because sims household staff and also on proved unsatisfactory occasion to supplement their number in the fields black human slaves were imported from africa shamefully slavery is a human institution at least as old as civilization itself it was accepted in ancient mesopotamian society by the hebrews by the greeks and even by the romans whose republic is the prototype for the federated commonwealths philosophers developed elaborate justifications for the institution most based on the assumption that one group of people general y speaking the group that owned the slaves in question was superior to another and that the latter therefore deserved their enslavement such speculation may perhaps have been excusable in the days when humans knew only of other humans differences in skin color features or type of hair must have seemed large and important in those days but when contrasted to sims it quickly becomes obvious that even the most dissimilar groups of humans are very much alike accordingly in the federated commonwealths the institution of slavery was faced with a challenge to its very raison dtre unlike any it had known in the old world from the story of the federated commonwealths jeremiah swept the feather duster over the polished top of his masters chest of drawers moving slowly in the building heat of a may morning in virginia he raised the duster to the mirror that hung above the chest he paused to look at himself he did not get to see his reflection every day he raised a hand to brush away some dust stuck in his wooly hair his eyeballs and when he smiled his white even teeth gleamed against the polished ebony of his skin you jeremiah mrs gil en cal ed from the next room what are you doing in there dusting maam he answered flailing about with the feather duster so she would see him busy if she came in to check unlike the sims that worked in the fields houseslaves rarely felt the whip but he did not intend to tempt fate all mrs gil en said though was go downstairs and fetch me up a glass of lemonade squeeze some fresh i think the pitchers empty yes maam jeremiah sighed as he went to the kitchen on a larger estate other blacks would have shared the household duties here he was cook cleaner butler and coachman by turns and busy all the time because there was so much to do he made a fresh pitcher of lemonade to his own taste drank a glass then added more sugar the gillens liked it sweeter than he did took you long enough jane gillen snapped when he got upstairs he took no notice of it that was simply her way she was in her early thirties a few years older than jeremiah her mousy prettiness beginning to yield to time oh that does a body good she said emptying the glass and giving it back to him why dont you take the rest of the pitcher out to my husband he and mr stowe are in the south field and theyll be suffering from the sun go on theyll thank you for it yes maam he said again this time with something like enthusiasm he returned to the kitchen put the pitcher and two glasses on a tray and went out to look for his master and the overseer a big male sim was chopping logs into firewood behind the house it stopped for a moment to nod to jeremiah as he went by he nodded back hello joe he said a faint edge of contempt riding his words he might be a slave but by god he was a man joe did not notice jeremiahs condescension muscles bulged under the thick coat of hair on the sims arms as it swung the axe up for another stroke the axe descended chips flew one flew right over joes head landed in the dust behind the sim jeremiah chuckled as he walked on had he been wielding the axe the chip would have caught him right in the forehead and probably made him bleed but sims had no foreheads above joes deepset eyes was only a beetling ridge of bone that retreated smoothly toward the back of his head more sims worked in the fields some sowing hemp seeds broadcast on the land devoted to the farms main cash crop others weeding among the growing green stalks of wheat they would have done a better job with lighter hoes but the native american subhumans lacked the sense to take proper care of tools of good quality mostly the sims worked in silenoe now and then one would let its long chinless jaw fall open to emit a grunt of effort and once jeremiah heard a screech as a sim hit its own foot instead of a weed but unlike humans the sims did not talk among themselves few ever mastered english and their own grunts and hoots were too restricted to make up a real language instead they used hand signs like the ones the deaf and dumb employed those came easier to them than speech jeremiah had heard mr gil en say even the wild sims that still lurked in the forests and mountains two centuries after colonists came to virginia used hand signs taught them by runaways in preference to their native cal s charles gillen and harry stowe were standing together watching the sims work gillen turned and saw jeremiah well well what have we here he said smiling he was a large man about the same age as his wife with perpetually ruddy features and a strong body beginning to go to fat lemonade sir for you and mr stowe jeremiah poured for each man handed them their glasses gillen drained his without taking it from his lips his face turned even redder than usual ahhl he said wiping his mouth now that was a kindly thought and surely its no part of your regular duties to go traipsing al over the farm looking for me he rummaged through the pockets of his blue cotton breeches heres a tensester for your trouble i thank you very much sir jeremiahs trousers did not have pockets he stowed the small silver coin in a leather pouch he wore on a thong round his neck under his shirt the hope for just such a reward was one of the things that had made him eager to go to his master besides it beat working he did not mention that the lemonade had been mrs gillens idea even if her husband found out though he would not take the tensester back he was a fairminded man harry stowe kept his glass in his left hand as he drank his right hand held his whip as it always did when he was in the field the whip was a yardlong strip of untanned cowhide an inch thick at the grip and tapering to a point stowe was a small compact man with fine features and cold blue eyes that never stopped moving he snarled an oath and stepped forward the whip cracked a sim shouted in alarm clutched at its right arm oh nonsense tom stowe snapped i didnt hurt you and well you know it but damn you have more care with what you do that was wheat you were rooting out there not a weed the sim understood english well enough even if it could not speak its hands moved sorry it signed its broad flat features were unreadable when it went back to weeding though it soon uprooted another stalk of wheat stowes hand tightened on the butt of the whip until his knuckles whitened but he did not lash out his shoulders sagged in a man that would be insolenoe he said to charles gillen but sims cannot will not attend as a man would i could wear out my arm my cowskin and my temper sir and not improve them much your being here at all keeps them working harry we shouldnt expect them to be fine farmers gillen replied when men first came to virginia they found the sims here unable to make fire with no tools but chipped stones you are an educated man to know such things the overseer said for myself all i know is that they do not work as i would wish and so waste your substance i wish you could afford to have niggers in the fields i would make fine farmers of them i wager he looked speculatively toward jeremiah the houseslave wished he could become invisible suddenly he was not glad at all he had come out to the fields he stretched out his hands to his master mr gil en you wouldnt treat me like no sim would you sir the wobble of fear in his voice was real no no jeremiah dont fret yourself gillen reassured him sending a lookatthetroubleyoucaud glance stowes way i find it hard to imagine a circumstance that would force me to use you so thank you sir thank you jeremiah knew he was laying it on thick but he took no chances not only was labor in the fields exhausting but he could imagine nothing more degrading even as a slave he had a measure of selfrespect one day he hoped to be able to buy his liberation the tenster his master had given him put his private hoard at over eighty denaires maybe he would buy land end up owning a few sims himself it was something to dream about anyway but if gil en worked him as he would a sim would he not think of him in the same way instead of as a person he might never get free then why his master had already turned his back on him and was talking politics with stowe as if he were not there so whom will you vote for in the censoral elections this fall harry i favor adams and westerbrook two men from the same party will work together instead of us having to suffer through another five years of divided government like this last term i dont know gillen said judiciously when the conscript fathers wrote the articles of independence after we broke from england in they gave us two censors to keep the power of the executive from growing too strong as it had in the person of the king to me that says they intended the two men to be of opposing view to check each others excesses to check excesses aye but im partial to a government that governs not one that spends all its time arguing with itself gillen chuckled something to that i suppose still dont you think jeremiah stopped listening what did politics matter to him as a slave he could no more vote than a sim could his head hung as he made his slow way back to the house mrs gillen saw him dawdling and scolded him she kept an eye on him the rest of the day which meant he had to work at the pace she set not his own that he thought resentful y was more trouble than a tensester was worth to make things worse he burnt the ham the gillens stowe and he were going to have for supper that earned him another scolding from his mistress and a contemptuous stare from the overseer at sunset stowe blew a long unmusical blast on a bugle the signal for the sims to come in from the fields for their evening meal their food was unexciting but filling mostly barley bread and salt pork eked out once or twice a week as tonight with vegetables from the garden plot and with molasses the sims also ate whatever small live things they could catch some owners discouraged that as a disgusting habit jeremiah certainly thought it was stepping on a wellgnawed rat tail could be counted on to make his stomach turn over most like charles gillen did not mind for it made their property cheaper to feed never catch me eating rats not if im starving jeremiah said as he blew out the candle in his smal stuffy room he listened to make sure the gillens were asleep stowe had his own cottage close by the log huts where the sims lived when he was sure all was quiet the slave lifted a loose floorboard and drew out a small flask of whiskey any sim caught with spirits was lashed till the blood ran through the matted hair on its back jeremiah ran the same risk and willingly sometimes he needed that soothing fire in his belly to sleep tonight though he drank the flask dry and tossed and turned for hours al the same spring gave way to summer the big sim joe stepped on a thorn and died three weeks later of lockjaw the loss cast a pal of gloom over charles gillen for joe was worth a hundred denaires gillens spirits lifted only when his son and daughter returned to the farm from the boarding schools they attended in portsmouth the commonwealth capital jeremiah was also glad to see them caleb was fourteen and sally eleven the slave sometimes felt he was almost as much a father to them as charles gillen himself but caleb at least came home changed this year before he had always talked of what he would do when the gil en farm was his jeremiah had spoken of buying his own freedom once a couple of years before caleb had looked so hurt at the idea of his leaving that he never brought it up again for fear of turning the boy against it for good he thought caleb had long since forgotten one day though caleb came up to him when the two of them were alone in the house he spoke with the painful seriousness adolescence brings i owe you an apology jeremiah hows that young master the slave asked in surprise you havent done nothing to me and even if you had he added silently you would not be required to apologize for it oh but i have caleb said though ive taken too long to see it do you remember when you told me once you would like to be free and go away yes young sir i do remember that jeremiah said cautiously any time the issue of liberation came up a slave walked the most perilous ground there was i was too little to understand then the boy said now i think i may because i want to go away too you do why could that be jeremiah was not pretending this declaration of calebs was almost as startling as his recalling their conversation at all to someone that young two years was like an age because i want to read the law and set up my own shingle one day the law is the most important thing in the whole world jeremiah his voice burned with conviction at fourteen one is passionately certain about everything i dont know about that young master nobody can eat law caleb looked at him in exasperation nobody could eat food either or even grow it if his neighbor could take it whenever he had a mind to what keeps him from it even if he has guns and men and sims enough to do it by force only the law something to that jeremiah admitted he agreed only partly from policy calebs idea had not occurred to him he thought of the law only as something to keep from descending on him that it might be a positive good was a new notion one easier to arrive at for a free man he thought without much bitoerness enthusiasm carried caleb along of course theres something to it people who make the law and apply the law rule the country i dont mean just the censors or the senate or the popular assembly though one day ill serve i think but judges and lawyers too that may be so young master but what will become of the farm when youve gone to portsmouth to do your lawyering or up to philadelphia for the assembly jeremiah knew vaguely where portsmouth was somewhere southeast a journey of a week or two he knew philadelphia was some long ways north but had no idea how far half as far as the moon maybe one day sally will get married caleb shrugged it will stay in the family and lawyers get rich dont forget who knows maybe one day ill buy the pickens place next door to retire on jeremiahs opinion was that old man pickens would have to be dragged kicking and screaming into his grave before he turned loose of his farm he knew however when to keep his mouth shut he also noticed that any talk about his freedom had vanished from the conversation nevertheless caleb had not forgotten one day he took jeremiah aside and asked him would you like me to teach you to read and cypher the slave thought about it he answered cautiously your father i dont know if hed like that most masters discouraged literacy among their blacks sims did not count no sim had ever learned to read in some commonwealths though not virginia teaching a black his letters was against the law ive already talked with him about it caleb said i asked him if he didnt think it would be useful to have you able to keep accounts and such he hates that kind of business himself the lad already had a good deal of politician in him jeremiah thought caleb went on once you learn maybe you can hire yourself out to other farmers and keep some of what you earn that would help you buy yourself free sooner and knowing how to read and figure can only help you afterwards youre right about that young sir id be pleased to start so long as your father wont give me no grief on account of it the hope of money first impelled jeremiah to the lessons but he quickly grew fascinated with them for their own sake he found setting down his name in shaky letters aweinspiring there it was recorded for al time it gave him a feeling of immortality almost as if he had had a child and struggling through first calebs little reader and then haltingly the bible was more of the same he wished he could spend al his time over the books he could not of course chores around the house kept him busy al through the day most of his reading time was snatched from sleep he yawned and did not complain his stock of money slowly grew five sesters here ten there once he made a whole denaire for himself when mr pickenss cook fell sick just before a family gathering and charles gillen loaned jeremiah to the neighbor for the day from anyone else he would have expected two or even three denaires from pickens he counted himself lucky to get one he did not save every sester he earned a man needs more than the distant hope of freedom to stay happy one night he made his way to a dilapidated cabin that housed a widow inclined to be complaisant toward silver no matter who brought it jeremiah was heading home feeling pleased with the entire world except for the mosquitoes when the moon light showed a figure coming down the path toward him it was harry stowe jeremiahs pleasure evaporated he was afraid of the overseer and tried to stay out of his way too late to step aside into the bushes stowe had seen him evening sir jeremiah said amiably as the overseer approached stowe set hands on hips looked jeremiah up and down evening sir he echoed voice mockingly high there was whiskey on his breath im tired of your uppity airsalways sucking up to young caleb what do you need to read for youre a stinking slave and dont you ever forget it i could never do that sir no indeed but al the same a man wants to make himself better if he can he never saw the punch that knocked him down drunk or sober stowe was fast and dangerous jeremiah lay in the dirt he did not try to fight back calebs law descended swiftly and savagely on any slave who dared strike a white man but fear of punishment was not what held him back now he knew stowe would have no trouble taking him even in a fair fight man i dont see any man there the overseer said all i sees a nigger he laughed harshly swung back his foot instead of delivering the kick though he turned away and went on toward the widows jeremiah rubbed the bruise on the side of his jaw felt around with his tongue to see if stowe had loosened any of his teeth no he decided but only by luck he stayed down until the overseer disappeared round a bend in the path then he slowly rose brushing the dust from his trousers not a man huh he muttered to himself not a man wel let that trash talk however he wants but whose sloppy seconds is he getting tonight feeling a little better he headed back to the gillen house summer wore on the wheat grew tall the stalks bent heavy with the weight of grain caleb and sal y returned to portsmouth for school the sims went into the fields to start cutting the hemp so it could dry on the ground the sickness struck them then abruptly and savagely stowe came rushing in from their huts at sunrise one morning to cry to charles gillen half the stupid creatures are down and choking and moaning gillen spil ed coffee as he sprang to his feet with an oath fear on his face he followed the overseer out jeremiah silently stepped out of the way he understood his masters alarm disease among the sims especial y now when the harvest was just under way would be a disaster from which the farm might never recover jane gil en waited anxiously for her husband to return when he did his mouth was set in a tight grim line diphtheria he said we may lose a good many he strode over to the cupboard uncorked a bottle of rum took a long pul he was not normally an intemperate man but what he had seen left him shaken as jeremiah washed and dried the breakfast dishes he felt a certain amount of relief at least as far as his own risk was concerned sims were enough like humans for illnesses to pass freely from them to the people around them but he had had diphtheria as a boy and did not have to worry about catching it again a sadly shrunken work force trooped out to cut the hemp charles served soup that being the easiest nourishment for the sick sims to get past the membranes clogging their throats then gillen hurried back out to the sim quarters to do what little doctoring he could the first deaths came that evening one was rare the powerful woodcutter who had replaced joe not all his strength sufficed against the illness that choked the life from him the tired sims returning from the fields had to labor further to dig graves i always feel so futile laying a sim to rest gillen told jane as they ate a late supper that jeremiah had made with a man theres always the hope of heaven to give consolation but no churchman ive ever heard of can say for certain whether sims have souls jeremiah doubted it he thought of sims as nothing more than animals that happened to walk on two legs and have hands that made them more useful than say horses but not much smarter he rejected any resemblance between their status and his own he at least knew he was a slave and planned to do something about it one day his hoard had reached nearly ninety denaires the next day even fewer of the sims could work charles gillen rode over to the pickens farm to see if he could borrow some but the diphtheria was there ahead of him mr pickens was down with it too and not doing well gillen bit his lip at the smal amount of hemp cut so far jeremiah had had just enough practice ciphering over the farm accounts to understand why the cash gillen raised from selling the hemp was what let him buy the goods his acres could not produoe after supper that evening gil en took jeremiah aside dont bother with breakfast tomorrow or with more soup for the sims he said jane will take care of all that for a while mrs gil en sir jeremiah stared at his master he groped for the only explanation he could think of you dont care for what ive been making you tel me what you want and il see you get it a gentleman to the core gil en replied quickly jeremiah its nothing like that i assure you youve very well then he stopped cold his cheeks reds plainly embarrassed to continue youve gone and sold me jeremiah blurted first and worst fear that came to his mind ever dreaded the announcement that would turn his life down and charles gillen was on the whole an easy master any number of tales jeremiah had heard convinced him of that i have not sold you jeremiah your place is here again gil ens reply was swift and firm again i trouble going on wel what is it then jeremiah demanded his masters hesitations set them in oddly reversed roles thef probing and seeking gil en trying to evade the jeremiah did when caught at something he knew wrong having the moral high ground was a new heady feeling he did not enjoy it long brought up short gillen i choice but to answer im sending you out to the fields tomorrow jeremiah to help cut hemp with sick misery the slave realized he would rather have been sold but thats sim work mr gillen he protested i know it is and i feel badly for it but so many sims are down with the sickness and you are strong and healthy the hemp must be cut it does not care who swings the sickle and i will not think less of you working in the fields rather the contrary because you have helped me at a time of great need when the day that you approach me to ask to buy your freedom be shall not forget had he promised jeremiah manumission as soon hempcutting was done he would have gained a worker as it was though the slave again protested dont send me out to do sim work sir why not gillens voice had acquired a dangerous jeremiah knew he was faltering and cursed it but could not do anything about it charles a decent man as decent as a slave owner could be was also a white man he knew himself the equal of farmers and townsmen his son dreamed of leading the federated commonwealths one day he was assuradly far above both blacks and sims also felt the gulf between himself and his course even gaining his freedom would not it certainly not in gil ens eyes but jeremiah nother gulf one with him at the top looking at sims below from gillens lofty perch that one was invisible but immensely important to jeremiah even a slave superior to the subhuman natives of america himself on things he could do that they would pable of learning his letters was something of reminder that even if his body was owned his mind could still roam free gillen without understanding at al what he was shoving him down with the sims as if there difference between him and them harry stowe no difference either indeed would relish getting on jeremiah he had made that quite clear its bad enough but the white men already looked at jeremiah he had some status though among the neighborhood it would disappear the instant t to the fields even the stupid sims would laugh openmouthed emptyheaded laughs at him and no better than themselves he would never be st his authority over them again passed through his mind in a matter of seconds the realization that none of it would make sense certainly not when measured against the denaires was losinsr every day it just wouldnt be right sir was the weak best jeremiah could do he knew it was not good enough even before he saw gillens face cloud with anger how would it not be right it pains me to have to remind you jeremiah but you are my slave my personal chattel how i employ you especial y in this emergency is my affair and mine alone now i tell you that you shall report to the field gang tomorrow at sunrise or your back will be striped and then you will report anyway do you fol ow me yes sir jeremiah said he did not dare look at gillen for fear his expression would earn him the whipping on the spot wel good having got his way gil en was prepared to be magnanimous he patted jeremiah on the shoulder it will be only for a few days a couple of weeks at most then everything will be back the way it was yes sir jeremiah said again but he knew better nothing would ever be the same not between him and other blacks not between him and the sims and not between him and gil en either one reason gillen was a bearable master was that he treated jeremiah like a person now the thin veil of politeness was ripped aside at need gillen could use jeremiah like any other beast of burden and at need he would it was as simple as that when jeremiah lifted the loose board in his room he found his little flask of spirits was empty i might have known he muttered under his breath its been that kind of day he blew out his candle he was already awake when stowe blasted away on the horn to summon the sims and him to labor he had been awake most of the night he was too full of mortification and swallowed rage to sleep his stomach had tied itself into a tight painful knot his eyes felt as though someone had thrown sand in them he rubbed at them as he pul ed on breeches shoes and shirt and went out to the waiting overseer stowe was doling out hardtack and bacon to the sims still well enough to work well well he said smiling broadly as jeremiah came up what a pleasure to see our new field hand and just in time for breakfast too get in line and wait your turn the overseer watched for any sign of resistance but jeremiah silently took his place the hardtack was a jawbreaker and the bacon heavily salted so it would keep almost forever brought tears to his eyes if his belly had churned before it snarled now he gulped down two dippers of water they did not help the sims big yellow teeth effortlessly disposed of the hardtack biscuits the salt in the bacon did not faze them either jeremiahs presence seemed to bother them a good deal more they kept staring at him then quickly looking away whenever his eyes met theirs the lowvoiced calls and hoots they gave each other held a questioning note those cal s though could convey only emotion not real meaning for that the sims had to use the hand signs men had given them their fingers flashed most often in the gesture equivalent to a question mark finally one worked up the nerve to approach jeremiah and sign why you here to work he said shortly he spoke instead of signing to emphasize to the sim that despite his present humiliation he was still a man harry stowe who missed very little noted the exchange grinning he sabotaged jeremiahs effort to keep his plaoe by signing he work with you he work like you he one of i you til job done no different isnt that right he added aloud for jeremiahs benefit the slave felt his face grow hot he bit his lip but did not stowes message disturbed even the sims one directed hesitant signs at the overseer he man not sim why work like sim hes a slave he does what hes told just like youd better if the master tells him to work like a sim he works like a sim and thats all there is to it enough dawdling now lets get on with it the overseer distributed seythes and sickles to his charges careful y counting them so the sims could not hold any back to use against their owners or against each other in fights over food or females jeremiah wished he had a pair of gloves his hands were too soft for the work he was about to do he knew better than to ask for any as he started down a row of hemp plants he saw the sims to either side quickly move past him it was not just that they were stronger though few men could match the subhumans for strength they were also more skil ed which was really galling bend slash stoop spread rise step bend they had a rhythm the black man lacked hurry it up jeremiah stowe said theyre getting way ahead there they know what theyre doing the slave grunted stung by the taunt turn one loose in my kitchen and see what kind of mess youd get to his surprise stowe laughed jeremiah soon grew sore stiff and winded he did not think he could have gone on without the halfgrown sim that carried a bucket of water from one worker to the next at first it would not stop for him passing him by for members of its own kind a growl from stowe though fixed that in a hurry reluctantly jeremiah came to see that the overseer did not use his charges with undue harshness to have done so would have wrung less work from them and work was what stowe was after he treated the sims and jeremiahlike so many other beasts of burden with impersonal efficiency the slave even wished for the malice stowe had shown on the path that summer night that at least would have been an acknowledgment of his humanity before long he found out what it meant to have such wishes granted spread the hemp out better once you cut it stowe snapped jeremiah jumped he had not heard the l overseer come up behind him spread it out stowe repeated it wont dry as well if you dont im doing as well as the sims are jeremiah said nodding toward the long sharp darkgreen leaves lying to his right and left stowe snorted i could wear out my whip arm and theyd still be slipshod i expect better from you and by christ ill get it his arm went back then forward fast as a striking snake the whip cracked less than a foot from jeremiahs eye he flinched he could not help it the next one youll feel the overseer promised he paused to let the message sink in then moved on to keep the sims busy jeremiah had a shirt of dark green silk he mostly wore it for show when his master was entertaining guests he had never noticed it was the exact color of hemp leaves now he did and told himself he would never put it on again the day seemed endless jeremiah did not dare look at his hands he did know that when he shifted them on the handle of the sickle he saw redbrown stains on the gray smooth wood craach god damn you jeremiah i told you what i wantedl stowe shouted the slave screamed at the hot touch of whip on his back oh stop your whining the overseer said ive not even marked you past a bruise you keep provoking me though and ill give you stripes youll wear the rest of your life several sims watched the byplay taking advantage of stowes preoccupation to rest from their labor work more work better one signed at jeremiah its wide stupid grin was infuriatingly smug go to the devil jeremiah muttered for once he hoped sims had souls so they could spend eternity roasting in hellfire he thought the day would never end but at last the sun set enough stowe shouted this time jeremiah had no trouble understanding the sims whoops he felt like adding some himself stowe collected the tools counting them as carefully as he had in the morning to make sure none was missing his chilly gaze swung toward jeremiah il see you tomorrow come sunrise now that you know what to do i wont have to go easy on you anymore the whip twitched in his hand ever so slightly no sir mr stowe you surely wont jeremiah said the overseer nodded for once satisfied jeremiah had been afraid he would have to sleep in the sim barracks but stowe did not object when he went back to his room in the big house probably hadnt thought of it the slave decided he stopped at the kitchen for leftovers from the meal jane gil en had cooked they were better than what the sims ate but not much his lip curled he had forgotten more about cooking than mrs gil en knew his hands felt as if they were on fire he could not ignore them any more there was a crock of lard in the kitchen he rubbed it into both palms the fat soothed the raw broken skin jeremiah went to his room his back twinged again when he took off his shirt stowe knew exactly what he was doing with a lash though he had not drawn blood but jeremiah remembered the overseers warning his aching muscles contracted involuntarily as if anticipating a blow that was sure to come looking back jeremiah thought that unwilled mortifying twinge was what made him do what he did next i dont care how white he is he aint gonna get the chance to whip me again he said out loud he put his shirt back on took out the pouch with his hardsaved sesters and denaires opened the door stepped into the hallway shut the door behind him he could have gone back with no one the wiser but from that moment on he was irrevocably a runaway in his own mind being one he stopped in the kitchen again to steal a carving knife he had held that blade in his hand a hundred times with the gillens or their children close by and never thought of lifting it against them no more he whispered no more and yet as he left the dark and quiet house he had trouble fighting the paralyzing tide of fear that rose inside him he had his place here his known duties and expectations his master had let him earn the money he was carrying just so he could buy his freedom one day he turned back his hand was on the doorknob when the pain that light touch brought returned him to his purpose how was it real y his place he wondered if gil en could take it from him whenever he chose the question had no answer he walked down the wooden steps and into the night eleven days later he came down the west norfolk road into portsmouth he was ragged and dirty and thin and tired only on the last day had he dared actually travel the highway before that fearing dogs and hunters on his track he had gone by winding backcountry paths and through the woods those held terrors of their own spearfangs had been hunted almost to extinction in virginia years ago almost however was the operative word jeremiah had spent an uncomfortable night in a tree because of a thunderous coughing roar that erupted from the undergrowth a few hundred yards to his left he also had an encounter with a wild sim it was hard to say which of the two got a worse fright from it in the old days jeremiah had heard sims would hunt down and eat any humans they could catch but now brought low by gunpowder and by mans greater native wit the wild sims were only skulking pests in the land they had once roamed freely and when this one saw the knife jeremiah jerked out it hooted and ran before it had a chance to hear his teeth chattering after those adventures and a couple of more like them he wished he had taken his chances on hounds and trackers with them at least he knew what to expect portsmouth was the biggest town he had ever seen ever imagined by the bay masts of merchantmen and naval vessels made a barebranched forest against the sky the gilded dome of the commonwealth capitol dominated the skyhne jeremiah did not know that was what it was he only knew it was grand and beautiful people of every sort swarmed through the streets paying no attention to one more newly arrived nonetooclean black man even the four sims bearing a rich traders sedan chair looked down their broad flat noses at him and no wonder he thought charles gillen was a long way from poor but he did not own a suit of clothes half so fine as the matched outfits of silk and satin the sims were wearing jeremiah blessed the halfthoughtout notion that had brought him to the city among these thousands how could anyone hope to find one person in particulari his confidence took a jolt though when he passed a cabin whose sign declared jason bros runaway sims and niggers catched the picture below showed a sim treed by hounds with improbably sharp teeth and red mouths jeremiah shuddered and hurried on before long his grumbling stomach forced him to face another problem on the road he had raided fruit trees and stolen a couple of chickens eking them out with fruits and berries he did not think he could get away with that kind of provisioning for long in portsmouth food was harder to get at and thieves more likely to be hunted down he could eat for a while on the money he had with him but he would have to find work if he did not want to deplete it the twenty sesters he paid for a bad breakfast only reinforced the truth of that here he would not have turned down the kind of hard manual labor that had made him run away in the first place he would have been doing it for himself of his own free will and he reasoned that employers who wanted only strong backs would ask few questions but no such hauling or digging or carrying jobs were to he had sims did them all for no more wages than their keep you must be just off the farm to think you can get that kind of work and get paid for it a straw boss said jeremiahs heart leaped into his mouth but the man went on if you have a skilled trade now like carpenter or mason i can use you how about it jeremiah had used saw and chisel and plane often enough on the gillen estate but he said sorry sir no and left in a hurry the straw bosss chance reference to real status even if nothing was behind it made him too nervous to stay he wandered aimlessly through portsmouth for a while marvelling at the number of buildings that would have dwarfed the gillen house till then the grandest he had known one imposing marble structure near the capitol had an inscription over the columned entrance way it was in large clear letters but even when he spel ed it out twice it made no sense eiat iustitia ft ruant coeli he shrugged and gave it up not far away down a winding side street stood a dilapidaoed clapboard building with a sign nailed to the front door the sign was hard to read because it needed painting but the words at least made sense alfred p douglas attorney at law jeremiah was about to pass on by when he remembered caleb gillens talk about lawyers and how important they were maybe an important man would have work for him and if the important man got too nosy well important men tended to be fat and he could probably outrun this one he walked up and knocked on the door its open someone with a deep voice called from inside he sounded important jeremiah turned the knob and walked in the man rummaging through the pile of books by his desk was fat but that ended his resemblance to anything jeremiah had imagined he was about thirty with a straggling mustache and a thick shock of greasy black hair his breeches had a hole in the knee one shoe had a hole in the sole his shirt was no cleaner than jeremiahs whatever he was digging for he must have decided he wasnt going to find it he made a disgusted face looked up at jeremiah and what can i do for you today sir jeremiah almost fled as he had from the straw boss no white man had ever cal ed him sir even in mockery this did not sound like mockery he took a chance stayed im looking for work from you sir im sorry i dont need a clerk right now douglas muttered something to himself that jeremiah did not catch i didnt mean that kind of work sir jeremiah tried to keep his mouth from fal ing open the fel ow thought he wanted to study law under him i meant cleaning cooking straightening up he looked around youll excus me for speaking so bold sir but this place could do with some straightening up douglas grunted youre right sir as i said just now that must have been the mutter what i need is someone to make sense of this mess youll not be able to do that i promise if you have no letters i can read sir some and write a bit jeremiah said and then had the wit to add as an afterthought mr douglas douglas grunted again you slave or free ice ran down jeremiahs back free he answered and got ready to bolt if douglas asked for papers to prove it all the lawyer said though was good id sooner line your pockets than your masters what do i call you jeremiah realizing a second too late that if he was free he should also have a surname he gave the first one that popped into his head jeremiah uh gillen douglas showed no sign of noticing the slip he plopped his bulk into an overstuffed armchair the springs groaned in protest all right mr gillen il try you damn me if i dont put that stack there into some kind of order and ill take you on the stack was the one the lawyer had been pawing through jeremiah knelt beside it he almost gave up at once for the books titles were ful of long incomprehensible words legal terms he supposed but before panic st in he remembered the abc caleb gillen had drilled into him and the way calebs father kept the books in his library if he arranged these alphabetically by author he could not go far wrong here you are sir he said a few minutes later he held out a handful of coins and here are the uh ninetyone sesters mixed in with the books douglas stared then burst into laughter keep them my friend keep them id say youve earned them the more so as id long since forgotten they were there it was honest of you to offer them back but then who wouldnt be honest with a prospective employer watching that last so perfectly summed jeremiahs thoughts when he found the money that he eyed douglas with fresh respect the lawyer took more care inspecting the books than he had over the coins he had to correct a mistake jeremiah had made and the blacks heart sank for fear he would be turned down but al douglas said was be more careful next time three denaires a week suit you yes sir the wage was a long way from kingly but jeremiah did not feel sure enough of himself to bargain if he bought fresh food and did his own cooking he thought he could scrape by then douglas went on you cook you say at jeremiahs nod he broke into a grin that turned his heavy features boyish for a moment then board with me why dont you ive rattled round my house since the swamp fever took my margaret two years ago the memory made him somber again help me keep the place neat and ill buy supplies for both of us you deal with them then if im not the worstcook in the commonwealth hes not been born yet do we have a contract a deal you mean yes sir jeremiah clasped douglass outstretched hand the lawyers grip was soft but strong jeremiah felt like turning handsprings with room and board taken care of three denaires wasnt bad money at all jeremiah spent the rest of the day getting things off the floor so he could sweep it clean of crumpled papers dust apple cores nutshells and other garbage douglass indifference to filth left his fastidious soul cringing he found another denaire and a half in loose change the lawyer let him keep that too though he warned bear in mind my generosity doesnt extend to gold if there is any down there the thought of coming across a gold piece made jeremiah work harder than ever only later did he think to wonder whether that was what douglas had had in mind he had gotten down to bare wood in a few places when douglas had a visitor a tall lean middleaged man who wore a stovepipe hat to make himself seem even taller ah mr hayes douglas said setting aside the document he had been studying what can i do for you this fine afternoon hayes glanced at jeremiah buy yourself a nigger doesnt seem like you alfred hes free i hired him douglas said his color rising mr hayes jeremiah gillen jeremiah this is zachary hayes hayes nodded with the minimum courtesy possible and did not offer to shake hands jeremiah went back to work he was not used to respect from whites and so did not miss it i came on a gamble hayes said turning away from jeremiah with obvious relief i daresay you own the most law books in the city and keep them in the worst order have you a copy of william watsons ten quodlibeticai questions concerning religion and state and if so can you lay your hands on it the title rings a bel having heard it how could one forget it douglas said as for where it might be though i confess i have no idea jeremiah paw through things and see what you come up with will you hayes made a sour face and folded his arms to wait plainly not expecting jeremiah to find the book that scorn spurred him more even than douglass earlier mention of gold he dove under tables climbed on a shaky chair to reach top bookease shelves on one of those its calfskin spine to the wall he found watsons tome he wordlessly handed it to hayes my thanks hayes said not to him but to douglas il have it back to you within a fortnight he spun on his heel and strode out douglas and jeremiah looked at each other they started to laugh at the same time dont mind him the lawyer said clapping jeremiah on the back he thinks niggers are stupid as sims come on lets go home the house almost made jeremiah regret his new employment douglas had spoken of needing help to keep the place neat only someone with his studied disdain for order woud have imagined there was any neatness to maintain the house bore a chilling resemblance to his office except that dirty clothes and dirtier pots were added to the mix the only thing that seemed to stand aloof from the clutter was a fine oil painting of a slim pale darkeyed woman douglas saw jeremiahs eyes go to it yes thats my margaret he said sadly as jeremiah would learn he never spoke of her without putting the possessive in front of her name the kitchen was worse than the rest of the house stale bread moldy flour greens limp at best and salt pork like the stuff charles gilkns sims aoe jeremiah shook his head he had looked for nothing better he pumped some water set a chunk of pork in it to soak out some of the salt meanwhile he got a fire going in the hearth the stew he ended up producing would have earned harsh words from his former owner but douglas demanded seconds and showered praise on him let me start with good food sir and ill really give you something worth eating jeremiah said i dont know whether i should or in six months il be too wide to go through my own front door douglas said ruefully surveying his rotund form jeremiah had to sweep off what he was coming to think of as the usual layer of junk to get at his cot it was saggy and lumpy nowhere near as comfortable as the one hed had on the gillen estate he didnt care it was his because he wanted it to be not because it had to be he slept wonderfully as the months went by he tried more than once to find a name for his relationship with alfred douglas it was something more than servant something less than friend part of the trouble was that douglas treated him unlike anyone ever had before for a long while because he had never encountered it before he had trouble recognizing the difference the lawyer used him as a man not as a slave that did not mean he did not tell jeremiah what to do he did which further obscured the change to the black man but he did not speak as to a halfwitted surly child and he did not stand over jeremiah to make sure he got things done he assumed jeremiah would and went about his own business not used to such liberty at first jeremiah took advantage of it to do as little as he could work or get out douglas had told him bluntly do you think i hired you to sit on your arse and sleep but he never complained when he caught jeremiah reading which he did more and more often in the beginning that had been purely practical on jeremiahs part so as to keep fresh what caleb gillen had taught him then the printed page proved to have a seductive power of its own which is not to say reading came easily it painfully taught jeremiah how small his vocabulary was sometimes he could figure out what a new word meant from its context most of the time he would have to ask douglas eleemosynary the lawyer raised his eyebrows its a fancy word for charitable he saw that meant a nothing to jeremiah either simplified again giving to those who lack what are you looking at anyhow jeremiah held up a law book wondering if he was in trouble douglas only said oh and returned to the brief a he was drafting when he was done he sanded the ink dry set the paper aside and pulled a slim volume from the shelf by this time things were easy to find he offered the book to jeremiah here try this you have to walk before you can run the articles of independence of the federated commonwealths and the terms of their federation jeremiah read aloud al else springs from those douglas said without them wed have only chaos or a tyrant as they do these days in england but go through them and understand them point by point and youve made a fair beginning toward becoming a iawyer jeremiah stared at him theres no nigger lawyers in portsmouth he spoke with assurance he had gotten to know the black part of town well it boasted scores of preachers a few doctors even a printer but no lawyers i know there arent douglas said perhaps there should be when jeremiah asked him what he meant he changed the subject as if afraid he had said too much the book douglas gave jeremiah perplexed and astonished him at the same time this is how the government is put together he asked the lawyer after he had struggled through the first third so it is douglas looked at him keenly as if his next question was to be some kind of test what do you think of it i think its purely crazy begging your pardon jeremiah blurted douglas said nothing waiting for him to go on he fumbled ahead trying to clarify his feelings the censors each with a veto on the other one the popular assembly chose by all the free people and the senators byi forgot how the senators happen censors and commonwealth governors become senators for life after their terms end douglas supplied jeremiah smacked his forehead with the heel of his hand thats right and the censors enforce the lawsand lead the armies but only if the senate decides to spend the money the armies need and its the popular assembly that makes the laws if the senate agrees and decides if its peace or war it in the first place if you ask me mr douglas i dont think any one of em knows for certain he can fart without checking the terms of federation first thats also why we have courts douglas smiled why do you suppose the conscript fathers arranged things this way remember after we won our freedom from england we could have done anything we wanted having had scant occasion to think about politics before jeremiah took a long time to answer when he did all he could remember was the discussion charles gil en and harry stowe had had the spring before for the sake of argufying he guessed to his surprise douglas said you know youre not far wrong they tried to strike a balance so everyone would have some power and no one group could get enough to take anybody elses freedom away the conscript fathers modeled our government on the mixed constitution the roman republic had you know who the romans were dont you jeremiah they crucified jesus a long time ago jeremiah said exhausting his knowledge of the subject so they did but they were also fine lawyers and good practical men of affairs not showy like the greeks but effective and able to rule a large state for a long time if we do half so well well have something to be proud of the discussion broke off there because zachary hayes came in to borrow a book now that jeremiah had douglass iibrary in order hayes stopped by every couple of weeks he never showed any sign of recognizing why he had more luck these days and spoke directly to jeremiah only when he could not help it this time he managed to avoid even looking at the black man instead he said to douglas if you dont mind youll see me more often alfred ive a new young man studying d under me and long since gave away my most basic texts no trouble at all zachary douglas assured him once hayes was gone douglas rolled his eyes that buzzard never gave away anything except maybe the clap i guaran a tee you he sold his old books probably for more than he paid for them too no denying hes able jeremiah did not answer he was deep in the terms of federation again once the conscript fathers had outlined the federated commonwealthss selfregulating government they went on to set further limits on what it could do reading those limits jeremiah began to have a sense of what douglas had meant by practical ruling each restriction was prefaced by a brief explanation of why it wasnt needed establishing dogmas having proven in history to engender civic strife followers of all faiths shall be forever free to fol ow their own beliefs without let or hindrance so that free men shal not live in fear of the state and its agents and form conspiracies against them no indiscriminate searches of persons or property shall be permitted to keep the state from the risk of tyranny worse than external subjugation no foreign mercenaries shal be hired but liberty shal depend on the vigilance of the free men of the nation on and on the book went checking the government for the benefit of the free man jeremiah finished it with a strange mixture of admiration and anger so much talk of freedom and not a word against slavery it was as though the conscript fathers had not noticed it existed conscious of his own daring jeremiah remarked on that to douglas the lawyer nodded slavery has been with us since greek and roman times and you can search the bible from one end to the other without finding a word against it and of course when englishmen came to america they found the sims no one would say the sims should not serve us jeremiah almost blurted but im no sim then he remembered douglas thought him free he did say sims is different than men there you are right douglas said sounding uncommanly serious the difference makes me wonder about our laws at times it truly does jeremiah hoped he would go on but when he did it was not in the vein the black had expected of course one could argue as well that the sims manifest inequality only points up subtler differences among various groups of men disgusted jeremiah found an excuse to knock off early one thing he had learned about lawyers was that they delighted in argument for its own sake without much caring about right and wrong he had thought douglas different but right now he seemed the same as the rest a gang of sims came by moving slowly under the weigh t of the heavy timbers on their shoulders he glowered at their hairy backs too many white men were like zachary j hayes lumping sims and blacks together because most blacks were slaves as it had back on charles gil ens estate that rankled he was no subhuman and if hayes doubted what blacks really were let him get a sim instead of the fancy cook he owned soon enough hed be skeletal not just lean jeremiah grinned liking the notion another party of sims emerged from a side street this group was carrying sacks of beans neither gang made any effort to get out of the others way in an instant they were hopelessly tangled traffic snarled because al the sims had their hands full they could not use their signs to straighten out the mess their native hoots and cal s were not adequate for the job indeed they made matters worse the sims glared at each other peeling back their lips to bare their big yellow teeth and grimacing horribly call the guards a nervous man shouted and several others took up the cry jeremiah ducked down an alleyway he had seen enough of sims brute strength on the farm to be sure he wanted to be far away if they started fighting the town did not erupt behind him so he guessed the overseers had managed to put things to rights a few words at the outset would have done it coming through or go ahead well wait the sims did not have the words to use poor stupid bastards jeremiah said and headed home mr douglas you have some of the strangest books in the i world and that is a fact jeremiah said douglas ran his hands through his oily hair if you keep excavating among those boxes god only knows what youll come up with what is it this time a proposed explication of the survival of certain beasts in america and their disappearance hereabouts by samuel pepys jeremiah pronounced it pepeeze peeps douglas corrected then remarked you know jeremiah you read much better now than you did when you started working for me last summer thats the first time youve slipped in a couple of weeks and no one could blame you for stumbling over that tongue twister practicejeremiah said he held up the book what is this anyhow it just might interest you come to think of it its the book that sets forth the transformational theory of life that the kinds of living things change over time thats not what the bible says i know churchmen hate pepyss theories as a lawyer though i find them attractive because he presents the evidence for them genesis is so much hearsay by comparison you never were no churchgoing man sir jeremiah said reproachfully he started to read al the same working with douglas had given him a good bit of the lawyers attitude and he respected his bosss brains if douglas thought there was something to this what had he called it transformational theory there probably was the book was almost i years old and written in the ornate style of the seventeenth century jeremiah had to ask douglas to help him with several words and complex phrases he soon saw what the lawyer meant pepys firmly based his argument on facts with no pleading to unverifiable authorities despite himself jeremiah was impressed someone squelched up the walk toward douglass door no a couple of people by the sound it was that transitional time between winter and spring the rain was still cold but jeremiah knew only relief that he did not have to shovel snow anymore douglas had heard the footsteps too he rammed quil into inkpot and started writing furiously put pepys down and get busy for a while jeremiah he said its probably jasper carruthers and his son here for that will i shouldve finished three days ago since its not done we ought at least to look busy grinning jeremiah got up and started reshelving some of the books that got pulled down every day he had his back to the door when it swung open but heard douglass relieved chuckle good to see you zachary the lawyer said saves me the embarrassment of pleading guilty to nonfeasance hayes let out a dry laugh a problem we all face from time to time alfred im glad you escaped it here do you own an english version of justinians digest im afraid the latin of my young friend here isnt up to his reading it in the original the volume happened to be in front of jeremiahs face he pul ed it from the shelf before douglas had to ask him for it turned with a smug smile to offer it to hayess student the smile congealed on his face like fat getting cold in a pan the youngster with hayes was caleb gillen the tableau held for several frozen seconds the two of them staring at each other while the lawyers not understanding what was going on stared at them both jeremiah caleb exclaimed its my fathers runaway nigger he shouted to hayes at the same moment jeremiah bolted for the door pepyss book proved his undoing it went flying out from under his foot and sent him sprawling caleb gillen landed on his back before he could shake free of the youngster hayes also grabbed him the lawyer was stronger than he looked between them he and caleb held jeremiah pinned to the floor panting his gray hair awry hayes said you told me he was a free nigger alfred he said he was i had no reason to doubt him douglas answered calmly he had made no move to rise from his desk and help seize jeremiah or indeed even to put down his quil now he went on for that matter i still have no reason to do so what i recognize him caleb gillen shouted his voice breaking from excitement and what if i didnt he and that proves it if i were a free nigger and someone said i was a slave id run too douglas said wouldnt you young sir im sorry i dont know your name wouldnt you zachary regardless of the truth or falsehood of the claim now you just wait one minute here alfred hayes snapped young master caleb gillen here told me last year of the absconding from his fathers farm of their nigger jeremiah my only regret is not associating the name with this wretch here so he could have been recaptured sooner he twisted jeremiahs arm behind his back that you failed to do so demonstrates the obvious fact that the name may be borne by more than one individual douglas said you see here sir caleb gillen said ive known that nigger as long as i can remember im not likely to make a mistake about who he is if he is free hell have papers to prove it hayes wrenched jeremiahs arm again the black gasped can you show us papers nigger you need not answer that save in a court of law douglas said sharply keeping jeremiah from surrendering on the spot he was sunk in despair tears dripping from his face to the floor once sent back to the gillen estate he would never regain the position of trust that had let him escape and probably would never be able to buy his freedom either hayess voice took on a new note of formality do you deny then alfred that this nigger is the chattel of charles gillen calebs father zachary one lads accusation is no proof as well you know douglas took the same tone jeremiah recognized it as lawyertalk a tiny spark of hope flickered by il uminating the dark misery that filled him it only made that misery worse overriding caleb gillens squawk of protest hayes said then let him be clapped in irons until such time as determination of his status may be made that will prevent any further disappearances i have a better idea douglas said he unlocked one of his desk drawerstook out a strongbox unlocked that what would you say the value of a buck nigger of his age would be is denaires a fair figure above him jeremiah felt caleb and hayes shift as they looked at each other aye fair enough hayes said at last coins clinked with the sweet music of gold after a bit douglas said then here are denaires for you to acknowledge by receipt to be forfeit to master gillens father if jeremiah should flee before judgment do you agree to this bond jeremiah will you also agree to that condition caleb the decision is yours hayes said jeremiah will you give your word the boy asked he waved aside hayess protest before it had well begun saying ive known him to be honest enough even if a runaway he slightly emphasized known and glanced toward douglas who sat impassive i wont run off from here i promise jeremiah said wearily get off him let him up caleb said he did so himself hayes followed more slowly jeremiah rose rubbing at bruises and at a knee that still throbbed from hitting the floor may i borrow your pen hayes asked douglas when he got it he wrote a few quick lines handed the paper to the other lawyer here is your receipt sir i hope it suits you be so good as to line out the word absconder and initial the change if you please it prejudges a case not yet heard hayes snorted but did as he was bid douglas dipped his head in acknowledgment after taking up the money hayes said come along master gillen if alfred wants to play this game we shal settle it in court never fear oh yes dont forget the copy of the digest your nigger was kind enough to find for you with that parting shot he and caleb swept out of the office jeremiah stared miserably at the floor douglas said i suppose its no good asking for a miracle you dont happen to be a free nigger named jeremiah who just coincidentally iooks exactly like that lads fathers nigger jeremiah no sirjeremiah muttered stil not looking up wel well have to try a different tack then douglas said he did not sound put out if anything he sounded eager more than anything else that made jeremiah lift his head you purely crazy mr douglas sir theyll have me in irons and hauled away fast as the judge can bang his gavel maybe maybe not douglas remained ponderously unruffled shit jeremiah burst out and why did you give your bond on me i couldve broke out of jail maybe gone somewheres else how can i run off now douglas chuckled caleb gil ens right you are honest enough even if a runaway if that were me in your shoes idve been out the door like a shot no matter what promises i made but i gambled you wouldnt because i think we just might get you really free yet youre crazy mr douglas jeremiah repeated a few seconds later he asked in a small voice do you really think so we just might id give anything ill pay you ive got i denaires saved up almost you can have em if im free i can make more jeremiah knew he was babbling but couldnt help it youll stay knowing that if we lose youll be reenslaved that was a poser at last jeremiah said even if i run someonell always be after me to drag me back if we win i wont have to look over my shoulder every time i sit with my back to the door thats worth something al right then ill take your money not only do i need it after going bond for you but having it in my pocket will give you an incentive to stay in town douglas looked knowingly at jeremiah the black felt his cheeks go hot maybe he really was honest once douglas had given hayes the money it had not occurred to him that he could still run away once admitted however the idea was in his head for good if things looked grim enough in court he told himself he might yet disappear for the life of him he could not see how the upcoming hearing could do anything but send him back to charles gil en after all he was an escaped slave he did not doubt his master could prove it so why was douglas willing to take the case before the judges when jeremiah got up the nerve to ask douglas did not answer right away he heaved his bulk up out of his chair walked over to pick up the volume of pepys the black had tripped on when he tried to escape he examined it careful y to make sure it had not been damaged then he came over and slapped jeremiah on the shoulder be a man he said be a man and well do all right true spring sweetened the air as jeremiah and douglas made their way to the portsmouth courthouse jeremiah pointed up at the inscription over the entrance the one that had baffled him when he arrived in the city what does that mean he asked douglas fiat iustitia et ruant caeli the lawyer seemed surprised for a moment at his ignorance then laughed well no reason to blame you for knowing even less latin than caleb gillen is there it means let there be justice though the heavens fall jeremiah admired the sentiment without much expecting to find it practiced if there were justice he would not be a slave but he had a fatalistic certainty he soon was going to be one again douglass optimism did little to lighten his gloom douglas was always an optimist why not jeremiah thought bitterly he was free a sim with a broom scurried out of the way to let jeremiah pass his spirits lifted a little even as a slave he had known there was more to him than to any of the subhumans his shoulders straightened he needed that small encouragement for he felt how hostile the atmosphere was as soon as he fol owed douglas into the courtroom hayes had made sure the case was tried in the newspapers constantly during the month since it began prosperouslooking white men filled most of the seats slave owners themselves jeremiah guessed from the way they glared at him free blacks had only a few chairs more stood behind the last row of seats hayes charles and caleb gillen and harry stowe were already in their places in front of the judges tribunal jeremiah tried to read the elder gillens face the man who had owned him for so long sent him a civil nod he thought about pretending he did not recognize him decided it would do no good and nodded back hayes who missed very little noticed he smiled a cold smile jeremiah grimaced rise for the honorable judges the bailiff intoned as the threeman panel filed in from their chambers in the black robes and powdered wigs the judges al seemed to jeremiah to be cut from the same bolt of cloth to douglas who had argued cases in front of them for years they were individuals as the judges and the rest of the people in the courtroom sat he whispered to jeremiah hardesty there on the left has an open mind im glad to see him especially with scott as the other junior judge as for kemble in the middle only he knows what hell do on any given day he has a habit of changing his mind from case to case thats not good in a judge but it cant be helped a second look was plenty to warn jeremiah to beware of judge scott the man had a long narrow unsmiling face a nose sharp and thin as a sword blade and eyes like black ice even when young he would not have changed his mind often and he had not been young for many years hardestys features were nondescript but rather thoughtful high judge kemble looked like a fox he had a sly mouth a sharp nose and wide blue eyes too innocent to be altogether convincing jeremiah would have bet he was rich what case bailiff he asked in a mel ifluous tenor the bailiff shuffled papers though both he and the judges knew perfectly well what case it was he read an action brought by charles gil en a citizen of the commonwealth of virginia to regain the services of his absconded black slave jeremiah the said jeremiah stating himself to be a freeman and so not liable to provide said services kemble nodded hardesty scribbled something scott looked bored the high judge glanced toward hayes the plaintiff may present his opening remarks the lawyer rose bowed to kemble and to each of the junior judges in turn may it please the honorable judges we propose to prove that the nigger seated at the defendants bench is and has been the slave of our client charles gillen that he did willfully run away from the estate of charles gillen and that he has received no manumission or other liberation to entitle him in law to so depart what evidence will you produce to demonstrate this claim sir kemble intoned i have beside me here the owner of i protest the word your excel encies douglas broke in for al that he borrows books from me mr hayes is surely too learned to assume what he wishes to prove the claimed owner hayes amended before the judges could comment the claimed owner of this claimed slave douglas winced at the sarcasm and his son and his overseer al of whom can identify the individual in question i shal also produce a bill of sale demonstrating the chattel status of that individual he sat down looking as smug as a scrawny man can judge kemble glanced toward douglas and how does the defendant plan to refute the evidence that counsel for the plaintiff shal put forward the lawyer waited for jeremiahs hesitant nod before he spoke the magnitude of what they were about to undertake still terrified the black though they had hashed it out togethsr and agreed it was the best chance to squeeze justice from the court as douglas had said if you hit something hit it hard for all his brave front douglas must have felt a trifle daunted tbo his voice was uncharacteristically nervous as he replied may it please the honorable judges we do not seek to refute the plaintiffs evidence indeed we stipulate it as part of the record all three judges had to work together to quiet the courtroom cries of sellout from the few black spectatars rose above the buzz of the rest of the audience the judges stared at douglas as they wielded their gavels hardesty in surprise kemble in frank speculation and scott resentfully as if the lawyer had awakened him for no good reason zachary hayes also spent a few seconds gaping at his col eague he recovered quickly though exclaiming if our evidence be admitted then the case is proven for us may i ask your excellencies to order the nigger bound over for return to his rightful owner bailiff judge scott began kemble overrode him a moment please surely mr douglas you could have chosen an easier way to surrender why this one surrender your excellency who spoke of surrender douglass voice was at its blandest now and hayess face suddenly clouded with suspicion douglas went on to stipulate that jeremiah was held in involuntary servitude does our case no harm as our contention is and shall be that such servitude is not only involuntary but contrary to law on what ground your excellencies hayes waved the documents he had intended to introduce these are all executed according to proper form douglas leaned down to whisper to jeremiah here we go no turning back now the lawyer took a deep breath faced the judges and said slowly on the grounds that for any man to hold another man in slavery clearly contravenes the articles of federation and must therefore have no standing in law anywhere in the federated colonies the court was silent for a few seconds while judges opponents and audience worked through the legal language to the implications behind it hayes furiously shouted your excellencies i protest at the same time as a black man raised a whoop and a white growled you hush your mouth there or il hush it for yout getting quiet back took longer this time and the bailiff and court scribe had to eject a couple of particularly obstreperous people finally with some sort of order restored judge scott brought down his gavel and said to me the plaintiffs protest has merit despite the defenses attempts at obfuscation this small openandshut case is not one from which to adduce large legal principles is it not judge hardesty spoke for the first time the principle would appear germane to the issue at hand as judge scott has seen your excellency hayes continued his protest to kemble this is but a desperate effort on the part of the defense to shift the case away from the area where they are weakest the truth its merits are clear as they stand no need to go beyond them on the contrary douglas said the claim i make is of paramount importance here if one man may in law own another when does application of that right end what would the feelings of the plaintiff and his comrades be were they at this side of the court hearing my client lay claim to their services any nigger wants me to slave for himd have to kill me first harry stowe snarled judge kembles gavel crashed down loud as a pistol shot sir that will be the last such outburst from you you look to have seen the inside of a courthouse once or twice enough to have learned the rules of behavior here the chief judge glowered at stowe until the overseer dropped his eyes and mumbled agreement kemble nodded very well then well overlook it this time as for the motion of the defense however we rule it is relevant to this case and will hear arguments based thereon he used the gavel again as hayes rose he seemed to be fighting to hold his temper his voice came out steady as he asked for a twoday extension to study the new situation kemble granted it and adjourned the court back in douglass office jeremiah was jubilant that stowe hurt mr gillen moren we did he grinned without him opening his fool mouth that way the judge wouldnt have got mad and gone along with your motion associating with me has made you cynical douglas said drawing the cork from a bottle of whiskey and taking a long swig ahhl better actual y i think youre wrong there ruling against us kemble probably would have lost on appeal and hes too clever to leave himself open for anything like that hel let us hang ourselves instead of doing the work for us that assessment shattered the blacks cheery mood we aint won yet then a skirmish douglas shrugged you arent back in the fields are you but no we havent won the real fight is just starting when jeremiahs case reconvened the courtroom was even more packed than it had been before at the bailiffs command the people who had managed to gain seats rose to honor the judges those at the back blacks again mostly had been standing for some time already and would keep on until court adjourned judge kemble rapped for order slowly silence descended kemble nodded to zachary hayes you may begin sir thank you your excellency hayes said rising i regret the necessity of belaboring the obvious i still it may not be amiss to remind some of the citizens of the federated commonwealths of the principles upon which it was built he sent a sour glance toward alfred douglas before continuing i shall not even attempt to cite the precedents sanctioning slavery suffice it to say they are both numerous and ancient dating back on the one hand to the old testament the foundation of our faith and on the other hand to the history and institutions of the wise and noble greeks and romans upon whose usages we have modeled our own listening jeremiah fdt his heart sink hayes sounded too knowledgeable too selfassured the blacks nails bit into his palms he should have run while he had the chance all douglas wanted to do was show off how bril iant he was why not if he lost the case it would not hurt him any he would not be the one hauled away in chains douglas might have been reading his thoughts he leaned over and whispered dont give up just yet hes not saying anything i didnt expect him to al right but jeremiah remained unconvinced hayes was saying at first glance it might seem strange that the federated commonwealths whose pride is in upholding the freedom of their citizens should also countenance slavery yet when properly examined no inconsistency appears more than two thousand years ago aristotle demonstrated in the politics that some men are indeed slaves by nature and that it is only proper for them to serve so that by enjoying the fruit of their labors the rest may be truly free how may we judge those who are slaves by nature whenever two groups of men differ widely so that the inferior group can do no more than use their bodies at the direction of their superiors that group is and ought to be slaves by nature they reason only enough to understand what they are told not to think new thoughts for themselves finally for us a kindly providence has distinguished this class of individuals by their dusky skins and other features different from our own to make display of their servile status this being the case i trust your excel encies shal soon bring an end to the farce we have seen played out here and that you shall return this nigger jeremiah to the station god has intended for him conscious of a job well done hayes sat mr douglas you may reply judge kemble said thank you your excellency douglas said slowly getting to his feet although i naturally hesitate to do so when my learned opponent as he has demonstrated is on such intimate terms with the almighty judge scotts gavel crashed to stifle the small swell of laughter in the court hayes gave douglas a distasteful look the younger lawyer brushed a lock of his thick dark hair back from his forehead he went on i should also like to congratulate mr hayes for the scholarship and energy he has expended to justify the ownership of one man by another i only find it a pity that he has wasted so much ingenuity over an entirely irrelevant result the mountains labor and bring forth a ridiculous mouse this time all three judges used their gavels though jeremiah saw judge hardestys mouth twitch hayes sprang out of his chair as if he had sat on a pin see here your excellencies he cried if this mountebank has a case to make let him make it instead of mocking mine the entire proceeding of the defense has skated on thin ice judge scott observed your excellency i hope to demonstrate otherwise douglas said hastily not all the sweat that beaded on his face came from portsmouths humid heat if the court will indulge me i believe i can do so by summoning two individuals to the witnessbox one is currently in the courtroom the other whom i should like to cal first is just outside the judges conferred briefly among themselves bunch of damned nonsense jeremiah heard judge scott say he saw the jurists powdered wig flap indignantly but after a few minutes judge kemble said you may proceed i thank you your excellency douglas said i should like the bailiff to fetch in a certain rob whom he will find i expect sitting against the wall opposite this courtroom bearing a martyred expression the things halfsmart lawyers put him through the bailiff went out into the hallway jeremiah heard him cal rob he returned a moment later his face now frozen accompanying him was a male sim the hair on its head and back and chest grizzled with age mr douglas i do not know what you are playing at but i assure you i am no longer amused judge kemble snapped you know perfectly well that no testimony by a sim is valid in a court of law they being incompetent to understand or take oath yes your excellency i am aware of that douglas answered it was for that very reason that i summoned rob who belongs to a friend of mine before you the presence of sims on these shores you see has a vital impact on the question of slavery why are you planning to liberate them next judge scott asked such sarcasm from the bench was dangerous no your excellency douglas replied at once i believe it just that they serve mankind but their just service points out the injustice of forcing men to similar servitude i fail to see how scott grumbled then let him show us if he can judge hardesty suggested softly his partners face did not clear but scott kept to himself the protest he still plainly felt after glancing at judge kemble hardesty said to douglas you may proceed thank you your excellency douglas pointed toward rob who sat calmly in the witnessbox looking rather bored and working its massive jaws to help pass the time here we have a being gifted with intelligence not much someone called from the audience which raised a laugh and made the judges pound loudly for order a judge spent the next several minutes looking down at the table in front of him until he trusted his control over his features once more douglas he knew had paid the fel ow three denaires for that interruption the lawyers face revealed nothing of his machinations gifted with intelligence he repeated though of a lesser sort than our own its existence is not to be denied in the wild sims craft crude tools of stone and attempt to imatate ours in a fashion no brute beast could match but as most of you know they have no language of their own and most fail to master the english tongue can you speak rob douglas asked turning to the sim its previously placid face grew tense as it struggled against its own slow wits and balky muscles yyyyess it got out at last and sat back proud and relieved speak bad it added with signs so you do douglas acknowledged he concentrated on the judges again had i bid the sim read to us from the amplest childrens primer of course it would have been helpless as it would have been to write its name no man has yet succeeded in teaching sims their letters and no man yet has taught a turtle to waltz zachary hayes broke in what of it the issue here is niggers not sims perhaps my distinguished opponent needs reminding of it yes mr douglas we have been patient for some time aw judge kemble said we shall not be pleased if this course of yours leads nowhere it leads to the very heart of the issue your excellency douglas assured him for consider in the slavery of ancients what was their chiefest concern why just as the learned mr hayes has demonstrated to define who might rightfully be a slave and who was properly free the great aristotle developed the concept my opponent discussed so well that of the slave by nature here in the person of rob and in his kind we see exactly what the greek sage intended a being with a body strong enough for the tasks we set yet without wit enough to set against our will aristotle admitted that in his day the most difficult thing to determine was the quality of mind that defined the natural slave and no wonder for he was trying to distinguish among groups of men and al men far more resemble each other than they differ from sims in these modern times we have a true standard of comparison mr hayes put forth the proposition that the physical appearance of niggers brands them as slaves that is the same as saying painted plaster will satisfy the stomach because it looks so good in this court should we not examine essence rather than exterior to do so i should like to summon my client jeremiah to the witnessbox while douglas was signing to rob that it could go hayes sprang up exclaiming i protest this this charades on what grounds sir judge kemble said on the grounds that it is obviously a trick rehearsed s well in advance intended to make this nigger out to be aristotle charlemagne and the twelve apostles al rolled into one aye theres a stink of collusion in the air judge scott rumbled how say you mr douglas kemble asked douglass smile was beatific the smile of a man whose enemy has delivered himself into his hands your excellency i say that even if i were to admit that charge and i do not i deny it it would only help my own case how could i conspire with jeremiah unless he had the brains to plot along with me hayes opened his mouth closed it again his eyes were wide and staring judge hardesty let out a most unjudicial snort then tried to pretend he hadnt judge scott looked grim which meant his expression changed not at all stifled whoops and cheers came from the blacks at the back of the courtroom judge kemble gaveled them down you may proceed sir was all he said to douglas the lawyer dipped his head waved jeremiah forward to take the oath as jeremiah raised his hand he thought douglas might remind the judges that he unlike a sim was able to do so but douglas knew when to be subtle the fact itself spoke louder than anything he could say about it facing the courtroom was harder than jeremiah had expected except for those of the few blacks he was hard pressed to find a friendly face the whites in the audience regarded him with looks ranging from stony disapproval to out and out hatred harry stowe was part of the latter group next to him sat the two people jeremiah knew best here charles and caleb gillen the habits of years died hard it hurt jeremiah to see the contempt on the face of the man ho had owned him and to see his masters son scowling at him as at iscariot he started to smile then let his face freeze they would reenslave him without a qualm if the judges said they could that made them no friends of his douglas produced a small thick book and presented it to eli zachary hayes would you care to open the bible at random sir so jeremiah may read the passage you select the older lawyer drew back from the book as if it had come from the devil youll not make me part of your trickery sin like as not youve had him memorize scriptiture for the sake of looking good here again you prove what youd sooner oppose douglas said if jeremiah were stupid as a sim he wouldnt be able to memorize the good book youll make a man of him in spite of yourself he turned to the bench would one of you care to make the selection your excellencies i dont want any possibility is of deceit in this for such as mr hayes to tax me with to jeremiahs surprise judge scott took the bible from tin douglas the lawyers face fell when he saw that scott did not open the book just anywhere as he had suggested but began hunting for a specific passage here the judge said let him read this he stabbed at the section he wanted with his thumb adding for the record this is the seventh chapter of first chronicles jeremiah certainly had not memorized it he had no idea what was in the passage but when douglas handed him the bible he understood why the lawyer had gone expressionless the chapter was one of those col ections of begats that crop up every now and then and ful of names more obscure than most having no choice he gulped and plunged in and of the sons of issachar tola and puah jashub and shimron four and the sons of tola uzzi and rephaiah and jeriel and jahmai and ibsam and shemuel he read slowly and carefully often pausing to sound out an unfamiliar name he knew he sometimes stumbled and hated himself for it but judge scott had set too wicked a trap for him to escape unscathed he fought his way through the sons of bilhan jeush benjamin ehud chenanah zethan tarshish and ahishahar the sons of shemida ahian shechem likhi and aniam and the sons of asher imnah ishvah ishvi and beriah to say nothing of their sister serah he almost broke down on pasach bimhal and asvath the sons of japhlet but his voice rose in triumph as he came at last to the sons of ul a arab and hanniel and rizia al these he finished were the children of asher heads of the fathers houses choice and mighty men of valour chiefs of princes and the number of them reckoned by genealogy for service in war was twenty and six thousand men he closed the bible the courtroom was very quiet douglas walked up and took the book from him judge scott looked down at his hands up to the plaster of the ceiling anywhere but at jeremiah i think you can go back to our table now jeremiah douglas murmured jeremiahs feet hardly seemed to touch the ground as he returned to his place he heard caleb gil en whisper to his father im so sorry sir its my fault he can read at al i went and put ideas in his head and see the thanks we get there was enough truth in that to sting a little yes caleb had taught jeremiah to read but he was forgetting the way that was so easy for someone used to thinking of people as belongings that jeremiah had wanted to be free long before he could pick out the word liberty on the printed page caleb had been willing enough to help last wmmer when jeremiahs goal seemed indefinitely far away now that it was here caleb was finding he did not like it so well mr hayes judge kemble said and then again more crisply mr hayes jeremiah had thought hayes would have to give in despite having worked so long for douglas he was still naive about lawyers hayes slowly rose long and angular he made a production out of stretching begging your excellencys pardon he said perfectly leifpossessed i was woolgathering there in considering this case you must remember that it bears on not a single individual but by the census of close to a mil ion persons of african descent what of their masters property lights further assuming that by some mischance they could become free how are they to provide for themselves and how will they take their place in a society of free men freedom bestowed as a gift will mean nothing to them as they will have done nothing to earn it judge hardesty nodded thoughtfully that frightened jeremiah who had come to think of the quiet judg as on his side what are we going to do he asked douglas might as well not have heard him he waited till he was sure hayes had finished then heaved his bulk up when a man shifts his argument from principle to expediency he remarked trust neither my learned oponent is looking to sow panic where none need exist he speaks as if we were on the point of civil war why do we have courts if not to treat our abuses before we need the medicine solders give very pretty hayes said you answer none of the points i raised but very pretty nonetheless had you not interrupted me i would have answered d douglas replied sweetly i dont presume to make the law but i can offer some suggestions you quoted the ancients when it suited your purpose they had their ways of dealing with freed men and of easing them into the life of the state perhaps some of the first generation would remain as clients to their onetime masters working for a wage for some length of time before severing all obligations given a few years and good will the thing can be done painlessly hearing douglas propose curtailing his freedom made jeremiah scowl he hated the thought of going back to work for the gillens even as a free man but a moments reflection reminded him that before he had been willing enough to stay on as a slave so long as he was treated well and had some hope of buying his liberty one day he had run away from maltreatment not slavery and he realized other blacks would not face the problem of exowners with grudges as deepseated as the gil ens against him or would they zachary hayes might have picked the thought from his brain painlessly eh he sneered turning douglass word against him you can make all the laws you like sir but how do you propose making the good white men who built the federated commonwealths accept their niggers as their equals there was the heart of things dragged out naked and bleeding before douglas could get up to respond jeremiah found himself on his feet your excellencies can i say something judge kemble glanced toward douglas who looked startled but shrugged is it germane the judge asked sternly sir does it apply has it a bearing on the case here oh yes sir that it does indeed it does very well be brief thank you sir jeremiah took a deep breath seems to me sir a lot of white folks needs to look down at niggers on account of they need to feel theyre bettern somebody even if you did free every nigger tomorrow made em just the same as whites to the law those whites would stil now they were higher in the scheme of things than sims your excellencies one of the things helped me get by so long as a slave was knowing the sims were there below me truth to tell he went on drawing on his thoughts of a few minutes before i didnt leave the gillen farm til they stopped treating me like i was a man and worked me like a sim in the fields thats purely not right sirs making a man into a sim and if slavery lets one man do that to an other why its not right either thats all he sat as abruptly as he had risen douglas leaned over find patted him on the back murmuring out to steal my bib you just might do it huh jeremiah said but the praise warmed him the arguments went on hayes was not one to leave a ase so long as he had breath to talk but he and douglas here hammering away at smaller points now thrashing around the edges of things douglas got in only one shot he thought telling a reminder of the historic nature of the case thats for kembles sake he told jeremiah during a recess letting him think people will remember his name forever for the sake of what he does here cant hurt jeremiah thought about that and contrasted it to caleb gillens picture of the law as a vast impersonal force poised over the heads of miscreants he preferred douglass way of hoking at things people were easier to deal with than vast impersonal forces gillen walked down granby pike toward the benjamin and levi bank of portsmouth money jingled in his pocket even if the conscript fathers of virginia decided to set up a clientage system like the one alfred douglas had outlined the year before by now he had enough money to buy himself out of any further service to the family that had once owned him hayes was still appealing his case of course sending up writ after writ based on judge scotts narrow interpretation of the law but judge hardesty had been as narrowly for jeremiah as scott was against him and judge kembles ringing condemnation of human slavery would be hard to overturn douglas had been dead right about him jeremiah thought he must have decided the eyes of history were on him a sim struggling along with a very fat knapsack bumped into jeremiah watch where youre going you brainless flathead he snapped the sim cringed it managed to get one hand free of its burden for a moment to sign sorry then it staggered on jeremiah felt briefly ashamed after all were it not for sims blacks would have been at the bottom of things the target of everyones spleen he almost went after the subhuman to apologize but the sim would never have understood and that was exactly the point he kept on toward the bank trapping run the range where bands of wild sims could continue to live their lives much as they had before europeans came to north america continued to shrink as human settlements pushed westward few bands remained entirely untouched by human influence signtalk for example spread from band to band even in areas where no people had ever been seen because it was a conspicuously better means of communication than the subhumans native assortment of noises and gestures some trappers and explorers were friendly with the wild sims through whose lands they passed others manifestly were not bands of sims naturally often responded in kind being welldisposed toward humans if the first person they met had been friendly to them and hostile even to those who would not have harmed them if their first experience with humans had been a bad one in this as in so much else sims revealed how closely they resembled people in colonial days and in the early years of the federatdedf cminore than their shave t attitude not wdthmuphasize the elstsedn however in the in tjthewas a trapper who began what ca the sims i from the story of the fedetat forest wed into the l i w ii k mt tr head surprised he hladd ptoakleked even to himself and when dont understand english will grasp hit the six had law i by f s chopped it down with a few hard swings then it checked if the edge of the hatchet head with its thumb it hooted again still sharp no chips it signed good in spite of its metal knife it was still used to the chipped stones sims made for themselves good henry quick agreed he had paid fifty sesters for the hatchet back in cairo the marten fur would be worth easily twenty times as much some people in the cities of the federated commonwealths called that robbery quick did not see it that way back on the other side of the mountains hatchets were easy to come by marten furs much less so the situation was reversed here accounts l balanced too back in the cities of the commonwealths quick would have had to put up with the stink of coal smoke railroad noise and the endless presence of people he had little use for pointless chatter maybe that was one reason he got on well with sims they lacked the brains to talk when they did not have something to say some trappers quick knew treated sims like wolves or foxes or any other vermin and hunted them savagely sims robbed traps no doubt of that they were hungry al the time and meat already caught was easy meat quick was sure the sim in the clearing with him had eaten the martens carcass as soon as the pelt was off it in a way quick fol owed the reasoning of the trappers who went after sims because of their hands and wits sims made devilish thieves but those same hands and wits made them dangerous enemies by the nature of things trappers traveled alone or in small groups the ones who came down hardest on sims often never returned quick had always felt that making them into al ies worked better his initial expense was greater because of the trade goods he bought before every journey but he thought he got more furs by enlisting the sims aid than by harassing them he found a trap robbed every now and again yes but more often were cases like this one sims doing his hunting for him the subhuman flourished the hatchet again making the flair sigh good it signed and left the clearing with no more farewell than that henry quick was not offended he had scant use for ceremony himself he stretched the skin fur side in on a piece of wood and set it aside to dry he did not have many marten pelts back at his base camp which made him doubly glad for this one he also thought he would have to be a lot hungrier than he was to want to eat marten meat he walked the trap line to check the snares he had set within a couple of miles of the clearing blazes he had cut on trees at eye level guided him from one trap to the next as far as he knew sims had not figured out what blazes were for he had several sets of traps within the territory this band wandered each grouped around a clearing he tried to make a complete circuit every couple of weeks or so to make sure none of the beasts he caught decomposed enough to harm their pelts his nose guided him to the first trap he shook his head in annoyance the trap must have taken a victim almost as soon as he reset it the last time through he was doubly annoyed when he found the metal jaws holding only a striped ground squirrel whose skin would have been worthless even if fresh doubly disgusted he threw the little corpse away set the trap again stuck on a fresh suet bait and went on to the next one something probably a bird but maybe a sim had stolen the bait from that trap without springing it quick sighed and replaced it the bait on the trap after that was stil intact quick sighed again hed have to think about moving it when he neared the next trap he heard a wild desperate thrashing he drew his pistol and sidled forward soft leather boots sliding soundlessly over dirt and grass leaves and twigs catching a sim in the act of robbing a trap would be tricky finding one caught in a trap might be worse for that could turn the whole band against him his breath hissed out in relief as he saw that the trap held fox the animal must have been fighting the spiked iron teeth for some time it was nearly exhausted and lay if panting as quick approached his mouth tightened this was the part of his job he tried not to think about taking a dead animal from a trap was much easier than dealing with a live one there no help for it he thought on his belt by his pistol he carried a stout bludgeon for times such as this he set the gun down drew it out the foxs yellow eyes stared unblinkingly at him next to the torment of its trapped and broken leg he was as nothing he brought down the bludgeon once twice the fox writhed and twitched for a few minutes then sighed almost in relief and lay still he sat not far from the body waiting for it to cool and the fleas and other pests to leave it then he pried apart the jaws of the trap rol ed the fox onto its back and began to skin it he always took pains at that and took extra ones today with the memory of the marten fur still fresh he did not want any sims work to outdo his so intent was he that he had almost finished before he realized he was not alone a sim stood a few paces away intently watching him it was a female he saw with some surprise unlike the males they did not usually stray far from the clearing where a band was staying he kept away from that clearing of al his traps this one was probably closest to it but it was still a good mile away female sims henry quick thought were not so brutallooking as males their features were not as heavy and the bony ridges above their eyes were less pronounced that did not mean the sim would have made an attractive woman it lacked both forehead and chin and short reddish hair covered more of its face than quicks brown beard concealed of his own like all sims it wore no clothes but like all sims it was hairy enough not to need them even its breasts were covered with hair though the pinkishbrown nipples at their tips were exposed it had an unwashed reek like that of the one that had traded quick the marten pelt take shin it signed that at any rate was what quick thought it meant he had trouble being sure it could not use its fingers well because its hands were ful of roots and grubs and its gestures were blurry in any case yes he answered he must have understood correctly for its next question t was why club not noisestick it pointed at his pistol not want hole in stil he signed it rubbed its long jaw as it considered that then grunted exactly like a person who got an unexpected answer that was still satisfying as if putting a hand to its face had reminded it of the food it carried it popped a grub into its mouth chewed noisily and swallowed like most wild sims it was on the lean side quick glanced down at the fox carcass to him it was so much carrion not to sims want meat he asked me it pointed to itself brown eyes wide with surprise male sims hunted females gathered probably quick thought this one had never taken anything bigger than a mouse or ground squirrel but it did not need much time to decide want meat it signed firmly leaving off the gesture that turned the phrase into a question quick handed the foxs body to the sim it gave a low hoot as it stared at the unaccustomed burden it held it turned to leave then looked back at the trapper as if it expected him to take back the bounty he had given keep go he signed it hooted again and slipped away henry quick went in a different direction off to check his next trap as he walked he chuckled quietly to himself there would likely be consternation among the sims toinight especially if the males had had a luckless day at the chase the trapper paused for a moment frowning he did not want his gift to land the female sim in trouble among humans that might happen if a woman stepped into mens territory with sims on reflection he did not think it would being less clever than humans sims lacked much of their capacity for jealousy their harsh lives also made them relentless pragmatists meat would be meat no matter where it came from quick found a rabbit in his last trap it was freshly dead he skinned it cleaned it and brought it back to the clearing his pack of trade goods was undisturbed had he been one of the trappers who habitual y maltreated sims he would not have dared leave it behind but then had he been one of that sort he would not have dared travel alone in this land where men had not yet settled he started his fire again spitted the rabbit on a stick and held it over the little blaze the savory smell the lean meat gave off made his nostrils twitch and his mouth grow suddenly wet he smiled wondering what roast fox smelled like when he woke the next morning he rol ed up his blanket and went over to wash in a creek that ran near the clearing the water was bitterly cold he shivered all the way back to his campfire and stood grateful y in front of it until he was dry no wonder sims did not bathe he thought as he dressed and this was still august with the days hot and muggy in another month though snow could start falling among the peaks of the rockies the ultimate source of his little stream he would have to think about heading back to inhabited country soon unless he wanted to spend a long cold winter living with the sims not bloody likely he said out loud no trapper had a lot of use for his fellow humans but quick ached to spend a couple of days with good bouncy company in a bordello he was bored with his hand his next set of traps surrounded a clearing a few miles northwest of this one the way was blazed and to guide him if he got lost he had a sketch map and a list of landmarks he had made when he first scouted this territory except for the ones he had given them none of the places hereabouts had names no other man so far as he knew g had seen them the behavior of the local sims certainly argued for that they had neither fled from him on his first appearance nor attacked him on sight having no hostile memories to overcome made establishing himself much easier than it would have been otherwise as if thinking of the sims had conjured them up quick heard a crashing in the undergrowth off to one side of him find the hoarse excited cries of several males they must leave been chasing something big most likely a deer they ae tireless trackers and more skil ed even than an out orsman like henry quick they had no guns with which il at a distance but had to rely on thrown stones and fars either tipped with firehardened wood or made from a knife gained in trade lashed to the end of a sapling the sims voices rose in a chorus of triumph they could eat well tonight and for the next couple of days buicks stomach rumbled he was not so sure of a good meal himself when he got to the clearing that formed the center for his next set of traps he set down his pack and went out to do some hunting of his own he came back near sunset seething with frustration beneath the calm shell he cultivated the sims had had more luck than he he was carrying a squirrel by the tail bet there wasnt much meat on a squirrel he made a fire coated the squirrel with wet clay and set it among the flames to bake when he thought it was done he nudged it out of the fire with a stick and began breaking the nowhard clay with the hilt of his dagger the squirrels fur and skin came away with the clay leaving behind sweet tender meat ready to eat quick unfortunately also remained quite ready to eat more and the squirrel was gone along with his trade goods he had about ten pounds of dried smoked buffalo meat in his pack he worried every time he decided to gnaw on a strip he might need it later he was only a little hungry flow he told himself severely he turned his back on the pack avoiding temptation a noise in the darkness beyond the edge of the clearing had ice darting up his back and made him forget his bel y he grabbed for his rifle peering out to see what sort of t beast was prowling round his camp light came back red from wolves eyes green from those of a spearfang even with the gun in his hand he shivered at the thought of confronting one of the great cats at night try as he would he saw nothing a moment later he l realized why a male sim stepped into the flickering circle of light his campfire threw like the eyes of humans sims eyes did not reflect the light that reached them the male came toward him slowly deliberately he saw it t was the one that had brought him the marten fur it carried its knife in one hand the hatchet he had traded it in the other neither weapon was raised and the sim showed no hostility still quick stayed wary no sim had ever visited t him at night before he did not set aside his rifle until the sim put down what it carried even then he had misgivings sims were stronger than people if this one chose to grapple with him he was in trouble but it had only freed its hands so it could use signs you it give food it signed amplifying meat you give to female yes quick agreed i not eat fox not want to he hesitated handtalk had no way to express waste the concept was alien to the sim mind put aside he finished lamely why not eat fox meat good the sim signed and the trappers tight nerves finally eased a bit still the males next question took him by surprise hungry now yes he signed again with a rueful glance in the direction he had thrown the squirrels smal bones then he was surprised all over again for the sim signed you come with me to our fire eat there go there he asked not quite believing he had seen correctly he had always made a point of staying away from at the clearing the sims used as their own that was partly what with people he would have cal ed politeness but more the simple desire not to draw unwelcome attention to himself wel he seemed to have drawn attention but not of the unwelcome sort this wild band owned flint and steel now fire and the nary of the time when they had not been able to make it loomed large in sims lives fire meant to this male what home meant to henry quick come he signed stepping toward the sim it picked up its weapons signed follow and plunged the woods quick fol owed as best he could again he reminded how wild sims perforce became masters of st craft the sim glided along so quietly that he felt slow t and clumsy by comparison sometimes only its lingering fir let him stay close to it he suspected it could have gone er had it not been leading him kinking on in front of his nose a firefly made him up other than that the forest was impenetrably dark the sim pressed on with perfect confidence just when quick was beginning to wonder if anything behind that confidence he scented woodsmoke on the breeze the sim must also have caught the smell for it said no a breathy throaty noise the first sound it had made all night and hurried ahead a moment later quick smel ed charring meat along with the smoke he hurried and soon saw light ahead the male hooted before it entered the clearing where its band was staying answering calls came back to it they made henry quick think of shouts heard on the breeze with the words blown away but the sense here welcome remaining quiet tell as the trapper stepped into the open area with the male sims it was a measuring sort of silence quick had entered most of the dozen or so of them as they and he hunted he had traded tools for furs with more than half of them meeting them as a group though emphasized the inferences between him and them as solitary contacts could not the females and youngsters on the other hand had wryer seen him before except for the one to whom hed given the fox carcass their stillness was more than a little fearful but they were curious too a child for the life of him quick could find no better word especially since young sims like grown females had a more human seemblance than did grown males of perhaps seven came up to him it touched his suede trousers and tunic then looked up at him the picture of puzzlement strange skin it signed a couple of males growled warningly and one hefted a stone as quick stretched out his arm al he did though i was roll up the fringed sleeve of his tunic to show what lay beneath no hair he signed that was not strictly true but by sim standards he might as well have been bald put on animal skins instead warm the youngster felt the trappers bare skin jerked its hand away with a grimace hair better it signed startled quick burst out laughing the sims laughed too loud and long the male that had been holding a stone threw it on the ground came over to quick and hugged him hard enough to make his ribs creak he wished he could have taken more credit for winning acceptance but was glad to get it no matter how it came the male that had brought him tugged him toward the fire eat it signed and the trapper needed no further invitation one leg stil remained from the carcass of a buck likely quick thought the one he had heard the males chasing the rest was bones the big ones split to get out the marrow and the skull crushed for the sake of the brains a grizzled male had charge of the meat as henry quick came over the sim picked up a chipped stone and began to carve off a chunk for him he started to offer his own steel knife instead but stopped when he saw the stone tool gliding through the leg of venison a steel knife lasted almost forever was easy to hone again and again and did not chip none of that however meant stone could not be sharp quicks eyes widened slightly at the size of the piece the old sim gave him too much he signed not eat al the sim shrugged and grunted someone will if you dont quick thought it meant even the single gesture had been hesitant the trapper wondered on handtalk had reached this band maybe it was so recently that the old sim had already been grown and only knew it imperfectly as a man will have trouble speaking a foreign language he acquires after his youth catching the meat bubble and brown as he held it on a stick over the fire drove such speculation from his mind beside him the sim that had brought him here was roasting a larger piece less patient with cooking than he it led its gobbet away from the flames tossed it from hand to hand until it was cool enough to eat then tore off one bite after another the venison disappeared with finishing haste quick sat beside the sim and tried valiantly to match its but its bigger teeth and bigger appetite meant he was classed since they starved so much of the time sims ate the most of good days like this one the trapper was amazingly full by the time half his piece was gone yet by then the male had almost finished and showed no signs of sing down he was thinking of offering it what was left of his venison when another sim touched him on the knee he turned round to see the female he had met the day before the female held out its left hand in a begging gesture meat with the right he cut off a piece and gave it to the sim two youngsters begging from the male next to him which gave them some scraps a little one that could hardly toddle came up one of the children with its hand out and in turn recieived a few tiny fragments of meat it stared at the trapper as it ate the male turned to quick more it signed getting up walking over to pluck a handful of whortleberries off a branch heavy with the large purpleblue fruit the trapper ate a few himself their tart sweetness cut through the greasy film coating the inside of his mouth both males and females freely took the berries no begging was involved only dearly won meat required that though they usually shared their prey the males who hunted had some prior claim on it with a burst of pride that made him feel foolish a moment later quick realized the female sim had treated him as if he were a hunter himself a dominant member of the band despite that acceptance he remained an object of curiosity that he knew was natural enough he was probably the first live creature ever to share the bands campsite if they changed their minds about him he might not stay that way either sims sometimes ate sims from other bands and when they could catch them people too a good many such grisly episodes punctuated mans westward expansion across america but this group found him only interesting the grizzled elder that tended the meat ran its hands over his clothes as fascinated by the soft suede as the youngster had been make it signed and then after obvious painful groping for the sign how skins cut to arms legs chest not stink rub tree barknot any tree right tree as a trapper he knew how to tan hides what he could not do was put it in terms the sim understood show one day he promised if a sim saw something done it could copy as well as a human but sims would not improve on a process as humans might show the old sim agreed it pointed to quicks fancy silver belt buckle show regretfully he shook his head he knew nothing of metalworking save that it was too complex for the subhumans to fathom his person fascinated the sims as much as his gear they pointed at his gray eyes then at their own which were uniformly dark he had to rol up his sleeve several times and take off his boots to show that under them his feet were like theirs if less battered and cal used his forehead though intrigued the sims most they kept patting at it to compare it to their own heads which sloped sharply he shuddered even when he thought of doing so through the winters bouts on the face of it it seemed impossible the sim to whom he had given the fox carcass was close by he signed how live when snow come the sim signed repeating for emphasis hard cold hungry many die in cold a shiver il ustrated the idea far more fluent with her signs than the elder had been the female went on dens like bears brush branches stil make fire still cold cold cold cold the sims eyes tried with dread winter was a worse enemy than spearfang or bear with their bel ies full though the sims never renective the first place did not care to look ahead the youngsters through the clearing wrestled with one another and bred their elders for al the world like so many unruly hen back in cairo or portsmouth or philadelphia many of the adults made beds of branches and leaves curled and went to sleep ignoring the youngsters squawks shouts a mother nursed a baby the old sim and a young adult male squatted by the fire chipping stones the young adult absently swatted at a youngster that disturbed him when it came back to watch what they were doing the male let it stay other adults had a different idea for passing the time three or four couples paired off and mated the rest of the sims paid them no particular attention nor did they seem to feel the lack of privacy when a running youngster was about to crash into one pair the male reached out from its position on its knees behind the female to fend off the little one henry quick found the rutting sims no more interesting than did the rest of the band he had been away from men a long time but not long enough to think of a sim as a partner he would as soon have coupled with a pack of dogs some trappers he knew did that some mated with sims too he knew what he thought of them the same as most a people thought you son of a sim would start a fights anywhere in the commonwealths he was taken by surprise when the female sim he had given the fox meat touched him on the leg again this time much higher up than before want the female signed the last gesture it used was not a standard part of handtalk but not easy to get wrong either to remove any possible misunderstanding the female was on hands and knees looking back over its shoulder at him neither that nor the sight of its cleft between hairy and rather boyish buttocks did anything to rouse his ardor no he signed handtalk was not made for tact he i softened his refusal as much as he could you i not same the sim luckily seemed more curious than angry not fit it asked eyeing his crotch as if to gauge what his trousers concealed he left that unanswered he had seen enough sims to know their masculinity was hardly so if rampant as jokes and stories made it out to be but he was no i more than average that way himself not want the female signed after a moment and used a that gesture of its own invention again full quick temporized he patted his stomach apparently that impeded performance among sims too because the female gave a small regretful hoot later it signed the trapper shrugged and spread his hands you i not same he repeated the female shrugged too and went off to get a few more whortleberries to henry quicks relief it did not come back to him hed meant to imply that men and sims were so different no offspring could come from a mating he did not know whether the sim was bright enough to follow that he did know it was a lie he had never seen a crossbreed the repugnance almost everyone felt for coupling with the subhumans had a lot to do with that few of mixed blood were born fewer still lived the human parent did that to save themselves from disgrace the ones that did survive were good for driving lawyers to distraction and for host of tales whose truth the trapper was in no position to judge he yawned back by his own campfire he would have een asleep hours ago here he had neither his own blanket lor the nests sims made for themselves he stretched out on he ground the big blaze the sims had going was plenty to seep him warm he was tired enough not to worry about sleeping soft he rolled over threw aside a twig that was raking his cheek and knew nothing more til the sun rose he woke with a crick in his neck and a bladder ful to bursting he walked into the bushes at the edge of the clearing to relieve himself by the smel and by the way his shoes squelched once or twice on the short journey the sims were not so fastidious they had already begun their endless daily round of foraging henry quick was glad to see that the importunate female was gone from the campsite otherwise he thought with wry amusement it might have wanted to go into the bushes with him to see just what sort of apparatus he had the males who hunted in a group rather than scattering one by one were still by the fire the trapper went up to the male that had guided him here good food he signed he had a spare bootlace in one of the pouches that hung from his belt he dug it out yes it was long enough for him to cut a couple of lengths from the end and stil do what he wanted with it he cut off the extra pieces tied them to the main length at one end and made loops at the other end of each then he tied the makeshift belt round the sims middle to carry knife axe he signed have them to use have hands free the sim did not seem to understand it rubbed its chinless jaw staring at quick but made no move to put the tools in the loops the old grizzled male looked from the trappers belt to the leather lace he had given the other sim its eyes lit it let out a soft hiss making the very same noise when as a boy he had seen his first steam railroad engine the grizzled sim stepped forward took the knife from the younger males hand and thrust it through one loop then it pointed first at the hatchet then at the second loop ill it gave an imperative barking call pointed again it might never have learned handtalk well henry quick thought but its years had given it a wisdom of its own after it repeated its gestures a third time the younger sim finally got the idea it pushed the hatchet handle into the vacant loop the head kept the hatchet from falling through the sim looked at its empty hands at the tools it still had with it suddenly it grinned an enormous grin good it signed at quick good good good have more another male asked sorry no more henry quick apologetically spread his hands he suggested make from plants from skins the old sim could follow handtalk no matter how it much trouble it had using the gestures make it signed and i pointed to itself before long quick suspected every sim in the band or at least every hunting male would be sporting a belt some would be made of vines and would break others of green hides that would stink and get hard and wear out quickly they would be better than no belts at al he supposed he was pleased to have found something to give in exchange for the feast of the night before sims had so little that he was surprised they had offered to share in spite of his earlier gift now they were less likely to resent him for accepting in daylight the journey back to his trap line took less than half as long as it had by night when he returned to the clearing where his latest camp was he checked his pack no sims had been near it though they never would have had a better chance to steal on the other hand he thought smiling theyd had plenty just as good he went the round of the traps near the clearing reset the traps that needed it he should have had one more a trap still held the bloody hind leg of a ringtail that was all that was left of disc blackmasked beast though when he first saw the tracks around the trap he thought the sims had robbed him of her al then he noticed the claw marks in front of the toes a bear had taken the chance to seize prey that could not flee he swore but resignedly that sort of thing had happened to him many times before and would again bears could be as big a nuisance as sims some bands of sims like the one whose territory he was now could be made to see that working with him got them more than robbing him did the only thing a bear understood was a bullet a grouse boomed somewhere off among the spruces henry quick forgot about the bear at least with the front part of his mind he sidled toward the noise the grouses dullbrown feathers concealed it on its perch but not well enough he got almost close enough to knock it down with a club before he shot it he bled and gutted the bird handling the gall bladder with care so it would not break and spil its noxious contents into the body cavity he wished he were back at his base camp the grouse would be better eating after hanging for several days but he was on the move and had no time for such refinements the dark rich meat would be plenty good enough tonight so it proved though he roasted it a couple of minutes too long grouse was best rare he would have liked to flavor it with some bacon instead of crumbs from his salt beef but the rashers hed brought were long gone hed eaten them as soon as they began to go rancid picking his teeth with the point of his knife he laughed at himself all this fretting about fancy cooking was a sure sign hed been in the wilderness too long that night he dreamt of eating pastry full of fruit and cream until he had to cut a new notch in his belt in its own way as sensual a dream as his more usual imaginings of sweetscented girls reaching up to him from featherbeds thick enough to smother in waking hungry to a blanket in the middle of a forest clearing was hard even eating what was left of the grouse was not help much though it would have been an expensive luxury if ordered in a cafe east of the mountains too much of what he did involved things that were expensive luxuries east of the mountains what he craved were the luxuries he could only get back there the intensity of that craving ended up undoing him the next clearing around which he had a set of traps was over on the west side of the one the sims used the trail he had blazed to it swung a lot farther north than it had to so he could give the sims clearing a wide berth now that the subhumans had shown how friendly they were he decided to take the direct route if he did that the rest of the time he was there he thought he could save several days travel and set out for the fleshpots of the east that much sooner the sims he told himself would not mind nor did they he happened on a party of hunting males not long after he set out several saw him and nodded his l way as they might have to one of their own band but he had i not reckoned on the bear for all his woodscraft the first he knew of it was when it loomed up on its hind legs like some ancient brooding god not fifty feet from him in that moment he had a good shot at its chest and belly but he held his fire bears even silvered bears like this one rarely attacked without being provoked but it did not do to count on a bear either this one peered his way he was close enough to see its nostrils flare as it took his scent it gave an oddly pig like grunt dropped to al fours and barreled toward him he threw his rifle to his shoulder fired and ran the bear screamed he heard its thunderous stride falter but it stil came on roaring its pain to the world and crashing through bushes and firs like a runaway railroad engine and in a sprint a bear even a wounded bear is faster than a man he had heard before he set out on this trapping run they had most of the kinks out of a repeating rifle he would have given five years worth of furs to have one now he threw away the gun he did have so he could run faster if he lived hed come back for it he never remembered feeling the blow that shattered his right leg al he knew at the time was that instead of sprinting in one direction he was suddenly spinning and sling through the undergrowth in a very different one that saved his life the bear had to change directions too and it was also hurt in the second or two its hobbling charge gave him he jerked out his pistol cocked it and squeezed the trigger he seemed to have forever to shoot his hand was steady with he eerie steadiness the shock of a bad injury can bring the bears mouth gaped in a horrible snarl the pistol bal shattered a fang before burying itself in the beasts brain the bear sighed and fell over dead god that was close the trapper said in a calm conversational voice he started to pull himself to his feet and the instant he tried to put any weight on his leg all the pain his nervous system had denied till then flooded over m he fainted before he could shriek the sun had moved a fair distance across the sky when he came back to himself the moment he did he wished he but escape to unconsciousness again he tasted blood and realized he had bitten his lip he had not noticed that pain was a trickle set against the allconsuming torrent in his leg tears were streaming down his face by the time he managed to sit up the world had threatened to gray out several times in the process his trouser leg was wet too not only from where hed pissed himself while unconscious but also farther down where the bear had struck him blood was soaking through the suede he held himself steady with one hand in a thorn bush while he walked the other down his leg to the injury something hard and sharp was pressing against the inside of his trousers he groaned this time not just from the pain with a compound fracture and heaven only knew how much other damage in there he would soon be as dead as if the bear had killed him cleanly he wished it had this way hurt worse his hands shook so badly that he took a quarter of an hour to reload his pistol a lead ball would end his misery no less than the bears but after the weapon was ready he did not raise it to his head if he had been able to charge it with powder and wadding and bullet how could pains grip on him be absolute he began to drag himself toward the bear that took no longer than loading the gun had though the body was only a handful of paces from him he passed out several times on the way at last he reached the carcass if he was going to try to live he would need to eat the bear was food for as long as it stayed fresh the pistol ball left no visible wound now that the bears mouth was closed in death quicks first shot with the rifle had torn along the left side of the beasts neck and lodged in its shoulder it might have been a mortal wound but not quickly enough to do the trapper any good he tried to push the point of his broken shinbone back into his flesh and failed repeatedly the pain was too much to stand he did drag himself to a sapling close by the bears carcass and cut it down with his knife then using the lace from his left boot he tied the sapling to his leg it was not much of a splint but it was a little better than nothing with it on the broken pieces did not grind together quite so agonizingly he set out to make a fire against the coming chill of night and the chill of his damaged body and for cooking a bloody gobbet he had worried off the bears shoulder he was still crumbling dry leaves for tinder when the hunting party of male sims came upon him he did not realize they were there until they were almost on top of him along with their crude weapons they carried squirrels and rabbits a snake and a couple of birds not a great days bag by any means they looked in wonder from henry quick to the bear and back again you kills one asked after a little while he recognized it as the male that had brought him the marten fur understanding its handtalk and responding took all the concentration and strength the trapper had i kill bear he answered bear hurt me break leg bone the sims grimaced one gave an involuntary hiss of pain another pointed at the rude splint why stick hold bone pieces stil hurt less quick changed the subject his leg did not hurt much less he waved at the dead bear cut up meat take to your fire he could not hope to eat a twentieth part of it before it spoiled the sims could have done what they wanted with the bear no matter what he said but his free giving of it seemed to take them aback come with us eat with us again signed the male he knew he had prayed it would ask that the band of sims he knew was his only hope of living through the winter though he had scorned the thought not long before it was his only hope of living longer than a few days come to that even if his leg healed well he would not be able to travel for months and with the injury he had he had a bad feeling it would not heal well a male with a broken front tooth was signing at the one he knew best kil it urged more meat kil another male agreed no hunt no walk lie by fire eat cold soon no food to give no good to us kil in other circumstances quick might have agreed with those sims he would be a burden for the band and one more mouth to feed when they wein hungry themselves unless he could find a way to make himself valuable to them he was done for take me to fire then take all tools in pack he offered one of the sims unfortunately was smart enough to see the flaw in that kil then take tools it signed he almost gave up then like a bul et a spear going into his chest or a club breaking his head would put him out of his pain but he had not shot himself and he did not want to end as a feast for subhumans he forced his battered wits to work take me to fire make more tools that was the best he could do if it did not appeal to the sims he was dead the male that had brought him the marten pelt hooted make noisesticks it asked he could see the eagerness on its broad features no he signed hating to have to do it but even had he had metal to hand he did not know how to make a gun use noisestick to kill game near fire he happened to think of bows and arrows they were rare in the commonwealths but some rich men back east liked to hunt with them claiming they were more sporting than guns quick cared nothing for sport he was interested in surviving make thing like noisestick but quiet he signed kil far like noisestick the male asked not that far farther than spear the sims shouted at one another not so much arguing as to intimidate finally the male that had brought quick the marten fur signed take and pointed at him he tried without much luck to stifle a shriek as two sims hauled him upright others fell to butchering the bear it soon they were toting slabs of meat bigger than those a man could easily carry that strength also helped the pair over whose shoulders he had draped his arms al the same the journey to the bands clearing was a nightmare it would have been dreadful even with careful men hauling the trapper it was worse with sims they were not deliberately cruel but they were careless several times his broken leg hit the ground so hard he thought it would fall off he rather wished it would mercifully he passed out again before the hunting party got home the anguish when his bearers let him down like a sack of meal brought him back to himself sims were all he could see as he peered blearily upward their thick odor clogged his nostrils he felt blood flowing down his leg again the thought of getting the sims to set the broken bone made him sweat but leaving it untended was worse take off stick he signed take off boots pants the sims grunted in puzzle the handtalk gesture for trousers meant nothing to them since they had never seen any except his he pointed and they understood fix bone put stick back and another stick on hold bone in place he thought of thing else hold me down i yell you do anyhow the sims hooted in dismay when they saw how he was he die a female signed flatly he live he make for us answered the male he knew he live that was another female after a moment he reconized it as the one that had wanted to couple with him well no danger of that now he thought and even in torment almost laughed the grizzled sim pushed forward maker it signed good if live that was the most signtalk the trapper had ever seen from it he turned his head away the sight of his redsmeared tibia sticking through his flesh was making him even sicker than he felt already push bone into leg he signed straight like other leg till then he had only thought he knew what pain was again the sims were not cruel on purpose again that did help no one could have set the fracture without hurting him badly that the wouldbe healers were inexperenced subhumans made things worse but perhaps not by much some unmeasurable time later his agony lessened by a tiny fraction he chose to believe that was because two pieces of bone were properly aligned if not he knew he could bear no more his throat was raw from screaming he could feel the blood slick on his hands where nails had bitten into his palms now sticks on he signed tie tight hold bones in place senses failed him before the sims were done this time it did not return to him at once when at last he woke again the sun was in his eyes it morning his leg felt better it was he realized an improvement on how it had felt the day before he looked around most of the sims were long gone from ring the males to hunt the females to forage the female that had wanted him came out of the woods its arms were full of berries and roots it set down its prizes and came over to stoop beside him after a moment it rose again to return with a chunk of food his stomach twisted he was not ready for food but he had a raging thirst water he signed the sim handed him the piece of wood he began hollowing out the branch with his dagger the work took most of the day it was interrupted when he had void his bowels after a while an old female wrinkling its broad flat nose got a handful of leaves and carried the dropping away he hoped the sim would clean him too but it did not sighing he went back to his carving when the rude cup was done he explained with signs what it was good for the grizzled male took some time to understand when at last it did it hurried off to test the marvel for itself it came back with a wide grin on its face standing where he could see it it held the cup over its hea and poured water into its mouth from arms length it got wet but it did not seem to care the female that had wanted him returned from another foraging trip it handed him another piece of cold cooked bear meat eat it signed again this time he felt ready to try the flesh tasted like beef but was greasier his stomach long empty churned uneasily his bowels moved again not long after that the young female dealt with the mess in the same way the old one had before it came back though with more leaves and did a rough job of wiping him thanks he signed it only grunted the gesture meant nothing to it back in the settled parts of the commonwealths where sims served humans polite phrases had come into handtalk they had not however become part of the rough abridged version this band used quick shook has head sorry he could not express the gratitude he felt the last thing he remembered when he fel asleep that night was seeing the grizzled sim hard at work on another cup the one he had made was in front of it every so often it would pick his up and study it as if to remind itself what it was doing the trapper woke before sunrise shivering he had thought of the pain in his leg as a fire before now it was hot in the most literal sense he put a hand to his forehead water he thought it was the last coherent thought he had for a long time he never knew how long he lay in delirium the hours and days stretched and twisted like taffy every once in while something would lodge in his memory he recalled young sim bending over to peer down at him its solemn face so close to his that it filled his field of vision a mite was crawling across its cheek the mite seemed more interesting to him than the little sim he remembered tel ing the male that had brought him l the marten fur how to get coffee stains out of linen he went into great detail though the sim knew nothing of either coffee or linen and understood not a word of english using handtalk never occurred to him after a while the sims went away quick kept on talking until his mind clouded i again he remembered being fed two or three times all of them by the female that had wanted him the first time he choked on a piece of meat and had to struggle to spit it out after that the sim gave him only soft pasty food he watched it chewing meat and fruit before passing them on b to him as if he were a justweaned infant he knew he should have been disgusted but he lacked the strength he did not spit out the food either quick heard deep racking coughing and marveled that his lungs and throat were not raw only gradually over a couple of days did he realize he was not the one coughing a little after that the noise stopped or he stopped noticing it he did not figure out which until much later he remembered the female shaking him back into foggy awareness of the world around him it held a plant in front l of his face a plant with downy graygreen leaves each cut go into blunt lobes and teeth the flower heads held many smal tubular pinkishwhite flowers they were sere and brown now well past their peak dusty maiden the plant is was called one of the thousands of little nondescript shrubs that grew in the woods he laughed foolishly he was a good way past his peak too he thought not quite ready for flowers though he said out loud the sense of the words brought him closer to real consciousness he was not far from being ready for flowers and knew it the female held the root against his lips eat it signed over and over until he opened his mouth it thrust the root he gagged bit down dirt crunched between his teeth as did the root it tasted horrid when he tried to spit it out the female sim held a hand over his mouth and would not him it kept signing eat with no other choice he did tears of rage and weakness filled his eyes the next thing he remembered was thinking it had started to rain but when he opened his eyes the sun was shining yet he was wet sweat covered every inch of his body it dripped from his nose and trickled through his damp and matted hair he put a hand to his forehead it was cooler his fever had broken he drifted away again but something closer to natural sleep than to the oblivion which he had wandered before when he woke again the female sim was trying to feed him another plant like the last one but even more beraggled this time the sim broke off the root and forced it into his mouth the taste was just as bad as he remembered but gagging he got the thing down after he had swallowed the female brought him a cup of water and held this while he drank it he did not think the cup was the one he had made he had another sweating spell during his next sleep and stayed awake some little while when he came out of it the same sim seemed to have taken over his nursing it greeted him with yet another dusty maiden plant he no longer tried to fight its ministrations enough of his wits were back for him to realize that however acrid and revolting the plant it was giving him tasted they were doing him good he came awake again at dawn thinking how hungry he was he tried to raise himself up on an elbow the effort left him gasping before he finally succeeded but no matter how weak he was he was at last in command of his faculties once more he took stock of himself looking down the length of his body he whistled soft and low no wonder im hungry said out loud his voice a rusty croak the fever had melted the flesh from his bones every rib was plainly visible he had no idea when the sims had taken off his tunic and his legs were birdscrawny the splints he saw with relief were still on his right calf it ached fiercely but now the pain was at a level he could bear yellow serum oozed from the scab where the bone had stabbed through his skin yet his right leg felt not much warmer than the other one despite the splints the leg had a kink in it that had not been there before he did not care he was healing a limp even a cane the rest of his life would be a smal price to pay he marveled that he was alive at al because the agony in his leg had diminished he was abler to take stock of his other bodily shortcomings which were considerable he felt raw running sores on his back and buttocks not surprising when he had been lying there so long there were more on the insides of his thighs from imperfectly cleaned wastes but he was not lying in a great stinking pool of his own filth the sims must have dragged him from spot to spot in their clearing he had no memory of it most of the subhumans were already out looking for food one of the old females that kept an eye on the kids while their parents foraged walked in front of him food he signed the old female fell back a pace hoo it said in surprise he must have been an inert lump so long that the sims no longer expected anything else from him the old female brought him some berries they were the unripe and overripe ones none of the subhumans had wanted again henry quick did not care halfstarved as he was they still tasted wonderful he tried to rol on his side but even splinted even beginning to mend his leg would not let him his bedsores for could think of no better name for them snarled as his weight came back down on them he was not going anywhere even so short a distance for a while yet he abandoned the slender dream hed let grow again of getting back across the mountains before the snow fel the female sim that had been caring for him returned with what looked like a chunk of log the old female gave an excited hoot pointed to quick seeing him awake the other sim dropped its burden and dashed over to the maiden plant this time he took the plant from the sims hand and ate it before he could be told to whatever was in that root was medicine better than most of what the doctors back in cairo used when he had choked it down he signed eat yes the female sim echoed grinning hugely one of the hatchets from quicks pack was lying close by the sim cut the log it had brought in punk flew the log was old two or three more strokes served to split it it was ful of at beetle larvae they squirmed in the dirt youngsters came running up to pop them into their mouths the female sim skewered several grubs on a twig held over the fire and brought them to quick the trapper paused then sighed if he was going to live with sims he d have to live like a sim and that was that he screwed his eyes shut but he ate perhaps hunger seasoned the bugs for he did not find them as disgusting as he thought compared to the medicinal root they were delicious the female sim fetched him a cup of water he wondered many times it had done that while his wits wandered not many human nurses would have been so patient the water made his bladder fill up he did not want to foul himself not now when he was awake he called to the sim when he had its attention he signed fill cup piss from me not piss on ground here boo the sim said softly as the subhumans often did a meeting an idea they had not thought of the sim put the cup between his legs it took hold of his penis to put tip inside the cup as matteroffactly as if it were holding his toe urinating without fouling himself was one of the pleasures that accompanied healing he thought of something not drink from this cup heed this cup piss only coo the female said again after al his improvement the trapper still slept as mum as a young child he was asleep when the hunting party males returned a little before sunset when he woke the next morning most of them were gone again the man that had brought him the marten pelt however crouched beside him plainly waiting for him to rouse that waiting was as far as politeness went among sim they had no small talk as soon as the male saw quicks eyes on it it signed make thing like noisestick quick frowned he had hoped the sim had forgotten the promise hed made as he thrashed on the ground in anguish he had only the vaguest idea of how to make bow to say nothing of arrows unfortunately the sim remembered he would have to learn if it was going to propel an arrow a bow had to be of springy wood the trapper pointed to one of the spruces at the edge of the clearing fetch me little tree like that has signed he held his hands about four feet apart the sim went into the woods it soon came back with a sapling such as he had described a knife lay close enough for him to reach it he began cutting branches off the trunk the sim watched for a while then decided nothing was going to happen right away it picked up its hatchet and a stout club and went off to hunt because quick was stuck on his back trimming the sapling was a slow awkward job he managed to twist enough to prop himself up on his left elbow he used his left hand to hold the fragrant trunk and carved away with his right but things still did not go well he looked round for the grizzled sim the old male could help and would probably be interested in what he was up to he did not see the old male thinking back he had not seen it since his wits came back when the female that cared for him returned from a foraging trip he asked about it dead the female signed a thumbsdown gesture old as the roman arena the sim amplified it with a racking burst of coughs quick recalled the paroxysms he had heard in his delirium face more he was frustrated because he could not make polite expressions of sympathy speech would permit after some thought he signed bad for band bad for band the female agreed toolmaker all sims use and make tools of course but as with people some were better than others the grizzled sim had lived enough to gain a great deal of experience too if it had passed on al it knew the band would indeed suffer henry quick wondered how much he could help there what hurt the band would also hurt him at the end of the day he had the trunk of the spruce bare ranches and a notch carved in either end good help he led to the female it smiled back at him he realized he had to make a conscious effort to smell it these days probably he thought because by now his own odor was as bad as its bout then the males came back they were smeared in blood but triumphant they carried a plump doe already cut in pieces the females and youngsters greeted them with glad cries the band would feast tonight the male that had brought quick the marten fur ambled over and picked up the wouldbe bow it scowled eyebrows king on the heavy browridges not like noisestick it signed ominously had it had a sign for fake it would have signed it not like the trapper admitted adding do like when the sim grunted a noise redolent of skepticism quicks eye fell on the hind leg from which another male carving chunks he had intended to use another bootlace as a bowstring but he had only two and the sims would need more bows than that assuming he could make any at all sinew might serve in place of leather save he signed and then paused grinding his teeth he not remember the sign for sinew eventually by pointing to the tendons in his own wrist and at the back of sims ankles he put across his meaning the male gave him a dubious look no butler would have been ashamed of but went over to the sim acting as butcher and passed the message along that male shrugged as if to say the trapper was daft but eventually set beside him several glistening white lengths each with bits of flesh still clinging to it he did not work on the bow for several days after that his fever returned it was not strong enough to drive him into delirium but it did leave him shivering and miserable he glumly crunched the dusty maiden roots the female sim brought him and wished he felt more like a human being or even a healthy sim because he was stil aware of his surroundings he real y noticed then the care the female sim gave him it fed him got him water cleansed him hauled him from place to place to keep him from lying in his own dung it might not have been as gentle as a human nurse but it was more conscientious than most not only was this spel of fever less severe than the last had been it was shorter yet even after quick began to feel better he kept waking up chilled only when he saw the sims also clutching themselves building thicker piles of bedding and huddling close to the fire did he understand that the weather was changing autumn was drawing near and hard on its heels would come winter the sims did what they could to get ready for it they brought in stones and brush which they began to work into a windbreak as the days went by it grew thicker and taller and extended all the way around the clearing with a couple of thin spots through which the sims could push they also stacked up great heaps of firewood once the snow started it would not be so easy to collect quicks hatchets helped them there they could not have cut so much wood with their crude tools alone some of them even realized it the male that had brought quick the marten pelt hefted its hatchet when it saw he was watching and signed good it was less happy however over the trappers efforts to make arrows that were worth anything finding really straight lengths of branch was hard enough getting points on them proved worse because the sims used stone tools quick had assumed they could easily chip out little stone arrowheads but the tools they were used to making were handsized choppers and scrapers they had never done the tiny flakework arrowheads required if quick had shown them how they could have duplicated his efforts he no skill in shaping stone though and soon discovered knowing what he wanted was very different from singing how to make it about the time the first frost appeared on the windbreak he worried about getting knocked over the head for failing to produce if the sims decided to do that he could not stop them but that fatalistic certainty was only a small of what gradual y let him relax or more important was that the sims accepted him they had grown accustomed to him lying by the fire and no longer saw him as much different from themselves except that he could not move his chief worry now was that would happen if a youngster tripped over his broken leg while playing where the young sims had once crowded to gape at him now they were so careless around him he sometimes wondered if they remembered he was there the leg stil hurt it also itched savagely he rubbed the leg round the healing gash raw until he understood the itch came from far within he healed despite the itch little buy little milestones were small but he treasured them the day he could sit up the day he could roll onto his side to air sores on his back and behind the day those sores started to scab over milestones or not he remained immobile save when a sim dragged him along except for his annoyingly troubled work on the bow he had little to do but lie by the fire and watch the members of the band just as they accepted him so he came to think of them more and more as individuals as people rather than as subhumans animals to evade or exploit looking back he supposed the beginning of that probably came when he finally decided that thinking of the male that had brought him the marten skin by that clumsy handle was more trouble than it was worth he decided to call it martin and have donewith it giving the sim a mans name helped him think of it as being more like a man one by one he named all the sims most of his names were just tags in his own mind the sims had so much trouble reproducing the sounds of english that they could not use his names themselves which made him hesitate to apply them martin however soon learned what noise meant him with a mans name martin was also harder think of as it the female that cared for henry quick also rapidly figured out what names were for he cal ed her sol even though he continued to improve he knew how dependent on her he still was he whittled away at a couple of branches slowly turning them into crutches but he was not ready to try them yet a fal a slip would put paid to weeks of slow recovery in any case he had nowhere to go now that the weather was changing sol went right on caring for him as she had all along she also got better and better as his assistant in the effort to unravel the secrets of the bow she would have been better yet he thought glumly had her mentor been worth a damn she copied his blunders faithful y one by one but stopped making them as soon as he did he knew a lot of people back in the commonwealths who having settled on a particular mistake would keep making it till the end of time he also knew a lot of people who would have turned up their noses in the most literal sense at the continuing unpleasant labor involved in disposing of his wastes and getting the filth off him afterwards sol never faltered in the days when he was still on his feet he had improvised a good many strange wipes for his hindquarters but in that regard sols ingenuity outdid his he was grateful and sometimes amused he would never have thought of using grouse feathers for instance sol also kept using that same wooden cup to help him pee he sometimes thought the simple desire to piss upright would be what finally drove him to his feet he was glad he had the sense to recognize that urge as a sign of returning health and did not try to act on it too soon another sign came not long afterward on a day where by the fire the wind held a chil y promise of the snow would come soon as he had countless times before he called sols name and asked for the cup she finished fishing the seeds out of a couple of pinecones she had and brought it over to him took him in hand again as she had so often before what happened then though was new and strange for he felt himself stiffening at the sims touch it was hard to say which of them was more surprised quick had been lustful enough out on the trap line there is nothing like a compound fracture of the leg and a bout of fever to make a man put aside such concerns had sol ignored his rise simply put his penis in the cup waited the moment would have passed the sim was about to do just that then paused looked down quietly said iloo quick started to sign for sol to take her hand away but in still perhaps more in the spirit of experimentation anything else she stroked him for the first time with intent his recovering body responded to the feeling before his mind could will it not to and in any event he was fully rampantly and so unexpectedly erect his mind had very little to say the sim swung astride him lowered onto him he decided entering sol felt no different from having a woman so seeing her there above him hairy chinless and browed made him shut his eyes in a spasm of concentration the act went on whether he watched or not and in closing his eyes regardless of the reason made it seem much more familiar he felt the thick hair on thighs and buttocks as she rode him but that sensation was distant insignificant when set against the explosion building in his loins nor were the small wordless noises the sim made unlike the ones he had heard in bedroom oh back in the commonwealths too often those were from women who sighed more for his coins on the dresser than had for himself the sim had no such art no wonder then that his hips bucked of themselves that his hands reached out to take hold of sols breasts he almost jerked them away again for the hair that covered the breasts but the nipples reminded him he was in a bedroom now then climax swept over him and for that endless instant he did not care where he was sol rolled away as soon as he was through he kept his eyes shut trying to sort things out he felt simultaneously fine and as wretched as he could ever recall he opened his eyes sol was looking at him he nodded not yet trusting either speech or handtalk the sim nodded back good sol signed al right the trapper said surprising himself as usual when he spoke out loud his equanimity was coming back how many times had he told himself that if he was going to live with the sims he would have to live like a sim a wry grin settled on his face eating grubs was al very well but he had not expected to take things quite this far again sol asked and no grin no matter how wry could survive that question once he could explain away to himself as something beyond his control repeating the act though would be committing himself to what he along with almost everyone in the commonwealths thought of as disgusting and yet the coupling had not been the sordid sort of masturbation he imagined mating with a mare or ewes might be sol had been a partner in the act not a mere uncomprehending receptacle for his lust indeed that he was being asked whether he wanted to go again said a good deal in the end the question more than anything else was what decided him all right he repeated the sim could not have understood his words but got the meaning from his tone sol took him literally and at once set about rousing his manhood he thought that would be futile so soon after the first round but his body long deprived proved him wrong the sim mounted him again normal y he preferred riding to being ridden but his leg made that not worth thinking about this time the joining was slower less fervent quick left his eyes open the sims in the clearing were paying hardly attention to him and sol than they would have to a couple of their own kind and the difference he judged was prurience only curiosity about how he performed they saw he functioned much like them they went to whatever they had been doing he stil did not look much at sol concentrating instead what he was feeling as before that was like in its knee to having a woman but now he noticed the peripheral differences more the hairiness of the sims body distracted him once or twice only later did he wonder if his relatively smooth skin was as strange to her he did notice the sims strength when she in the middle coupling he could not think of sol as it grasped him as they mated he had never bedded a woman at least as strong he was chat thought diverted quicks attention again he wondered how the males would react to his joining the band in this most intimate sense some had partners who mated more or less steadily with them but the dominant males of the hunting party martin and two or three others so coupled with the unattached females of the band now trapper was part of that hierarchy he wondered where he fit he could not hunt he could not even walk if he was plain importance it would have to come through his tools anyway he thought as sensation built toward release it was too late to worry now but afterward he worked away on the bow and arrows ih more concentration than he had shown for several days nor could he stifle a twinge of alarm when martin loomed over him hands on hips to inspect what he was up to but the sim as usual was businesslike sticks flip martin asked henry quick shrugged it was always a good questioa after endless effort he had figured out how to chip reasonably smal reasonably sharp arrowheads they were better points than he got by simply whittling away at the tip of tt arrow at any rate now he was having trouble making the miserable arrows go straight the first ones hed tried just spun crazily which was good for making the sims laugh but not much else then he vaguely remembered that proper arrows had feathers at the back to make them fly true getting feathers was a problem the sims threw rocks well enough to bring down a lot of birds but getting the feathers to stay on the arrow was a whole different question the sims knew nothing about glue and quick did not know how to make it either so far his best solution was cutting thin grooves in the shafts and sliding the feathers into them that was not nearly good enough once in a while one of his arrows would fly straight and thwack into a tree with enough force to stick which made the sims hoot appreciatively more often a feather would come out in flight which made the arrow behave as if it were trying to dodge its target instead of hitting it sol continued to help in his bowbuilding efforts and to care for him as she had been doing she never understood much english besides her name but he passed a lot of time talking first to her then with her in handtalk they did best at the purely pragmatic level she understood why the people back in the commonwealths wanted the furs he had come to trap furs warm she signed running a hand over his relatively naked skin no hair need warm she stroked he own redbrown hair to emphasize the contrast her hair had grown thicker almost furry as the season changed when quick tried to explain that people coveted furs for their beauty as well as their warmth he ran into a snare sims did have an aestnet wited to things they made themselves a fur was just a fur did better getting across the idea of rarity begging for ed was a simple kind of bargaining and the sims had od he would give them his strange and wonderful i tools in exchange for furs in my band he signed many tools few furs here many furs few tools you want nodded why few furs there she asked her handtalk far more fluid than it had been when he first met her she and to a lesser extent the rest of the band had learned from quick a number of signs they had not people he answered much hunting i understood that a band of sims that grew too large for the territory to support soon shrank again from starvation me parts of life in the commonwealths railroads boats quick did not even try to explain getting as the idea of a house a permanent place to live was enough as was describing domesticated plants and animals to sol it al seemed a vision of unparalleled abundance warm place to sleep she signed plenty to eat the trapper nodded admitting it why come here sol asked get furs was the only answer quick could put across wonderlust meant nothing to the sim sols band knew perhaps twenty miles square as intimately as if could but nothing of the world beyond it explain that he often found the company of his fellow men exsessive was also next to impossible but they fight sol asked he signed but then after thinking about it had to ri staff with other men long time maybe fight he knew how impatient he could get with peoples foolishness he really did not have that problem with the band of sims they were not smart enough to make idiots of themselves on purpose what brains they had they had to use he wanted to do something for sol to show his gratitude in a more permanent more substantial way than coupling after the first few times he had stopped worrying about whether those matings constituted bestiality that was more because he thought of himself as a member of the sim band than because he suddenly reckoned her human but the effect was the same he concentrated on the similarities rather than their differences the problem was that the sims lived at the bared subsistence level things that would have been approprate back in the commonwealths were incomprehensible and valueless here before he ful y realized that quick spent a good deal of time whittling a piece of pine into the shape of a spearfang sol looked at it when he proudly presented it to her she was interested she had never seen an image belfore but she was not really pleased inspiration struck when the trapper saw how the hunting party of males behaved when they came into the clearing on a day after the snow had begun to fal the sims threw down the carcasses they had brought into the clearing then as one rushed to put their feet as close to the fire in as they could quick smelled singeing hair but did not blame the sims a bit for him even healthy going out into the snow barefoot would have meant at the very least losing toes to frostbite the sims feet were hairy above and had thickly cal used soles so that risk was less for them nothin however could make such shoeless travel anything but it pain the females sol among them also had to brave the winter to forage and to cut firewood henry quick suddenly realized that while his boots did not have laces anymore they were much better than nothing before sol went out the next time he showed her how to put them on her feet she did not like them they must have felt strange and confining but when she came back her broad grin gleamed like the snow that still clung to the load of fir branches she was carrying warm she signed unbelievingly pointing down feetwarm she went to quick to hug him and plant exuberant kisses on his nd shoulders warm she signed again feet warm quick felt warm himself no easy trick that winter he had found a gift that made her happy the boots also made the other sims jealous quick tried that as fast as he could he did not want sol to suffer hed only meant to help the only solution he came with involved sacrificing his trousers which he could not wear anyhow they made several pairs of improvised shoes not as good as real boots but far superior to bare yet hairy leathery bare feet makeshift cordwainery let sol keep the boots that had been his that relieved him a great deal once he as convinced they did some good he signed all hunters sther gone quick answered martin gave a dissatisfied grunt the trapper hoped the sim would not demand the shirt off his back he needed it also fearing the big male would take his boots away from sol the trapper suggested foot things from skins of animals you kil skins stink fast martin signed quick remembered promising to show the grizzled sim to snake leather now in a way he could keep that promise rub skins with bark from spruce he signed then slow maybe not stink martin grunted again do he signed before long quick doing as much skinning scraping and curing as he had working the trap line he had been a lot of things before but never a cobbler for sims cold wet weather made his leg hurt worse but with brent kind of pain one he suspected would be with the rest of his life he knew several men with healed in bones who were the best prophets of rain for miles now at last he felt himself definitely on the mend successive triumphs were small but satisfying he treasured the day he sat up by himself the day he rol ed overthe day he coupled with sol with him on top the sticks were stil awkward and so was she that was not a posture sims often used neither come to that was female atop male most often they mated from behind like any other beasts quick realized he would have thought before his enforced sojourn here yet they treat far more than beasts that applied to other things seeing the utility of boots every so often around the camp the trapper would notice the subhumans joining as he sol did he smiled every time that was not one of the things he had intended to teach them still without the fire and the windbreak the band of sims could not have survived in the worst storms none of them went out except to gather more wood they huddled in their bedding close by the fire hugging one another for extra warmth often they went a couple of days without food they were used to going hungry quick was not his bel y began to preoccupy him more than his leg whenever the hunting party came back with game his stomach heralded their arrival with growl a wolf would have been proud of thanks in no small part to his hatchets the fire the never went out nor did the sims have to sacrifice the windbreak or rob it so it became threadbare indeed the females a youngsters cut so much more wood than they had before that the band often used the piles of of branches to thicken and restore their beds before using it to feed the fire quick had done that himself on the trapping line fir branches made a fine mattress on which to lay a blanket being now without a blanket the trapper happily join the sims in burrowing among the branches and using the group to hold his body warmth his nose grew so used to the thick resinous smell of fir that he had to make a conscious effort to notice it he found that the sap that oozed from the branches was easier to clean from his relatively smooth skin than to get out of the sims hair the sims spent a fair amount of time grooming one another under any circumstances it was as much a part of social lives as backfence chatter was back in the commonwealths quick did not mind taking part getting lair smooth and neat pleased him he made an absent note to carve out a comb when he had the chance as he cleaned from her hair left his hands constantly and spit did not take it off after a while he accepted that as just another nuisance his whoop made sims all over the clearing jump if it not dissolve the resin neither would water now his feathers would stay where he put them he had a couple of dozen shafts finished by the time they came into the clearing staggering under the weight of a fawn in his arms quick was no archer and was hampered by having to shoot sitting down nevertheless he sent several arrows close to a treetrunk that stood further away than anyone could throw a stone hiss wrist raw and red from being lashed by the sinew string he handed the bow to martin the sim had used it a couple of times before but already showed signs of being a better marksman than quick martin grunted the first two arrows went where he aimed them then hoo as a third followed he shot again as if to reassure himself it was no fluke thrust the bow back at the trapper make more he signed quick had won over the skeptic with sols help quick went from cobbler to bowyer and per he had finished a handful of crude bows and close to a hundred arrows before he paused to wonder about what he was doing men had always pushed forward across pica as they pleased not least because sims lacked the brains to fight back a bow was nowhere near as potent as a gun but it was vastly better than anything the subhumans had before not only that it was simple enough for them to make and care for themselves which was not true of firearms after some thought he decided it did not matter for one thing ideas did not move quickly from one band of sims to the next how recently this band had acquired sign showed that for another even with bows the sims could hardly become more than a nuisance and final y staying alive now counted far more than any hypothetical trouble in the future in such matters the trapper was a practical man he grinned from ear to ear when the hunting party began coming back with more game than they ever before not need close one signed holding a rabbit blood on its white fur in front of quicks face he kissed the trappers cheek then patted his own belly from far eat good save for a single infant not a sim had died this winter though it was the desperate time of year for the wild sims quick was amazed at the difference the extra fuel and the extra food made but winter was also the desperate time of year for other predators that roamed the woods one morning a female started to push aside a chunk of the windbreak she shoved back the piled branches with a shriek of fright as a wolf bayed in anger and frustration and hunger around the windbreak the rest of the pack took up the chorus the sims were besieged sol shivered next to quick cold had nothing to do with it wolves stay she signed stay stay stay we him hungry we go out they eat they eat enough then go the rest of the sims seemed sunk in the same fit of depression none showed any sign of trying to drive wolves away nor did they reach for the bows that lay by fire their wits were slower than humans after al quick saw they had trouble grasping that what served so well on the hunt would also defend them he was sure they would eventually have worked through for themselves but lacked the patience to wait he shouted till he had martins attention his voice also roused the devils choir outside the windbreak but he did not care about that take bows arrows he signed shoot wolves he red that by pantomiming drawing a bow back to his shoulder to shoot wolves those you not shoot run away the big male rubbed his long chinless jaw as he led with the idea he sprang to his feet with a wordless run for the weapons he dashed to the windbreak i through quick heard a snarl from the far side the was not afraid of a sim especially not with a barrier between them martin aimed the bow through a gap in the branches the wolfs fierce growls turned to a yowl of agony that went on and on the howls from the rest of the pack stopped abruptly quick feared and hated wolves after sims they were the most dangerous creatures in the woods a bear or a spearfang of course was more than a match for a wolf but pack of wolves would run even a spearfang off its prey had the trapper been able to stand he would have gone to windbreak to fire his rifle and pistol at the beasts the sims proved able to deal with things on their own martin dashed to another hole in the windbreak he shot a wounded wolf kiyied in pain that was enough more males rushing up to grab the rest of the bows and arrows in minutes several more wolves had been hit the rest of the pack was in full retreat the male sims with clubs and spears went outside the windbreak to finish off the animals they had wounded roast wolf tasted much better than quick had thought it would afew days later the weather turned clear and unseasonly warm the trapper with the aid of sol and of the crutches he had fashioned weeks before stood up for the first time since the sims had brought him into the clearing the effort of even a couple of steps required left him weak his left leg was from lack of use almost as feeble as the right the feeling walking brought was intoxicating he leaned over and kissed sol the lips he had never done that before the motion almost made him fall sol steadied him they both laughed he kissed her again this time they did slide to the ground carefully still laughing and ended up coupling afterward sol got up to gather wood leaving quick to himself she took pleasure in the act but knew nothing like lazing in the afterglow a smile still on his lips quick watched her retreating form there he thought goes a hell of a woman hearing word in his own mind brought him up short it had be i while since he took a real look at how he felt about sol that her body pleased him had been a surprise but l no longer now he noticed her hairiness her feet hardly more than had she been black or had very blue eyes he was used to her as one person grows used to another what did surprise him was how much he liked her he knew that had grown from her caring for him but there was more to it now her happiness mattered to him why else had he given her his boots and worried so much whether martin would take them away and if he desired her and at the same time wanted to gladden her in other ways he startled himself by speaking out loud if thats not love i dont know what the devil is the summer before using that word in connection i a sim would have seemed as ridiculous as thinking a female sim as a woman he shrugged not so disturbed as he expected to be living as part of the band had this perspective sims werent human he thought but they were people he nodded slowly pleased with the distinction the sim had been living in these woods for who knew how many years for the first time quick felt guilty over the people who were supplanting wild sims all across the continent even tame sims depended on their masters whims for security the trapper had trouble finding that right be the same time did not know what else could have happened more the sims hunted with bows the deadlier of the males brought in such an unending stream of food that the clearing constantly smelled of cooking meat the whole band began to lose the gauntness that went with most of them though was fat to quick a fat wild sim contradiction in terms so he thought at any rate he noticed sols belly beginning to protrude yet she d no extra flesh on her limbs or in her face the trapper scratched his head and kept on trying to get about on his crutches his right leg was never going to be the same there was famous knot of bone where the leg had been broken ad not healed straight which made it a little shorter its mate quick stumped patiently back and forth as much weight on it as he could day by day it bore but he knew he had made his last trapping run he would need a stick for the rest of his life he was exercising his mind he would have sworn where far away when the reason sol was putting on fat dawned on him he sat down heavily no matter often his body had joined with hers he had never thought issue might spring from it in hindsight that was stupid in hindsight of course a lot of things were stupid he stayed on his haunches lost in his own thoughts when sol came back from a foraging trip she gave him a bachful look not wash she asked no henry quick pointed at her baby in you she glanced down at herself the bulge was obvious so obvious that quick again kicked himself for not figuring what it meant before she signed baby in me she did not say anything about him being the father but since that first time she had rarely coupled with anyone but him after a moment he realized he had never seen any sim in the band use the sign for father they viewed mating for its own sake not for the sake of children and had never made the connection between the two he wondered what to do and wished he were callous enough for her pregnancy to make no difference to him he had intended to head back toward the commonwealths soon as the snow melted now it would not be so easy you want me stay here he signed where go sol asked to men like me sol frowned one of him was strange enough visual ing many of his kind took more imagination than she h at last she signed winter not gone only too right its not quick said aloud even or mild day like this one the breeze made his teeth chatter first he thought sol had changed the subject but arte moment he realized such subtlety was beyond her sh simply pointed out that whatever he decided to do wasnt going to do it tomorrow or the day after either he thought about what staying with the sims and the going back to the commonwealths would be like he ca for sol as he had for no woman on the other side of rockies and she was carrying his child that counted something but he was not sure in which direction it swt the balance son of a sim was a bad enough thing to call a man but father of a sim still he could be like a god if he chose to stay there was so much the sims did know he laughed at himself like a god was it a god who huddled naked cold and stinking in fir branches who ate whatever was alive or had been lately and was glad to get it who could not even use his own speech but had to content himself with a clumsy limited makeshifts anyone who bought godhood on those terms deserved to think he had it that the trapper lived hardly better than the sims while in the field did not enter into the equation he deliberatly chose those hardships to escape from his fellow men for time and to earn the money to live high when he got back to civilization until now he had never imagined staying west of the mountains without sol he would have had no doubts without sol he would have been dead months before and would not be in this quandary male sims were not normally quiet and reflective sol had accepted that henry quick sometimes was but had also come to know him well enough to tell when his thoughts troubled him you good she asked even after trading signs with him for so long she could not come closer than that to probing his feelings he spread his palms a gesture that meant neither yes nor no she rummaged about offered him some halffrozen roots she had found eat she signed as if food could cure mental as well as physical distress he sighed and ate sol made another gesture he acted on that one afterward no matter how sated his body was his mind did not rest could it be love he wondered when he could not express the idea to sol but what else was it he had no idea not even for himself he turned to sol you want me he asked it was her turn to hesitate finally she signed you good he tugged at his beard frowning sometimes sims statements were oracular in their obscurity at last he decided she was telling him that the most important thing was his own happiness a curious mirroring of his own feelings toward her and if that wasnt love what else was at even if it was was it worth abandoning the commonwealths for good he knew a fair number of men who had given up the lives they had known to stay with one whom they had fal en in love once the first lust faded most came to regret it something else occurred to the trapper he was the first to enter this part of the wilderness but he would not be last he did not have to wonder what the newcomers would think of him just what he would have thought before the bear wrecked his leg tales of quick the simlover would get him remembered forever but not in a way he wanted what else he thought he did not even think of taking sol back to the commonwealths with him he knew the ostracism that would bring the more so as she carried his child she did not deserve to face that apart from it too he doubted she could adapt to life east of the rockies she was a creature of wilds no less than the marten or the spearfang if he had to live with her it would have to be here he bit down on his lip till he tasted blood then slowly made himself relax as sol had reminded him winter was long way from over nothing he decided now could be fit he would be rehashing it endlessly for weeks to come he decided to put it aside as well as he could and wait to see what the weeks would bring that sadly indecisive and unoriginal conclusion was enough to grant him rest at last whenever the weather was clear enough and wa enough to let him quick kept exercising working to bring strength back in his longinactive legs he got to the point where he could stump about on his crutches lending him strength and balance then a good many days later he managed to hobble along with but a single stick most of the time though he spent as he had the begining of the winter under cover martin stayed on good terms with the trapper that partly because of the bows and arrows quick kept turn out by now the sims products especial y the arrow heads were as good as anything he could make but he had more leisure than they in which to make them moreover martin must have realized that without quick the band never would have known of bows and arrows in the first place the sim kept drawing the trapper out hoping to pick up more ideas the band could use quick racked his brains came up with little no matter how freeranging a life lived in the wild most of what he knew depended in some part on civilized techniques he could not match here or domesticated plants and animals that were equelly unobtainable he had never thought of things as basic as wheat and corn he tried to change a way of life without them most of the other males let quick alone that was not so hostility as uncertainty over where he fit into the band his status could hardly have been more confusing he went from being a powerful outsider to a helpless cripple as if that were not bad enough as a helpless cripple come up with a notion none of them could have they been men he knew he could have expected over sol he had already seen though that that sort exssiveness was much weaker among sims the males did not object when he took his share of the meat they brought in and let it go at that among themselves they jockeyed for position as they my had quick was just as glad not to be involved in the males squabbles reminded him of nothing so much as small boys squaring off to fight even perfectly healthy he would not have relished the prospect of getting t facetoface screaming match with a wild male not without his pistol handy at any rate but for al the shrieks and gestures for al the fury and teeth few tiffs actual y ended with the combatants punching and kicking and biting like a lot of smallboy fights most were games of bluff and counterbluff good for letting off steam but not ping the status of either participant through the winter martin stayed atop the hierarchy only was he in his physical prime but he also enjoyed dded prestige the success of quicks devices brought the band had fared well in what was usually a time ivation and the sims recognized that and gave credit fist did at any rate like humans some were unwilling do anything for which they were not responsible three or four males of middling to fairly high shin the hunting party began hanging around toer they had been the last ones to start using the bow if sims that was plenty to settle things martin would tun uli his back and swagger away satisfied he was still cock o the walk henry quick shared the big males exuberance but as to a point he could not help noticing that the members the hunting party who backed martin were nowhere near so closely knit as caesars followers caesar by himself was no match for martin caesar and several comrades probaij were rain came more and more often black patches of dirt began to appear the evergreens lost their white mantle while buds grew on branches bare for months quick the geese crying far overhead and on clear days saw vs of black specks flying north against the blue sky he wondered as he had once in a while through winter if anyone missed him back in the commonwealth trapping was a risky business and every year many tried it never came back if he did return to civilization he would be a nine days wonder was that reason enough make the trip he doubted it he also doubted whether he could finish his life among the sims even loving one for better or worse he and they were different unable to decide what to do he let day follow day hoping events would solve his problem for him he got strong with his stick he was not much slower or more awkward than an old man he could even hobble a couple of steps without it though his left leg had to take almost al of the weight with that success he began thinking hard about what travel would mean the idea of depending on archery to feed himself was appal ing his powderhorn was stil half full he had done his best to keep rifle and pistol dry through the winter greased them with animal fat and used dirt and gravel to scour away the rust that did appear he began substituting the rifle for his stick the extra weight t tired him but he managed he hated to burn powder and waste bullets on test shots but he would sooner find out whether his guns worked in practise where his life did not depend on the answer when he loaded them he pointed the pistol into the air big noise he signed warning the females youngsters in the clearing noisestick sol amplified the sims had learned the year that quick carried noisy weapons that could slay at tance few except the hunting males though had hem of course the trapper thought as he squeezed bigger they might not hear one now he felt pike cheering when the gun went off the recoil was easier to take than hed expected easier even than he rembered his arms had become very strong from bearing so much of his weight through his crutches sims shrieked some clapped hands to ears young ran to their mothers big noise was easier to say than erience even sol jumped though she recovered y noisestich good she signed good quick answered he fired the rifle it also worked and almost knocked him over the report was louder he pistol shot had been but the sims did not make such a fuss over it this time they knew what he was doing after he reloaded both guns if he did decide to leave they would make al the difference in the world the females and youngsters had a great deal to tell the when the hunting party returned hands fluttered in their excitement the sims hooted and yelled to add asis to their gestures after the commotion died down martin came over to quick he asked the same question sol had noise good the trapper agreed they were hunt with us the sim asked too slow not keep up martin rubbed his jaw he could not disagree with thank him at length he signed give me noisestick quick had expected something of the sort you not work stick he signed to make sure he was not lying he had surreptitiously removed the flints from his guns when the females were carrying on he did not sign why martin took the pistol away from him the sim knew what the trigger was for but only a click rewarded him when he pul ed it he tried the rifle with the same result growling in frustration he shoved them back at quick and stalked away the trapper made sure the sim was not looking before he restored the flints to their places the next morning most of the hunting party set of early as they usually did martin hung back he walked a and down examining the windbreak plainly trying decide whether it was time to turn it into firewood of caesar and two members of his clique also stayed behind as far as quick could see they were not doit anything in particular he practiced his walking limping along leaning his right side on his rifle and carrying his pistol in his left the morning was humid so his leg hurt more than usual when martin turned away from the windbreak and spotted the other males still in the clearing he shouting angrily at them go hunt he signed his gestures quick and peremptory he was still wearing the makeshift belly quick had made for him from a bootlace he yanked free the dagger waved it in the air quick expected caesar and his followers to go meekly at their way as they always had before they did not maybe they had planned it among themselves maybe they simply noticed they were three to martins one they held their ground and yelled back instantly pandemonium fil ed the clearing several males ran to martin and added their yells to his almost as many though backed caesar and his two comrades quick stood off to one side and wished his hands were free so he could cover his ears sol he thought would have favored martin but she was already off in the woods the two groups of sims still shrieking drew closer ton each other caesar perhaps given courage by the males at his back did not shrink as martin approached instead he decided to confront martin windmil ing his arms and yelling as loudly as his opponent the encounter was at a level too basic for either of them to bother with signs their responses were what counted now just the same the quarrel might have ended peaceably or with no more than pushes and shoves most incidents among sims did but when martin reached out to push him away he stil had the sharp steel dagger in his fisted a dripping line ran down the other sims chest caesar shrieked again a cry full of pain surprise and martin might have finished him at that moment but had stared for an instant as much taken aback as his foe at the blood running through caesars hair an instant was all marrtin got fast as a striking snake caesar bent down grabbed a branch and slammed it into the dominant males side then he sprang for martin they fel together biting gouging and kicking quick had not thought the din could get louder and he was wrong the sims gathered in a tight knot about the two battling males they were all screaming at the top of their lungs and beginning to struggle with one of caesars supporting males also had a knife he had a female aside almost pitching her into the fire anded over the two main combatants he slashed at one of them presumably martin an anguished bellow arose loud enough to be heard through the chaos all around qulick limped forward that martin had to fight for his rank was one thing that he should be beset by two at once thing else again the male was raising an arm to bring down the dagger again the trapper shifted his weight to his left foot that leg would have to bear most of fire a moment he used the stock of his rifle to knock the knife out of the sims hand then hit him in the temple with that second blow might have fel ed a man but sims had thicker skulls and thicker muscles over them the male shook his head spat blood he grabbed quick by the shoulders and threw him to the ground a lumberjack might have matched it but the sim was half foot shorter than quick the trapper landed heavily the rifle came out of his hand and bounced away pain flared in his ribs and in his bad leg thats what you get for sticking your nose in he thought blurrily but the male was not done with him the sim seized his rifle lifted it high and stamped toward him plainly intending to beat him to death quick still held on to his pistol he cocked it with desperate haste and fired he aimed for the sims chest the bal took the male in the bel y instead the noise of the shot shocked the sims into moment silence nothing else perhaps could have distracted the so effectively from their own quarrels leaning up on his elbow quick saw one of the two males around whom l bigger squabble had revolved also sitting up pushing at the inert body of his foe martin had won the fight blood was still flowing from a score of caesars wounds yet by the way he moved the victor was also badly hurt quick spared him hardly a glance though the traps horrified attention and that of all the sims in the clearing was drawn to the male he had shot quick had heard tales of the agony of gutshot men now he saw it first hand the sim rolled and thrashed hands clutched to the h above and to one side of its navel blood trickled between fingers soon more came from its anus when it emptied bladder a moment later that discharge too was red the sim shrieked and wailed several females came running from the woods the gunshot drew those who had not heard the sound of fight sol was the last of them her bulging belly made her move slowly quick was glad to see her and even glad she had not been in the clearing before he struggled to his feet his right leg groaned but he did not scream he had not rebroken it he picked up his rifle a hobbled over toward martin when sol came up to help him as she had so many times before he grateful y let her take some of his weight the other sims their eyes stil on the awful spectacle of the male he had shot stepped out of the way none of them signed to him none of them seemed to want to have anything to do with him pain twisted martins face his hairy hide was scraped in a dozen places to show raw bleeding flesh caesar had bitten half of one ear away martin was holding his ribs with one hand and had the other at the back of his left heel when the trapper saw that and saw how the sims left calf bunched but his foot was limp he had a sinking feeling that made him forget his bruises against all odds he had recovered from his own crippling injury at least enough to walk about martin never would not when he was hamstrung martin took his hands from his wounds signed fix leg eyes were ful of desperate appeal they held quicks seeing how martins thoughts paralleled his own only henry quick feel worse behind the trapper the male he had shot screamed on unceasing and dreadful not fix he had to sign sol stared at him in amazement fix she signed firmly sticks sticks fix your leg sticks fix his leg not fix the trapper repeated miserably his leg not hurt way how could he explain that the splints only held pieces of his shattered leg together while the bone mended but that you could splint a cut tendon from now till doomsday and it would never mend he could not not with limited handtalk sol knew and if he could she would not have believed him sticks sol signed and stepped away from him to get a couple at least she was doing something constructive the rest of the sims in the clearing wandered about dazed like men and women who had been through a train wreck quick could see why in the space of a few minutes the band had meet disaster two prime males were dead even if one would go on making horrid noises for hours the dominant male was at best crippled at worst if his wounds went he would join caesar and his fol ower the hunting party never more than a dozen strong to begin with would take years to recover worse quick knew the catastrophe would not have happened in the same way had he not become part of band the fight between martin and caesar without the sharp steel knife the tool hed got from the trapper would have remained one of the shoveandbluff contests typical with sims maybe caesar would have backed down maybe martin no one would have been much hurt either while the subhumans lacked a good part of the trappers reasoning ability they seemed to have reached the same conclusions he had though whatever the means they used to get there all through the winter they had treated quick like one of them now they drew apart from him he saw at once he was no longer one of the band being rejected by mere sims should not have hurt quick but it did the trappers fate had been too intimately tied with theirs for too long for him to be indifferent to their feeling about him that was especial y true in one case quicks gaze went to sol who was still busy putting a splint on martins leg better she signed when she was through martins breath hissed through clenched teeth he shrugged as if he did not want to say no but hurt too much to say yes quick knew he was not going to get better with or without the splint sol got to her feet awkwardly she patted her swollen belly in annoyance almost in reproach most of her attention though remained on martin at last she looked a caesari her eyes met the trappers she looked at him at the sim he had shot who was stil ululating piteously at martin and caesar whose skin was pierced in so many places it would have been worthless as a pelt when she glanced quicks way again it was with no more warmth than if she been looking at a stone that told him the last thing he needed to know if the sims had decided to tear him to pieces he could not have stopped them they ignored him instead perhaps they thought ostracism a worse punishment in their small band with each member knowing all the others so intimately that made some sense quick was never sure living like a sim he found at last could not make him think like a sim he loaded his pistol put his powderhorn ammunition which also held flint and steel a knife and a cup on his belt leaning on his rifle he took a couple of steps toward the edge of the clearing then turned to caesar it did not matter what the band did to him he could not save the wounded sim or have its shrieks pursuing him into the woods he aimed careful y shot the male in head reloaded again limped away the sims still did not stop him he looked back at sol a last time and at the child he would never see now the child that would live its life with its mothers band maybe that at least was for the best he told himself and it because of the social strictures in the commonwealths against such babies in the world of humans a half sim would always be at a disadvantage slower than its fellows but in the world of sims a man child might prove something of a prodigy and gain a place in the band higher than any it could look for the mountains quick not know that was so he could only hope the trees closed in behind him hiding the clearing from view henry quick knocked back wiskey with reverent pleasure he was wearing clothes left behind before he set out on his last trapping run hed been in civilization a month and regained some of the weight hed dropped in his slow painful journey east all the same his tunic and the breeches that l have been tight flopped on him as though meant for a lager man have another james cartwright urged the fur dealer had been generous with quick giving him a room in his own house and a place at his table quick knew he had an ulterior motive he did not mind even martin had had an ulterior motive the trapper caught a barmaids eye held up his glass the girl looked bored but finally nodded and off for a bottle she was blonde smoothskinned and quick could easily imagine sharing a bed with her afterward was something else again your health he said to the fur dealer when he had resupplied he drank again sighed contentedly now then henry cartwright said seeing that relaxation on the trappers face you really ought to tel me more about the clearing where your cache of furs is it would be worth a pretty pile of silver denaires i dare say so they would so they would quick admitted drunk or sober i have nothing to say to you about it you can test it if you like ill sponge up as much as yot to buy worse luck for you i believe it but laughing the dealer signaled for another round after it arrived he turned serious again henry i just cant fathom youre being so pigheaded its not as if you could get those pelts back for yourself moving the way you do you needed a special miracle to make the trip out once cant be thinking of going in again for them oh i can think about it quick said the urge to get away would never leave him but whenever he tried to even now he knew long journeys were really behind why then cartwright persisted the liquor had loosened quicks tongue enough for him to be willing to justify himself out loud because of the sims he said that band deserves to have men leave them alone instead of flooding in the way they would after they found my trail and took out my furs those sims took me in and saved me and theyve had enough grief for it theyre just sims henry cartwright said he knew the trappers story as much of it as quick had told anyone new about sol no one knew about the child no one ever would they were here first john quick said stubbornly not their fault theyre stupider than we are having to work fields and such is one thing we can make better use of good land than they ever could but let them keep the woods some of them ought to stay free maybe you wont want to go trapping after all cartwright observed you sound like youve got yourself a new aim in life quick hadnt thought of it in quite those terms he stroked his chin hed shaved his beard but wasnt yet used to it feeling smooth skin again at last he said maybe i do sims arent animals after al a hunter sitting at the next table turned round at his remark he grinned drunkenly youre right there pal they give better sport than any damned beasts he hooked his thumb under his necklace drawing quicks eye to it the necklace was strung with dried rather hairy ears it took four men to pry quicks hands from the fel ows neck freedom where can be no doubt that the labor of sims contribated greatly to the growth of the federated commonwealths of america as we have seen this was true in agriculture it was also the case in the huge factories of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries simple repetitive tasks proved to be within the capacity of the native subhumans their treatment at the dormitories next to these factories was all too often worse than any suffered by human workers who had both the wit and the political ability to combine to improve their conditons these workers alliances were early supporters of he sims justice movement if factory owners could use sims instead of people rewarding them with no more than what was frequently inadequate food and shelter then wages for all workers were depressed only the fact that humans greatly outnumbered sims prevented this problem from being even worse than it was the steady growth of technology however did as much to change conditions for sims as did political agitation farming grew increasingly mechanized and machines gradual y began taking over many of the simple factory jobs sims had formerly performed this transformation also affected humans of course but most succeeded in changing with the times and in finding new positions in emerging high technology industries this option was not open to sims even with improved technology the sims justice movement has continual y faced a serious problem sims while more than beasts manifestly are less than men and women defining a middle ground and an appropriate role for sims in modern society has never been easy the movement itself has fragmented several times over attempts to do so in recent years though the area of research has drawn attention from almost al factions of the sims justice movement because they are so like people in so many ways sims have since their discovery been used for experiments where humans could not in good conscience be employed sometimes this has resulted in glorious successes witness the sim abel who orbited the earth six months before the first man to do so sometimes as in the case of certain nineteenth century medical research conducted without benefit of anesthesia words cannot convey the horror suffered by sims and yet it cannot be denied that much good has accrued to humanity through the testing in sims of new surgical techniques and various methods of immunization whether this good outweighs the suffering that sims are intelligent enough to feel but not ful y to understand must in the end be decided by each person for him or herself society as a whole stil feels that it does research with sims under properly controlled conditions continues there remains though a vocal minority that cannot in its conscience justify what it perceives as abuse of intel igent creatures from the stories of the federated commonweald peter howard stepped to the podium with the strides of a man who did not believe in wasting anytime ever yes i have something to say his walk proclaimed il say it and get out and get back to work and once youve heard it you can do what you like with it televisionvision lights glared overhead flashbulbs from news or photographers made even the determined dr how blink repeatedly as soon as he reached the rostrum he turned on the microphone for quiet when he did not get it right away a frown made his long thin face longer he tapped again louder this time and said id like to start with a short statement if i could i dont want to spend more time here in philadelphia than i have to i want get down to terminus and back to work the reporters gradually quieted they still were not fast enough to suit howard who began when the room in the house of the popular assembly was still buzzing with talk i have some progress to report in our efforts to find a cure required for immune deficiency syndrome more commonly an as aids that got him silence but only a moments worth then buzz became a roar a whole new fusil ade of flashbulbs went off howard held up his hand as much to protect his eyes as to ask to be al owed to go on finally he could i do not yet have a cure he said setting off hysteria was the last thing he wanted to when reporters who had leaped to their feet sat down good howard thought having ridden an emotional roller coaster in two sentences maybe they would quite down now and listen hesaid as you know the hiv virus that causes aids attacks the bodys immune system specifically the white blood cells cal ed tlymphocytes without these cells to hit off infection the body becomes vulnerable to opportunity diseases it would otherwise repel eventually one of them proves fatal to the patient at the terminus disease research center we have created a drug we are cal ing an hiv inhibitor or hivi for short in the laboratory hivi seems to help prevent the virus from gaining a foothold in the bodys lcel s strengthens the effectiveness of the antibodies the immure system produces to fight aids let me show you what we have achieved he gestured in the direction from which he had come his hands shaping words almost everyone in the chamber fol owed as easily as speech out here now a sturdy male sim emerged to join him at the podium this is matzo howard said more flashbulbs popped matt lowered his head so they his heavy browridges protected his eyes from the bursts of intolerable light how do you feel matt howard asked he signed the words as he spoke them to make sure the sim would understand i feel good matt answered with his hands like almost al sims he found signtalk much easier than true speech matt feels good now howard said sadly six month ago he was much less well the doctor waved a hand and lights dimmed a large screen dropped into place behind him and matt howard waved again at the far end of thin hal a slide projector came on the hall grew truly quiet at last into that silenced howard said this was matt six months ago the sim on the slide was sadly different from the one who stood before the reporters in the flesh the federated commonwealths the world had seen too many cases of aids for them to mistake this one the image of the emaciated sim his once thick hair falling out in clumps all over his body was vivid and a dreadful il ustration of why in africa aids was simply called the slims howard went on two days after that picture was taken matt began receiving hivi today his tcells are nearly normal as are his immune responses he does not know he still has aids feel good matt signed again the reporters could not stand it anymore why isnt it a cure then one of them shouted because as i was about to say howard added pointy the aids virus is stil in matts bloodstream he can still transmit it to others other sims in his case i suppose in theory to humans as well through sexual relations if he stops receiving hivi injections the symptoms of course will return now he emphasized the word i will respond to questions the frantically waving hands reminded him of stormtossed treetops he chose one at random yes you in the row with the blue ruffled tunic how many sims have died of aids in the course of your experiments the man asked howard pursed his lips he had expected questions of that sort with the demonstrators marching outside the of the popular assembly he would have been an idiot but he had hoped not to have to deal with them so he should have listened to his colleagues down in terminus and planted a few people to ask the questions he wanted asked he had always been headstrong though he thought could deal with anything now hed have to the program to date has seen the expiration of twenty sims he answered steadily his luck was not all bad the reporter simply followed asking wouldnt it have been better to use shimpanses than sims in your research her than sims and men shimpanses are the only resident in which the aids virus will grow howard akknowledged but there are several objections to their use in aids research most obvious of course is the fact that most of them must be caught wild in africa and then shipped to the fca that makes the supply uncertain and wsive al the more so because of the growing instability in the african states as the aids epidemic debilitates in sims being native to america are easily available were are also other reasons for preferring them to shimpanses biologically sims are much closer to humans shimpanses are as we al know mixed births between sims and humans are perfectly possible the reporters muttered in distaste everyone knew that but it was something seldom mentioned outside of dirty jokes howard suspected there would be shocked gasps in living rooms al across the federated commonwealth talking about sex between people and sims was not standard television fare also of course the doctor finished sims have advantage of being able to report symptoms to us somthing of which shimpanses are incapable he pointed to another reporter yes isnt that part of the problem dr howard the she asked how do you feel about deliberately subjecting twentyeight intel igent creatures to the grim lingering death aids brings i had hoped some of you might perhaps be interested in the success or at least the partial success of hivi rather than in the failures that preceded it howard said i am drhoward the reporter said but thats not l question i asked howard scowled out at the audience but saw several nodding along with the reporter if some of these people had their way he thought with sudden hot anger that he did his best to conceal hed be lucky to be able to work shimpanses let alone sims he chose his words with care he had not come to philadelphia to antagonize the press i always regret the death of any ah creatures in the laboratory but particularly in the case of what is as you say a grim diseases as aids i feel justified in doing whatever i must to peoples lives but sims the reporter persisted howard cut him off are not people the law never regarded them as such they are different from animals true but they are also very different from us sims in my research project were purchased with an appriation from the senate for that express purpose everything i have done has been in accordance with all applicable regulations and that is all i have to say on that he looked toward another reporter yes what is it that makes hivi more effective against aids than er drugs howard nodded to her and smiled his thanks at last a sensable question were stil not entirely sure mistress ah reynolds mistress reynolds but we believe that the chief achievment has to do with the way hivi interacts with the cel s outer membranes and strengthens them making them more resistant to penetration by the aids virus hivi developed from round and round round and round ken dixon was sick of carrying his picket sign he also did not like half the greencoats that were gathering in front of the hall of popular assembly he could not read their faces not the mirrored visors on their helmets but their body language said they were going to break up the demonstration soon kil ing sims is murder he chanted hed been cal ing for a couple of hours now since before dr howards conference convened his throat felt sore and scratchy a man walking on the part of the sidewalk the demonstration wasnt using caught his eye not under the law its not he said he looked prosperous and wellfed nothing like a sim whod been given aids on purpose probably a lawyer himself dixon thought scornful y philly was lousy with them while the chant went on old the young man he broke it to say the law is g e probable lawyer fell into step beside him why he sims arent people if using them will help us rid ives of this terrible disease why shouldnt we dixon frowned at the planning meeting for this protest hed worried out loud that people would say just what this this jumped up fellow was saying that the threat of aids would let them justify the horror of the terminus labs hed been talked down then and now gave back the reasoning the rest of the steering committee had used against him howards aids research is just a fragment of what were talking about here if you al ow it you set a precedent fame al owing all the other cruelty that sims have suffered since people first came to america everything from working them to death on farms and in mines to hunting them and kil ing them for sport he screwed up his face to show what he thought of that kind of sport sims were here the plump man shrugged we use them to do the work we didnt care to do for ourselves stil do why not the mans question grated on dixon all over again he thought before he answered the fellow was not a fooll in the old days we needed them i admit im not saying what we did then was right far from it but it understandable it isnt anymore not with machines to do simwork and do it better easter and cheaper than sims youd send them al to the preserves then that would be the ideal solution dixon said seriously most of the people marching with him would given the plump man a yes at once three big tracks of land together they were as large as a fairsized commonwealth state one in the rockies one on the plains and one in the northwest woods gave wild sims and their way of life a last stronghold in the fca trouble was even a smal band of wild sims needed a large territory on which to forage there wasnt enough land to accommodate the subhumans who now lived in civilized country even assuming they wanted to trade modern lives for ones like those of their ancestors and in this notsoideal world the plump man asked all his raised eyebrow telling dixon he knew all the objections that had popped into the demonstrators mind as much freedom as they can handle dixon said he jerked his chin at the hall of the popular assembly at least freedom from being made into lab animals because theyre too much like us that eyebrow damn it climbed higher as much freedom as they can handle the plump man echoed i cant imagine a more dangerous gift for either the sims or the people who give it to them his eyes followed dixons stubborn chin to the portico of the hal someone was handing the greencoat chief a rolledup piece of paper the fellow resumed i would say for example that our esttemed constabulary has just been granted al the freedom they can handle yes dixon said unhappily he knew a writ when he the somebody on the committee had fouled up the side was supposed to keep the greencoats off peoples backs until the protest broke up by itself he turned to say that to the man whod been walking him the fellow wasnt there anymore dixon spotted him walking purposefully down the street in the direction hed been going before he fell in with the demonstration in the plump mans perspective that made good sense he was tempted to disappear himself the greencoat chief put a hailer to his mouth the static belched from it as he turned it on made everybody look ray who hadnt already one of his assistants ceremonously unrolled the writ hoh trouble melody porter said from in front of them theyd been in a lot of the same classes at the philadelphia collegium since they were both freshmen four years now he thought bemused theyd been to lots of demonstrations together too melody was even more strongly committed to justice for sims than he was she came by it honestly she was the greatgreatgrandaughter of henry quick the trapper whod really founded the sim justice movement kiln an altogether different vein dixon thought marching with her was one of the things that made protests while after a few more seconds of fumbling the boss greencoat got the hailer working his aide handed him the paper pro bono publico he intoned his amplified voice filling the square with formality dixon wonderes how many horrors had been perpetrated for the publi pro bono publico the greencoat repeated for the sake of the record and for the benefit of everyone this side a complete nervedead deafness then he got down to business a court has declared this rally a danger to public order those who do not disperse in the next five minute will be liable to arrest his blunt demand jerked the protesters out of thei chant people shouted back at the greencoat were peaceable why arent you cant stand to hear the truth eh and a cry that started a new chant justice for sims and for people tool even so dixon noticed that the marchers picket signs which had been steady began to jerk as if pelted by hailstones people were having second thought few were leaving though the officer with the hailer knew his job he kept the pressure on loudly announcing each minute as it went by the greencoats shook themselves out into a skirmish lin times up the chief announced the line moveed forward dixon took off his spectacles and stuck them in the hip pocket of his breeches sometimes these affairs stayed polite sometimes they didnt the world turned blurry a greencoat emerged out of the blur he was carrying a club his voice conversational matteroffact he ask dixon you going to take off kid before he answered he heard melody loudly say noto what had to be the same question that kil ed the few shreds of hesitation he had left no he said trying to i sound as firm as melody had the greencoat only shrugged i arrest you then constituting a danger to public order formal langu done he went on come along quietly sure al right then put down your sign you wont get extra trashstrewing charge on account of it dixon did he fit his spectacles back on the greencoat waited till he was done then gave him a light shove over that way me boyo he sounded more bored than anything else dixon thought a little resentfully justice for sims was too important to be handled as part of someones routine even with his spectacles dixon did not see what went wrong maybe a protester whacked a greencoat with a picket n maybe a greencoat thought one was going to and swung first maybe a greencoat swung first for the hell of it however it happened it happened fast what had been a peaceful process turned ugly all at once demonstrators swung greencoats and pushed them away when they tried to arrest them like the genie in the legend once violence was of the bottle it did not want to go back in she greencoat who was urging ken dixon along sudl y pushed him in the back hard he went down to his knees his careful y replaced spectacles flew off his nose he heard a crunch as a greencoat running toward the wing fight smashed them with his boot melody screamed as she got the same treatment he just got leave her alone he shouted he tried to get to his feet to go help her a club exploded against the side of his head he went down he tried to get up again but his legs didnt want to what he told them he had made it to al fours when a greencoat landed on him knocking him down again youre not going anywhere the greencoat bawled in his ear it was his greencoat he recognized the voice he was irrationally pleased he was able to recognize anything the greencoat yanked his arms out from under him his face in hit the pavement the greencoat jerked his arms behind his back clapped manacles on his wrists he had thought the roaring pain in his head left him immune to hurts the bite of the manacles metal teeth convinced otherwise in a hurry come on you stinking simlover the gleencoat muted he hauled dixon to his feet frogmarching him toward a constabulary motorcoach two more greencoats were waiting at the steps they grabbed him flung him inside he almost fel over somebody inside the motorcoach moment later somebody almost fell over him crawling with his hands locked behind him was almost lmpossible because he had to he managed to lurch his way up or one of the motorcoachs hard comfortless seats are you all right ken he hadnt even seen melody the seat in front of him concern in her voice she went on youre bleeding i suppose so he said vaguely he felt something warm and wet trickling down his cheek and jaw he leaned head against the barreinforced glass of the window then he looked at melody again above one ear blood matted her short sandy hair so are you i know despite the blow shed taken she stil had wits about her and she was furious the bastard groped me too when he was wrestling with me to get the manacle on i clawed him pretty good i think before he managed to good for you dixon leaned against the window again talking and thinking hurt someone sat down beside him he hardly noticed he was watching the greens finish off the demonstration protesters outnumbered constables but the contest was never in doubt the demonstratars hesitated before they fought and when they did it by ones and twos the greencoats did not hesitate at al and worked together a few demonstrators managed to get away most were seized and hauled off to the motorcoaches maybe its for the best melody said this way our side of the message is sure to reach the television tonight along with dr howards rationalizations maybe was al dixon could manage after a while the greencoats slammed the motorcoachs doors shut its engine roared to life it rattled through the streets of philadelpha toward the lockup the two sims separated matt lay back on the bed it was the one called jane dr howard saw when she turned her face toward the monitor camerashe stayed on hands and knees beside him after a surprisingly short time matts vigor returned he got behind her and fel to it dont they ever quite a technician asked pointing at creen a whole bank of monitors let the investigators at disease research center watch the sims they studied out disturbing them what else do they have to do howard asked they not likely to sit around reading books you know the technician laughed but persisted this is the third time theyve been at it today and its only he glanced at locket watch a little past two seward shrugged werent you ever a randy eighteenold thats what matt is or the equivalent sims age a faster than we do so hes probably about at his peak at fourteen and up until not so long ago he was deathly ill so i dare say hes making up for lost time too ok maybe the technician said howard walked we row of television screens to check on some of the sims at the drc the technician muttered under his breath no way i could have gone that hard even when i eighteen especial y if my girl was that ugly seward knew he was not supposed to hear but turned anyway jane looks as good to matt as the lead in as in love does to you thats his problem the technician retorted howard he had a picture of that particular blonde taped above jsk ilim glad he has his urge back the effectiveness of the hivi in returning him to health fnost the technician reminded him what im glad is that jane already carries the aids virus too because no matter how good matt feels hes still got the virus in his blood and he can still spread it right yes howard said reluctantly thats the main draw back to hivi at the moment it can let carriers transmit aids giving it to people who will pass it on in turn in some ways you know that strikes me as worse than no cure at al the technician said howard wished the man would shut up and let him get away he was putting his finger on just the problem that most worried the doctor luckily it had not occurred to any of the reporters in philadelphia or a triumphant conference might have turned embarrassing in a blurr who he was though howard could not sir or shove the comment aside he paused to pick his words with care it depends as far as checking the epidemic goes i suppose youre right but if my blood test had just come back positive id scream bloody murder if somebody said i couldnt have hivi i cant argue with you there the technician admitted and the doctor took advantage of the moment of agree a fresh batch of calc printouts was on his desk ana of the effectiveness of a variant of hivi at restoring immune system and protecting tcells the variant was good as the basic drug howard made a note to a begin writing up the new datum to somebody so it could get it in print negative information was information too some other lab would not have to waste time checking the new subtype it wouldnt be the sort of publication a news confrences accompanied though howard put his head in his hands he wished hed never called the bloody conference in the first place that riot exactly the word for it dozens of people had been hurt what turned into a riot outside the hall of the popular assembly censor bryan had cal ed for an investigation into the way the constabulary handled it and censor ken had promptly vetoed the cal it was the worst falling out the two chief executives had had in their term howard did not care about that politics meant nothing to him he cared very much about what hurt people that he known the protest outside would cause so many of fights he never would have gone to philadelphia he sat up straight no that wasnt true aids hurt more people than riots ever would the only way to fight it was with research research took denaires lots of them and the only way to latch on to them was by shouting every piece of press even one as ambiguous as hivi to the housetops the intercom buzzed he jumped and was glad no one was with him to see it mr tanaka is here to see you sir secretary said oh yes of course thank you doris send him in howard ran fingers through his thick brown hair joseph tanaka had no official standing but he had been friends of censor jennings since they were at middle school ether jenningss eyes the papers called him these days doris opened the door for tanaka howard rose to shake hand he had a strong grip and looked a few years younger in person than in photos he was of course exactly the censors age his sturdy middleaged features somehow went well with the conservative velvet jacket and maroon ruffled shirt he wore good of you to take time from your busy schedule dr howard tanakas voice was deep almost gravelly his manner straightforward a pleasure howard waved to a chair wont you sit sanaka did not i was hoping youd show me around in certainly straightforward indeed howard thought follow me then he gave tanaka a quick tour of the laboratories ending with the bank of screens that monitored the infected sims the technician fortunately had sense enough to keep his mouth shut when they were back in howards office tanaka did at iast take a seat most interesting he said steepling his fingers especially the sims quarters i must say you treat sims well certainly we do howard said for one example they eat the same food as our staff buys at the cafeteria we passed through tanaka gave a wry chuckle from what i know of cafeterias thats not necessarily a recommendation still l see your point you do well by the sims as i said already he turned serious again of course youve also given them aids mr tanaka howard said stifflythis research program operates under laws passed by the popular assembly with funds appropriated by the senate neither censor saw fit to affix his veto to the laws of the appropriation as you know i am conforming to them in every particular i do not doubt that for a moment dr howard what ive come to see is the result of that conforming after al though they are not human beings sims do have their own smal er measure of intelligence and they did not consent to be experimented on appalled howard burst out a sim cannot give informed consent thats a fundamental principle of lawns not quite what i meant tanaka said i doubt the sim is eager to die though of a disease they almost certanly would not have contracted in the normal course of their lives many people not usually supportive of the sim justice movement he paused to let howard make some uncomplimentary remark but the doctor stayed quiet shrugg i tanaka went on still have qualms at their being finfected with aids howard had dealt with officials for years and had no trouble translating what they said into what they ment tanaka was talking about votes the doctor took a moment to make sure his reply informed without antagonising they also have qualms mr tanaka about being ill themselves and two or three million of them have been those somewhere around a third maybe more as it goes by will actually develop aids and just about al those will die very unpleasantly the people who still have symptoms are just as able to pass it on through sex as ones who do more able because the ones without sims give me my best chance of fighting it in people how can i do anything but use them what would you do if there were no sims tanaka asked after thinking a few seconds himself the best l could howard answered muddle along shimpanses and a lot of in vitro work i suppose it wouldnt be the same i think youve seen that here a lot people would die while i and a lot of other reseachers using sims dont forget struggled to translate answers we eventually got into clinical terms we dont that problem with sims their biochemistry is almost identical to ours tanaka nodded and rose showing the meeting was done he stuck out his hand thank you very much dr youve been most interesting have l im glad what will you tell censor jennings tanaka blinked youre very forthright im concerned about my program sir reluctantly dr howard i have to say you neednt be i think the censor will be happy when i tell him that youve made your points well you also might have given me another answer to my question just now in which case i would have said something different to censor jennings honestly puzzled howard asked what might i have said when i asked what youd do without sims you might have suggested going on with human defectives the doctor felt his face freeze good day mr tanaka doris i am certain will show you out he sat down i understand your reaction dr howard as i said you i the test nicely the idea revolts me quite as much as you i assure you but i had to know good day howard repeated unmollified nodding he left howard was so filled with fury that he did not whether he had hurt the drc political y he did not think he had tanaka plainly felt as he did he was also he realized furious at himself and took a long while to figure out why when he did he wished he hadnt if there were no sims who could say what he might do to take a crack at aids and who could say whether he would be able to look at himself in a mirror afterwards he was not grateful to tanaka for showing him a part of himself he would sooner have left unseen he got very little work done the rest of the day the air waggon pulled slowly to a stop outside terminus when it was not moving anymore a steward opened the door ken dixon got his shoulder bag out from under his seat worked his way up the aisle thanks for breaking thee trail for me melody porter said from behind him my pleasure he said adding oaf a moment later al another passenger stuck an accidental elbow in his bel y he turned his head back toward melody youll forgive me it i omit the gallant bow this once she said graciously he snorted have a pleasant stay in terminus the steward said as dixon walked by and then again to melody they walked out of the air waggons cooled air and into the furious muggy heat of a terminus august afternoon whats the matter melody asked when dixon suddenly stopped halfway down the descent ladder in less polite voices passengers behind them asked the same thing sorry my spectacles just steamed up dixon took them off his nose peered at them in nearsighted wonder and stuck them in his hip pocket holding tightly to the rail hat went carefully down the rest of the ladder once down on the ground he was relieved to discover that the fog dissipated as his spectacles reached the same sweltering temperature as their surroundings he put theg back on when they went inside the cooled station building he let out a blissful sigh melody echoed him adding philadelphia summer is bad but this walking left him covered with a sweaty film he wiped his forehead with the back of his hand through the station buildings broad sweep of plate glass he and melody watched a human boss supervise the gang of sims that was loading baggage from the air waggon onto carts he shook his head the seventeenth century alive and well in the twentieth he said scornfully wel someone with an amused voice said at his elbow you sound like the chap im looking for look like him too the young man added he looked the way the philadelphia committee said he would a tal man with a good many blacks in his ancestry who wore a thick mustache youre patrick dixon asked as he had been told to do sorry no stephens the name the fel ow said they nodded at each other amateurs games dixon thought but good enough he hoped for the moment later later was another matter he put it aside here comes the luggage melody had been watching the sims tossing bags onto the conveyor belt they walked over to it stephen nudged dixon is she real y the one whos his greatgranddaughter he whispered not wanting her to hear greatgreat yeah whoa the respect in stephens voice and eyes was just this side of awe dixons lingering doubts cleared up no infiltrator could be that impressed over her ancestry he and melody had boarded the air waggon early their bags naturally were among the last ones out having been put aboared beneath everyone elses so much for efficiency melody sighed when she had hers dixons finally appeared couple of minutes after that come on stephen said he led them to an omnibus with peachtree street on the destination placard it roared off a little more than half full about ten minutes later it was dixon discovered thankful y cooled stephen rose from his seat at a stop on peachtree street in the midst of a neighborhood with many more apartment blocks than private houses dixon thought himself ready for the blast of heat that would greet him when he got off the omnibus and was almost right the collegium is over there stephen said pointing west dixon could see a couple of tal buildings over the tops of the apartments in this neighborhood no one will pay any attention to you everybody will figure youre just a couple of new students here for the start of fal term good melody said briskly she turned around trying to orient herself wheres the drc from here that way stephen gave her a respectful glance yes northwest of here maybe three or four miles she said again well be staying with you i gather until we get down to business thats right people float in and out of my cube all the time the landlords used to it as long as he gets paid on the first of every month and nobody screams too loud he doesnt care half the cubes in his block are like that stephen started walking down the street come on its this way following dixon asked how alert are they likely to be at the drc not very i hope since the word came down from philadelphia that this was going to happen terminus hasnt heard much from us about justice for sims weve been quiet just letting everybody relax and think weve forgotten what were for outstanding dixon said if they were alert either this wouldnt work at al or a lot of people might end up hurt on account of us which wouldnt do the cause any good not stephen agreed but we have made the two connections well need most one in the calc department the other in food services the calc department i can see but why food services stephen told him why he grinned melody laughed out loud stephen turned off the street lead them into an apartrnent block and up three flights of stairs by the time they got to the fourth floor dixon was sweating for reasons that had nothing to do with terminuss climate my armsll be as long as a shimpanses if i have to carry these bags one more flight he complained you dont were here stephen had his key out and opened the door to his cube here this will help he turned on the cooler nodding gratefully dixon set down his bags and shut the door behind him and melody the cube was not big the luggage dixon had dropped nd the two bedrolls on the floor effectively swallowed the living room a table covered with what looked like floor plans was shoved into one corner melody made a beeline for that dixon was content just to stand and rest for a minute stephen handed him a glass of iced coffee he gulped it down fast enough to make his sinuses hurt thanks he said squeezing his eyes shut to try to make the pain go away no problem stephens eyes traveled to the bedrolls he lowered his voice a little i dont know what kind of arangement the two of you have but im not here all the time dixon looked at melody who was engrossed in architectural drawings i dont quite know either he said also quietly i was sort of hoping this trip would let me find out like that eh al right like i said ill be gone a lot i expect youll have the chance to learn chance to learn what melody looked up from the floor plans beckoned come over here the two of you stephen just how much support can we count on from your people here if we can put folks in a couple of places at the same time we may actually bring this off if i read this right we can get in and out here pretty fast they bent over the plans together the night guards footsteps echoed down the quiet hal way except for him it was empty he was sleepy and bored he turned a corner gray light from the bank of monitors lit the corridor ahead the night technician was leaning back in his swivel chair reading a paperback he looked bored he too hello edward the guard said slow here tonight isnt it though lloyd the technician put the bookdown on his thigh open so he could keep his place place is like a morgue when the computers go haywire everybody packs it in and goes home early lloyd nodded not quite happily getting so no one can think anymore without the damn gadgets to help em he glanced at the screens thats something sims dont have to worry about just swive and sleep and eat edward agreed it could be worse then because he was a fairminded man he added a lot of times it is especially when the new drugs go thumbsdown aids like everyone else at the drc the guard made it a swear word hows he doing having beenfree of symptoms for eight months now on hivi matt was a being to conjure with in these halls everyone worried over him the technician perfectly understood lloyds concern hes fine just worn out from the females again good lloyd yawned til the hinge of his jaw cracked like a knuckle his eyes shifted from the monitors to a coffeepot on a hot plate i need another cup of that il join you edward got up and poured for both of them thanks the guard sipped he made a face give me some sugar will you its bitter tonight tastes like its been sitting in the pot for a week it is viler than usual isnt it the technician added cream and sugar to his own brew lloyd finished tossed his cup at a trash can under the coffeepot he missed muttered to himself and bent to pick up the cup then he ambled down the hal he yawned again even wider than before he glared back ward the technicians station the coffee hadnt done him uch good had its he put a hand on the wall of the corridor for some reason he did not feel very steady on his feet before he knew what was happening he found himself sliding to the tile floor he opened his mouth to call for help only a snore came out in front of the monitors the technician lol ed in his chair his head thrown back bonelessly the paperback lay under the swivel chairs wheels where it had fallen its cover was bent terminus night was as hot as terminus day with the added pleasure of mosquitoes crouched on the wide lawn outside the drc complex dixon was trying to keep his swearing to whispers as he slapped at bugs when do we go he asked the fourth time like a smal child impatient to set out one of the lighted windows in the big building went dark for a moment then lit again now melody said at last good luck to all of us people rose and ran forward their feet scuffling softly on the grass automatic doors hissed open leading into a passage that bent sharply out of sight from outside was a guard station a guard slept in the chair a cup of coffee d spil ed on the desk in front of him the fluorescent lights overhead made stephens teeth gleam whitely as he grinned food services he said also grinning dixon nodded and gave him a thumbsup we split here melody declared refusing to be distracted even for a moment stephen your group goes that way toward elevator b bring back as much hivi and syringes and needles as you can get your hands on right he and two other young men dashed away out of here in fifteen minutes or you get left behind melody called after them then she turned to dixon and the young woman with him whom they knew only as deli now we head up ourselves and get matt the elevators right across from the guard station went to the sim ward dixon thumbed the up button a door whooshed open the three raiders no liberators dixon thought crowded in he hit a moment before melody got it on the of panel the door closed acceleration pressed against the soles of his shoes the door opened again how convenient melody said as they tumbled out the bank of monitor screens was in the same position on floor as the guard station on ground floor the man in the chair in front of them was solidly out as the guard down below good the screens have room numbers on them the the one thing i wasnt sure of dixon said is that matt lets see melody said coming up beside him following his pointing finger yes thats him room i is it lets go no entry without authorized accompanist read a large sign above closed double doors dixon tried them they were locked figured as much he said he stepped aside al yours dee she didnt speak she never said much as far as dixon could tell she was a locksmith by trade though and carried a set of picks on her belt her motions were quick and sure in less than a minute she had the doors open come on she said they went quietly not wanting to disturb any of the sleeping sims but matt ib melody said stoped dee took a step toward the door but melody was therer trying it melody raised a hand in triumph like a cricket player after a century matt woke to the sound of the opening door his mouth fell open in surprise when he saw three strange humans coming in who he signed what henry quick was my greatgreatgrandfather said a voice hardly above a whisper her fingers echoed the words depressed or interested dixon shook his head in wonder he had lost track of how many times he had seen that reaction when melody said who she was somehow all sims everywhere knew that henry quick had been the first man to worked to give them justice that matt signed again why you here to make you free dixon said as melody had as the did who communicated with sims he repeated his in words with signtalk come with us do you want to spend the rest of your life cooped up in here matt shrugged food good females here feel good now not sick nixon scowled that wasnt the answer he was looking melody asked quietly do you want to be sick again you probably will if you stay here do you remember what is like when you were sick the question was not quite theoretical like very young children sims often let the past recede quickly but dixon thought that what matt had undergone was not something he would easily forget the sims nostrils flared in alarm his browridges his eyes went wide no he signed vermhemently shook his head he climbed off the bed i with you good dee said she turned and started down the hal ly and matt followed dixon came with them later after leaving a souvenir on the bed to give dr howard something to think about they hurried out through the double doors dee locked it again this time riding the elevator made dixon feel light it matt said again when they were in the lobby he lot the unconscious guard there signed not to be ats what he thought dixon said matt looked at i confusion never mind come on dadled out of the drc and ran toward one of the horselesses parked on the roadway close to the edge it was not strictly speaking a legal place to park but traffic regulations were not likely to be enforced in the wee small hours one of the horselesses sped off as it passed under a street lamp dixon saw it was crowded with people triumphflared in him they must have got the hivi and welt got matt the driver of the remaining horseless threw open the door across from him in melody signed to matt she dixon and dee came piling after the sim no sooner had dee slammed the door than the driver roared away from the dixon started to say something to the sim but before he could melody leaned over and kissed him for a long time when she finally let dixon go by some miracle he remembered what he had been about to tell matt free youre free at last that got him kissed again which was he though dizzily a long way from bad i free dr peter howard read it was the last word of the pamphlet on matts bed printed twice as big and black as any of the others in howards mouth it sounded obscene normal y among the most selfcontrolled of men he savagely crumpled the pamphlet and flung it to the floor the security officer who picked it up gave him a reproachful look there might have been useful evidence there doctor oh shut up howard snarled where the hell were you people when this sim was stolen asleep on the job thats where the guards were drugged dr howard the securitying man corrected stiffly our investigation into that part the affair is just beginning wonderful howard turned away slowly clumsily he made his way down the hal getting out of the way of other people seemed more trouble than it was worth its as if i were one of the walking wounded he thought then realized a moment later i am he used the flat broad expanse of walnut as a fortress wall to hold the outside world outside in a bigger sense he had used the whole drc the same way well the outside world had unfaded with a vengeance and with such stupidity he thought filled with rage that was al the more consuming for having no outlet he had only skimmed the pamphlet the thieves left behind to explain their handiwork but he had seen and heard the phrases there often enough over the years his fists clenched till nails bit into flesh at the pain he opened them again no matter how furious he was he stayed careful about his hands but it was not was not was not his fault that sims were as they were in earlier days he knew people had thought other races of people to be inferior breeds sims did that much at least to stop mans inhumanity to man by showing what an inferior breed was like a security man stuck his head into the office breaking howards chain of thought outside greencoats are here to l see you sir he said send them in howard sighed normal y terminuss regular constabulary stayed away from the drc normally howard thought he would not get to use that word again any time soon no sooner had the greencoat actually the fellow was in ordinary clothes blue breeches and a yellow tunic come in than the phone chimed excuse me howard said thinking everything happens at once the greencoat nodded howard picked up the phone an excited voice said in his ear this is butler at the terminus constitution ive had a report that a sim with aids has been taken out of the disease research center hello is that you dr howard are you there lm here howard said no point in breaking the conection like the greencoat in his office this butler was only the first of many matt was confused dealing with people often left him feeling that way but he had lived in his old home in the tower for a long time and mostly knew what to expect with these new people he had no idea what was coming next shaking his head he got out of bed the third new strange not quite comfortable bed hed had in as many nights and used the toilet he had to strain to make the urine go through his penis which was stiff with a morning erection stiffer than usual even he missed the females with whom hed been living he flushed the toilet sat down on it to comb his red brown hair that was another reason he missed the females there was a big patch on his back that he could not reach in the towers sims by twos and threes would speed a lot of time combing each other all over it was something to do he sniffed and felt his broad nostrils expand with pleasure breakfast was cooking sausages today from the smell he liked sausages he went out to the kitchen the man and woman who had taken him from the tower were there along with the strange man and woman whose house this was they we al drinking coffee they looked up as he came in good morning he signed good morning the people replied with mouths a hands help yourself added the woman who lived here emily was her name matt remembered he nodded his thanks along with the sausages were sweet rolls and slices of apple he fil ed his plate took a glass of water he did not care for coffee behind him emilys mate isaac whistled and said certainly nothing wrong with his appetite now weve noticed that replied ken one of the ones who had taken him away hope it wont put you to too much trouble dont worry isaac said matt sat down at the table and started to eat were proud to help keep him out of the drc folks and taking him was a grand gesture but do you know what youll do with him in the end we were thinking of getting him to one of the preserves and setting him loose there ken said but his voice wailed away with the aids virus still in him we cant do that melody finished for him not without spreading aids among the wild sims people often talked around sims as if they could not understand spoken words because they could not say them watt put down his fork so he could sign feel good we know you do matt melody said gently touching his hand for a moment with her small hairless one but no matter how good you feel you arent well the sickness is inside you she and ken had said that before it made no sense to matt if he did not feel sick how could he be sick feel good he repeated he watched the humans roll their eyes and shrug he shrugged too theres another problem ken added hell feel well only as long as we have hivi for him he looked down at his hands maybe we should have thought a little longer about that for his sake we did the best we could melody said hes out now they cant do any more experimenting on him hes free for as long as we can keep him that way matt had heard almost identical talk every day since he left the towers it was about him he knew but it did not fil to connect to him then isaac said something new i dont think we can keep him free we can keep him away from the doctors sure but only he can make himself free dixon scowled melody rose abruptly from the table iii be taking off soon i think even matt who did not use speech himself could hear the anger in her voice he ate another sausage free was one of the many words they used that gave him trouble ideas like bread or cat or green or jump or sideways were easy enough to deal with he could even count though sometimes he had trouble remembering which number went with how many things or whether he had attached a number to each of the things in the group he happened to be counting but he could not eat free or see it or do it the closest he could come to it in his own mind was do whatever i want right now he was ful and felt well he wouldnt have minded coupling but ken and melody had taken him away to from his females and he found human women ugly still he was reasonably content did that make him free he didnt know come on matt melody said we have to get moving weve imposed on these good people quite enough thats obvious she walked out of the kitchen dont take it that way melody emily said isaac just never mind ken said before anyone else could talk you put us up for the night and were grateful we all share wanting to make things better for sims and thats enough isnt it nobody said anything matt wondered what the answer to the question was in the towers people had wanted answers to questions all the time and were upset when they didnt get them but ken and melody and isaac and emily were just leaving this one lying around matt shook his head at the vagaries of people melody came back wearing rubber gloves and carrying razor and a syringe give me your arm matt she said not need he protested feel good he had said the same thing back in the towers and the same success with it none give me your arm melody repeated you want to keep feeling good dont you he nodded resignedly and held out his right arm the hair on its underside had been shaved a few days before he left the tower but it was growing in again the razor scraped it away leaving a long narrow stretch of pinkish skin exposed now melody could see exactly where to put the needle matts lips skinned back from his teeth in a grimace of pain the people in the towers were much better at using syringe they hardly hurt him at all finally the ordeal ras done melody left the syringe on the table boil it or put it in a glass ful of bleach before you throw it away she said to emily and isaac make sure you get rid of that virus not sick nothing wrong matt signed adding a moment latter but arm hurts were glad you feel all right melody said smiling in a waythat made her seem more appealing to matt than she had before but the virus is still in your blood we dont want to take any risk of its spreading matt sighed the people in the tower had talked that way to but it made no sense to him blood is blood he signed never mind ken said again lets get going matt accompanied him and melody out to the horseless out front of emilys and isaacs house isaac stayed behind emily waved from the porch the morning sun glinted off a gold front tooth ken started the horseless he and melody shared the front seat matt had the back to himself springfield ken asked as he pulled out into traffic springfield melody agreed ive got the town map here we wont need that for a few hours he said all i need worry about now is finding my way to via lxvi eastbound matt listened to the two people with half an ear at best he watched houses trees open spaces go by that wasnt very interesting either hed done too much of it already the last few days after a while one house one tree one open space looked like another if anything could be more boring for him than traveling in a horseless he had no idea what it was his eyes tried to glaze but even that was denied him it was too early in the day for him to fall asleep he played with his fingers for a bit that soon palled he started to stroke himself then stopped for some reason he knew people did not like anyone doing that out in the open he started to sing instead his song had no words tongue and lips could not shape them but the hoots a grunts he let out in their place had rhythm of a sort rhythm he made plainer by pounding on his thighs withe palm of his hands his head bobbed happily as far he was concerned it was a fine song he was the only one who thought so before very long ken burst out wil you please stop that infernal racket matt subsided he was used to obeying people but he was not pleased about it this time he held up his hands so they could see them in the mirror like my song he signed grumpily is that what you call it ken said i dont matt held up his hands again not free to sing he asked not freed ken almost drove off the road watch where you going melody exclaimed whats the matter with you ken told her what the matter was she laughed and laughed she turned round in her seat so she could sign with matt as well as speak to him sing all you like he opened his mouth to begin again then paused why laugh he asked because because melody stopped finally because we do want to help sims be free but it surprised us to have a sim you use the word to us matt made an uncertain noise deep in his throat it didnt seem very funny to him he gave up and started sing again ken made a noise remarkably similar to his but he didnt say anything they got to springfield before noon ken drove around while trying to find the next safe house fancier part town than i expected he observed the house was biger than the ones where they had stayed before and the yard had a fence around it but matt who was used to the immence size of the towers remained ummpressed if a day in a horseless was the way to freedom he was beginning to doubt that he wanted any part of it his boredom fell away as he walked through the front a female sim of about his own age was on her hands knees in front of the house weeding in a flower bed wa he said enthusiastically she female looked over her shoulder and smiled at him hoo she said back her backside twitched a little uhoh ken and melody said at the same time matt paid little attention to them something else was on his mind a plump middleaged man came out on the front porch he house hello my friends he said im glad to see you im saul rhoda is on the phone but shell be out in a moment im sure glad to see you saul ken nodded toward the female and who is this lucy saul frowned then he looked from her to matt matt saw that saul was not looking at his face he looked down at himself his enthusiasm was quite visible oh saul said i see yes ken said he did not sound happy wel saul said and let that hang for a while before ming as if with happy inspiration lets go inside and uncle after that we can see what comes up he looked last again and broke into a laugh that sounded any thing but cheerful the prospect of food was almost enough to divert matt i lucy he went with ken and melody to join saul with only a brief sideways glance at the female sim lucy put down the trowel she had been using and started to follow everyone else in matt felt a smile spread over his food a female maybe this was what ken and melody ment by freedom he had had this much back in the tower outside at least no one did hurtful things to him save the injection each morning hed had that before too with much else none of it pleasant getting away from those prodings pokings and stickmgs made even long stretches of riding in a horseless seem not too bad but then he heard saul say lucy why dont you stay outside and finish what youre doing rhoda will bring something soon im sure matt let out an indignant grunt and sent a look to ken and melody he was surprised and dismayed when they agreed with saul come on matt ken said lunch first wel worry about everything else later sulkily lucy went back to work before she did thou she gave matt a glance full of promise from beneath browridges he let himself be steered into the house but all he noticed about lunch was that there was a lot of it ended up not being hungry anymore but with no idea what hed eaten after a while lucy did come in to use the toilet before she could get into the same room as matt rhoda found something for her to do out in the back yard again ken and melody failed to interfere matt glowered at them this did not strike him as anything like freedom finally he had waited as long as he could he got up and started toward the back of the house the toilet is through that door ken said sharply matt snorted not want toilet he signed want h forearm pumped graphically no all the people in the room spoke together the flat refusal brought matt up short and also madehim angry yes he signed nodding so vigorously that his long chinless jaw thumped against his chest want couple not couple since leave tower want to you couple yes he pointed at saul and rhoda rhoda was even rounder than her husband she turned pink at the question but answered yes of course we do saul nodded matt turned to ken and melody you you couple yes they both turned pink and looked away from each othf for a moment yes we do ken admitted at last he still did not look at melody until she reached out and took him hand in hers matt signed i couple too he headed for the back door again no everyone said again now he stared at them in disbelief not free to couple he signed not free that had worked just this morning he was sure it would again but it failed no matt melody told him im sorry but youre not free to couple not free matt signed wondering if he had heard carectly why not free when his hands had finished signing they curled themselves into fists he saw melody and everyone else look alarmed at that sims were stronger than people their fear did not stop them from arguing with him though ken said you cant couple with lucy because you have the aids virus in you if you couple with her youll give her the same sickness you have not sick matt protested feel fine feel fine long time now you give medicine hurt arm so l feel fine yes you feel fine yes melody said but what makes you sick is stil in you and can go out when you couple and weve no medicine for lucy im sorry matt she spread her hands in a gesture sims and people shared matt only shook his head in reply what she said made no sense to him if he felt well how could he have anything inside him that made him sick and when he mated the oniy thing that came out of him was jism jism was just jism how could it make a female sick a besides in tower he signed couple with many females they not sick now why this female here get sick if they not now he grinned pleased at his own cleverness it was bigger mental effort than he usually made the people seemed to understand that too ken rolled his eyes something else that was not part of signtalk but that matt understood and said to no one in particular just at we need a sim who cites precedent on us that matt did not follow he did not waste time on it in any case for melody was saying to him the female sims the tower had the aids virus in them like you they already il the same way you are they not ill they feel fine matt signed feel good his hips moved involuntarily as he remembered how good the females back at the tower had felt he wanted that feeling again but as melody still would not let him go matt she persisted those females in the tower were getting medicine too just like you werent they yes and they feel fine matt answered this is getting us nowhere saul broke in if youre thinking of letting him couple with lucy you two rhoda and i will have to ask you to leave we never would have come here if wed known you had a female sim ken said they glared at each other hoping he was forgotten matt started toward the back of the housed again wait melody said resentful y he turned back he was tired of her trying to tell him things that obviously werent so what she said though did not look to have anything to do with his lust for lucy you remember that im henry quicks greatgreatgranddaughter dont you matt he nodded that was one reason and a big one why hal gone along when she and ken and dee came bursting into his room in the tower no one connected with henry quick a could mean harm to a sim he was sure of that then please believe me in henry quicks name when i tel you that you shouldnt couple with lucy or with other female sim out here melody said earnestly please matt he looked away from her he did not think she was lying he wished he did not understand he signed she sighed i know matt will you do as i ask anyhow yes he signed giving up with more than a twinged regret this lucy was quite a desirable female handjobs al right he asked is that sarcasm saul asked hush melody said of course not she turned back to matt yes of course using your hand is all right you wil go into another room first matt went thinking grumpily that people from outside the towers even if they were related to henry quick explained about every little thing then he thought of lucy again and the heat of that thought drove from his mind any worries about people that evening dixon sat up on the guestroom bed he shared with melody poor miserable bastard he said as he peeled off the rubber he was wearing i wonder if i if should have offered him one of these that never occurred to me melody sat languor afterward was not her style she looked again do you think he could have used one dixon had been half joking or more than half he gave it some serious thought and regretfully shook his head i doubt it i massacred a fair number of them learning how and i suspect he wouldnt care if he tore one putting it on sims arent careful over details like that no they arent melody admitted adding a lot of people arent either i suppose not dixon said but if a man didnt like a rubber he probably wouldnt take it off halfway through and go on without it im afraid matt might thats the other reason i didnt think i ought to try to give him one iii tell you why i like rubbers melody waited for dixon to let out a questioning grunt then she said because with them you have to go clean up harumph in almost high dudgeon he did just that when he carne back to the bed melody was wearing a tshirt and a serious expression ken why did you get into the sim justice movement in the first place what brought that on he asked blinking as he sat down beside her i dont know rather to his relief she did not meet his eyes but she did go on even so i suppose its just that seem to keep emphasizing the ways sims are different from people and less than people not the ways were the same melody they are different from us he said as gentle as he could her mouth went wide and thin a sure dam sign all the same he continued no matter how much you want justice for sims that doesnt mean youll ever see one elected censor or even see one learn to read ive known people not you he added hastily who sometimes seem to forget that i dont think you answered me everything you sounds as though it ought to put you on the other side now she did look at him in the same way she might at a roach on her salad plate oh for heavens sake he said in some exasperation doesnt my being here count for anything look as far as i can see we have a responsibility to sims just because arent as smart as we are and cant stand against us wit people on their side thats always been true i suppose its especially true now that we have machines to drudge us instead of sims we dont need to exploit them al and we shouldnt all rights do i pass can we go to sleep she seemed taken aback at his vehemence and needed as moment to col ect herself and nod all right she said as he and turned out the light good he lay down beside her his outbursts startled him a little too he thought about what hed said he believed all of it that was not the problem the problem he eventually realized was that he not given melody al his reasons one of them was the hope of being just where he was now in bed with her would he have worked for sims justice without hope he looked inside himself and decided he would appeased his conscience and let him slide toward sleep more time on the road was coming tomorrow doris dumped the mornings pile of mail on dr howards desk then went back to her own station outside howard went quickly through the stack dividing it he had to deal with now things that could wait and things that could go straight into the trash the wastebasket gave a resounding metal ic clunk as he got rid of the stack an instapicture of a sim fel out of an envelope as he opened it swearing the doctor pulled out the that accompanied the photo the lead line shouted matt is still free howard jabbed the intercom button with his thumb doris came on he growled fetch me coleman i just got another one yes dr howard while he waited for the security chief to get there he read through the sheet it was much like the others that had to the drc and the copies that had gone to televietlets and papers all across the federated commonwealth whoever had matt knew how to keep reminding the country about it some of the phrases were ones he had seen before no longer a victim of experimentation freed from certain death in the laboratory howards lips quirked sourly that last was an outandout lie he knew it and he expected that the people who had stolen knew it too he hoped they did the intercom buzzed coleman came in without waiting to go through the formalities he and howard had been seeing a lot of each other lately coleman was in his forties with red hair going white at the temples his movments were quick and jerky as if he had abundant energy seeking some kind any kind of outlet he fairly snatched the picture and sheet out of howards hands then made a grab for the envelope still sitting on the is desk posted in philadelphia he noted adding iater different printer from the one for the text probably came to somebody who sent it on to us makes it hard to trace impossible would seem a better word howard said he hoped to get a rise out of the security officer he was disappointed all coleman did was nod nothing we do with it he said gloomily ill pass it on to terminus greencoats but no reason to think theyll anymore on it than on any of the others meanwhile of course all the commentators and refers in the country go right on giving it to us howard growled nothing i can do about that coleman said long as these folks care to theyll feed the newsies whatever they want oh get the hell out of here the doctor shouted at him unruffled coleman took the photo the sheet of paper the envelope and left the door closed softly behind him howard stared down at his hands ashamed of his an outburst matt had been gone more than a month now no one was having any luck tracking him down no even knew what part of the commonwealth he was in the fcas just too big had too many people and sims to make finding ones who did not want to be found easy the doctor was also aware that coleman had not been quite right howard knew to the hundredth of a cubic millilitre how much hivi the thieves had stolen he knew almost the day how long that hivi would hold off the aids in matt he also knew what would happen when the hivi s gone for matts sake he hoped the people who had him do too the coughing from the next room went on and on and ken dixon looked at melody who was looking at the door worry had drawn her mouth down put two deep lit between her eyes and other fainter ones on her forehead she looked he thought the way she would when she was forty it was not the kind of thought he usually had the endless cough though left him with mortality on his mind the antibiotic isnt helping much he said in fact it wasnt helping at all he and melody both knew that although she had not yet admitted it out loud then she did saying no in a low voice its probably not a bacterial pneumonia then he said probably its the one caused by protozoans yes melody said as low as before which means matts immune system is going south or he never would have come down with it dixon said he wished melody would make things easier by staying with the chain of logic but after her two oneword statements she went back to moodily staring at the bedroom he would have to say it himself then which means the aids virus is loose in him again yes melody said whispered really as quietly as silk spoken she began to cry dixon did not realize it until he saw tear tracks glistening on her cheeks oh ken she said and then sobbed out loud for the first time we tried so hard i know oh how i know his voice was heavy he wouid have lightened it but could not he was tasting it now for the first time in his life the young think answers come easily as if by right that the world shapes itself at the bidding of their will one by one generation by generation they learn how smal a part of truth that is the world shapes them far more than they it then melody said what are we going to do he knew he had to answer knowing hurt worse than staying quiet would have he said were going to give matt back to the drc what she stared at him thats the only place he can get more hivi and if he doesnt get it he wont go on too long if this round of pemmonia doesnt finish him the next one will or some other infection he wont be able to fight off and we cant help him come on melody is it so or not she said grimly aids was not a quick or easy way to die too many thousands of deaths had left everyone knowing that but theyll only go on using him as a lab specimen a live one dixon broke in at least for a while and with the hivi he feels al right for as long as its effective however long that is melody was still fighting it longer than he has with us she flinched the cause if you think that cause is worth more than what happens to one sim in particular how are you any different from dr howard thats a low blow ken but she did not give him a direct reply for some time she did not give him anything at al she finally said lets see what matt has to say about it if he wants to go back oh shit it was not i concession but dixon knew it was as much as he would get they went to the closed door melody usually impetuous stayed behind dixon as if to say this was not her place he opened the door they both frowned at the sickroom smel that met them matt lay on his back on the bed he lifted his head a couple of inches when they came in then let it fal back the pil ow as though the effort of holding it up was top much for him for the moment though he was breathing well he had lost weight but had no appetite a bowl of food almost full stood untouched on the nightstand his eyes were the only live things in his thin face he looked dab thought like a camp survivor from the russoprussian war dixon knew the comparison was a cliche nontheless it fit all too well once inside the bedroom melody took the lead dixons idea might have been her own once she was with matt youve stopped coughing she said quietly are you feeling any better so tired the sim signed so tired his arms flopped down on the mattress as soon as he was done using them then one of them came up again medicine he signed medicine that helps im sorry matt we have none and dont know where to get any melody said dixon winced at matts shrug of resignation melody went on they do have that kind of medicine at the towers matt if you want to go back she held her voice steady home matt signed which only made dixon feel worse he had not thought he could the sims somber face brightened medicine back home he tried to sit up eventual y succeeded though it set off another spasm of coughing this one fortunately brief females too yes he i with a sidelong look at dixon and melody tired of hand that set melody laughing so hard she had trouble stoping finally at dixons quizzical look she explained read in my greatgreatgrandfathers diary that the only reason he ever came home from a trapping run was that he got tiered of his hand dixon laughed too a little before turning serious pin matt seems to have made his choice that brought her up short after a moment she gave a reluctant nod then went on now we have to figure out how to give him back without giving ourselves away to the greencoats the intercom buzzed yes doris dr howard said its for you sir his secretary said wont give a name wont speak to anyone but you he says its about matt put him on howard said wearily hed had enough crank cal s since matt was taken to last him a lifetime but there was always the off chance he picked up the phone yes this is dr peter howard go ahead the man on the other end of the line sounded young and cautious but what he said made howard sit straighter in his chair how do i know your not a fake if i were a fake would i have any way of knowing last three pamphlets you got were red green and white order the doctor said exitment rising in his voice i dont believe you would this is about matt you say where is he is he well is he alive the stolen hivi should have been used up some time ago after it was gone anything might have happened no hes not very well but he is alive the caller as a matter of fact hes sitting on a bench on the corner peachtree and sherman waiting for somebody to come pick him up were giving him back to you if that was true relief left howard limp thank you he whispered youre anything but welcome the young man bitterly you made him sick but youre the only one who can slow down the aids in him now so we dont have any choice but to give him back i wish we did people will be better because of what weve done to him howard said wil matt he didnt get a choice you had him some little while yourself did you let him make all his own choices the silence at the other end of the connection answered that for howard you cant with a sim can you the doctor said believe me i know that go to hell the young man said im breaking this call off now youre probably tracking this call the connecting went blank thank you for giving him back anyhow howard to the dead line then he gathered himself and rang coleman he was not surprised to find that the so chief had already given orders for picking up matt going after the caller howard found himself hoping the young man got away that did surprise him its no good ken melody said they were sitting slide side at the edge of the hotel bed but he had know before she spoke that they would not be making love tonight the way shed sat stiffly not looking at him in the passenger seat of the horseless as he drove away from the drc had been plenty to tell him that now she went on after today in fact wed probably be better travel separately why he said down deep he knew why though admitting it to himself by continuing you agreed we had to take matt back i know i did it was the only thing we could do and i did i dont see how il ever do anything but hate it and being with you just keeps reminding me of it sorry the rewards of being right he said it earned him a glare call it whatever you like but stay together and i think ill end up hating you too id rather break clean now however you like he said tonelessly he suspected she would end up hating him anyway convincing herself that everything that had gone wrong was his fault it was too late for him to do anything about that he and melody slept with their backs to each other the space of mattress between them might as well have i chasm the iv that slowly dripped into matts arm after a while gave him a familiar pain he slept again on a familiar bed in a familiar room his breakfast came on a familiar tray at a familiar time after so much strangeness all that was reassuring aside from the temporary nuisance of the iv he felt better the towers had the medicines to cure the sicknesses he had come down with on his travels and the special medicine to help keep him from falling sick so easily again he had females once more when he felt well enough for them that was good after doing so long without when couplings were done they would ask him in signtalk about his adventures on the outside he answered as best he could they were curious and it helped pass the time in horseless like on television he would sign and to himself that never failed to draw awed murmurs of excited hoos from whatever female he was with better than here here everything the same al the time l torn he shrugged and yawned baring his large yellow teeth after while going in homeless same al the time too he answered full of the ennui of the experienced traveler is one afternoon the female cal ed jane asked why take you from here people want to help make sims free he signed people want to make me free hoo jane said softly you go outside tower you free matt thought that over no matter how often ken and melody had used the word he stil could not quite get what they meant by it not sure he signed then slowly shook his head no not free people outside like people here say they let sims do what sims want but real y only let us do what sims want when they want that too ah jane said and nodded she understood that perfectly after a while they coupled again then a nurse came to take matt away more needles he signed the nurse nodded he sighed and went with her the afternoon moved on to twilight
