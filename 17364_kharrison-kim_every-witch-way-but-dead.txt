every which way but dead kim harrison to the guy who gave me my first pair of handcuffs thanks for being there id like to thank the people closest to me for their understanding while i muddled through all this but most importantly id like to thank my agent richard curtiswho saw the possibilities before i knew they existed and my editor diana gillwho guided those possibilities and brought them to life one i took a deep breath to settle myself jerking the cuff of my gloves up to cover the bare patch of skin at my wrist my fingers were numb through the fleece as i moved my nexttolargest spell pot to sit beside a small chipped tombstone being careful to not let the transfer media spill it was cold and my breath steamed in the light of the cheap white candle i had bought on sale last week spilling a bit of wax i stuck the taper to the top of the grave marker my stomach knotted as i fixed my attention on the growing haze at the horizon scarcely discernable from the surrounding city lights the moon would be up soon being just past full and waning not a good time to be summoning demons but it would be coming anyway if i didnt call it id rather meet algaliarept on my own termsbefore midnight i grimaced glancing at the brightly lit church behind me where ivy and i lived ivy was running errands not even aware i had made a deal with a demon much less that it was time to pay for its services i suppose i could be doing this inside where it was warm in my beautiful kitchen with my spelling supplies and all the modern comforts but calling demons in the middle of a graveyard had a perverse rightness to it even with the snow and cold and i wanted to meet it here so ivy wouldnt have to spend tomorrow cleaning blood off the ceiling whether it would be demon blood or my own was a question i hoped i wouldnt have to answer i wouldnt allow myself to be pulled into the everafter to be algaliarepts familiar i couldnt i had cut it once and made it bleed if it could bleed it could die god help me survive this help me find a way to make something good here the fabric of my coat rasped as i clutched my arms about myself and used my boot to awkwardly scrape a circle of six inches of crusty snow off the clayred cement slab where i had seen a large circle etched out the roomsized rectangular block of stone was a substantial marker as to where gods grace stopped and chaos took over the previous clergy had laid it down over the adulterated spot of once hallowed ground either to be sure no one else was put to rest there accidentally or to fix the elaborate halfkneeling battleweary angel it encompassed into the ground the name on the massive tombstone had been chiseled off leaving only the dates whomever it was had died in at the age of twentyfour i hoped it wasnt an omen cementing someone into the ground to keep him or her from rising again sometimes workedand sometimes it didntbut in any case the area wasnt sanctified anymore and since it was surrounded by ground that was still consecrated it made a good spot to summon a demon if worse came to worst i could always duck onto sanctified ground and be safe until the sun rose and algaliarept was pulled back into the everafter my fingers were shaking as i took from my coat pocket a white silk pouch of salt that i had scraped out of my twentyfivepound bag the amount was excessive but i wanted a solid circle and some of the salt would be diluted as it melted the snow i glanced at the sky to estimate where north was finding a mark on the etched circle right where i thought it should be that someone had used this circle to summon demons before didnt instill me with any confidence it wasnt illegal or immoral to summon demons just really really stupid i made a slow clockwise path from north my footprints paralleling the outside track of the salt as i laid it down enclosing the angel monolith along with most of the blasphemed ground the circle would be a good fifteen feet across a rather large enclosure which generally took at least three witches to make and hold but i was good enough to channel that much ley line force alone which now that i thought about it might be why the demon was so interested in snagging me as its newest familiar tonight id find out if my carefully worded verbal contract made three months ago would keep me alive and on the right side of the ley lines i had agreed to be algaliarepts familiar voluntarily if it testified against piscary the catch being that i got to keep my soul the trial had officially ended two hours after sunset tonight sealing the demons end of the bargain and making my end enforceable that the undead vampire who controlled most of cincinnatis underworld had been sentenced to five centuries for the murders of the citys best ley line witches hardly seemed important now especially when i was betting his lawyers would get him out in a measly one right now the question on everyones mind on both sides of the law was whether kisten his former scion would be able to hold everything together until the undead vampire got out because ivy wasnt going to do it scion or no if i managed to get through this night alive and with my soul intact id start worrying about me a little less and my roommate a little more but first i had to settle up with the demon shoulders so tight they hurt i took the milky green tapers from my coat pocket and placed them on the circle to represent the points of a pentagram i wouldnt be drawing i lit them from the white candle i used to make the transfer media the tiny flames flickered and i watched for a moment to be sure they werent going to go out before i stuck the white candle back on the broken grave marker outside the circle the hushed sound of a car pulled my attention to the high walls dividing the graveyard from our neighbors steadying myself to tap the nearby ley line i tugged my knit cap down stomped the snow from the hem of my jeans and made one last check that i had everything but there was nothing left to procrastinate with another slow breath and i touched my will to the tiny ley line running through the churchs graveyard my breath hissed in through my nose and i stiffened almost falling as my equilibrium shifted the ley line seemed to have picked up the winter chill slicing through me with an unusual coldness putting out a gloved hand i steadied myself against the candlelit tombstone while the incoming energy continued to build once the strengths equilibrated the extra incoming force would flow back to the line until then i had to grit my teeth and bear it as tingling sensations backwashed at the theoretical extremities in my mind that mirrored my real fingers and toes each time it was worse each time it was faster each time it was more of an assault though it seemed like forever the force balanced in a heartbeat my hands started to sweat and an uncomfortable sensation of being both hot and cold took me like being in a fever i took off my gloves and jammed them into a deep pocket the charms on my bracelet jingled clear in the wintersilenced air they wouldnt help me not even the cross i wanted to set my circle quickly somehow algaliarept knew when i tapped a line and i had to summon it before it showed up on its own and robbed me of the thread of power i might claim as its summoner the copper spell pot with the transfer media was cold when i picked it up and did something no witch ever did and lived to tell of it i stepped forward putting myself into the same circle i was going to call algaliarept into standing across from the personsized monument cemented to the ground i exhaled the monolith was covered in a black smut from bacteria and city pollution making it look like a fallen angel that the figure was bowed weeping over a sword held horizontally in his hands as an offering only added to the creepy feeling there was a birds nest wedged into the fold of the wings as they curved around the body and the face didnt look right the arms too were too long to be human or inderlander even jenks didnt let his kids play around this one please let me be right i whispered to the statue as i mentally moved the white rill of salt from this reality to that of the everafter i staggered as most of the energy pooling in my center was yanked out to force the shift the media in the pot sloshed and still not having found my balance i set it down in the snow before it spilled my eyes went to the green candles they had turned eerily transparent having been moved to the everafter with the salt the flames though existed in both worlds adding their glow to the night the power from the line began to build again the slow increase as uncomfortable as the first quick influx of tapping a line but the ribbon of salt had been replaced with an equal amount of everafter reality arching high to close over my head nothing more substantial than air could pass the shifting bands of reality and because i set the circle only i could break itproviding i had made it properly to begin with algaliarept i summon you i whispered my heart pounding most people used all sorts of trappings to summon and contain a demon but seeing as i already had an arrangement with it simply saying its name and willing its presence would pull it across the lines lucky me my gut clenched when a small patch of snow melted between the warrior angel and me the snow steamed the cloud of reddish vapor billowing up to follow the confines of a body not yet taken shape i waited my tension growing algaliarept varied its shape sifting through my mind without me even knowing to choose what scared me the most once it had been ivy then kistenuntil i had pinned him in an elevator in a foolish moment of vampireinduced passion its hard to be scared of someone after youve frenchkissed him nick my boyfriend always got a slavering dog the size of a pony this time though the mist was definitely a human shape and i guessed it was going to show up either as piscarythe vampire i had just put in prisonor perhaps its more typical vision of a young british gentleman in a green velveteen coat with tails neither scares you anymore came a voice from the mist jerking my head up it was my voice aw crap i swore picking up my spell pot and backing away until i almost broke my circle it was going to show up as me i hated that im not afraid of myself i shouted even before it finished coalescing oh yes you are it had the right sound but the cadence and accent were wrong i stared riveted as algaliarept took on my outline running its hands suggestively down itself flattening its chest to my lame excuse of womanhood and giving me hips that were probably a little more curvaceous than i deserved it dressed itself in black leather pants a red halter top and highheeled black sandals that looked ridiculous out in the middle of a snowy graveyard eyelids lightly closed and lips open it shook its head to make my frizzy shoulderlength red curls take shape out of the lingering haze of everafter it gave me more freckles than i could possibly have and my eyes werent the red orbs it showed when it opened them but green mine werent slitted like a goats either you got the eyes wrong i said and i set my spell pot down at the edge of the circle i gritted my teeth hating that it heard my voice quaver hip cocked the demon put out a sandaled foot and snapped its fingers a pair of black shades materialized in its grip and it put them on hiding its unnatural eyes now theyre right it said and i shuddered at how close it matched my voice you dont look anything like me i said not realizing i had lost so much weight and deciding i could go back to eating shakes and fries algaliarept smiled perhaps if i put my hair up it mocked coyly as it gathered the unruly mass and held it atop my er its head biting its lips to redden them it moaned and shifted as if its hands were tied above it looking like it was into bondage games falling back onto the sword the angel held it posed like a whore i hunched deeper into my coat with the fake fur around the collar from the distant street came the slow sound of a passing car can we get on with this my feet are getting cold it pulled its head up and smiled you are such the party pooper rachel mariana morgan it said in my voice but now with its customary highbrow british accent but a very good sport not making me drag you into the everafter shows a fine strength of mind im going to enjoy breaking you i jerked when a smear of everafter energy cascaded over it it was shifting forms again but my shoulders eased when it turned itself into its usual vision of lace and green velvet dark hair styled long and round smoked glasses twisted into existence pale skin and a strongfeatured face appeared matching its trim narrowwaisted figure in elegance highheeled boots and an exquisitely tailored coat finished the outfit turning the demon into a charismatic young businessman of the eighteenth century possessing wealth and poised for greatness my thoughts touched on the horrific crime scene i had contaminated last fall while trying to pin the murders of cincinnatis best ley line witches on trent kalamack al had slaughtered them in piscarys name each of them had died in pain for its enjoyment al was a sadist no matter how good the demon looked yes lets get on with it it said as it took a tin of a black dust that smelled like brimstone and inhaled a pinch deeply it rubbed its nose and moved to poke at my circle with a boot making me wince nice and tight but its cold ceri likes it warm ceri i wondered as all the snow within the circle melted in a flash of condensation the scent of wet pavement rose strong then vanished as the cement dried to a pale red ceri algaliarept said its voice shocking me in its soft tone both coaxing and demanding come i stared when a woman stepped from behind algaliarept seemingly from nowhere she was thin her heartshaped face sallow and her cheekbones showing too strongly standing substantially shorter than i she had a diminutive almost childlike mien her head was down and her pale translucent hair hung straight to her midback she was dressed in a beautiful gown that dropped to her bare feet it was exquisitelush silk dyed in rich purples greens and goldsand it fitted her curvaceous form like it had been painted on though she was small she was wellproportioned if perhaps a shade fragile looking ceri algaliarept said putting a whitegloved hand to tilt her head up her eyes were green wide and empty what did i tell you about going barefoot a glimmer of annoyance crossed her face far away and distant behind the numb state she was in my attention dropped as a matching pair of embroidered slippers materialized about her feet thats better algaliarept turned from her and i was struck by the picture of the perfect couple they made in their finery she was beautiful in her clothes but her mind was as empty as she was lovely insane from the raw magic the demon forced her to hold for it filtering the ley line power through her mind to keep itself safe dread twisted in my gut dont kill her i whispered my mouth dry youre done with her let her live algaliarept pulled its smoked glasses down to look over them its red orbs fixing on me you like her it said she is pretty isnt she over a thousand years old and aged not a moment since the day i took her soul if i were honest shes the reason i was invited to most of the parties she puts out without a fuss though of course for the first hundred years it was all tears and wailing fun in itself but it does get old youll fight me wont you my jaw clenched give her back her soul now that youre done with her algaliarept laughed oh you are a love it said clapping its whitegloved hands once but im giving that back to her anyway ive sullied it beyond redemption leaving mine reasonably pure and i will kill her before she has the chance to beg forgiveness from her god its thick lips split in a nasty grin its all a lie anyway you know i went cold as the woman slumped into a small spot of purple green and gold at its feet broken i would die before letting it drag me into the everafter to becomebecome this bastard i whispered algaliarept gestured as if to say so what it turned to ceri finding her small hand in the mass of fabric and helping her rise she was barefoot again ceri the demon coaxed then glanced at me i should have replaced her forty years ago but the turn made everything difficult she doesnt even hear anymore unless you say her name first it turned back to the woman ceri be a love and fetch the transfer media you made this sundown my stomach hurt i made some i said and ceri blinked the first sign of comprehension crossing her big eyes solemn and blank she looked at me as if seeing me for the first time her attention went to the spell pot at my feet and the milky green candles about us panic stirred in the back of her eyes as she stood before the angel monument i think she had just realized what was going on marvelous algaliarept said youre trying to be useful already but i want ceris it looked at ceri her mouth open to show tiny white teeth yes love time for your retirement bring me my cauldron and the transfer media tense and shirking ceri made a gesture and a childsized cauldron made of copper thicker than my wrist appeared between us already filled with amber liquid the flecks of wild geranium suspended as if it were a gel the scent of ozone rose high as it grew warmer and i unzipped my coat algaliarept was humming clearly in a grand mood it beckoned me closer and i took a step fingering the silver knife tucked in my sleeve my pulse quickened and i wondered if my contract would be enough to save me a knife wasnt going to be much help the demon grinned to show me flat even teeth as it gestured to ceri my mirror it prompted and the delicate woman bent to retrieve a scrying mirror that hadnt been there a moment ago she held it before algaliarept like a table i swallowed remembering the foul sensation of pushing my aura off of me and into my scrying mirror last fall the demon took off its gloves one by one and placed its ruddy thickknuckled hands atop the glass long fingers spread wide it shuddered and closed its eyes while its aura precipitated out into the mirror falling from its hands like ink to swirl and pool in its reflection into the medium ceri love hurry now she was almost panting as she carried the mirror holding algaliarepts aura to the cauldron it wasnt the weight of the glass it was the weight of what was happening i imagine she was reliving the night she had stood where i was now watching her predecessor as i watched her she must have known what was going to happen but was so deadened inside that she could only do what was expected and by her obvious helpless panic i knew that something was left in her worth saving free her i said hunched in my ugly coat as my attention flicked from ceri to the cauldron and then to algaliarept free her first why it looked idly at its nails before putting the gloves back on ill kill you before i let you drag me into the everafter and i want her free first algaliarept laughed at that long and deep putting a hand against the angel the demon bent almost double a muted thump reverberated up through my feet and the stone base cracked with the sound of a gunshot ceri stared her pale lips slack and her eyes moving rapidly over me things seemed to be starting to work in her memories and thoughts long suppressed you will struggle algaliarept said delighted stupendous i so hoped you would its eyes met mine and it smirked touching the rim of its glasses adsimulo calefacio the knife in my sleeve burst into flame yelping i shrugged out of my coat it hit the edge of my bubble and slid down the demon eyed me rachel mariana morgan stop trying my patience get over here and recite the damned invocation i had no choice if i didnt it would call my deal breached take my soul in forfeit and drag me into the everafter my only chance was to play the agreement out i glanced at ceri wishing she would move away from algaliarept but she was running her fingers over the dates engraved in the cracked tombstone her sunstarved complexion now even paler do you remember the curse algaliarept asked when i came even with the kneehigh cauldron i snuck a glance in not surprised to find the demons aura was black i nodded feeling faint as my thoughts went back to having accidentally made nick my familiar was it only three months ago i can say it in english i whispered nick oh god i hadnt said goodbye he had been so distant lately that i hadnt found the courage to tell him i hadnt told anyone good enough its glasses vanished and its damned goatslitted eyes fixed on me my heart raced but i had made this choice i would live or die by it deep and resonate seeming to vibrate my very core algaliarepts voice slipped from between its lips it was latin the words familiar yet not like a vision of a dream pars tibi totum mihi vinctus vinculis prece factis some to you i echoed in english interpreting the words from memory but all to me bound by ties made so by plea the demons smile widened chilling me with its confidence luna servata lux sanata chaos statutum pejus minutum i swallowed hard moon made safe ancient light made sane i whispered chaos decreed taken tripped if bane algaliarepts knuckles gripping the vat went white in anticipation mentem tegens malum ferens semper servus dum duret mundus it said and ceri sobbed a small kitten sound quickly stifled go on algaliarept prompted excitement making its outline blur say it and put your hands in i hesitated my eyes fixing on ceris crumpled form before the gravestone her gown a small puddle of color absolve me of one of my debts i owe you first you are a pushy bitch rachel mariana morgan do it i demanded you said you would take off one of your marks as agreed it leaned over the pot until i could see my reflection wideeyed and frightened in its glasses it makes no difference finish the curse and be done with it are you saying you arent going to hold to our bargain i goaded and it laughed no not at all and if you were hoping to break our arrangement on that then youre sadly the fool ill take off one of my marks but you still owe me a favor it licked its lips and as my familiar you belongto me a nauseating mix of dread and relief shook my knees and i held my breath so i wouldnt get sick but i had to fulfill my end of the bargain completely before i would see if my beliefs were right and i could slip the demons snare by a small point called choice lee of mind i said trembling bearer of pain slave until the worlds are slain algaliarept made a satisfied sound jaw gritted i plunged my hands into the cauldron cold struck through me burning them numb i yanked my hands out horrified i stared at them seeing no change in my redenameled fingertips and then algaliarepts aura seeped farther into me touching my chi my eyes seemed to bulge in agony i took a huge breath to scream but couldnt let it out i caught a glimpse of ceri her eyes pinched in memory across the cauldron algaliarept was grinning gagging i struggled to breathe as the air seemed to turn to oil i fell to my hands and knees bruising them on the concrete hair falling to hide my face i tried to keep from retching i couldnt breathe i couldnt think the demons aura was a wet blanket dripping with acid smothering me it coated me inside and out and my strength was surrounded by its power it squeezed my will to nothing i heard my heart beat once then again i took a shuddering breath swallowing back the sharp tang of vomit i was going to live its aura alone couldnt kill me i could do this i could shaking i looked up while the shock lessened to something i could deal with the cauldron was gone and ceri was huddled almost behind the huge grave marker beside algaliarept i took a breath unable to taste the air through the demons aura i moved unable to feel the rough concrete scraping my fingertips everything was numb everything was muted as if through cotton everything except the power of the nearby ley line i could feel it humming thirty yards away as if it were a hightension power line panting i staggered to my feet shocked to realize i could see it i could see everything as if i was using my second sightwhich i wasnt my stomach roiled as i saw that my circle once tinged with a shading of cheerful gold from my aura was now coated in black i turned to the demon seeing the thick black aura surrounding it and knowing a good portion of it coated mine then i looked at ceri hardly able to see her features so strong was algaliarepts aura on her she didnt have an aura to combat the demons having lost her soul to it and that was what i had pinned everything on if i retained my soul i still had my aura smothered as it was under algaliarepts and with my soul came free will unlike ceri i could say no slowly i was remembering how free her i rasped i took your damned aura free her now oh why not the demon chortled rubbing its gloved hands together killing her will be a banger of a way to get your apprenticeship started ceri the slight woman scrambled up her head high and her heartshaped face showing panic ceridwen merriam dulciate algaliarept said im giving you your soul back before i kill you you can thank rachel for that i started rachel i had always been rachel mariana morgan before apparently as a familiar i wasnt worth my full name anymore that ticked me off she made a small sound staggering i watched with my new vision as algaliarepts bond fell from her the barest faintest glimmer of purest blue rimmed herher returned soul already trying to bathe her in protectionthen vanished under the thousand years of darkness the demon had fostered on her soul while it had been in his keeping her mouth worked but she couldnt speak her eyes glazed as she panted hyperventilating and i leapt forward to catch her as she fell struggling i dragged her back to my end of the circle algaliarept reached after her adrenaline surged i dropped ceri straightening i drew on the line rhombus i shouted the word of invocation i had been practicing for three months to set a circle without drawing it first with a force that sent me lurching my new circle exploded into existence sealing ceri and me in a second smaller circle inside the first my circle had lacked a physical object to focus on so the excess energy went everywhere instead of back in the ley line where it was supposed to the demon swore blown backward until it slammed against the inside of my original circle still up and running with a ping that reverberated through me my first circle broke and algaliarept hit the ground breathing heavily i hunched with my hands on my knees algaliarept blinked at me from the concrete then a wicked smile came over it were sharing an aura love it said your circle cant stop me anymore its grin widened surprise it sang lightly standing up and taking the time to meticulously brush its coat of crushed velvet oh god if my first circle didnt hold it now neither would my second i had thought that might happen ceri i whispered get up we have to move algaliarepts eyes tracked behind me to the hallowed ground that surrounded us my muscles tensed the demon leapt shrieking i jerked ceri and myself backward the surge of everafter flowing into me from breaking the circle was almost unnoticed my breath was knocked from me as we hit the ground ceri on top of me still not breathing i sent my heels scrabbling against the snow and pushed us farther away the goldcolored trim on ceris ball gown was rough under my fingers and i yanked her to me until i was sure we were both on holy ground damn you all to hell algaliarept shouted from the edge of the cement furious i got up shaking my breath caught and i stared at the frustrated demon ceri the demon demanded and the scent of burnt amber rose when it set its foot across the unseen barrier and jerked it back push her at me or ill blacken your soul so badly that your precious god wont let you in no matter how you beg it ceri moaned clutching my leg as she huddled hiding her face trying to overcome a thousand years of conditioning my face grew tight from anger this would have been me this still could be me i wont let it hurt you anymore i said one hand dropping to touch her shoulder if i can stop it from hurting you i will her grip on me shook and i thought she seemed like a beaten child youre my familiar the demon shouted spittle flying from it rachel come here i shook my head colder than the snow warranted no i said simply im not going into the everafter you cant make me algaliarept choked in disbelief you will it thundered and ceri clutched my leg tighter i own you youre my bloody familiar i gave you my aura your will is mine no it isnt i said shaking inside it was working god save me it was working my eyes warmed and i realized i was almost crying from relief it couldnt take me i might be its familiar but it didnt have my soul i could say no youre my familiar it raged and ceri and i both cried out as it tried to cross into holy ground and yanked itself back again im your familiar i yelled back frightened and i say no i said id be your familiar and i am but im not going into the everafter with you and you cant make me algaliarepts goatslitted eyes narrowed it stepped back and i stiffened as its anger chilled you agreed to be my familiar it said softly smoke curling up from its shiny buckled boots as they edged the circle of blasphemed ground come here now or ill call our agreement breached and your soul will be mine by default double jeopardy i knew it would come to this ive got your stinking aura all over me i said as ceri quivered im your familiar if you think theres been a breach in contract then you get someone out here to judge what happened before the sun comes up and take one of these damned demon marks off me i demanded holding my wrist out my arm shook and algaliarept made an ugly noise deep in its throat the long exhalation set my insides to quiver and ceri ventured to peek at the demon i cant use you as a familiar if youre on the wrong side of the lines it said clearly thinking aloud the binding isnt strong enough thats not my problem i interrupted legs shaking no algaliarept agreed it laced its whitegloved hands behind its back its gaze dropping to ceri the deep fury in its eyes scared the crap out of me but im making it your problem you stole my familiar and left me with nothing you tricked me into letting you slip payment for a service if i cant drag you in ill find a way to use you through the lines and i will never let you die ask her ask her of her neverending hell its waiting for you rachel and im not a patient demon you cant hide on holy ground forever go away i said my voice trembling i called you here now im telling you to leave take one of these marks off me and leave now i had summoned it and therefore it was susceptible to the rules of summoningeven if i was its familiar it exhaled slowly and i thought the ground moved its eyes went black black black black then blacker still oh shit ill find the way to make a strong enough bond with you through the lines it intoned and ill pull you through soul intact you walk this side of the lines on borrowed time ive been a dead witch walking before i said and my name is rachel mariana morgan use it and take one of these marks off of me or you forfeit everything im going to get away with it i outsmarted a demon the knowledge was heady but i was too frightened for it to mean much algaliarept gave me a chilling look its gaze dropped to ceri then it vanished i cried out as my wrist flamed but i welcomed the pain hunched as i held my demonmarked wrist with my other hand it hurtit hurt as if the dogs of hell were chewing on itbut when my blurred vision cleared there was one scared line crossing the welted circle not two panting through the last of the pain i slumped my entire body collapsing in on itself i pulled my head up and took a clean breath trying to unknot my stomach it couldnt use me if we were on opposite sides of the ley lines i was still myself though i was coated with algaliarepts aura slowly my second sight faded and the red smear of the ley line vanished algaliarepts aura was getting easier to bear slipping almost into an unnoticed sensation now that the demon was gone ceri let go of me reminded of her i bent to offer her a hand up she looked at it in wonder watching herself as she put a thin pale hand in mine still at my feet she kissed the top of it in a formal gesture of thanks no dont i said turning my hand to grip hers and pull her upright and out of the snow ceris eyes filled and spilled over as she silently wept for her freedom the welldressed abused woman beautiful in her tearful silent joy i put my arm around her giving her what comfort i could ceri hunched over and shook all the harder leaving everything where it was and the candles to go out on their own i stumbled to the church my gaze was fixed to the snow and as ceri and i made two trails of footprints over the one leading out here i wondered what on earth i was going to do with her two we were halfway to the church before i realized ceri was walking barefoot in the snow ceri i said appalled where are your shoes the crying woman made a rough hiccup wiping her eyes she glanced down a red blur of everafter swirled about her toes and a pair of burnt embroidered slippers appeared on her tiny feet surprise cascaded over her delicate features clear in the porch light theyre burned i said as she shook them off bits of char stuck to her looking like black sores maybe big al is having a tantrum and burning your things ceri silently nodded a hint of a smile quirking her blueing lips at the insulting nickname i used so i wouldnt say the demons name before those who didnt already know it i pushed us back into motion well ive got a pair of slippers you can wear and how about some coffee im frozen through coffee we just escaped a demon and im offering her coffee she said nothing her eyes going to the wooden porch that led to the living quarters at the back of the church her eyes traveled to the sanctuary behind it and the steeple with its belfry priest she whispered her voice matching the icedover garden crystalline and pure no i said as i tried not to slip on the steps i just live here its not a real church anymore ceri blinked and i added its kinda hard to explain come on in i opened the back door going in first since ceri dropped her head and wouldnt the warmth of the living room was like a blessed wave on my cold cheeks ceri stopped dead in the threshold when a handful of pixy girls flew shrieking from the mantel above the empty fireplace fleeing the cold two adolescent pixy boys gave ceri a telling glance before following at a more sedate pace pixies i prompted remembering she was over a thousand years old if she wasnt an inderlander she wouldnt have ever seen them before believing they were ah fairy tales you know about pixies i asked stomping the snow from my boots she nodded closing the door behind her and i felt better the adjustment to modern life would be easier if she didnt have to come to grips with witches weres pixies vampires and the like being real on top of tvs and cell phones but as her eyes ranged over ivys expensive electronic equipment with only a mild interest i was willing to bet that things on the other side of the ley lines were as technologically advanced as they were here jenks i shouted to the front of the church where he and his family were living out the duration of the cold months can i see you for a minute there was the tight hum of dragonfly wings faint over the warm air hey rache the small pixy said as he buzzed in whats this my kids are saying about an angel he jerked to a hovering halt his eyes wide and his short blond hair swinging as he looked behind me angel huh i thought as i turned to ceri to introduce her oh god no i said pulling her back upright she had been picking up the snow i had knocked off my boots holding it in her hand the sight of her diminutive form dressed in that exquisite gown cleaning my mess was too much please ceri i said taking the snow from her and dropping it on the carpet dont a wash of selfannoyance crossed the small womans smooth brow sighing she made an apologetic face i dont think she had even realized what she was doing until i stopped her i turned back to jenks seeing his wings had taken on a faint red tint as his circulation increased what the hell he muttered gaze dropping to her feet pixy dust sifted from him in his surprise to make a glittering spot of sun on the gray carpet he was dressed in his casual gardening clothes of tightfitting green silk and looked like a miniature peter pan minus the hat jenks i said as i put a hand on ceris shoulder and pulled her forward this is ceri shes going to be staying with us for a while ceri this is jenks my partner jenks zipped forward then back in agitation an amazed look came over ceri and she glanced from me to him partner she said her attention going to my left hand understanding crashed over me and i warmed my business partner i reiterated realizing she thought we were married how on earth could you marry a pixy why on earth would you want to we work together as runners taking my hat off i tossed the red wool to the hearth where it could dry on the stone and fluffed the pressure marks from my hair i had left my coat outside but i wasnt going out to get it now she bit her lip in confusion the warmth of the room had turned them red and color was starting to come back into her cheeks in a dry clatter jenks flitted close so that my curls shifted in the breeze from his wings not too bright is she he pointed out and when i waved him away in bother he put his hands on his hips hovering before ceri he said loudly and slowly as if she were hard of hearing wearegoodguys westopbadguys warriors ceri said not looking at him as her eyes touched on ivys leather curtains plush suede chairs and sofa the room was a salute to comfort all of it from ivys pocketbook and not mine jenks laughed sounding like wind chimes warriors he said grinning yeah were warriors ill be right back i gotta tell that one to matalina he zipped out of the room at head height and my shoulders eased sorry about that i apologized i asked jenks to move his family in for the winter after he admitted he usually lost two children to hibernation sickness every spring theyre driving ivy and me insane but id rather have no privacy for four months than jenks starting his spring with tiny coffins ceri nodded ivy she said softly is she your partner yup just like jenks i said casually to make sure she really understood her shifting eyes were cataloging everything and i slowly moved to the hallway um ceri i said hesitating until she started to follow do you want me to call you ceridwen instead she peeked down the dark corridor to the dimly lit sanctuary her gaze following the sounds of pixy children they were supposed to stay in the front of the church but they got into everything and their squeals and shrieks had become commonplace ceri please her personality was thundering back into her faster than i would have believed possible going from silence to short sentences in a matter of moments there was a curious mix of modern and oldworld charm in her speech that probably came from living with demons so long she stopped in the threshold of my kitchen wideeyed as she took it all in i didnt think it was culture shock most people had a similar reaction when seeing my kitchen it was huge with both a gas and an electric stove so i could cook on one and stir spells on the other the fridge was stainless steel and large enough to put a cow in there was one sliding window overlooking the snowy garden and graveyard and my beta mr fish swam happily in a brandy snifter on the sill fluorescent lights illuminated shiny chrome and expansive counter space that wouldnt be out of place before the cameras of a cooking show a center island counter overhung with a rack of my spelling equipment and drying herbs gathered by jenks and his family took up much of the space ivys massive antique table took up the rest half of it was meticulously arranged as her office with her computerfaster and more powerful than an industrialsized package of laxativecolorcoded files maps and the markers she used to organize her runs the other half of the table was mine and empty i wish i could say it was neatness but when i had a run i ran it i didnt analyze it to death have a seat i said casually how about some coffee coffee i thought as i went to the coffeemaker and threw out the old grounds what was i going to do with her it wasnt as if she was a stray kitten she needed help professional help ceri stared at me her face returning to its numb state i she stammered looking frightened and small in her gorgeous outfit i glanced at my jeans and red sweater i still had on my snow boots and i felt like a slob here i said as i pulled out a chair ill make some tea three steps forward one back i thought when she shunned the chair i offered and took the one before ivys computer instead tea might be more appropriate seeing as she was over a thousand years old did they even have coffee in the dark ages i was staring at my cupboards trying to remember if we had a teapot when jenks and about fifteen of his kids came rolling in all talking at once their voices were so highpitched and rapid they made my head hurt jenks i pleaded glancing at ceri she looked overwhelmed enough as it was please they arent going to do anything he protested belligerently besides i want them to get a good sniff of her i cant tell what she is she stinks of burnt amber so badly who is she anyway and what was she doing in our garden in her bare feet um i said suddenly wary pixies had excellent noses able to tell what species someone was just by smelling them i had a bad suspicion that i knew what ceri was and i really didnt want jenks to figure it out ceri raised her hand as a perch smiling beatifically at the two pixy girls who promptly landed on it their green and pink silk dresses moving from the breeze stirred by their dragonfly wings they were chattering happily the way pixy girls do seemingly brainless but aware of everything down to the mouse hiding behind the fridge clearly ceri had seen pixies before that would make her an inderlander if she was a thousand years old the turn when we all came out of hiding to live openly with humans had only been forty years ago hey jenks exclaimed seeing his kids monopolizing her and they whirled up and out of the kitchen in a kaleidoscope of color and noise immediately he took their place beckoning his oldest son jax down to perch on the computer screen before her you smell like trent kalamack he said bluntly what are you a wash of angst took me and i turned my back on them damn i was right she was an elf if jenks knew he would blab it all over cincinnati the moment the temperature got above freezing and he could leave the church trent didnt want the world to know that elves had survived the turn and he would drop agent orange on the entire block to shut jenks up turning i frantically waved my fingers at ceri pantomiming zipping my mouth realizing she wouldnt have a clue what that meant i put my finger to my lips the woman eyed me in question then looked at jenks ceri she said seriously yeah yeah jenks said impatiently hands on his hips i know you ceri me jenks but what are you are you a witch rachels a witch ceri glanced at me and away im ceri jenkss wings blurred to nothing the shimmer going from blue to red yeah he repeated but what species see im a pixy and rachel is a witch you are ceri she insisted ah jenks i said as the womans eyes narrowed the question as to what the kalamacks were had eluded pixies for the entirety of the familys existence figuring that out would give jenks more prestige in the pixy world than if he took out an entire fairy clan by himself i could tell he was on the edge of his patience when he flitted up to hover before her damn it jenks swore frustrated what the hell are you woman jenks i shouted in alarm as ceris hand flashed out snagging him jax his son let out a yelp leaving a cloud of pixy dust as he darted to the ceiling jenkss eldest daughter jih peeked around the archway from the hall ceiling her wings a pink blur hey lego jenks exclaimed his wings made a furious clatter but he wasnt going anywhere ceri had his pant leg between her thumb and forefinger her reflexes were better than even ivys if she had enough control to be that precise im ceri she said her thin lips tight as jenks hovered snared and even my demon captor had enough respect that he didnt curse at me little warrior yes maam jenks said meekly can i go now she raised one pale eyebrowa skill i enviedthen glanced at me for direction i nodded emphatically still shocked at how quick it had been not smiling ceri let him go guess you arent as slow as i thought jenks said sullenly the ruffled pixy brought the scent of storebought dirt to me as he retreated to my shoulder and my brow furrowed when i turned my back on her to poke around under the counter for a teapot i heard the soft familiar clink of pens recognizing the sound of ceri tidying ivys desk her centuries of slavery were showing again the womans mix of meek servitude and quick pride had me at a loss for how to treat her who is she jenks whispered in my ear i crouched to reach into the cupboard pulling out a copper teapot so badly tarnished that it was almost maroon she was big als familiar big al the pixy squeaked rising up to land upon the tap is that what you were doing out there tinks panties rachel youre getting as bad as nick you know thats not safe i could tell him now now that it was over very aware of ceri listening behind us i ran the water into the teapot and swirled it around to clean it big al didnt agree to testify against piscary out of the goodness of its heart i had to pay for it with a dry rasp of wings jenks moved to hover before me surprise shock and then anger cascaded over his face what did you promise him he said coldly its an it not a him i said and its done i couldnt look at him i promised to be its familiar if i was allowed to keep my soul rachel a burst of pixy dust lit the sink when when is it coming to get you we have to find a way out of this there must be something he flew a bright path to my spell books under the center island counter and back is there anything in your books call nick hell know not liking his fluster i wiped the water off the bottom of the teapot my boot heels made a dull thumping on the linoleum as i crossed the kitchen the gas ignited with a whoosh and my face warmed from embarrassment its too late i repeated im its familiar but the bond isnt strong enough for it to use me if im on this side of the ley lines and as long as i can keep it from pulling me into the everafter ill be okay i turned from the stove finding ceri sitting before ivys computer staring at me with rapt admiration i can say no its done jenks came to a sputtering halt before me done he said too close to focus on rachel why putting piscary away isnt worth that i didnt have a choice frustrated i crossed my arms before me and leaned against the counter piscary was trying to kill me and if i survived i wanted him in jail not free to come after me again its done the demon cant use me i tricked it him ceri said softly and jenks spun i had forgotten she was there she was so quiet al is male female demons wont let themselves be pulled across the lines thats how you can tell mostly i blinked taken aback al is male why did he keep letting me call him an it she lifted her shoulder in a very modern show of confusion my breath came out in a puff and i turned back to jenks i started as i found him hovering right before my nose his wings red youre an ass he said his tiny smooth features creased in anger you should have told us what if it had gotten you what about ivy and me huh we would have kept looking for you not knowing what had happened at least if you had told us we might have been able to find a way to get you back ever think of that ms morgan were a team and you just stepped all over that my next outburst died but there wasnt anything you could have done i said lamely how do you know jenks snapped i sighed embarrassed that a fourinch man was lecturing meand had every right to yeah youre right i said slumping slowly my arms uncrossed im justim just not used to having anyone i can depend on jenks im sorry jenks dropped three feet he was so surprised youyou agree with me ceris head made a smooth turn to the open archway her empty expression went even more so i followed her gaze to the dark hall not surprised to find it holding ivys lithe silhouette her hip cocked hand on her thin waist looking sleek in her bodytight leather suddenly wary i pulled myself from the counter and straightened i hated it when she just appeared like that i hadnt even felt the air pressure change when she opened the front door hi ivy i said my voice still carrying its chagrin from jenks ivys blank gaze matched ceris perfectly as she ran her brown eyes over the small woman sitting in her chair she pushed herself into motion moving with a living vampires grace her boots almost silent tucking her long enviably straight black hair behind an ear she went to the fridge and pulled out the orange juice dressed in her casual leather pants and black tuckin shirt she looked like a biker chick gone sophisticate her cheeks were red from the cold and she looked chilled even though she still wore her short leather jacket jenks hovered beside me our argument forgotten in the more pressing problem of ivy finding someone unexpected in her kitchen my last guest she had pinned to the wall and threatened to bleed ivy didnt like surprises that she was drinking orange juice was a good sign it meant she had succumbed to that damned blood lust of hers and jenks and i would only have to deal with a guiltstrewn vampire instead of an irritable guiltstrewn and hungry vampire she was a lot easier to live with now that she was practicing again ah ivy this is ceridwen i offered shes staying with us until she finds her feet ivy turned leaning back against the counter to look predatory and sexy as she took the cap off the jug and drank right from the carton like id say anything ivys gaze ran over ceri then flicked to jenkss obvious agitation and then to me so she said her melodious voice reminding me of torn gray silk on snow you wiggled out of your agreement with that demon good job nicely done my jaw dropped how did you know i stammered as jenks yelped in surprise a faint smile unusual but honest pulled the corners of her mouth up a flash of fang showed her canines the same size as mine but sharp like a cats shed have to wait until she was dead to get the extended versions you talk in your sleep she said lightly you knew i said floored you never said anything nicely done jenkss wings clattered like june bugs you think being a demons familiar is a good thing what train hit you on the way home ivy went to get a glass from the cupboard if piscary had been released rachel would be dead by sunup she said as she poured out juice so shes a demons familiar so what she said the demon cant use her unless he pulls her into the everafter and shes alive you cant do anything if youre dead she took a sip of her drink unless youre a vampire jenks made an ugly sound and flew to the corner of the room to sulk jih took the opportunity to flit in to hide in the ladle hanging over the center counter the tips of her wings showing a brilliant red above the copper rim ivys brown eyes met mine over her glass her perfect oval face was almost featureless as she hid her emotions behind the cool facade of indifference she maintained when there was someone in the room beside us two jenks included im glad it worked she said as she set the glass on the counter are you all right i nodded seeing her relief in the slight trembling of her long pianist fingers she would never tell me how worried she had been and i wondered how long she had stood in the hallway listening and collecting herself her eyes blinked several times and her jaw clenched in an effort to stifle her emotion i didnt know it was tonight she said softly i wouldnt have left thanks i said thinking jenks was right i had been an ass for not telling them i just wasnt used to having anyone but my mother care ceri was watching ivy with a puzzled rapt attention partner she hazarded and ivy flicked her attention to the small woman yeah ivy said partner whats it to you ceri this is ivy i said as the small woman got to her feet ivy frowned as she realized the precise order she kept her desk in had been altered she was big als familiar i warned she needs a few days to find her feet is all jenks made an eyehurting noise with his wings and ivy gave me a telling look her expression shifting to an annoyed wariness when ceri came to stand before her the small woman was peering at ivy in confusion youre a vampire she said reaching to touch ivys crucifix ivy sprang back with a startling quickness her eyes flashing black whoa whoa whoa i said as i stepped between them ready for anything ivy take it easy shes been in the everafter for a thousand years she may not have seen a living vampire before i think shes an inderlander but she smells like the everafter so jenks cant tell what she is i hesitated telling her with my eyes and my last sentence that ceri was an elf and therefore a loose cannon as far as magic was concerned ivys pupils had dilated to almost a full vampire black her stance was domineering and sexually charged but she had just slaked her blood lust and so was capable of listening i shot a quick glance at ceri glad to see she wisely hadnt moved we all okay here i asked my voice demanding they both back down thin lips pressed tight ivy turned her back on us jenks dropped to my shoulder nicely done he said got all your bitches in line i see jenks i hissed knowing ivy had heard when her knuckles on her glass turned white i flicked him off me and laughing he rose up and then back down to my shoulder ceri was standing with her arms confidently at her side watching ivy grow more and more tense ohhhhh jenks drawled your new friend is gonna do something uh ceri i questioned heart pounding as the petite woman went to stand beside ivy at the sink clearly demanding her attention pale face tight with a repressed anger ivy turned what she said flatly ceri inclined her head regally never taking her green eyes from ivys slowly dilating brown ones i apologize she said in her high clear voice every syllable carefully pronounced ive slighted you her attention dropped to ivys elaborate crucifix on its silver chain about her neck youre a vampire warrior and yet you can wear the cross ceris hand twitched and i knew she wanted to touch it ivy knew it too i watched unable to interfere as ivy turned to face her hip cocked she gave ceri a more indepth onceover taking in her dried tears her exquisite ball gown her bare feet and her obvious pride and upright carriage as i held my breath ivy took her crucifix off the chain gathering her hair in front of her as she pulled it from around her neck im a living vampire she said as she put the religious icon in the elfs hand i was born with the vampire virus you know what a virus is dont you ceris fingers traced the lines of the worked silver my demon let me read what i wished a virus is killing my kin she looked up not the vampire virus something else ivys gaze darted to me then returned to the small woman standing just a shade too close to her the virus changed me as i was forming in my mothers womb making me some of both i can walk under the sun and worship without pain ivy said im stronger than you she added as she subtly put more space between them but not as strong as a true undead and i have a soul she said the last as if she expected ceri to deny it ceris expression became empty youre going to lose it ivys eye twitched i know i held my breath listening to the clock tick and the almost subliminal hum of pixy wings eyes solemn the thin woman held the crucifix out to ivy im sorry thats the hell from which rachel mariana morgan saved me ivy looked at the cross in ceris hand no emotion showing im hoping she can do the same for me i cringed ivy had pinned her sanity on the belief that there was a witch magic that might purge the vampire virus from her that all it would take would be the right spell to let her walk away from the blood and violence but there wasnt i waited for ceri to tell ivy that no one was beyond redemption but all she did was nod her wispy hair floating i hope she can me too ivy glanced at the crucifix ceri was extending to her keep it it doesnt help anymore my lips parted in surprise and jenks landed upon my big hoop earrings as ceri placed it about her neck the elaborately tooled silver looked right against the rich purple and green of her formal gown ivy i started jerking when ivy narrowed her eyes at me it doesnt help anymore she said tightly she wants it im giving it to her ceri reached up clearly finding peace in the icon thank you she whispered ivy frowned touch my desk again and ill snap every one of your fingers ceri took the threat with a light understanding that surprised me it was obvious she had dealt with vampires before i wondered wheresince vampires couldnt manipulate ley lines and would therefore make lousy familiars how about some tea i said wanting something normal to do making tea wasnt normal but it was close the pot was steaming and as i rummaged in a cupboard for a mug good enough for a guest jenks snickered swinging my earring like a tire swing his kids were flitting into the kitchen in twos and threesmuch to ivys annoyancepulled by the novelty of ceri they hovered over her jih taking the closest stance ivy stood defensively before her computer and after a moments hesitation ceri sat in the chair farthest from her she looked lost and alone as she fingered the crucifix about her neck as i searched the pantry for a tea bag i wondered how i was going to make this work ivy wasnt going to like another roommate and where would we put her the accusing clatter of ivys pens was loud as she rearranged her pencil cup got one i said in relief as i finally found a tea bag jenks left me to bother ivy chased off my earring by the steam drifting up as i poured the boiling water into the mug here ceri i said waving the pixies away from her and setting it on the table do you want anything with it she looked at the cup as if shed never seen one before eyes widening she shook her head i hesitated wondering what i had done wrong she looked like she was ready to cry again is it okay i asked and she nodded her thin hand shaking as she took the mug jenks and ivy were staring at her you sure you dont want sugar or anything i asked but she shook her head narrow chin trembling she brought the cup to her lips brow furrowed i went to get the coffee grounds out of the fridge ivy rose to rinse the carafe she leaned close to me running the water to blur her words as she muttered whats wrong with her shes crying over her tea i spun ceri i exclaimed if you want some sugar its okay she met my gaze tears streaming down her pale face i havent had anything to eat fora thousand years she choked out i felt as if i had been punched in the gut do you want some sugar still crying she shook her head ivy was waiting for me when i turned back around she cant stay here rachel the vampire said her brow tight shell be fine i whispered appalled that ivy was ready to kick her out ill bring my old cot down from the belfry and set it up in the living room ive got some old tshirts she can wear until i take her shopping jenks buzzed his wings for my attention then what he said from the spigot i gestured my frustration i dont know shes much better already she wasnt talking half an hour ago look at her now we all turned finding ceri sobbing quietly and drinking her tea in small reverent sips as the pixy girls hovered over her three were plating her long fair hair and another was singing to her okay i said as we turned back bad example jenks shook his head rache i really feel bad for her but ivys right she cant stay here she needs professional help really i said belligerently feeling myself warm i havent heard of any group therapy sessions for retired demon familiars have you rachel ivy said a sudden shout from the pixy children brought jenks up from the spigot his eyes went past us to his kids as they descended upon the mouse who had finally made a dash for the living room and found itself in its own personal hell excuse me he said flitting off to rescue it no i said to ivy im not going to dump her in some institution im not saying you should ivys pale face had started to color and the ring of brown about her eyes was shrinking as my body heat rose and my blood grew warm triggering her instincts but she cant stay here the woman needs normal and rachel we arent it i took a breath to protest then let it out frowning i glanced at ceri she was wiping her eyes the hand curled about her mug shaking to make rings on the surface of her tea my eyes went to the pixy children arguing over who was going to get to ride the mouse first it was little jessie and the tiny pixy screamed in delight when the rodent darted out of the kitchen with her on its back in a blur of gold sparkles all but jih followed maybe ivy was right what do you want me to do ivy i said calming id ask my mom to take her in but shes a step away from being in an institution herself jenks buzzed back what about keasley surprised i looked at ivy the old guy across the street ivy said warily we dont know anything about him jenks landed on the sill beside mr fish and put his hands on his hips hes old and on a fixed income what more is there to know as ceri collected herself i sifted the idea through my mind i liked the old witch whose slow speech hid a sharp wit and high intelligence he had stitched me up after algaliarept had torn my neck he had stitched up my will and confidence too the arthritic man was hiding something and i didnt think his real name was keasley any more than i believed his story that he had more medical equipment than a small emergency room because he didnt like doctors but i trusted him he doesnt like the law and he knows how to keep his mouth shut i said thinking it was perfect eyes pinched i looked at ceri talking to jih in soft tones ivys eyes were doubtful and peeved i pushed into motion im calling him i added as i motioned to ceri that i would be right back and went into the living room for the phone three ceri jenks said as i flipped the switch and got a pot of coffee going if tea makes you cry you gotta try french fries come here ill show you how to use the microwave keasley was on his way over it might take him a while since he was racked by arthritis so badly that even most pain charms wouldnt touch it i felt bad for pulling him out into the snow but it would have been even more rude to descend upon his house with an intentness i didnt understand jenks perched himself on ceris shoulder and talked her through the task of microwaving frozen french fries she bent to watch the little carton spin my pink slippers on her feet looking overly large and awkward pixy girls swirled around her in a whirl of pastel silk and chatter mostly ignored the unending noise had driven ivy into the living room where she was currently hiding with her earphones on my head came up when the air pressure shifted ello came a strong raspy voice from the front of the church rachel the pixies let me in where are you ladies i glanced at ceri recognizing her sudden apprehension its keasley a neighbor i said hes going to check you over make sure youre healthy im fine she said pensively thinking this might be harder than i thought i padded in my sock feet into the hallway to talk to him before he met ceri hi keasley were back here his hunched wizened figure limped down the hallway eclipsing the light more pixy children escorted him wreathing him in circles of sifting pixy dust keasley had a brown paper grocery bag in his hand and he brought the cold scent of snow in with him mixing pleasantly with a witchs characteristic redwood scent rachel he said his brown eyes squinting up at me as he got closer hows my favorite redhead im good i said giving him a quick hug and thinking that after outwitting algaliarept good was an understatement his overalls were worn and smelling of soap i thought of him as the neighborhoods wiseoldman and a substitute grandfather figure all in one and i didnt mind that he had a past he wasnt willing to share he was a good person thats all i needed to know come on in i have someone i want you to meet i said and he slowed with a wary caution she needs your help i said softly his thick lips pressed together and the brown wrinkles of his face deepened keasley took a slow breath his arthritic hands making the grocery bag crackle he nodded showing me a thinning spot in his tightly curled graying hair blowing in relief i led him into the kitchen holding myself back so i could see his reaction to ceri the old witch rocked to a halt as he stared but upon seeing the delicate woman standing in pink fuzzy slippers beside the microwave in her elegant ball gown with a folder of steaming fries i could understand why i dont need a physician ceri said jenks rose from her shoulder hi keasley you gonna check ceri out keasley nodded limping as he went to pull out a chair he gestured for ceri to sit then carefully lowered himself into the adjacent seat wheezing he set his bag between his feet opening it to pull out a blood pressure cuff im not a doctor he said my name is keasley not sitting ceri looked at me then him im ceri she said just above a whisper well ceri its nice to meet you setting the cuff on the table he extended his arthriticswollen hand looking unsure ceri awkwardly put her hand in his keasley shook it smiling to show his coffeestained teeth the old man gestured to the chair and ceri arranged herself in it reluctantly setting her fries down and warily eyeing the cuff rachel wants me to look you over he said while he pulled more doctor stuff out ceri glanced at me sighing as she nodded in surrender the coffee had finished and as keasley took her temperature checked her reflexes her blood pressure and made her say ahhhh i took a cup into the living room for ivy she was sitting sideways in her cushy chair with her earphones on head on one arm feet draped over the other her eyes were shut but she reached out without looking taking the cup the instant i set it down thank you she mouthed and still not having seen her eyes i walked out sometimes ivy gave me the creeps coffee keasley i asked as i returned the old man peered at the thermometer and turned it off yes thank you he smiled at ceri youre fine thank you sir ceri said she had been eating her fries while keasley worked and she looked glumly at the bottom of the carton immediately jenks was with her more he prompted try some ketchup on them suddenly jenkss zeal to get her to eat french fries became very clear it wasnt the fries he was interested in it was the ketchup jenks i said tiredly as i took keasley his coffee and leaned against the center island counter shes over a thousand years old even humans ate tomatoes then i hesitated they did have tomatoes back then right the hum of jenkss wings audibly dropped crap he muttered then brightened go ahead he said to ceri you try working the nuker this time without my help nuker she questioned carefully wiping her hands on a napkin as she stood yeah dont they have microwaves in the everafter she shook her head sending the tips of her fair hair floating no i prepared als food with ley line magic this isold keasley jerked almost spilling his coffee his eyes tracked ceris grace as she went to the freezer and with jenkss encouragement pulled out a box of fries she meticulously punched the buttons her lip caught between her teeth i thought it odd that the woman was over a thousand years old but thought the microwave was primitive the everafter keasley said softly and my attention returned to him i held my coffee before me with both hands warming my fingers how is she he shifted his shoulders shes healthy enough maybe a little underweight mentally shes been abused i cant tell what or how she needs help i took a deep breath looking down into my cup ive got a big favor to ask keasley straightened no he said as he put his bag on his lap and started putting things in it i dont know whoor even whatshe is i stole her from the demon whose work you stitched up last fall i said touching my neck she was itsi mean hisfamiliar ill pay for her room and board that isnt it he protested bag in hand his tired brown eyes went worried i dont know anything about her rachel i cant risk taking her in dont ask me to do this i leaned over the space between us almost angry she has been in the everafter the last millennium i dont think shes out to kill you i accused and his leathery features shifted to a startled alarm all she needs i said flustered that i had found one of his fears is a normal setting where she can regain her personality and a witch a vampire and a pixy living in a church running down bad guys isnt normal jenks looked at us from ceris shoulder as the woman watched her fries warm the pixys face was serious he could hear the conversation as clearly as if he was standing on the table ceri asked him a soft question and he turned away answering her cheerfully he had chased all but jih out of the kitchen and it was blessedly quiet please keasley i whispered jihs ethereal voice rose in song and ceris face lit up she joined in her voice clear as the pixys managing only three notes before she started to cry i stared as a cloud of pixies rolled into the kitchen almost smothering her from the living room came an irate shout as ivy complained that the pixies were interfering with the stereo reception again jenks yelled at his kids and all but jih flitted out together they consoled ceri jih soft and soothing jenks somewhat awkwardly keasley slumped and i knew hed do it okay he said ill try it for a few days but if it doesnt work shes coming back fair enough i said feeling a huge weight slip off my chest ceri looked up her eyes still wet you didnt ask me my opinion my eyes widened and my face flamed her hearing was as good as ivys um i stammered im sorry ceri its not that i dont want you to stay here heartshaped face solemn she nodded i am a stumbling stone in a fortress of soldiers she interrupted id be honored to stay with the retired warrior and ease his hurts retired warrior i thought wondering what she saw in keasley that i didnt in the corner came a highpitched argument between jenks and his eldest daughter the young pixy was wringing the hem of her pale green dress her tiny feet showing as she pleaded with him now wait a moment keasley said curling the top of his paper bag down i can take care of myself i dont need anyone easing my hurts ceri smiled my slippers on her feet made a hush across the linoleum as she came to kneel before him ceri i protested right along with keasley but the young woman batted our hands away the suddenly sharp look in her green eyes brooking no interference get up keasley said gruffly as he sat before her i know you were a demons familiar and this might be how he made you act but be still keasley ceri said a faint glow of everafter red blurring her pale hands i want to go with you but only if you let me return your kindness she smiled up at him her green eyes losing their focus it will give me a feeling of selfworth i truly need my breath caught as i felt her tap the ley line out back keasley i said my voice high his brown eyes went wide and he froze where he sat as ceri reached out and placed her hands upon the knees of his workfaded overalls i watched his face go slack the wrinkles sliding into themselves to make him look older he took a deep breath stiffening kneeling before him ceri shivered her hands dropped from him ceri keasley said his raspy voice cracking he touched his knees its gone he whispered his tired eyes going watery oh dear child he said standing to help her rise i havent been without pain for so long thank you ceri smiled tears leaking out as she nodded neither have i this helps i turned away my throat tight i have some tshirts you can wear until i take you shopping i said just keep my slippers theyll get you across the street at least keasley took her arm in one hand his bag in the other ill take her shopping tomorrow he said as he headed for the hallway i havent felt good enough to go to the mall in three years it will do me good to get out he turned to me his old wrinkled face transformed ill send the bill to you though i can tell everyone she is my sisters niece from sweden i laughed finding it was very close to a cry this was working out better than i had hoped and i couldnt stop smiling jenks made a sharp noise and his daughter slowly drooped to land upon the microwave all right ill ask he shouted and she rose three inches her face hopeful and her hands clasped before her if its okay with your mother and its okay with keasley its okay with me jenks said his wings a dismal blue jih rose and fell in obvious nervousness as jenks hovered before keasley um do you have any plants at your house that jih might tend he asked looking terribly embarrassed brushing his blond hair from his eyes he made a wry face she wants to go with ceri but im not letting her leave unless she can be productive my lips parted i sent my eyes to ceri seeing by her held breath that she clearly wanted the company ive got a pot of basil keasley said reluctantly if she wants to stay when the weather breaks she can work the garden such as it is jih squealed pixy dust falling from her in a gold shimmer that turned to white ask your mother jenks said looking upset as the excited pixy girl zipped out he landed on my shoulder wings drooping i thought i could smell autumn before i could ask jenks a shrill tide of pink and green flowed into the kitchen appalled i wondered if there was a pixy in the church that wasnt in that fourfoot circle surrounding ceri keasleys wrinkled face was filled with a stoic acceptance as he unrolled the bag of supplies and jih dropped inside to make the trip safe from the cold above the crinkled top of the bag the pixies all cried goodbye and waved eyes rolling keasley handed the bag to ceri pixies i heard him mutter taking ceris elbow he nodded to me and headed into the hall his pace faster and more upright than id ever seen it i have a second bedroom he said do you sleep at night or during the day both she said softly is that all right he grinned to show his coffeestained teeth a napper eh good i wont feel so old when i drop off i felt happy as i watched them head to the sanctuary this was going to be good in so many ways whats the matter jenks i said as he remained on my shoulder while the rest of his family accompanied ceri and keasley to the front of the church he sniffed i thought jax would be the first one to leave to start his own garden my breath slipped from me in understanding im sorry jenks shell be fine i know i know his wings shifted into motion sending the scent of fallen leaves over me one less pixy in the church he said softly its a good thing but no one told me it was going to hurt four squinting over my sunglasses i leaned against my car and scanned the parking lot my cherry red convertible looked out of place among the scattering of minivans and saltrusted late model cars at the back away from potential scratches and dings was a lowtotheground gray sports car probably the zoos pr person as everyone else was either a parttime worker or a dedicated biologist who didnt care what they drove the early hour made it cold despite the sun and my breath steamed i tried to relax but i could feel my gut tightening as my annoyance grew nick was supposed to meet me here this morning for a quick run in the zoo it looked like he was going to be a noshow again i uncrossed my arms from in front of me and shook my hands to loosen them before i bent at the waist and put my palms against the icecold snowdusted parking lot exhaling into the stretch i felt my muscles pull around me were the soft familiar sounds of the zoo preparing to open mixing with the scent of exotic manure if nick didnt show in the next five minutes there wouldnt be enough time for a decent run i had bought us both runner passes months ago so we could run anytime from midnight to noon when the park was closed i had woken up two hours earlier than usual for this i was trying to make this work i was trying to find a way to mesh my witchs noontosunup schedule with nicks human sunrisetomidnight clock it had never seemed to be a problem before nick used to try lately it had been all up to me a harsh scraping pulled me upright the trash cans were being rolled out and my pique grew where was he he couldnt have forgotten nick never forgot anything unless he wants to forget i whispered giving myself a mental shake i swung my right leg up to put my lightweight running shoe atop the hood ow i breathed as my muscles protested but i leaned into it id been slacking off on my workouts lately as ivy and i didnt spar anymore since she had resumed succumbing to her blood lust my eye started to twitch and i closed both of them as i deepened the stretch grabbing my ankle and pulling nick hadnt forgottenhe was too smart for thathe was avoiding me i knew why but it was still depressing it had been three months and he was still distant and hesitant the worst thing was i didnt think he was dumping me the man called demons into his linen closet and he was afraid to touch me last fall i had been trying to bind a fish to me to satisfy some inane ley line class requirement and accidentally made nick my familiar instead stupid stupid stupid i was an earth witch my magic coming from growing things and quickened by heat and my blood i didnt know much about ley line magicexcept i didnt like it i generally only used it to close protective circles when i was stirring a particularly sensitive spell and to make the howlers pay what they owed me and occasionally to fend off my roommate when she lost control of her blood lust and i had used it to knock piscary flat on his can so i could beat him into submission with the leg of a chair it had been this last one that tipped nick from hotandheavy maybethisistheone boyfriend to phone conversations and cold kisses on my cheek starting to feel sorry for myself i pulled my right leg down and swung the left one up ley line magic was heady in its rush of strength and could drive a witch insane making it no accident that there were more black ley line witches than black earth witches using a familiar made it safer since the power of a ley line was filtered through the simpler minds of animals instead of through plants as earth magic did for obvious reasons only animals were used as familiarsat least on this side of the ley linesand in truth there were no witchborn spells to bind a human as a familiar but being both fairly ignorant of ley line magic and rushed i had used the first spell i found to bind a familiar so i had unknowingly made nick my familiarwhich we were trying to undobut then i made things immeasurably worse by pulling a huge amount of ley line energy through him to subdue piscary he had hardly touched me since but that had been months ago i hadnt done it again he had to get over it it wasnt as if i was practicing ley line magic much uneasy i straightened blowing out my angst and doing a few side twists to send my ponytail bouncing after having learned it was possible to set a circle without drawing it first i had spent three months learning how knowing it might be my only chance to escape algaliarept i had kept my practice to three in the morning when i knew nick was asleepand i always drew directly off the line so it wouldnt go through nick firstbut maybe it was waking him up anyway he hadnt said anything but knowing nick he wouldnt the rattle of the gate opening brought me to a standstill and my shoulders slumped the zoo was open a few runners straggling out with red cheeks and exhausted content expressions still floating on a runners high damn it he could have called bothered i unzipped my belt pack and pulled out my cell phone leaning against the car and looking down to avoid the eyes of the passing people i scrolled through my short list nicks was second right after ivys number and right before my moms my fingers were cold and i blew on them as the phone rang i took a breath when the connection clicked open holding it when a recorded womans voice told me the line was no longer in service money i thought maybe that was why we hadnt been out for three weeks concerned i tried his cell phone it was still ringing when the familiar choking rumble of nicks truck grew loud exhaling i snapped the cover closed nicks blue beatup ford truck jostled off the main street and into the parking lot maneuvering slowly as the cars leaving were ignoring the lines and cutting across the expanse i slipped the phone away and stood with my arms over my chest legs crossed at my ankles at least he showed i thought as i adjusted my sunglasses and tried not to frown maybe we could go out for coffee or something i hadnt seen him in days and i didnt want to ruin it with a bad temper besides i had been worried sick the last three months about slipping my bargain with al and now that i had i wanted to feel good for a while i hadnt told nick and the chance to come clean would be another weight off me i lied to myself that i had kept quiet because i was afraid he would try to take my burdenseeing as he had a chivalrous streak longer and wider than a sixlane highwaybut in reality i was afraid he would call me a hypocrite since i was forever on him about the dangers of dealing with demons and here i was becoming ones familiar nick had an unhealthy lack of fear when it came to demons thinking that as long as you handled them properly they were no more dangerous than saya pit viper so i stood and fidgeted in the cold as he parked his saltstained ugly truck a few slots down from mine his indistinct shadow moved inside as he shuffled about finally getting out and slamming the door with an intensity that i knew wasnt directed at me but necessary to get the worn latch to catch rayray he said as he held his phone up and strode around the front his lean height looked good and his pace was quick a smile was on his face its oncegauntness muted into a pleasant rugged severity did you just call i nodded letting my arms fall to my sides obviously he wasnt prepared to run as he was dressed in faded jeans and boots a thick fabric coat was unzipped to show a bland flannel buttondown shirt it was neatly tucked in and his long face was cleanshaven but he still managed to look mildly unkempt with his short black hair a shade too long he had a bookish mien instead of the hint of danger that i usually liked in my men but maybe i found nicks danger to be his intelligence nick was the smartest man i knew his brilliant jumps of logic hidden behind an understated appearance and a deceptively mild temperament in hindsight it was probably this rare mix of wicked intellect and harmless human that attracted me to him or possibly that he had saved my life by binding big al when he tried to rip out my throat and despite nicks preoccupation with old books and new electronics he wasnt a geek his shoulders were too broad and his butt was too tight his long lean legs could keep up with me when we ran and there was a surprising amount of strength in his arms as evidenced by our once frequent now distressingly absent mock wrestling which more often than not had turned into a more er intimate activity it was the memory of our oncecloseness that kept the frown off my face when he came around the front of his truck his brown eyes pinched in apology i didnt forget he said his long face looking longer as he tossed his straight bangs out of his way there was a flash of a demon mark high on his brow gained the same night i had gotten my first and remaining one i got caught up in what i was doing and lost track of time im sorry rachel i know you were looking forward to it but i havent even been to bed and im dead tired do you want to reschedule for tomorrow i kept my reaction to a sigh trying to stifle my disappointment no i said around a long exhalation he reached out his arms going around me in a light hug i leaned into the expected hesitancy of it wanting more the distance had been there so long that it almost felt normal pulling back he shuffled his feet working hard i offered this was the first time i had seen him in a week not including the odd phone call and i didnt just want to walk away nick too didnt seem eager to leave yes and no he squinted into the sun i was up sifting through old messages on a chatroom list after finding a mention of that book al took immediately my attention sharpened did you i stammered pulse quickening my quick hope squished to nothing as he dropped his gaze and shook his head it was some freak wannabe he doesnt have a copy it was all madeup nonsense i reached out and briefly touched his arm forgiving him for missing our morning run its okay well find something sooner or later yeah he muttered but id rather it be sooner misery hit me and i froze we had been so good together and now all that was left was this awful distance seeing my depression nick took my hands stepping forward to give me a loose embrace his lips brushed my cheek as he whispered im sorry rayray well manage something im trying i want this to work i didnt move breathing in the smell of musty books and clean aftershave my hands hesitantly going about him as i looked for comfortand finally found it my breath caught and i held it refusing to cry we had been months searching for the counter curse but al wrote the book on how to make humans into familiars and he had a very short print run of one and it wasnt as if we could advertise in the papers for a ley line professor to help us as he or she would likely turn me in for dealing in the black arts and then id really be stuck or dead or worse slowly nick let go and i stepped back at least i knew it wasnt another woman hey uh the zoo is open i said my voice giving away my relief that the awkward distance he had been holding himself at finally seemed to be easing you want to go in and get a coffee instead i hear their monkey mocha is to come back from the dead for no he said but there was true regret in his voice making me wonder if he had been picking up on my worry about al all this time thinking i was upset with him and drawing away maybe more of this was my fault than i had guessed maybe i could have forged a stronger union between us if i had told him instead of hiding it from him and driving him away the magnitude of what i might have done with my silence fell on me and i felt my face go cold nick im sorry i breathed it wasnt your fault he said his brown eyes full of forgiveness unaware of my thoughts i was the one that told him he could have the book no you see he took me in a hug silencing me a lump formed in my throat and i couldnt say anything as my forehead dropped to his shoulder i should have told him i should have told him right from the first night nick felt the shift in me and slowly after a moments thought he gave me a tentative kiss on the cheek but it was a tentativeness born from his long absence not his usual hesitancy nick i said hearing the coming tears in my voice immediately he pulled back hey he said smiling as his long hand rested on my shoulder ive got to go ive been up since yesterday and i have to get some sleep i took a reluctant step back hoping he couldnt tell how close to tears i was it had been a long lonely three months at last something seemed to be mending okay you want to come over for dinner tonight and finally after weeks of quick refusals he paused how about a movie and dinner instead my treat a real datething i straightened feeling myself grow taller a date thing i said moving awkwardly foottofoot like a fool teenager asked to her first dance what do you have in mind he smiled softly something with lots of explosions lots ofguns he didnt touch me but i saw in his eyes his desire to do so tight costumes i nodded smiling and he checked his watch tonight he said catching my eye as he headed back to his truck seven oclock seven oclock i called back my good feeling growing he got in the truck shaking as he slammed the door the engine rumbled to life and with a happy wave he drove away seven oclock i said watching the taillights flash before he jostled onto the street five plastic hangers clattering i stacked the clothes on the counter beside the cash register the bored bottledyed blonde with earlength hair never looked up as her fingers manipulated those nasty metal clips gum snapping she pointed her gun at everything adding up my purchases for ceri she had a phone to her ear head cocked and her mouth never stopped as she chatted to her boyfriend about getting her roommate fried on brimstone last night i eyed her in speculation breathing in the fading aroma of the street drug lingering on her she was dumber than she looked if she was dabbling in brimstone especially now it had been coming in cut with a little something extra lately leaving a rash of deaths spanning all the socioeconomic brackets maybe it was trents idea of a christmas present the girl before me looked underage so i could either sic health and inderland services on her or haul her ass down to the is lockup the latter might be fun but it would put a real crimp in my afternoon of solstice shopping i still didnt know what to get ivy the boots jeans socks underwear and two sweaters on the counter were for ceri she was not going out with keasley dressed in one of my tshirts and pink fuzzy slippers the girl folded the last sweater her bloodred manicure garish amulets clanked about her neck but the complexion charm hiding her acne needed to be replaced she must have been a warlock because a witch wouldnt be caught dead with a bassackward charm like that i glanced at my wooden pinky ring it might be small but it was now potent enough to hide my freckles through a minor spell check hack i thought feeling vastly better a hum rose from nowhere and i felt smug that i didnt jump like the register girl when jenks all but fell onto the counter he was wearing two black body stockings one atop the other and had a red hat and boots on against the chill it was really too cold for him to be out but jihs leaving had depressed him and hed never been solstice shopping before my eyes widened as i took in the doll he had lugged to the counter it was three times his size rache he exclaimed puffing as he pushed the blackhaired curvaceous plastic homage to adolescent boys dreams upright look what i found it was in the toy department jenks i cajoled hearing the couple behind me snicker its a bitemebetty doll he exclaimed his wings moving furiously to keep himself upright his hands on the dolls thighs i want it i want to get it for ivy it looks just like her eyeing the shiny plastic leather skirt and red vinyl bustier i took a breath to protest look see he said his voice excited you push the lever in her back and fake blood squirts out isnt it great i started when a gelatinous goo jumped from the blankeyed dolls mouth arching a good foot before hitting the counter a red smear dripped down her pointy chin the register girl eyed it then hung up on her boyfriend he wanted to give this to ivy pushing ceris jeans out of the way i sighed jenks hit the lever again watching in rapt attention as red squirted out with a rude sound the couple behind me laughed the woman hanging on his arm and whispering in his ear warming i grabbed the doll ill buy it for you if you stop that i all but hissed eyes bright jenks rose up to land on my shoulder tucking in between my neck and my scarf to stay warm shes gonna love it he said you watch pushing it at the girl behind the counter i glanced behind me at the tittering couple they were living vamps welldressed and unable to go thirty seconds without touching each other knowing i was watching the woman straightened the collar of his leather jacket to show off his lightly scarred neck the thought of nick brought a smile to me the first time in weeks as the girl recalculated my total i dug in my bag for my checkbook it was nice having money real nice rache jenks questioned can you put a bag of mms in there too his wings sent a cold draft against my neck as he set them vibrating to generate some body heat it wasnt as if he could wear a coatnot with those wings of hisand anything heavy was too limiting i snatched up a bag of overpriced candy whose handlettered cardboard sign said the sale would go to help rebuild the firedamaged city shelters i already had my total but she could add it on and if the vamps behind me had a problem with that they could curl up and die twice it was for orphans for gods sake the girl reached for the candy and beeped it giving me a snotty look the register chirped to give me the new total and as they all waited i flipped to the check register freezing i blinked it had been balanced with neat tidy numbers i hadnt bothered to keep a running total as i knew there was tons of money in it but someone had then i brought it closer staring thats it i exclaimed thats all i have left jenks cleared his throat surprise he said weakly it was just laying there in your desk and i thought id balance it for you he hesitated sorry its almost gone i stammered my face probably as red as my hair the eyes of the register girl were suddenly wary embarrassed i finished writing out the check she took it calling her supervisor to run it through their system to make sure it was good behind me the vamp couple started in with a snarky commentary ignoring them i flipped through the check register to see where it went almost two grand for my new desk and bedroom set four more for insulating the church and for a garage for my new car i wasnt about to let it sit out in the snow then there was the insurance and gas a big chunk went to ivy for my back rent another chunk went to my night in the emergency room for my broken arm as i hadnt had insurance at the time a third chunk to get insurance and the resti swallowed hard there was money still in there but i had enjoyed myself down from twenty thousand to high four figures in only three months um rache jenks said i was going to ask you later but i know this accounting guy you want me to have him set up an ira for you i was looking at your finances and you might need a shelter this year seeing as you havent been taking anything out for taxes a tax shelter i felt sick theres nothing left to put into it taking my bags from the girl i headed for the door and what are you doing looking at my finances im living in your desk he said wryly its kind of all out there i sighed my desk my beautiful solidoak desk with nooks and crannies and a secret cubby at the bottom of the lefthand drawer my desk that i had used for only three weeks before jenks and his brood moved into it my desk which was now so thickly covered in potted plants that it looked like a prop for a horror movie about killer plants taking over the world but it was either that or have them set up housekeeping in the kitchen cupboards no not my kitchen having them stage daily mock battles among the hanging pots and utensils was bad enough distracted i tugged my coat closer and squinted at the bright light reflecting off the snow as the sliding doors opened whoa wait up jenks shrilled in my ear when the blast of cold air hit us what the hell do you think youre doing witch do i look like im made of fur sorry i made a quick left turn to get out of the draft and opened my shoulder bag for him still swearing he dropped down to hide inside he hated it but there was no alternative a sustained temp lower than fortyfive degrees would throw him into a hibernation that would be unsafe to break until spring but he should be all right in my bag a were dressed in a thick wool coat that went to his boot tops edged from me with an uncomfortable look when i tried to make eye contact he pulled his cowboy hat down and turned away a frown crossed me i hadnt had a were client since i made the howlers pay me for trying to get their mascot back maybe id made a mistake there hey give me those mms okay jenks grumbled up at me his short blond hair framing delicate features reddened by the cold im starving here i obediently shuffled through the bags and dropped the candy in to him before pulling the ties to my shoulder bag shut i didnt like bringing him out like this but i was his partner not his mom he enjoyed being the only adult male pixy in cincinnati not in a stupor in his eyes the entire city was probably his garden as cold and snowy as it was i took a moment to dig my zebrastriped car key out from the front pocket the couple that had been behind me in line passed me on their way out flirting comfortably and looking like sex in leather he had bought her a bitemebetty doll too and they were laughing my thoughts went to nick again and a warm stir of anticipation took me putting my shades on against the glare i went out to the sidewalk keys jingling and bag held tight to me even making the trip in my bag jenks was going to get cold i told myself i should make cookies so he could bask in the heat of the cooling oven it had been ages since id made solstice cookies i was sure i had seen some floursmeared cookie cutters in a nasty zippy bag at the back of a cupboard somewhere all i needed was the colored sugar to do it right my mood brightened at the sight of my car ankledeep in crusty slush at the curb yeah it was as expensive as a vampire princess to maintain but it was mine and i looked really good sitting behind the wheel with the top down and the wind pulling my long hair back not springing for the garage hadnt been an option it chirped happily at me as i unlocked it and dropped my bags in the unusable backseat i folded myself into the front setting jenks carefully on my lap where he might stay a little warmer the heat went on fullbore as soon as i got the engine started i tunked it into gear and was ready to pull out when a long white car slid up alongside in a slow hush of sound affronted i glared as it doubleparked to block me in hey i exclaimed when the driver got out in the middle of the freaking road to open the door for his employer ticked i jammed it into neutral got out of my car and jerked my bag farther up my shoulder hey im trying to leave here i shouted wanting to bang on the roof of the car but my protests choked to nothing when the side door opened and an older man wearing scads of gold necklaces stuck his head out his frizzed blond hair went out in all directions blue eyes glinting in suppressed excitement he beckoned to me ms morgan he exclaimed softly can i talk to you i took my sunglasses off staring takata i stammered the older rocker winced his face sliding into faint wrinkles as he glanced over the few pedestrians they had noticed the limo and with my outburst the jig as they say was up eyes pinched in exasperation takata stretched out a long skinny hand jerking me off my feet and into the limo i gasped holding my bag so i didnt squish jenks as i fell into the plush seat across from him go the musician cried and the driver shut the door and jogged to the front my car i protested my door was open and my keys were in the ignition arron takata said gesturing to a man in a black tshirt tucked into a corner of the expansive vehicle he slipped past me in a tang of blood that pegged him as a vamp there was a flush of cold air as he got out quickly thumping the door shut behind him i watched through the tinted window as he slipped into my leather seats to look predatory with his shaved head and dark shades i only hoped i looked half that good the muffled sound of my engine revved twice then we jerked into motion as the first of the groupies started patting the windows heart pounding i spun to look out the back window while we pulled away my car was edging carefully past the people standing in the road shouting at us to come back it worked its way into the clear quickly catching up and running a red light to stay with us stunned at how fast it had been i turned the aging pop star was wearing outlandish orange slacks he had a matching vest over a soothing earthtoned shirt everything was silk which i thought was his only saving grace god help him even his shoes were orange and socks i winced it kind of went with the gold chains and blond hair which had been teased out until it was so big it could frighten small children his complexion was whiter than mine and i dearly wanted to pull out the woodframed glasses that i had spelled to see through earth charms to know if he had hidden freckles uh hi i stammered and the man grinned showing his impulsive wickedly intelligent demeanor and his tendency to find the fun in everything even if the world was falling apart around him actually the innovated artist had done just that his garage band making the jump to stardom during the turn capitalizing on the opportunity to be the first openly inderland band he was a cincy hometown boy who had made good and he returned the favor by donating the proceeds of his winter solstice concerts to the citys charities it was particularly important this year as a series of arson fires had decimated many of the homeless shelters and orphanages ms morgan the man said touching the side of his big nose his attention went over my shoulder and out the back window hope i didnt startle you his voice was deep and carefully schooled beautiful i was a sucker for beautiful voices um no setting my shades aside i unwound my scarf how are you doing your hair looksgreat he laughed easing my nervousness we had met five years ago and had coffee over a conversation centering on the trials of curly hair that he not only remembered me but also wanted to talk was flattering it looks like hell he said touching the long frizz that had been in dreadlocks when we last met but my pr woman says it ups my sales by two percent he stretched his long legs out to take up almost the entirety of one side of the limo i smiled you need another charm to tame it i said reaching for my bag my breath caught in alarm jenks i exclaimed jerking the bag open jenks came boiling out about time you remembered me he snarled what the turn is going on i nearly snapped my wing falling onto your phone you got mms all over your purse and ill be dammed before i pick them up where in tinks garden are we i smiled weakly at takata ah takata i started this is jenks caught sight of him a burst of pixy dust exploded lighting the car for an instant and making me jump holy crap the pixy exclaimed youre takata i thought rachel was pissing on my daisies about knowing you sweet mother of tink wait until i tell matalina its really you damn its really you takata reached over and adjusted a knob on an elaborate console and heat poured out of the vents yeah its really me do you want an autograph hell yes the pixy said no one will believe me i smiled settling myself farther into the seat my fluster vanishing at jenkss star fawning takata tugged a picture of him and his band standing before the great wall of china from a dogeared folder who do i make it out to he said and jenks froze uh he stammered his hovering wings going still i shot my hand out to catch him and his featherlight weight hit my palm um he stuttered panicking make it out to jenks i said and jenks made a tiny sound of relief yeah jenks the pixy said finding the presence of mind to flit over to stand on the photo as takata signed it with an illegible signature my name is jenks takata handed me the picture to carry home for him pleasure to meet you jenks yeah jenks squeaked nice to meet you too making another impossibly high noise to get my eyelids aching he darted from me to takata like an insane firefly park it jenks i breathed knowing the pixy could hear me even if takata couldnt my name is jenks he said as he lit atop my shoulder quivering when i carefully put the photo in my bag his wings couldnt stay still and the comeandgo draft felt good in the stifling air of the limo i returned my gaze to takata taken aback at the empty look on his face what i asked thinking something was wrong immediately he straightened nothing he said i heard you quit the is to go out on your own he blew his air out in a long exhalation that took guts it was stupid i admitted thinking of the death threat my past employer had set on me in retaliation though i wouldnt change a thing he smiled looking satisfied you like being on your own its hard without a corporation backing you i said but ive got people to catch me if i fall i trust them over the is any day takatas head bobbed to make his long hair shift im with you on that his feet were spread wide against the cars motion and i was starting to wonder why i was sitting in takatas limo not that i was complaining we were on the expressway looping about the city my convertible trailing three car lengths behind as long as youre here he said suddenly i want your opinion on something sure i said thinking his mind jumped from topic to topic worse than nicks i loosened the tie on my coat it was starting to get warm in there capital he said flipping open the guitar case beside him and pulling a beautiful instrument from the crushed green velvet my eyes widened im going to release a new track at the solstice concert he hesitated you did know i was playing at the coliseum ive got tickets i said my flash of excitement growing nick had bought them i had been worried he was going to cancel on me and id end up going to fountain square for the solstice as i usually did putting my name in the lottery to close the ceremonial circle there the large inlaid circle had a permit only use status except for the solstices and halloween but now i had a feeling we would be spending our solstice together great takata said i was hoping you would well i have this piece about a vampire pining after someone he cant have and i dont know which chorus works the best ripley likes the darker one but arron says the other fits better he sighed showing an unusual bother ripley was his were drummer the only band member to have been with takata for most of his career it was said she was the reason everyone else only lasted a year or two before striking out on their own i had planned on singing it live the first time on the solstice takata said but i want to release it to wvmp tonight to give cincinnati a chance to hear it first he grinned to look years younger its more of a high when they sing along he glanced at the guitar in his lap and strummed a chord the vibration filled the car my shoulders slumped and jenks made a choking gurgle takata looked up his eyes wide in question youll tell me which one you like better he asked and i nodded my own personal concert yeah i could go for that jenks made that choking gurgle again okay its called red ribbons taking a breath takata slumped eyes vacant he modified the chord he had been playing his thin fingers shifted elegantly and with his head bent over his music he sang hear you sing through the curtain see you smile through the glass wipe your tears in my thoughts no amends for the past didnt know it would consume me no one said the hurt would last his voice dropped and took on the tortured sound that had made him famous no one told me no one told me he finished almost whispering ooooh nice i said wondering if he really thought i was capable of making a judgment he flashed me a smile throwing off his stage presence that quickly okay he said hunching over his guitar again this is the other one he played a darker chord sounding almost wrong a shudder rippled its way up my spine and i stifled it takatas posture shifted becoming fraught with pain the vibrating strings seemed to echo through me and i sank back into the leather seats the humming of the engine carrying the music right to my core youre mine he almost breathed in some small fashion youre mine though you know it not youre mine bond born of passion youre mine yet wholly you by way of your will by way of your will by way of your will his eyes were closed and i didnt think he remembered i was sitting across from him um i stammered and his blue eyes flashed open looking almost panicked i think the first one i offered as he regained his composure the man was more flighty than a drawer full of geckos i like the second better but the first fits with the vampire watching what she cant have i blinked what he cant have i amended flushing god help me i must look like a fool he probably knew i roomed with a vampire that she and i werent sharing blood probably hadnt made it into his report the scar on my neck wasnt from her but from big al and i tugged my scarf up to hide it he looked almost shaky as he put his guitar aside the first he questioned seeming to want to say something else and i nodded okay he said forcing a smile the first it is there was another choked gurgle from jenks i wondered if he would recover enough to make more than that ugly sound takata snapped the latches on his instrument case and i knew the chitchat was over ms morgan he said the rich confines of the limo seeming sterile now that it was empty of his music i wish i could say i looked you up for your opinion on which chorus i should release but i find myself in a tight spot and you were recommended to me by a trusted associate mr felps said he has worked with you before and that you had the utmost discretion call me rachel i said the man was twice my age making him call me ms morgan was ridiculous rachel he said as jenks choked again takata gave me an uncertain smile and i returned it not sure what was going on it sounded like he had a run for me something that required the anonymity that the is or the fib couldnt provide as jenks gurgled and pinched the rim of my ear i straightened crossed my knees and pulled my little datebook out of my bag to try to look professional ivy had bought it for me two months ago in one of her attempts to bring order to my chaotic life i only carried it to appease her but setting up a run for a nationally renowned pop star might be the time to start using it a mr felps recommended me to you i said searching my memory and coming up blank takatas thick expressive eyebrows were high in confusion he said he knew you he seemed quite enamored actually a sound of understanding slipped past me oh is he a living vamp by chance blond hair thinks hes gods gift to the living and the dead i asked hoping i was wrong he grinned you do know him he glanced at jenks quivering and unable to open his mouth i thought he was pissing in my daisies my eyes closed as i gathered my strength kisten why didnt that surprise me yeah i know him i muttered as i opened my eyes not sure if i should be angry or flattered that the living vampire had recommended me to takata i didnt know his last name was felps disgusted i gave up on my attempt at being professional throwing my datebook back into my bag i slouched in the corner my movement less graceful than i hoped as it was pushed along by the cars motion as we shifted lanes so what can i do for you i asked the older warlock straightened tugging the soft orange of his slacks straight id never known anyone who could look good in orange but takata managed it its about the upcoming concert he said i wanted to see if your firm was available for security oh i licked my lips puzzled sure thats no problem but dont you have people for that already i asked remembering the tight security at the concert id met him at vamps had to cap their teeth and no one got in with more than a makeup spell course once past security the caps came off and the amulets hidden in shoes were invoked he nodded yes and therein lies the problem i waited as he leaned forward sending the scent of redwood to me long musician hands laced he eyed the floor i arranged security with mr felps as usual before i got into town he said when his attention came back to me but a mr saladan came to see me claiming hes handling security in cincinnati and that all monies owed to piscary should be directed to him instead my breath came out in understanding protection oh i got it kisten was acting as piscarys scion since very few people knew that ivy had displaced him and now held the coveted title kisten continued to handle the undead vampires affairs while ivy refused to thank god youre paying for protection i said you want me to talk to kisten and mr saladan to get them to stop blackmailing you takata tilted his head back his beautiful tragic voice ringing out in laugher that was soaked up by the thick carpet and leather seats no he said piscary does a damnedfine job of keeping the inderlanders in line my concern is with mr saladan appalled but not surprised i tucked my red curls behind my ear wishing i had done something with them that afternoon yeah i used blackmail but it was to keep myself alive not make money there was a difference its blackmail i said disgusted he went solemn its a service and i dont begrudge a dime of it seeing my frown takata leaned forward to send his gold chains swinging his blue eyes fixing on mine my show has an mpl just like a traveling circus or fair i wouldnt keep it one night if it wasnt for arranging protection at every city we play in its the cost of doing business mpl was short for mixed population license it guaranteed that there was security in place to prevent bloodletting on the premises a necessity when inderlanders and humans mixed if too many vampires gathered and one succumbed to his or her blood lust the rest were hardpressed to not follow suit i was never sure how a slip of paper was enough to keep hungerdriven vampires mouths to themselves but establishments worked hard to keep an a rating on their mpls since humans and living inderlanders would boycott any place that didnt have one it was too easy to end up dead or mentally bound to a vampire you didnt even know and personally id rather be dead than be a vampires toy my living with a vampire aside its blackmail i said we had just passed the bridge to cross the ohio river i wondered where we were going if it wasnt the hollows takatas thin shoulders moved when im touring im at any one place for one night maybe two if someone starts trouble we wont be around long enough to track them down and every goth out there knows it wheres the incentive for an excited vamp or were to behave him or herself piscary puts the word out that anyone causing trouble will answer to him i looked up not liking that it made beautiful simplistic sense i have an incidentfree show takata said smiling and piscary gets seven percent of the ticket sales everyone wins up to now ive been very satisfied with piscarys services i didnt even mind he upped his cost to pay for his lawyer snorting i dropped my eyes my fault i said so i hear the lanky man said dryly mr felps was very impressed but saladan takata grew concerned his expressive fingers drumming out a complicated rhythm as his gaze went to the passing buildings i cant afford to pay both of them there would be nothing left to rebuild the citys shelters and thats the entire point to the concert you want me to make sure nothing happens i said and he nodded my eyes tracked the jim beam bottler just off the expressway while i took that in saladan was trying to muscle in on piscarys turf now that the undead master vampire was put away for murder murders that i staked to him i tilted my head in a vain attempt to see jenks on my shoulder i have to talk to my other partner but i dont see a problem i said there will be three of us me a living vamp and a human i wanted nick to go even if he wasnt officially part of our firm me jenks squeaked me too me too i didnt want to speak for you jenks i said it might be cold takata chuckled with all that body heat and under those lights no way then its settled i said terribly pleased im assuming we get special passes yes takata twisted to reach under the folder that held his bands pictures these will get you past clifford from there it shouldnt be a problem super i said delighted as i dug in my bag for one of my cards heres my card in case you have to get in touch with me between then and now things were starting to happen fast and i took the wad of thick cardboard he gave me in return for my black business card he smiled as he looked at it and tucked it away in a front shirt pocket turning with that same soft look he tapped a thick knuckle on the glass between the driver and us i clutched my bag to me when we swerved to the shoulder thank you rachel he said as the car stopped right there on the freeway ill see you on the twentysecond about noon at the coliseum so you can go over our security with my staff sounds good i stammered as jenks swore and dove for my bag when the door opened cold air blew in and i squinted in the afternoon glare behind us was my car he was going to leave me right here rachel i mean it thank you takata extended his hand i took giving it a firm shake his grip was tight feeling thin and bony in mine professional i really appreciate it he said as he released my hand you did good by quitting the is you look great i couldnt help but smile thank you i said letting the driver help me out of the limo the vamp driving my car slipped past me and vanished into the darkest corner of the limo as i tightened the tie of my coat and draped my scarf about my neck again takata waved his goodbye as the driver shut the door the small tidy man nodded to me before turning around i stood with my feet in the snow as the limo eased into the fast traffic and disappeared bag in hand i timed the traffic and slipped into my car the heater was on full and i breathed the scent of the vamp who had been driving it pulling it deep into me my head hummed with the music takata had shared with me i was going to be working security at his solstice concert it didnt get any better than that six i had gotten myself turned around and back over the ohio river and into the hollows and still jenks hadnt said anything the starstruck pixy had parked himself on his usual spot atop the rearview mirror watching the encroaching snow clouds turn the bright afternoon dark and depressive i didnt think it was the cold that had turned his wings blue as i had the heater cranked it was embarrassment jenks i questioned and his wings blurred to nothing dont say anything he muttered barely audible jenks it wasnt that bad he turned a look of selfdisgust on him i forgot my name rache i couldnt help my smile i wont tell anyone the pink returned to his wings really he asked and i nodded it didnt take a genius to realize it was important to the egodriven pixy to be selfassured and in control i was sure thats where his bad mouth and short temper came from dont tell ivy i said but the first time i met him i fawned all over him he could have taken advantage of me used me like a tissue and thrown me away he didnt he made me feel interesting and important even though i was working peon runs at the is at the time hes cool you know a real person i bet he didnt think twice about you forgetting your name jenks sighed his entire body moving as he exhaled you missed your turn i shook my head breaking at a red light behind an obnoxious suv i couldnt see around the saltstained bumper sticker read some of my best friends are humans yum and i smiled only in the hollows i want to see if nick is awake yet as long as were out i explained my eyes went to jenks youll be all right for a little longer yeah he said im okay but youre making a mistake the light changed and i almost stalled my car we lurched through the intersection slipping on the slush when i gunned it we talked today at the zoo i said feeling warm inside i think were going to be okay and i want to show him the backstage passes his wings made an audible hum you sure rachel i mean that was a big scare when you pulled that ley line through him maybe you shouldnt push it give him some space ive given him three months i muttered not caring that the guy in the car behind me thought i was flirting with him as my eyes were on the rearview mirror any more space and hed be on the moon im not going to rearrange his furniture just show him the passes jenks said nothing his silence making me nervous my worry shifted to puzzlement when i turned into nicks parking lot and stopped beside his beatup blue truck there was a suitcase in the passenger seat it hadnt been there this morning lips parted i glanced at jenks and he shrugged looking unhappy a cold feeling slipped into me my thoughts flitted over our conversation at the zoo we were going to the movies tonight and he was packed he was going somewhere get in my bag i said softly refusing to believe the worst this wasnt the first time i had come over to find nick gone or leaving he had been in and out of cincinnati a lot the last three months me usually being unaware of it until he returned and now his phone was disconnected and there was a packed bag in his truck had i misread him if tonight was supposed to be a dump date i was going to just die rachel im opening the door i said as i stiffly put my keys into my bag you want to stay here and wait and hope it doesnt get too cold jenks flitted to hover before me he looked worried despite his hands being on his hips let me out as soon as were inside he demanded my throat tightened as i nodded and he dropped down with a reluctant slowness i carefully snugged the ties shut on my bag and got out but a swelling feeling of hurt made me slam the door and my little red car shook glancing into the bed of the truck i realized it was dry and empty of snow it seemed likely that nick hadnt been in cincinnati the last few days either no wonder i hadnt seen him last week thoughts spinning i paced up the slippery walk to the common door yanking it open and taking the stairs to leave successively smaller chunks of snow on the gray carpet i remembered to let jenks out at the top of the thirdfloor landing and he hovered silently as he took in my anger we were going out tonight i said as i pulled my gloves off and jammed them in a pocket its been staring at me in the face for weeks jenks the hurried phone calls the trips out of town without telling me the lack of any intimate contact for god knows how long ten weeks jenks said easily keeping up with me oh really i said bitterly thank you so much for that update easy rache he said spilling a trace of pixy dust in his wake from worry it might not be what you think id been dumped before i wasnt stupid but it hurt damn it it still hurt there was nowhere for jenks to land in the barren hallway and he reluctantly lighted on my shoulder jaw clenched so hard it hurt i made a fist to hammer on nicks door he had to be homehe didnt go anywhere without his truckbut before i could the door swung open my arm dropped and i stared at nick my surprise mirrored on his long face his coat was unzipped and a homemade hat of soft blue yarn was pulled tight to his ears he took it off as i watched shifting it and the keys in his grip to his other hand which held a slicklooking briefcase at odds with his otherwise ragtag attire his hair was tousled and he smoothed it with a deft hand while he regained his composure there was snow on his boots unlike his truck keys jingling he set the briefcase down he took a breath then let it slowly out the guilt in his eyes told me i was right hi rayray hi nick i said hitting the k with an excessive force i guess our date is off jenks buzzed a greeting and i hated the apologetic look he gave nick four inches or sixfootfour they were all in the same club nick didnt move to invite me in was tonight a dump dinner i asked abruptly just wanting to be done with it his eyes widened no he protested but his gaze flicked to the briefcase is it someone else nick cause im a big girl i can take it no he repeated his voice softer he shifted looking frustrated he reached out stopping just shy of my shoulder his hand fell no i wanted to believe him i really did then what i demanded why didnt he invite me in why did we have to do this in the freaking hallway rayray he whispered his brow furrowed its not you my eyes closed as i gathered my strength how many times had i heard that his foot shoved the expensive briefcase into the hall and my eyes flew open at the scraping sound i stepped aside as he came out shutting the door behind him its not you he said his voice suddenly hard and it wasnt a dump dinner i dont want to call it quits between us but something came up and frankly its none of your business surprised my lips parted jenkss words flashed through me youre still afraid of me i said pissed that he didnt trust me to not pull a line through him again i am not he offered angrily motions stiff he locked his door from the outside turning to hold the key up between us here he said belligerently take my key ill be out of town for a while i was going to give it to you tonight but since youre here it will save me the trouble ive stopped my mail and the rent is paid up through august august i stammered suddenly afraid he glanced at jenks jenks can jax come over and watch my plants for me until i get back he did a good job last time it might only be a week but the heat and electricity are on automatic draw in case its longer nick i protested my voice sounding small how had this turned around so fast sure jenks said meekly you know i think ill go wait downstairs no im done nick picked up the briefcase im going to be busy tonight but ill swing by later to pick him up before i leave town nick wait i said my stomach clenched and i felt lightheaded i shouldve kept my mouth shut i shouldve ignored the packed bag and played the stupid girlfriend i shouldve gone to dinner and ordered lobster my first real boyfriend in five years and finally when things were starting to get back to normal here i was scaring him off just like all the others jenks made an embarrassed sound uh ill be by the front door he said vanishing down the stairwell to leave a trail of glowing pixy dust all the way to the next landing long face tight in unhappiness nick pushed the key into my hand his fingers were cold i cant he took a breath meeting and holding my eyes i waited frightened at what he was going to say suddenly i didnt want to hear it rachel i was going to tell you this over dinner buti tried i really did i just cant do this right now he said softly im not leaving you he rushed to add before i could open my mouth i love you and i want to be with you maybe for the rest of my life i dont know but every time you tap a line i feel it and its as if im back in that fib cruiser having an epileptic seizure from the line you pulled through me i cant breathe i cant think i cant do anything when im farther away its easier i need to be away for a while i didnt tell you because i didnt want you to feel bad face cold i could say nothing he never told me i had made him seize god help me i hadnt known jenks had been with him why hadnt he told me i have to catch my breath he whispered giving my hands a squeeze to go a few days without remembering that ill stop i said panicking i wont tap a line again nick you dont have to leave yes i do dropping my hands he touched my jawline his smile was pained i want you to pull on a line i want you to practice ley line magic is going to save your life someday and i want you to become the best damned ley line witch cincinnati has he took a breath but i have to put some distance between us just for a while and i have some business of out of state it has nothing to do with you ill be back but he had said august youre not coming back i said my throat closing youll come for your books and then youll be gone rachel no i turned away the key was cold in my hand cutting into my palm breathe i reminded myself just go ill bring jax over tomorrow just go i shut my eyes when he put a hand on my shoulder but i wouldnt turn they flashed open when he leaned closer and the scent of musty books and new electronics filled me thank you rachel he whispered and there was the lightest touch of lips on mine im not leaving you ill be back i held my breath and stared at the ugly gray carpet i wouldnt cry damn it i wouldnt i heard him hesitate then the soft thumps of his boots on the stairs my head started to hurt as the muted rumble of his truck vibrated the window at the end of the hall i waited until i couldnt hear it anymore before i turned to follow him out my steps slow and unseeing id done it again seven i pulled my car carefully into the tiny garage turning off the lights and then the engine depressed i stared at the spackled wall two feet in front of the grille silence soaked in broken by the ticking of the engine cooling off ivys bike rested quietly against the side wall covered in a canvas tarp and stored for the winter it was going to be dark soon i knew i should get jenks inside but it was hard to find the will to unbuckle my belt and get out of the car jenks dropped to the steering wheel with an attentiongetting hum my hands fell into my lap shoulders slumping well at least you know where you stand now he offered my frustration flared then died overwhelmed by a wave of apathy he said hes coming back i said glumly needing to believe the lie until i hardened myself to the truth jenks wrapped his arms about himself dragonfly wings still rache he cajoled i like nick but youre going to get two calls one where he says he misses you and is feeling better and the last when he says hes sorry and asks you to give his key to his landlord for him i looked at the wall just let me be stupid and believe him for a while okay the pixy made a sound of wry agreement he looked positively chilled his wings almost black as he hunched shivering id pushed him past his limits by detouring to nicks i was definitely going to make cookies tonight he shouldnt go to sleep cold like that he might not wake up until spring ready i asked as i opened my bag and he awkwardly jumped down into it instead of flying worried i debated if i should tuck my bag inside my coat i settled on putting it in the department store bag and rolling the edges down as far as i could only now did i open the door being careful not to hit the edge of the garage bag in hand i made my way on the shoveled path to the front door a sleek black corvette was parked at the curb looking out of place and unsafe in the snowy streets i recognized it as kistens and my face tightened id been seeing too much of him lately for my liking the wind bit at my exposed skin and i glanced up at the steeple sharp against the graying clouds mincing on the ice i passed kistens mobile icon of masculinity and rose up the stone steps to the thick wooden double doors there was no conventional lock though there was an oak crossbar inside which i set every sunrise before i went to bed bending awkwardly i scooped out a cup of pelletized deicer from the open bag sitting beside the door and sprinkled it on the steps before the afternoons snowmelt had a chance to freeze i pushed open the door my hair drifting in the warm draft that billowed out soft jazz came with it and i slipped inside to latch it softly behind me i didnt particularly want to see kistenno matter how nice he was on the eyesthough i thought i should probably thank him for recommending me to takata it was dark in the small foyer the glow of dusk slipping in from the sanctuary beyond doing little to light it the air smelled like coffee and growing things sort of a mix between a plant nursery and coffeehouse nice ceris things went atop the small antique table ivy had swiped from her folks and i opened up my bag peering down to see jenks looking up thank god he muttered as he slowly lifted into the air then he hesitated head cocked as he listened where is everyone i shrugged out of my coat and hung it up on a peg maybe ivy yelled at your kids again and theyre hiding are you complaining he shook his head he was right though it was really quiet too quiet usually there were headsplitting shrills of pixy children playing tag an occasional crash from a hanging utensil hitting the kitchen floor or the snarls of ivy chasing them out of the living room the only peace we got were the four hours they slept at noon and four hours again after midnight the warmth of the church was soaking into jenks and already his wings were translucent and moving well i decided to leave ceris things where they were until i could get them across the street to her and after stomping the snow off my boots beside the melting puddles kisten had left i followed jenks out of the dark foyer and into the quiet sanctuary my shoulders eased as i took in the subdued lighting coming in through the kneetoceilinghigh stainedglass windows ivys stately baby grand took up one corner in the front dusted and cared for but played only when i was out my plantstrewn rolltop desk was kittycorner to it way up in the front on the anklehigh stage where the altar once sat the huge image of a cross still shadowed the wall above it soothing and protective the pews had been removed long before i moved in leaving an echoing wooden and glass space redolent of peace solitude grace and security i was safe here jenks stiffened sending my instincts flaming now shrilled a piercing voice jenks shot straight up leaving a cloud of pixy dust hanging where he had been like an octopus inking heart pounding i hit the hardwood floor rolling sharp patters of impacts hit the planks beside me fear kept me spinning until i found a corner heady the strength of the graveyards ley line surged through me as i tapped it rachel its my kids jenks cried as a hail of tiny snowballs struck me gagging i choked on the word to invoke my circle yanking back the cresting power it crashed into me and i groaned as twofold the ley line energy suddenly took up the same space staggering i fell to a knee and struggled to breathe until the excess found its way back to the line oh god it felt like i was on fire i should have just made the circle what in tinks knickers do you think youre doing jenks yelled hovering over me as i tried to focus on the floor you should know better than to jump a runner like that shes a professional youre going to end up dead and im going to let you rot where you fall were guests here get to the desk all of you jax i am really disappointed i took a breath damn that really hurt mental note never stop a ley line spell midcast matalina jenks shouted do you know what our kids are doing i licked my lips its okay i said looking up to find absolutely no one in the sanctuary even jenks was gone i love my life i muttered and i worked myself carefully up from the floor in stages the flaming tingle in my skin had subsided and pulse hammering i let go of the line completely feeling the remaining energy flow out of my chi to leave me shaking with the sound of an angry bee jenks flew in from the back rooms rachel he said as he came to a halt before me im sorry they found the snow that kist brought in on his shoes and he told them about snowball fights when he was a kid oh look they got you all wet matalina jenkss wife zipped into the sanctuary in a billow of gray and blue silk giving me an apologetic wince she slipped under the crack in my rolltop desk my head started to hurt and my eyes watered her scolding was so highpitched that i couldnt hear it tired i straightened to my full height and tugged my sweater straight small spots of water showed where id been hit if they had been fairy assassins with spells instead of pixies with snowballs id be dead my heart slowed and i snatched up my bag from the floor its okay i said embarrassed and wanting jenks to shut up no biggie kids will be kids jenks hovered in apparent indecision yeah but theyre my kids and were guests theyll be apologizing to you among a few other things gesturing it was okay i stumbled down the dark hallway following the smell of coffee at least no one had seen me rolling on the floor evading pixy snowballs i thought but such commotions had become commonplace since the first hard frost and jenkss family moved in there was no way i could pretend i wasnt here now though besides they had probably smelled the flush of fresh air when i opened the door i passed the opposing hisandher bathrooms that had been converted into a conventional bathroom and a combination bathroomlaundry room the latter was mine my room was on the right side of the hallway ivys was directly across from it the kitchen was next and i made a left turn into it hoping to grab some coffee and go hide in my room to avoid kisten entirely i had made the mistake of kissing him in an elevator and he never missed an opportunity to remind me of it thinking at the time i wouldnt live to see the sunrise i had let my guard down and enjoyed myself all but giving in to the lure of vampiric passion even worse kisten knew he had tipped me over the edge and that i had been a breath away from saying yes exhausted i elbowed the light switch and dropped my shoulder bag on the counter fluorescent lights flickered on sending mr fish into a frenzy of motion soft jazz and the rise and fall of conversation filtered in from the unseen living room kistens leather coat was draped over ivys chair before her computer there was a halffull pot of coffee and after a moments thought i poured it into my gigantic mug trying to be quiet i started a new batch i didnt mean to eavesdrop but kistens voice was as smooth and warm as a bubble bath ivy love he pleaded as i got the grounds out of the fridge its only one night an hour maybe in and out no ivys voice was cold the warning obvious kisten was pushing her past where i would but theyd grown up together the children of wealthy parents who expected them to join their families and have little vamp brats to continue piscarys livingvampire line before they died and became true undead it wouldnt happenthe marriage not the dead part they had already tried the cohabitation route and while neither would say what happened their relationship had cooled until all that was left was more of a warped sibling fondness you dont have to do anything kisten persuaded laying his fake british accent on heavy just be there ill say everything no someone snapped off the music and i silently pulled the silverware drawer open for the coffee scoop three pixy girls darted out shrieking i bit back my yelp heart pounding as they vanished down the dark hallway motions quick from adrenaline i poked around to find the scoop missing i finally spotted it in the sink kisten must have made the coffee if it had been ivy her asinine need for order would have had it washed dried and put away why not kistens voice had taken a petulant tone hes not asking for much tight and controlled ivys voice was seething i dont want that bastard in my head at all why would i let him see through my eyes feel my thoughts the carafe hung from my fingers as i stood over the sink i wished i wasnt hearing this but he loves you kisten whispered sounding hurt and jealous youre his scion he doesnt love me he loves me fighting him it was bitter and i could almost see her perfect slightly oriental features tighten in anger ivy kisten cajoled it feels good intoxicating the power he shares with you its a lie she shouted and i started you want the prestige the power you want to keep running piscarys interests pretend youre still his scion i dont care but im not letting him in my head even to cover for you i noisily ran the water into the carafe to remind them i was listening i didnt want to hear more and i wished theyd stop kistens sigh was long and heavy it doesnt work that way if he really wants in you wont be able to stop him ivy love shut up the words were so full of bound anger that i stifled a shudder the carafe overflowed and i jumped as water hit my hand grimacing i shut the tap off and tipped the excess out there was a creak of wood from the living room my stomach clenched someone had just pinned someone else to a chair go ahead kisten murmured over the tinkling of the water pouring into the coffeemaker sink those teeth you know you want to just like old times piscary feels everything you do whether you want him to or not why do you think you havent been able to abstain from blood lately three years of denial and now you cant go three days give it up ivy hed love to feel us enjoying ourselves again and maybe your roommate might finally understand she almost said yes he goaded not to you to me i stiffened that had been directed at me i wasnt in the room but i might as well have been there was another creak of wood touch her blood and ill kill you kist i swear it i looked around the kitchen for a way to escape but it was too late as ivy halted in the archway with a scuff of boots she hesitated looking unusually ruffled as she gauged my unease in an instant with her uncanny ability to read body language it made keeping secrets around her chancy at best anger at kist had pinched her brow and the aggressive frustration didnt bode well even if it wasnt aimed at me her pale skin glowed a faint pink as she tried to calm herself bringing the faint whisper of scar tissue on her neck into stark relief she had tried surgery to minimize piscarys physical sign of his claim on her but it showed when she was upset and she wouldnt accept any of my complexion charms i had yet to figure that one out seeing me unmoving by the sink her brown eyes flicked from my steaming mug of coffee to the empty pot i shrugged and flicked the switch to get it brewing what could i say ivy pushed herself into motion setting an empty mug on the counter she smoothed her severely straight black hair bringing herself back to at least looking calm and collected youre upset she said her anger at kisten making her voice rough whats up i pulled my backstage passes out and clipped them to the fridge with a tomato magnet my thought went to nick then to rolling on the floor evading pixy snowballs and mustnt forget the joy of hearing her threaten kisten over my blood that she wasnt ever going to taste golly so much to choose from nothing i said softly long and sleek in her blue jeans and shirt she crossed her arms and leaned against the counter beside the coffeemaker to wait for it to finish her thin lips pressed together and she breathed deeply youve been crying what is it surprise stopped me cold she knew i had been crying damn it had only been three tears at the stoplight and i had wiped them away before they even dribbled out i glanced at the empty hallway not wanting kisten to know ill tell you later okay ivy followed my gaze to the archway puzzlement crinkled the skin about her brown eyes then understanding crashed over her she knew id been dumped she blinked and i watched her relieved when the first flicker of blood lust at my new available status quickly died living vampires didnt need blood to remain sane as undead vampires did they still craved it though choosing whom they took it from with care usually following their sexual preferences on the happy chance that sex might be included in the mix but the taking of blood could range in importance from confirming a deep platonic friendship to the shallowness of a onenight stand like most living vamps ivy said she didnt equate blood with sex but i did the sensations a vampire could pull from me were too close to sexual ecstasy to think otherwise after twice being slammed into the wall by ley line energy ivy got the message that though i was her friend i would never ever say yes to her it had been easier after she resumed practicing too with her slacking her needs somewhere else and coming home satiated relaxed and quietly selfloathing for having given in again over the summer she seemed to have turned her energies from trying to convince me that her biting me wasnt sex to ensuring that no other vampire would hit on me if she couldnt have my blood then no one could and she had devoted herself in a disturbing yet flattering drive to keep other vampires from taking advantage of my demon scar and luring me into becoming their shadow living with her gave me protection from themprotection i wasnt ashamed to acceptand in return i was her unconditional friend and whereas that might seem onesided it wasnt ivy was a highmaintenance friend jealous of anyone who attracted my attention though she hid it well she barely tolerated nick kisten though seemed exempt which made me ohsowarm and fuzzy inside and as i took up my coffee i found myself hoping she would go out tonight and satisfy that damned blood lust of hers so she wouldnt be looking at me like a hungry panther the rest of the week feeling the tension shift from anger to speculation i looked at the unfinished pot brewing thinking only of escaping the room you want mine i said i havent drunk any my head turned at kistens masculine chuckle he had appeared without warning in the doorway i havent drunk any either he said suggestively id like some if youre offering a flush of memory took me of kisten and me in that elevator my fingers playing with the silky strands of his blonddyed hair at the nape of his neck the dayold stubble he cultivated to give his delicate features a rugged cast harsh against my skin his lips both soft and aggressive as he tasted the salt on me the feel of his hands at the small of my back pressing me into him damn i pulled my eyes from him forcing my hand down from my neck where i had been unconsciously touching my demon scar to feel it tingle stimulated by the vamp pheromones he was unconsciously putting out double damn pleased with himself he sat in ivys chair clearly guessing where my thoughts were but looking at his wellputtogether body it was hard to think of anything else kisten was a living vamp too his bloodline going back as far as ivys he had once been piscarys scion and the glow of sharing blood with the undead vampire showed in him still though he often acted the playboy by dressing in biker leather and affecting a bad british accent he used it to hide his business savvy he was smart and fast and while not as powerful as an undead vampire he was stronger than his compact build and slim waistline suggested today he was dressed conservatively in a silk shirt tucked into dark slacks clearly trying to be the professional as he took on more of piscarys business interests now that the vampire languished in prison the only hints to kistens badboy side were the gunmetal gray chain he wore about his necktwin to the pair ivy wore about her ankleand the two diamond studs he had in each ear at least there were supposed to be two in each ear someone had torn one out to leave a nasty tear kisten lounged in ivys chair with his immaculate shoes provocatively spread leaning back as he took in the moods drifting about the room i found my hand creeping up to my neck again and i scowled he was trying to bespell me get in my head and shift my thoughts and decisions it wouldnt work only the undead could bespell the unwilling and he couldnt lean on piscarys strength any longer to give him the increased abilities of an undead vampire ivy pulled the brewed coffee out from under the funnel leave rachel alone she said clearly the dominant of the two nick just dumped her my breath caught and i stared at her aghast i hadnt wanted him to know wellkistenmurmured leaning forward to put his elbows on his knees he was no good for you anyway love bothered i put the island counter between us its rachel not love rachel he said softly and my heart pounded at the compulsion he put in it i glanced out the window to the snowy gray garden and the tombstones beyond what the turn was i doing standing in my kitchen with two hungry vamps when the sun was going down didnt they have somewhere to go people to bite that werent me he didnt dump me i said as i grabbed the fish food and fed mr fish i could see kistens reflection watching me in the dark window hes out of town for a few days gave me his key to check on everything and pick up his mail oh kisten glanced sidelong at ivy a long excursion flustered i set the fish food down and turned he said he was coming back i protested my face tightening as i heard the ugly truth behind my words why would nick say hed be coming back unless it had occurred to him not to as the two vamps exchanged more silent looks i pulled a mundane cookbook out from my spell library and set it thumping onto the island counter id promised jenks the oven tonight dont even try to pick me up on the rebound kisten i warned i wouldnt dream of it the slow soft tone of his voice said otherwise cause youre not capable of being half the man nick is i stupidly said high standards eh kisten mocked ivy perched herself on the counter by my tengallon dissolution vat of saltwater wrapping her arms about her knees yet still managing to look predatory while she sipped her coffee and watched kisten play with my emotions kisten glanced at her as if for permission and i frowned then he stood in a sliding sound of fabric coming to lean on the island counter across from me his necklace swung pulling my attention to his neck marked with soft almost unseen scars i like action movies he said and my breath came fast i could smell the lingering aroma of leather on him under the dry scent of silk so i said belligerently peeved that ivy had probably told him about nicks and my weekendlong stints in front of the adrenaline channel so i can make you laugh i flipped to the most tattered stainsplattered recipe in the book id swiped from my mom knowing it was for sugar cookies so does bozo the clown but i wouldnt date him ivy licked her finger and made a tally mark in the air kisten smiled to show the barest hint of fang leaning back and clearly feeling the hit let me take you out he said a platonic first date to prove nick wasnt anything special oh please i simpered not believing he was stooping this low grinning kisten turned himself into a spoiled rich boy if you enjoy yourself then you admit to me that nick was nothing special i crouched to get the flour no i said when i rose to set it thumping on top of the counter a hurt look creased his stubbled face puton but still effective why not i glanced behind me at ivy silently watching you have money i said anyone can show a girl a good time with enough money ivy made another tally mark thats two she said and he frowned nick was a cheap ass huh kisten offered trying to hide his ire watch your mouth i shot back yes ms morgan the sultry submissiveness in his voice yanked my thoughts back to the elevator ivy once told me kisten got off on playing the submissive what i had found out was that a submissive vampire was still more aggressive than most people could handle but i wasnt most people i was a witch i put my eyes on his seeing that they were a nice steady blue unlike ivy kisten freely indulged his blood lust until it wasnt the overriding factor governing his life one hundred seventyfive dollars he offered and i bent to get the sugar the man thought a cheap date was almost two hundred dollars one hundred he said and i looked at him reading his genuine surprise our average date was sixty i said damn he swore then hesitated i can say damn cant i hell yes from her perch on the counter ivy snickered kistens brow pinched in what looked like real worry okay he said deep in thought a sixtydollar date i gave him a telling look i havent said yes yet he inhaled long and slow tasting my mood on the air you havent said no either no he slumped dramatically pulling a smile from me despite myself i wont bite you he protested his blue eyes roguishly innocent from under the island counter i pulled out my largest copper spell pot to use as a mixing bowl it wasnt reliable any longer for spelling as it had a dent from hitting ivys head the palmsized paint ball gun i stored in it made a comforting sound against the metal as i took it out to put back under the counter at ankle height and i should believe you because kistens eyes flicked to ivy shell kill me twice if i do i went to get the eggs milk and butter out of the fridge hoping neither of them sensed my pulse quickening but i knew my temptation didnt stem from the subliminal pheromones they were unconsciously emitting i missed feeling desired needed and kisten had a phd in wooing women even if his motives were onesided and false from the looks of it he indulged in casual blood taking like some men indulged in casual sex and i didnt want to become one of his shadows that he strung along caught by the binding saliva in his bite to crave his touch to feel his teeth sinking into me to fill me with euphoria crap i was doing it again why should i i said feeling myself warm i dont even like you kisten leaned over the counter as i returned the faultless blue of his eyes caught and held mine it was obvious by his rakish grin that he knew i was weakening all the better reason to go out with me he said if i can show you a good time for a lousy sixty bucks think what someone you like could do all i need is one promise the egg was cold in my hands and i set it down what i asked and ivy stirred his smile widened no shirking beg pardon he opened the tub of butter and dipped his finger into it licking it slowly clean i cant make you feel attractive if you stiffen up every time i touch you i didnt before i said my thoughts returning to the elevator god help me i had almost done him right there against the wall this is different he said its a date and i would give my eyeteeth to know why women expect men to behave differently on a date than any other time because you do i said he gave a raisedeyebrow look to ivy straightening he reached across the counter to cup my jaw i jerked back brow furrowed nope he said as he drew away i wont ruin my reputation by taking you out on a sixtydollar date for nothing if i cant touch you its a nogo i stared at him feeling my heart pound good shocked kisten blinked good he questioned as ivy smirked yeah i said pulling the butter to me and scooping out about a half cup with a wooden spoon i didnt want to go out with you anyway youre too full of yourself think you can manipulate anyone into doing anything your egotesticle attitude makes me sick ivy laughed as she unfolded herself and jumped lightly to the floor without a sound i told you she said pay up shoulders shifting in a sigh he twisted to reach his wallet in a back pocket pulling out a fifty and shoving it into her hand she raised a thin eyebrow and made another tally mark in the air an unusual smile was on her as she stretched to drop it into the cookie jar atop the fridge typical kisten said his eyes dramatically sad try to do something nice for a person cheer her up and what do i get abused and robbed ivy took three long steps to come up behind him curling an arm across his chest she leaned close and whispered in his torn ear poor baby they looked good together her silky sultriness and his confident masculinity he didnt react at all as her fingers slipped between the buttons of his shirt you would have enjoyed yourself he said to me feeling as if id passed some test i pushed the butter off the spoon and licked my finger clean how would you know because you enjoyed yourself just now he answered you forgot all about that shallow selfcentered human who doesnt know a good thing when she bites him on his he looked at ivy where did you say she bit him ivy love his wrist ivy straightened and turned her back on me to retrieve her coffee who doesnt know a good thing when she bites him on hiswrist kisten finished my face was burning thats the last time i tell you anything i exclaimed to ivy and it wasnt as if i had drawn blood good god admit it kisten said you enjoyed talking with me pitting your will against mine it would have been fun he said as he looked at me through his bangs you look like you could use some fun cooped up in this church for god knows how long when was the last time you got dressed up felt pretty felt desirable i stood very still feeling my breath move in and out of me balanced my thoughts went to nick leaving to go out of town without telling me our cuddling and closeness that had ended with a shocking abruptness it had been so long i missed his touch making me feel wanted stirring my passions and bringing me alive i wanted that feeling backeven if it was a lie just for a night so i wouldnt forget how it felt until i found it again no biting i said thinking i was making a mistake ivy jerked her head up her face expressionless kisten didnt seem surprised a heady understanding was in his gaze no shirking he said softly his eyes alive and glinting i was like glass to him sixtydollar maximum i countered kisten stood taking his coat from the back of the chair ill pick you up at one am night after tomorrow wear something nice no playing on my scar i said breathlessly unable to find enough air for some reason what in hell was i doing with a predatory grace he shrugged into his coat he hesitated thinking not one breath on it he agreed his thoughtful expression shifted to sly anticipation as he stood in the archway to the hall and held out his hand to ivy motions stiff ivy pulled the fifty back out of the cookie jar and gave it to him he stood and waited and she took another and slapped it into his hand thanks ivy love he said now i have enough for my date and a haircut too he met my eyes holding them until i couldnt breathe see you later rachel the sound of his dress shoes seemed loud in the darkening church i heard him say something to jenks followed by the faint boom of the front door closing ivy wasnt pleased that was a stupid thing to do she said i know i wouldnt look at her mixing the sugar and butter with a rough quickness then why did you do it i kept stirring maybe because unlike you i like being touched i said wearily maybe because i miss nick maybe because hes been gone the last three months and ive been too stupid to notice back off ivy im not your shadow no she agreed less angry than i expected im your roommate and kist is more dangerous than he lets on ive seen him do this before he wants to hunt you hunt you slow i stilled my motions and looked at her slower than you i questioned bitterly she stared at me im not hunting you she said sounding hurt you wont let me letting go of the spoon i put my hands to either side of the bowl and bowed my head over it we were the pair one too afraid to feel anything lest she lose control of her ironclad hold on her emotions and the other so hungry to feel anything that shed risk her free will for one night of fun how i had kept from being a vampires flunky this long was a miracle hes waiting for you i said as i heard kistens car revving through the insulated walls of the church go satiate yourself i dont like it when you dont ivy swung into motion not saying a word she stiffly walked out boots thumping on the hardwood floor the sound of the churchs door shutting was quiet slowly the ticking of the clock above the sink became obvious taking a slow breath i pulled my head up wondering how in hell i had become her keeper eight the rhythmic thumps of my running feet jolting up my spine were a pleasant distraction from my thoughts of nick it was bright the sun glittering off the piles of snow to make me squint through my new sunglasses i had left my old pair in takatas limo and the new ones didnt fit as well this was the second day in a row that i had gotten up at an ungodly ten in the morning to come out and run and by the turn i was going to run this time jogging after midnight wasnt as funtoo many weirdos besides i had a date tonight with kisten the thought zinged through me and my pace increased each puffed breath was timed with my steps to make a hypnotic tempo luring me into a runners high i picked up the pace even more reveling in it an old witch couple was ahead of me doing a fast walkrun as i passed the bear exhibit they were watching with a hungry interest the bears not the witches i think thats why management let us runners in we gave the large predators something to watch besides kids in strollers and tired parents actually our collective group of runners had taken it upon ourselves to adopt the indochina tiger exhibit with just that in mind the funds for their upkeep and health care came entirely from our specialpass fees they ate very well track i exclaimed breathily in time with my steps and the two witches slid aside making a spot for me thanks i said as i passed them catching their heavy redwood scent in the crisp painfully dry air the sound of their companionable conversation quickly retreated i spared a confused angry thought for nick i didnt need him to run i could run by myself he hadnt run with me much lately anyway not since i got my car and didnt need to bum a ride from him yeah right i thought my jaw clenching it wasnt the car it was something else something he wouldnt tell me about something that frankly wasnt my business track i heard faintly from someone not far behind it was low and controlled whoever it was they were keeping up with me with no trouble all my warning flags went up lets see if you can run i thought taking a deep breath different muscles eased into play like gears shifting as i pushed into a faster pace my heart pounding and the cold air slicing in and out of me i was already going at a good clip my natural pace somewhere between a long distance run and a sprint it had made me a favorite in the eight hundred meter in high school and had stood me in good stead when i worked for the is and needed to run down the occasional tag now my calves protested at the increased speed and my lungs began to burn as i passed the rhinos and cut a left i vowed to get out here more i was going soft no one was ahead of me even the keepers were absent i listened hearing his pace increase to match mine i snuck a quick look back as i made a sharp left it was a were somewhat short and lanky sleek in matching gray running pants and longsleeve shirt his long black hair was held back with an exercise band and there was no strain on his placid face as he kept up with me crap my heart gave an extra hard thump even without the cowboy hat and wool duster i recognized him crap crap crap my pace quickened with a surge of adrenaline it was the same were why was he following me my thoughts drifted back further than yesterday id seen him before lots of befores he was at the watch counter last week when ivy and i were picking out a new perfume to overpower my natural scent mixing with hers he had been putting air into his tires three weeks ago when i was pumping gas and locked myself out of my car and three months ago id seen him leaning against a tree when trent and i talked at eden park my jaw clenched maybe its time we chatted i thought as i ran past the cat house there was a dropoff ahead by the eagles i cut a right leaning back as i went downhill mr were followed as i thumped along behind the eagle exhibit i took stock of what i had in my belt pack were my keys my phone a mild pain amulet already invoked and my minisplat gun loaded with sleepy time potions no help there i wanted to talk to him not knock him out the path opened up into a wide deserted section no one ran down here because the hill was such a killer to get back up perfect heart pounding i went left to take the slope instead of heading for the vine street entrance a smile curved over me as his pace faltered he hadnt expected that leaning into the hill i ran up it full tilt seeming to be in slow motion the path was narrow and snowcovered he followed here i thought as i reached the top panting i snuck a quick look behind me and jerked off the path and into the thick shrubbery my lungs burned as i held my breath he passed me with the sound of feet and heavy breathing intent on his steps reaching the top he hesitated looking to see which way i had gone his dark eyes were pinched and the first signs of physical distress furrowed his brow taking a breath i leapt he heard me but it was too late i landed against him as he spun pinning him against an old oak his breath whooshed out as his back hit his eyes going wide and surprised my fingers went chokingly under his chin to hold him there and my fist hit his solar plexus gasping he bent forward i let go and he fell to sit at the base of the tree holding his stomach a thin backpack slid up almost over his head who in hell are you and why have you been tailing me the last three months i shouted trusting the odd hour and the closed status of the zoo to keep our conversation private head bowed over his chest the were put a hand in the air it was small for a man and thick with short powerfullooking fingers sweat had turned his spandex shirt a darker gray and he slowly moved his wellmuscled legs into a less awkward position i took a step back my hand on my hip lungs heaving as i recovered from the climb angry i took off my sunglasses and hung them from my waistband and waited david he rasped as he looked up at me immediately dropping his head while he struggled to take another breath pain and a hint of embarrassment had laced his brown eyes sweat marred his rugged face thick with a black stubble that matched his long hair god bless it he said to the ground why did you have to hit me what is it with you redheads anyway always having to hit things why are you following me i shot at him head still bowed he put up a hand again telling me to wait i shifted nervously as he took a clean breath then another his hand dropped and he looked up my name is david hue he said im an insurance adjuster mind if i get up im getting wet my mouth dropped open and i took several steps back onto the path as he rose and wiped the snow from his backside an insurance adjuster i stammered surprise washed the remnants of adrenaline from me i put my arms about myself and wished i had my coat as the air suddenly seemed colder now that i wasnt moving i paid my bill i said starting to get angry i havent missed one payment youd think for six hundred dollars a month six hundred a month he said his features shocked oh honey we have to talk affronted i backed up farther he was in his midthirties i guessed from the maturity in his jaw and the barest hint of thickening about his middle that his spandex shirt couldnt hide his narrow shoulders were hard with muscle that his shirt couldnt hide either and his legs were fabulous some people shouldnt wear spandex despite being older than i liked my men david wasnt one of them is that what this is about i said both ticked and relieved is this how you get your clients stalking them i frowned and turned away thats pathetic even for a were wait up he said lurching out onto the path after me in a snapping of twigs no actually im here about the fish i jerked to a stop my feet again in the sun my thoughts zinged back to the fish i had stolen from mr rays office last september shit um i stammered my knees suddenly weak from more than the run what fish fingers fumbling i snapped my sunglasses open putting them on i started walking for the exit david felt his middle for damage as he followed me meeting my fast pace with his own see he said almost to himself this is exactly why ive been following you now ill never get a straight answer ill never settle the claim my stomach hurt and i forced myself into a faster pace it was a mistake i said my face warming i thought it was the howlers fish david took off his sweatband slicked his hair back and replaced it word is that the fish has been destroyed i find that extremely unlikely if you could verify that i can write my report send a check to the party mr ray stole the fish from and youll never see me again i gave him a sidelong glance my relief that he wasnt going to serve me with a writ or something very real i had surmised that mr ray had stolen it from someone when no one came after me for it but this was unexpected someone insured their fish i scoffed not believing it then realized he was serious youre kidding the man shook his head ive been following you trying to decide if you have it or not we had reached the entrance and i stopped not wanting him to follow me to my car not that he didnt already know which one it was why not just ask me mr insurance agent looking bothered he planted his feet widely with an aggressive stance he was my height exactlymaking him somewhat short for a manbut most weres werent big people on the outside you really expect me to believe you dont know i gave him a blank look know what running a hand across his thick bristles he looked at the sky most people will lie like the devil when they get ahold of a wishing fish if you have it just tell me i dont care all i want is to get this claim off my desk my jaw dropped aa wishing he nodded a wishing fish yes his thick eyebrows rose you really didnt know do you still have it i sat down on one of the cold benches jenks ate it the were started excuse me i couldnt look up my thoughts went back to last fall and my gaze drifted past the gate to my shiny red convertible waiting for me in the parking lot i had wished for a car damn i had wished for a car and gotten it jenks ate a wishing fish his shadow fell over me and i looked up squinting at davids silhouette black against the faultless blue of noon my partner and his family ate it david stared youre joking feeling ill i dropped my gaze we didnt know he cooked it over an open fire and his family ate it his small feet moved in a quick motion shifting he pulled a folded piece of paper and a pen from his backpack as i sat with my elbows on my knees and stared at nothing david crouched beside me and scribbled using the smooth concrete bench as a desk if you would sign here ms morgan he said as he extended the pen to me a deep breath sifted through me i took the pen then the paper his handwriting had a stiff preciseness that told me he was meticulous and wellorganized ivy would love him scanning it i realized it was a legal document davids handwritten addition stating that i had witnessed the destruction of the fish unaware of its abilities frowning i scrawled my name and pushed it back his eyes were full of an amused disbelief as he took the pen from me and signed it as well i bit back a snort when he brought out a notarizing kit from his backpack and made it legal he didnt ask for my identification but hell hed been following me for three months youre a notary too i said and he nodded returning everything to his backpack and zipping it up its a necessity in my line of work standing he smiled thank you ms morgan no sweat my thoughts were jumbled i couldnt decide if i was going to tell jenks or not my gaze returned to david as i realized he was holding out his card i took it wondering since ive got you here he said moving so i wasnt looking into the sun to see him if youre interested in getting a better rate on your insurance i sighed and let the card fall what a weenie he chuckled gracefully swooping to pick it up i get my health and hospitalization insurance for two fifty a month through my union suddenly i was interested runners are almost uninsurable true he pulled a black nylon jacket out of his backpack and put it on so are field insurance adjusters but since there are so few of us compared to the pencil pushers that make up the bulk of the company we get a good rate union dues are one fifty a year it gets you a discount on your insurance needs car rentals and all the steak you can eat at the yearly picnic that was too good to believe why i asked taking the card back he lifted his shoulder in a shrug my partner retired last year i need someone my mouth opened in understanding he thought i wanted to be an insurance adjuster oh pleeeeease sorry ive already got a job i said snickering david made an exasperated noise no you misunderstand i dont want a partner ive driven off all the interns theyve saddled me with and everyone else knows better than to try ive got two months to find someone or theyre going to shave my tail i like my job and im good at it but i dont want a partner he hesitated his sharp gaze scanning the area behind me with professional intentness i work alone you sign the paper you belong to the union you get a discount on your insurance you never see me but for the yearly picnic where we act chummy and do the threelegged race i help you you help me i couldnt stop my eyebrows from rising and i shifted my attention from him to the card in my grip four hundred dollars less a month sounded great and id be willing to bet they could beat what i was paying for my car insurance too tempted i asked what kind of hospitalization do you have his thin lips curled up in a smile to show a hint of small teeth silver cross my head bobbed it was designed for weres but it was flexible enough to work a broken bone is a broken bone so i drawled leaning back whats the catch his grin widened your salary is deferred to me as im the one doing all the work ahhhh i thought he would get two salaries this was a scam if i ever heard one smirking i handed him his card back thanks but no thanks david made a disappointed sound backing up with his card you cant blame me for trying it was my old partners suggestion actually i should have known you wouldnt go for it he hesitated your backup really ate that fish i nodded going depressed thinking about it least i got a car out of it first well he set the card down beside me snapping it into the concrete give me a call if you change your mind the extension on the card will get you past my secretary when im not in the field im in the office from three to midnight i might consider taking you on as an apprentice for real my last partner was a witch and you look like you have some chutzpah thanks i said snidely its not as boring as it looks and safer than what youre doing now maybe after you get beat up a few more times youll change your mind i wondered if this guy was for real i dont work for people i work for myself nodding he casually touched his head in a loose salute before he turned and walked away i pulled myself straight as his trim figure slipped past the gate he got in a gray twoseater across the lot from my little red car and drove off i cringed recognizing it and realizing he had watched nick and me yesterday my butt was frozen from sitting on the concrete when i stood i picked up his card tearing it in half and going to a trash can but as i held the ripped pieces over the hole i hesitated slowly i put them in my pocket an insurance adjuster a small voice in my head mocked grimacing i took the pieces out and dropped them in the can work for someone else again no never nine peace sat warm in me as i sprinkled the yellow sugar on the iced cookie shaped like the sun okay so it was a circle but with the sparkling sugar it could be the sun i was tired of the long nights and the physical affirmation of the turning seasons had always filled me with a quiet strength especially the winter solstice i set the finished cookie aside on the paper towel and took another it was quiet but for music filtering in from the living room takata had released red ribbons to wvmp and the station was playing it into the ground i didnt care the refrain was the one i had told him fitted with the theme of the song and it pleased me i had played some small part in its creation all the pixies were sleeping in my desk for at least two more hours ivy probably wouldnt be up stumbling about in search of coffee for even longer she had come in before sunrise looking calm and relaxed selfconsciously seeking my approval for having slacked her blood lust on some poor sap before falling into bed like a brimstone addict i had the church to myself and i was going to squeeze every drop of solitude out of it that i could swaying to the heavy beat of drums in a way i wouldnt if anyone were watching i smiled it was nice to be alone once in a while jenks had made his kids do more than apologize to me and i had woken this afternoon to a hot pot of coffee in a sparkling clean kitchen everything shone everything was polished they had even scoured the accumulated dirt out of the circle i had etched into the linoleum around the center island counter not a breath of dust or cobweb marred the walls or ceiling and as i dipped my knife into the green icing i vowed to try to keep it this clean all the time yeah right i thought as i layered frosting on the wreath id put it off until i was back to the same level of chaos that the pixies had dragged me out of id give it two weeks tops timing my movements with the beat of the music i placed three little hot candies to look like berries a sigh shifted my shoulders and i set it aside and took up the candle cookie trying to decide whether to make it purple for aged wisdom or green for change i was reaching for the purple when the phone rang from the living room i froze for an instant then set the butter tub of frosting down and hustled after it before it could wake the pixies they were worse than having a baby in the house snatching the remote from the couch i pointed it at the disc player to mute it vampiric charms i said as i picked up the phone and hoped i wasnt breathing hard this is rachel how much for an escort on the twentythird a young voice asked cracking that depends on the situation i frantically looked for the calendar and a pen they werent where id left them and i finally dug through my bag for my datebook i thought the twentythird was a saturday is there a death threat involved or is it general protection death threat the voice exclaimed all i want is a goodlooking girl so my friends wont think im a dweeb my eyes closed as i gathered my strength too late i thought clicking the pen closed this is an independent runner service i said tiredly not a bloodhouse and kid do yourself a favor and take the shy girl shes cooler than you think and she wont own your soul in the morning the phone clicked off and i frowned this was the third such call this month maybe i should take a look at the yellow pages ad that ivy bought i wiped my hands free of the last sugar and shuffled in the narrow cabinet that the message machine sat on pulling out the phone book and dropping it on the coffee table the red message light was blinking and i tapped it leafing through the heavy book to private investigators i froze when nicks voice came rolling out guilty and awkward telling me he had stopped by about six this morning and picked up jax and that he would call me in a few days coward i breathed thinking it was one more crucifix tied to the coffin he knew no one but the pixies would be up then i vowed to enjoy myself on my date with kisten whether ivy would have to kill him afterward or not i jabbed the button to clear his message then went back to the phone book we were one of the last listings and as i found vampiric charms in a friendly font my eyebrows rose it was a nice ad more attractive than the fullpage ads around it with a line drawing of a mysteriouslooking woman in a hat and duster ghosted into the background fast discreet no questions asked i said reading it sliding scale payment options insured week day and hourly rates under it all were our three names address and phone number i didnt get it there was nothing here that would lead anyone to think bloodhouse or even a dating service then i saw the tiny print at the bottom saying to see the secondary entries i flipped through the thin sheets to the first one listed finding the same ad then i looked closer not at our ad but the ones around it holy crap that woman was hardly clothed having the perky body of an animé cartoon my eyes flicked to the heading escort service i said flushing at the steamy suggestive ads my gaze jerked to our advertisement again the words taking on an entirely new meaning no questions asked week day or hourly rates payment options lips pressed together i shut the book leaving it out to talk to ivy about no wonder we were getting calls more than a little irate i unmuted the stereo and headed back into the kitchen steppenwolfs magic carpet ride trying its best to lighten my mood it was the hint of a draft the barest scent of wet pavement that made my step hesitate and the palm streaking out at me past the archway to the kitchen miss my jaw god bless it i swore as i dove past it into the kitchen instead of falling back into the cramped hall remembering jenkss kids i tapped the ley line out back but did nothing else as i fell into a defensive crouch between the sink and the island counter i almost choked when i saw whom it was standing by the archway quen i stammered not getting out of my stance as the lightly wrinkled athletic man stared at me with no expression the head of trents security was dressed entirely in black his tightfitting body stocking looking vaguely like a uniform what in hell are you doing i said i ought to call the is you know that and have them haul your ass out of my kitchen for illegal entry if trent wants to see me he can come down here just like anyone else ill tell him he can suck dishwater but he ought to have the decency to let me do it in person quen shook his head i have a problem but i dont think you can handle it i made an ugly face at him dont test me quen i all but snarled youll fail well see that was all the warning i got as the man pushed off the wall headed right for me gasping i dove past him instead of backward the way i wanted quen lived and breathed security backing away would only get me caught heart pounding i grabbed my dented copper spell pot with white frosting in it and swung quen caught it yanking me forward adrenaline hurt my head as i let it go and he tossed it aside it made a harsh bong and spun into the hallway i snatched the coffeemaker and threw it the appliance jerked back at its cord and the carafe fell to shatter on the floor he dodged his green eyes peeved when they met mine as if wondering what in hell i was doing but if he got a grip on me i was a goner i had a cupboard of charms in arms reach but no time to invoke even one he gathered himself to jump and remembering how he had evaded piscary with incredible leaps i went for my dissolution vat teeth gritted in effort i tipped it over quen cried out in disgust as ten gallons of saltwater cascaded over the floor to mix with the coffee and glass shards arms pinwheeling he slipped i levered myself onto the island counter stepping on frosted cookies and knocking over vials of colored sugar crouched to avoid the hanging utensils i jumped feet first as he rose my feet hit him squarely in the chest and we both went down where was everyone i thought as my hip took the fall and i grunted in pain i was making enough noise to wake the undead but as such commotion was more common than silence these days ivy and jenks would probably ignore it and hope it went away slipping i skittered from quen hands reaching unseeing i scrabbled for my paint ball gun kept purposely at crawling height i yanked it out nested copper pots rolled noisily enough i shouted arms stiff as i sat on my butt in saltwater aiming at him it was loaded with waterfilled splat balls for practice but he didnt know that what do you want quen hesitated water making darker smears on his black pants his eye twitched adrenaline surged he was going to risk it instinct and practice with ivy made me squeeze the trigger as he leapt onto the table to land like a cat i tracked him squeezing out every last splat ball his expression went affronted as he pulled himself to a crouching halt his attention jerking from me to the six new splatters on his skintight shirt crap id missed him once jaw clenched his eyes narrowed in anger water he said you load your spell gun with water aint you just lucky for that i snapped what do you want he shook his head and my breath hissed in as i felt a dropping sensation in me he was tapping the line out back panic jerked me to my feet and i flung my hair out of my eyes from his vantage point on the table quen straightened to his full height his hands moving as he whispered latin like hell you will i shouted throwing my splat gun at him he ducked and i snatched up whatever i could to throw it at him desperate to keep him from finishing the charm quen dodged the butter tub of frosting it thunked into the wall to make a green smear grabbing the cookie tin i ran around the counter swinging it like a board he dove off the table to avoid it cursing at me cookies and redhot candies went everywhere i followed him grabbing him about the knees to bring us both down in a sodden splat he twisted in my grip until his livid green eyes met mine hands scrabbling i shoved saltwater soggy cookies into his mouth so he couldnt verbally invoke a charm he spit them at me his deeply tanned pockmarked face vehement you little canicula he managed and i jammed some more into him his teeth closed on my finger and i shrieked jerking back you bit me i shouted incensed my fist swung but he rolled to his feet crashing into the chairs panting he stood he was soaked covered in water and sparkles of colored sugar growling an unheard word he leapt i lurched upright to flee pain lanced through my scalp as he grabbed my hair and spun me around into an embrace my back to his chest one arm went chokingly around my neck the other slipped between my legs yanking me up onto one foot furious i elbowed him in the gut with my free arm get your hands i grunted hopping backward on one foot off my hair i reached the wall and smashed him into it his breath exploded out as i jabbed his ribs and his grip around my neck fell away i spun to stiffarm his jaw but he was gone i was staring at the yellow wall shrieking i went down my legs pulled out from under me his weight landed on me pinning me to the wet floor with my arms over my head i win he panted as he straddled me his green eyes from under his short hair wild i struggled to no effect ticked that it was going to be something as stupid as body mass that decided this you forgot something quen i snarled i have fiftyseven roommates his lightly wrinkled brow furrowed taking a huge breath i whistled quens eyes widened grunting in effort i jerked my right hand free and slammed the heel of my hand at his nose he jerked back out of the way and i pushed him off me rolling still on my hands and knees i flipped my wet stringy hair out of the way quen had gained his feet but he wasnt moving he was standing stockstill cookiesmeared palms raised above his head in a gesture of acquiescence jenks was hovering before him the sword he kept to fight off encroaching fairies aimed at quens right eye the pixy looked pissed dust spilling from him to make a steady sunbeam from him to the floor breathe jenks threatened blink just give me a reason you bloody freak of nature i stumbled upright as ivy dove into the room moving faster than i would have believed possible robe loose and flowing she grabbed quen by the throat the lights flickered and the hanging utensils swung as she slammed him into the wall beside the doorway what are you doing here she snarled her knuckles white with pressure jenks had moved with quen his sword still touching the mans eye wait i exclaimed worried they might kill him not that id mind but then thered be is personnel in my kitchen and paperwork lots of paperwork slow down i soothed my eyes flicked to ivy still holding quen there was frosting on my hand and i wiped it off on my damp jeans as i caught my breath saltwater marked me and i had cookie crumbs and sugar in my hair the kitchen looked like the pillsbury doughboy had exploded i squinted at the purple frosting on the ceiling when had that happened ms morgan quen said then gurgled as ivy tightened her grip the music from the living room softened to talk i felt my ribs wincing angry i paced to where he hung in ivys hold ms morgan i shouted six inches from his reddening face ms morgan im ms morgan now what in hell is wrong with you i yelled coming into my house ruining my cookies do you know how long its going to take to clean this up he gurgled again and my anger started to slow ivy was staring at him with a shocking intensity the scent of his fear had tripped her past her limits she was vamping out at noon this wasnt good and i took a step back suddenly sobered um ivy i said im okay she said huskily her eyes saying different want me to bleed him quiet no i exclaimed and i felt another drop in me quen was tapping a line i took an alarmed breath things were spiraling out of control someone was going to get hurt i could set a circle but it would be around me not him drop him i demanded jenks you too neither of them moved now shoving him up the wall ivy dropped him and stepped away he hit the floor in a slump his hand at his neck as he coughed violently slowly he moved his legs into a normal position flipping his very black hair from his eyes he looked up sitting crosslegged and barefoot morgan he said roughly his hand hiding his throat i need your help i glanced at ivy who was tightening her black silk robe about herself again he needed my help riiiiight you okay i asked ivy and she nodded the ring of brown left to her eyes was too thin for my comfort but the sun was high and the tension in the room was easing seeing my concern she pressed her lips together im fine she reiterated you want me to call the is now or after i kill him my gaze ran over the kitchen my cookies were ruined sitting in soggy clumps the globs of frosting on the walls were starting to run saltwater was venturing out of the kitchen threatening to reach the living room rug letting ivy kill him was looking really good i want to hear what he has to say i said as i slid open a drawer and put three dish towels in the threshold as a dike jenkss kids were peeking around the corner at us the angry pixy rubbed his wings together to make a piercing whistle and they vanished in a trill of sound taking a fourth towel i wiped the frosting off my elbow and went to stand before quen feet spread wide and my fists on my hips i waited it must have been big if he was willing to risk jenks figuring out he was an elf my thoughts went to ceri across the street and my worry grew i wasnt going to let trent know she existed he would use her some waysome very ugly way the elf felt his ribs through his black shirt i think you cracked them he said did i pass i said snidely no but youre the best ive got ivy made a sound of disbelief and jenks dropped down before him staying carefully out of his reach you ass the fourinch man swore we could have killed you three times over quen frowned at him we it was her i was interested in not we she failed so i guess that means youll be leaving i said knowing i wouldnt be that lucky i took in his subdued attire and sighed it was just after noon elves slept when the sun was high and in the middle of the night just like pixies quen was here without trents knowledge feeling more sure of myself i pulled out a chair and sat down before quen could see my legs trembling trent doesnt know youre here i said and he nodded solemnly its my problem not his quen said im paying you not him i blinked trying to disguise my unease trent didnt know interesting you have a job for me that he doesnt know about i said what is it quens gaze went to ivy and jenks peeved i crossed my legs and shook my head were a team im not asking them to leave so you can tell me of whatever pisspoor problem youve landed yourself in the older elfs brow wrinkled he took an angry breath look i said my finger jabbing out to point at him i dont like you jenks doesnt like you and ivy wants to eat you start talking he went motionless it was then i saw his desperation shimmering behind his eyes like light on water i have a problem he said fear the thinnest ribbon in his low controlled voice i glanced at ivy her breath had quickened and she stood with her arms wrapped about herself holding her robe closed she looked upset her pale face even more white than usual mr kalamack is going to a social gathering and my lips pursed i already turned down one whoring offer today quens eyes flashed shut up he said coldly someone is interfering in mr kalamacks secondary business ventures the meeting is to try to come to a mutual understanding i want you to be there to be sure thats all it is mutual understanding it was an imtougherthanyousogetoutofmycity party saladan i guessed genuine surprise washed over him you know him jenks was flitting over quen trying to figure out what he was the pixy was getting more and more frustrated his shifts of direction becoming jerky and accented with sharp snaps of his dragonfly wings ive heard of him i said thinking of takata my eyes narrowed why should i care if he assumes trents secondary business ventures this is about brimstone isnt it i said well you can take a leap of faith and burn in hell trent is killing people not that he hasnt done it before but now hes killing them for no reason outrage pulled me to my feet your boss is moth crap i ought to bring him in not protect him and you i said louder pointing are lower than moth crap for doing nothing while he does it quen flushed making me feel vastly better about myself are you that stupid he said and i stiffened the bad brimstone isnt from mr kalamack its from saladan thats what this meeting is about mr kalamack is trying to get it off the streets and unless you want saladan taking over the city youd better start trying to keep mr kalamack alive like the rest of us are you going to take the run or not it pays ten thousand from jenks came an eyeballhurting pulse of ultrasonic surprise cash up front quen added pulling a narrow wad of bills from somewhere on his person and throwing it at my feet i looked at the money it wasnt enough a million dollars wouldnt be enough i shifted my foot and it slid across the wet floor to quen no take the money and let him die rache jenks said from the sunstrewn windowsill the blackclad elf smiled thats not how ms morgan works his pockmarked face was confident and i hated the selfassured look in his green eyes if she takes the money shell protect mr kalamack down to her last breath wont you no i said knowing i would but i wasnt going to take his lousy ten grand and you will take the money and the job quen said because if you dont im going to tell the world about your summers at that little camp of his fathers youre the only person who has a ghosts chance in hell to keep him alive my face went cold bastard i whispered refusing to feel afraid why dont you just leave me alone why me you just smeared me into the floor his eyes dropped from mine there will be vampires there he said softly powerful ones theres the chance he took a breath and met my eyes i dont know if i shook my head somewhat reassured quen wouldnt tell trent would be mildly ticked if i was packed up and shipped off to antarctica he still had hopes of luring me to his payroll himself if youre afraid of vampires thats your problem i said im not going to let you make it mine ivy get him out of my kitchen she didnt move and i turned my ire evaporating at the blank look on her face hes been bitten she whispered the wistful faltering in her voice shocking me hunched into herself she leaned back against the wall closed her eyes and took a slow breath to scent him my lips parted in understanding piscary had bitten him right before i clubbed the undead vampire into unconsciousness quen was an inderlander and so couldnt contract the vamp virus and be turned but he might be mentally bound to the master vampire i found my hand covering my neck my face cold big al had taken the form and abilities of a vampire when he had torn open my neck and tried to kill me he had filled my veins with the same potent cocktail of neurotransmitters that now ran through quen it was a survival trait to help ensure that vamps had a willing blood supply and it turned pain into pleasure when stimulated by vampire pheromones if the vamp had enough experience they could sensitize the response such that they and only they could stimulate the bite into feeling good binding the person to them alone and preventing easy poaching of their private supply algaliarept hadnt bothered to sensitize the neurotransmittersseeing as he was trying to kill me i was left with a scar that any vamp could play on i didnt belong to anyone and as long as i kept vampire teeth on the right side of my skin i wouldnt in the ranking of the vampire world an unbound bitee was the lowest of the low a party favor a pathetic remnant that was so beneath notice that any vampire could take what they wanted unclaimed property didnt last long passed from vamp to vamp soon drained of their vitality and will left to rot in a confused loneliness of betrayal when the ugliness of their life started to show on their face id be among their ranks if it wasnt for ivys protection and quen had either been bitten and left unclaimed like me or bitten and claimed by piscary as i stared in pity at the man i decided he had a right to be afraid seeing my understanding quen rose smoothly to his feet ivy tensed and i raised my hand to tell her it was all right i dont know if the bite has bound me to him or not quen said the evenness of his voice failing to hide the fear in him i cant risk mr kalamack relying on me i mightbe distracted at a sensitive moment waves of bliss and promises of pleasure coming from that bite might indeed be a large distraction even in the midst of a fight pity pulled me forward tracks of sweat marred his lightly wrinkled face he was as old as my father would be if he were still alive with the strength of a twentyyearold and the sturdiness only maturity imparted has any other vamp made your scar tingle i asked him thinking it was a really personal question but he had come to me never dropping my gaze he said ive yet to get into a situation where it might rache jenks called and there was a clatter of wings as he dropped to hover beside me then i dont know if piscary bound you or not i said then froze as i realized my scar was tingling sending hints of deeper feelings to bring me to a wideeyed alertness quen stiffened our eyes met and i knew by his frightened look that he was feeling it too rache jenks shouted his wings red as he got in my face and forced me to back up quen isnt the only one with a problem here i followed his frightened gaze behind me to ivy ohcrap i whispered ivy had pressed herself into a corner her robe falling open to show her black silk nightgown her awareness was lost black eyes unseeing as her mouth worked i froze not knowing what was going on get him out of here she whispered a bead of saliva dropping from her teeth oh god rachel hes not bound to anyone piscaryhes in my head she took a gasping breath he wants me to take him i dont know if i can stop get quen out of here i stared not knowing what to do get him out of my head she moaned get him out horrified i watched her slide down the wall to huddle with her hands over her ears get him out heart pounding i spun to quen my neck was a flaming mass of promise i could see by his expression that his scar was alight and flaming god help me it felt good get the door i said to jenks grabbing quens arm i pulled him into the hallway from behind us came a frightening guttural groan i broke into a run dragging quen behind me quen stiffened when we entered the sanctuary breaking my hold youre leaving i shouted reaching for him now he was hunched and trembling making the martial arts master look vulnerable lines from his internal struggle showed on his face his eyes showed his broken spirit you will accompany mr kalamack in my place he said his voice haggard no i wont i reached for his arm flashing alive he sprang back you will accompany mr kalamack in my place he repeated his face falling back into despair or i will give in and go back into that kitchen his face twisted and i panicked that he might anyway hes whispering to me morgan i can hear him through her my mouth went dry my thoughts spiraled to kisten if i let him bind me to him i could end up like this why me i asked theres a university of people better at magic than i am everyone else relies on their magic he panted bent almost double you use it as a last resort it gives youthe advantage he gasped shes weakening i can feel it okay i exclaimed ill go damn it just get out of here a sound of agony soft as a brush of wind slipped from him help me he whispered i cant make myself move anymore heart pounding i grabbed his arm and dragged him to the door behind us was ivys tortured cry of anguish my stomach twisted what was i doing going on a date with kisten a bright stab of snowreflected light lanced into the church as jenks and his brood worked the elaborate pulley system we had rigged so they could open the door quen balked at the cold blast of air that sent the pixies hiding get out i exclaimed in frustration and fear as i pulled him out onto the stoop a long gray ghost limo idled at the curb my breath hissed in relief as jonathan trents numberone lackey opened the drivers door and emerged i never thought id be happy to see the shockingly tall distasteful man they were in this together working behind trents back this was a badder mistake than usual i could feel it already quen panted as i helped him lurch down the steps get him out of here i demanded jonathan yanked open the passengerside door are you going to do it he said his thin lips pressed tight as he took in my cookiesmeared hair and wet jeans yes i pushed quen in he fell onto the leather seat collapsing like a drunk go the tall elf shut the door and stared at me what did you do to him he said coldly nothing its piscary get him out of here apparently satisfied he strode to the drivers side with an odd quietness the car accelerated i stood on the icy sidewalk and shivered watching it speed away until it turned a corner and was gone pulse slowing i wrapped my arms around myself the winter sun was cold slowly i turned to go inside not knowing what id find curled up on my kitchen floor ten i watched myself in the mirror above my new solidash dresser as i put my hoop earrings in the ones big enough for jenks to ride on the little black dress looked good on me and the abovetheknee boots that went with it would keep me warm enough i didnt think kisten had planned a snowball fight in the park as corny and cheap as that was and he had said wear something nice i stood sideways and checked myself out this was nice this was very nice pleased i sat on my bed and snapped my boots up leaving the last few inches open so i could walk easier i didnt want to get excited about going out with kisten but the chance to dress up and have a good time had been so infrequent lately that it was hard not to i told myself that i could be going out with the girls and still feel like this it wasnt kisten it was just going out wanting a second opinion i went clattering into the hall in search of ivy the memory of her fighting piscary off in her mind was very real the undead vampire had given up as soon as quen was gone but she had been very subdued the rest of the day refusing to talk about it as she helped me clean the kitchen she didnt want me going out with kisten now and i was inclined to agree with her that it was a stupid idea but it wasnt as if i couldnt fight kisten off he had said he wouldnt bite me and i wasnt about to let a moment of passion change my mind not now not ever i ran my hand down my sparkling party dress as i entered the living room hesitating for ivys inspection curled up on the couch she looked up from her magazine i couldnt help but notice she was on the same page as when i had gone in to change thirty minutes ago what do you think i said making a slow circle and feeling tall in my spikeheeled boots she sighed closing her magazine on her finger to mark the page i think its a mistake my brow furrowed and i looked down at myself yeah youre right i said as my thoughts went to my closet ill put on something else i turned to leave and she threw her magazine across the room to hit the wall before me thats not what i meant she exclaimed and i spun startled ivys oval face was creased and her thin eyebrows pinched as she sat up in her chair fidgeting rachel she cajoled and i knew where this conversation was going im not going to let him bite me i said becoming angry im a big girl i can take care of myself and after this afternoon you can be damned sure his teeth arent going to get anywhere near me brown eyes worried she curled her legs up under her to make herself look uncertain it was a mien i didnt see on her very often her eyes closed as she took a breath as if gathering herself you look nice she said and i could almost feel my blood pressure drop dont let him bite you she added softly i dont want to have to kill kisten if he binds you to him you got it i said trying to lighten her mood as i walked out knowing she might it would be the only way to reliably break his hold on me time and distance would do it eventually too but ivy wasnt one to take chances and being bound to him after i had said no to her would be more than she could take my heels clacked a little slower as i went back to my room to change into something more subdued this outfit was asking for trouble standing before my open closet i pushed hangers around hoping something would jump out and say wear me wear me id already been through everything and was starting to think i didnt have anything that wasnt too sexy and yet attractive enough for a night on the town with all the money id spent filling my closet last month there ought to have been something my stomach tightened at the thought of my shrinking bank balance but quen had left his ten thousand on the kitchen floor and i had agreed to babysit trent the soft knock at my door startled me and i spun my hand to my collarbone um ivy said her closedlipped smile telling me she found something funny in having surprised me im sorry i know you arent going to let him bite you she raised a long hand in a gesture of exasperation its the vamp thing thats all i nodded understanding id been living with ivy long enough that her unconscious vampire instincts thought of me as her property even though her conscious mind knew different it was why i didnt spar with her anymore wash my clothes with hers bring up ties of family and blood or follow her out of the room if she abruptly left in the middle of a conversation for no apparent reason all pushed her vampireinstinct buttons and would put us right back where we were seven months ago fumbling about as we figured out how to live with each other here ivy said coming one step into my room and holding out a fistsized package wrapped in green foil and a purple bow its an early solstice gift i thought you might like to use it on your date with kisten oh ivy i exclaimed taking the elaborate clearly storewrapped package thank you i ah havent wrapped yours yet wrapped i hadnt even bought it thats okay she said clearly flustered i was going to wait but i thought you could use it for your date she fumbled eyes eager she looked at the box in my hand go on open it okay i sat on my bed carefully undoing the fabric and foil ribbon as i might want to use it next year the paper was embossed with the black kiss logo and i slowed my fingers wanting to prolong the suspense the black kiss was an exclusive shop catering to vamps i didnt even windowshop there the associates knew by looking that i couldnt afford a hanky the paper came away to reveal a small wooden box and inside that amid a cushion of crushed red velvet was a cutglass perfume bottle ooooh i breathed thank you ivy had been getting me perfume since id moved in as we tried to find a scent that covered up her lingering aroma on me and help her curb her vampiric tendencies it wasnt the romantic gift one might think it was but kind of a vampire antiaphrodisiac my dresser was covered in castoffs of varying degrees of effectiveness actually the perfume was more for her than me its really hard to find she said starting to look discomforted you have to special order it my dad told me about it i hope you like it mmmm i said opening it and dabbing some behind my ear and on my wrists i breathed deeply thinking it smelled like a green woods and dash of citrus clean and crisp with a hint of darker shadows scrumptious oh this is wonderful i said standing to give her a quick impromptu hug she held very still and i busied myself at my dresser pretending i didnt notice her surprise huh she said and i turned finding a bemused expression on her it works what i said warily wondering what i had put on her gaze rove before settling on mine it blocks a vampires sense of smell she said at least the more sensitive aromas that run to the unconscious she gave me a lopsided smile to make her look harmless i cant smell you at all cool i said impressed i should wear it all the time ivys expression went subtly guilty you could but i got the last bottle and i dont know if i could find it again i nodded she meant it was more expensive than a gallon of water on the moon thank you ivy i said earnestly youre welcome her smile was genuine happy early solstice her attention went to the front of the church hes here the rumble of an idling car filtered in through my thin stainedglass window i took a deep breath and glanced at my bedside clock right on time i turned to her pleading with my eyes for her to get the door nope she grinned to show an unconscious slip of teeth you get it she turned and left i looked down at myself thinking what i had on was grossly inappropriate and now i had to answer the door in it ivy i complained as i followed her out she never slowed holding her hand up in refusal as she walked into the kitchen fine i muttered boot heels clicking to the front of the church i flicked on the lights in the sanctuary in passing the high dim glow doing little to brighten the gloom it was after one in the morning and the pixies were all safe and snug in my desk until about four when they would wake up there was no light in the foyer and i wondered if we ought to do something about that as i pushed open one side of the heavy wooden door with the soft sound of shoes grinding on rock salt kisten shifted back hi rachel he said his eyes taking in my clothes a faint stiffening of the skin about his eyes told me i had guessed correctly i wasnt dressed for whatever he had planned i wished i knew what he had on under the luscious gray wool coat he was wearing it went all the way to his boot tops and looked classy he had shaved toohis usual dayold stubble gonegiving him a polished look i wasnt used to seeing on him this isnt what im wearing i said by way of greeting come on in i just need a minute to change sure past him at the curb was his black corvette the light snow melting as it hit he edged in past me and i pulled the door thumping shut behind him ivys in the kitchen i said starting back to my room his soft steps following right behind me she had a bad afternoon she wont talk to me but she might talk to you she called me he said the careful cadence of his words telling me he knew about piscary asserting his dominance over her youre going to put on different boots right i jerked to a stop at the door to my room whats wrong with my boots i said thinking they were the only thing that i was going to keep on ahthe only thing from this outfit not the only thing total he looked at them his dyedblond eyebrows high theyre what five inches yeah its icy youre going to slip and break your ass his blue eyes widened i mean your rear end a smile crossed my face at the thought that he was trying to clean up his mouth for me they make me as tall as you too i said smugly i noticed he hesitated with a little jiggle he whisked past me and into my room hey i protested as he went right to my closet get out of my room ignoring me he pushed all the way to the back where i put everything i didnt like i saw something here the other day he said making a small exclamation as he leaned to tug at something here he said holding out a pair of drab black boots start with these those i complained as he set them aside and stuck his arms back into my closet theres no heel to those at all and theyre four years old and out of style and what were you doing in my closet thats a classic boot kisten said affronted it never goes out of style put them on he shuffled about again pulling something out by feel as he couldnt possibly see anything back there my face warmed when i saw an old suit id forgotten i had oh this is just ugly he said and i snatched it out of his hands its my old interview suit i said its supposed to be ugly throw it away but keep the pants youre wearing them tonight i am not i protested kisten i am fully capable of picking out my own clothes silently he raised his eyebrows then went right back in to get a black longsleeve shirt from my dontgothere section that my mother bought for me three years ago i hadnt the heart to give it away as it was silk even though it was so long it hung midthigh on me the neckline was too low and it made my small chest look even flatter this too he said and i shook my head no i said firmly its too long and its something my mother would wear then your mother has better taste than you he said in good humor wear a camisole under it and for gods sake dont tuck it in kisten get out of my closet but he reached back in bowing his head over something small in his hands as he rocked back i thought it might be that ugly purse with the sequins i wished i had never bought but i went mortified when he turned with an innocuous looking book it had no title and was bound with a soft brown leather the glint in kistens eyes told me he knew what it was give me that i said reaching out for it a wicked grin on him kisten held it up over his head i could probably still get it but id have to climb him well well well he drawled ms morgan you have shocked and delighted me where did you get a copy of rynn cormels guide to dating the undead i pressed my lips together and fumed stymied hip cocked i could do nothing as he took a distancing step back and flipped through it have you read it he asked then made a surprised mmmm sound as he paused at a page i forgot about that one i wonder if i can still do that yes ive read it i extended my hand give it here kisten pulled his attention from the pages his long masculine hands cradling the book open his eyes had gone black just a wee bit and i cursed myself as a thrill of excitement went through me damn vamp pheromones ooooh its important to you kisten said glancing out the door when ivy banged something in the kitchen rachel he said his voice softer as he moved a step closer you know all my secrets without looking his fingers dogeared a page what drives me crazy what instinctively tips me overtheedge he said the last word carefully and i stifled a delicious shudder you know how tomanipulate me he murmured the book dangling from an inattentive hand do witches have a manual he had somehow gotten within two feet of me and i didnt remember him moving the smell of his wool coat was strong and under that was the heady scent of leather flustered i snatched the book away and kisten dropped back a step dont you wish i muttered ivy gave it to me so i would stop pushing her buttons thats all it is i shoved it under my pillow and his smile widened damn it if he touched me i was going to slug him thats where it belongs he said not a closet keep it close for quick reference get out i said pointing long coat drifting about his shoe tops he moved to the door his every motion holding a confident seductive grace put your hair up he said as he sauntered through the archway a grin came over him showing me his teeth i like your neck page twelve third paragraph down he licked his lips hiding the flash of fang even as i saw it out i shouted taking two steps and slamming the door fuming i turned to what he had laid out on my bed glad id made it that afternoon a faint tingling at my neck drew my hand up and i pressed my palm into it willing it away i stared at my pillow then hesitantly pulled the book out rynn cormel had written it cripes the man had singlehandedly run the country during the turn and he had enough time to write a vampire sex manual too the scent of lilac rose as i opened it at the dogeared page i was prepared for anything having been through the book twice and finding myself more appalled than turned on but it was only about the use of necklaces to send messages to your lover apparently the more you covered your neck the more you were inviting him or her to rip it open the gothic metallic lace that was so popular lately was like walking around in a teddy going completely bare at the neck was almost as bada delicious claim of vampiric virginity and a complete and utter turnon huh i muttered closing the book and dropping it on my new bedside table maybe a reread was in order my gaze went to the outfit kisten had chosen for me it looked frumpy but id try it on and when ivy told him i looked like i was forty he could wait another ten minutes while i changed back motions quick i took off my boots and tossed them thumping aside i had forgotten that the gray slacks were lined with silk and they made a pleasant sensation slipping over my legs i chose a black halter topwithout kistens helpand put the long shirt on over it it didnt do a thing to show off my curves and i turned to my mirror frowning i froze at my reflection shocked damn i whispered i had looked good before in my black dress and boots but in this in this i lookedsophisticated remembering page twelve i fumbled for my longest gold chain and looped it over my head double damn i breathed shifting to see myself from a different angle my curves were gone hidden behind the simple straight lines but the subdued statement of the modest slacks silk shirt and gold chain screamed confidence and casual wealth now my pale skin was softly alabaster instead of sickly white and my athletic build appeared sleek it was a new look for me i didnt know i could do highclass wealthy i hesitantly pulled my hair up off my neck and held it atop my head whoa i breathed when it turned me from sophisticated to elegant looking this good outweighed the embarrassment of letting kisten know he could dress me better than i could dress myself digging in a drawer i found and invoked my last amulet to tame the frizz of my hair then put my hair up pulling a few strands to drape artfully before my ears i dabbed on a bit more of my new perfume checked my makeup hid my hairtaming amulet behind my shirt then grabbed a small clasp purse as my shoulder bag would ruin everything the lack of my usual charms gave me a moment of pause but it was a date not a run and if i had to fight kisten off id be using ley line magic anyway my flatheeled boots were subdued as i left my room and followed the soft giveandtake murmurs of kisten and ivy into the amberlit sanctuary i hesitated at the doorway looking in they had woken the pixies who were flitting everywhere concentrating about ivys grand piano as they played tag among the wires and stops there was a faint hum of sound shifting the air and i realized the vibrations from their wings were making the strings resonate ivy and kisten stood by the archway to the foyer she had that same uneasy defiant look on her that shed been wearing earlier when she refused to talk to me kisten was bent close clearly concerned with his hand on her shoulder i cleared my throat for their attention and kistens hand fell ivys posture shifted back to her usual equanimity but i could see her shattered confidence underneath oh thats better kisten said as he turned his eyes lighting briefly on my necklace he had unbuttoned his coat and i ran my eyes appreciatively over him as i approached no wonder he had wanted to dress me he looked fabulous navy italian pinstripe suit shiny shoes hair slicked back and smelling faintly of soapand smiling at me with an attractive selfassurance his usual chain was a quick flash hidden behind the collar of his starched white shirt a tasteful tie was snugged up to his neck and a watch fob ran from a vest pocket through a buttonhole and then to the other vest pocket looking at his trim waist broad shoulders and slender hips there was nothing to argue with nothing at all ivy blinked as she took me in when did you buy that she asked and i smiled widely kist picked it out of my closet i said brightly and that would be the only admission of my lack of polish he was going to get it was a date so i went to stand beside kisten nick would have gotten a kiss but as ivy and jenks were hoveringand in jenkss case literallya little discretion was in order more importantly he wasnt nick jenks landed on ivys shoulder do i need to say anything the pixy asked kisten his hands on his hips to look like a protective father no sir kisten said entirely serious and i fought to keep a smile from me the picture of a fourinch pixy threatening a sixfoot living vampire would have been ridiculous if kisten werent taking him seriously jenkss warning was real and very enforceable the only thing more unstoppable than fairy assassins were pixies they could rule the world if they wanted good jenks said apparently satisfied i stood by kisten and rocked back and forth on my flat heels twice staring at everyone no one said a word this was really weird ready to go i finally prompted jenks snickered and flitted off to corral his kids back into the desk ivy gave kisten a last look and walked out of the sanctuary sooner than i would have expected the tv blared i ran my eyes over kisten thinking he looked as far away from his biker image as a goat is to a tree kisten i said putting a hand to my necklace what does thissay he leaned close confidence not looking for anything but naughty behind closed doors i stifled a thrillinvoked shudder when he pulled away okay thatworks let me help you with your coat he said and a sound of dismay came from me as i followed him into the foyer my coat my ugly ugly coat with the fake fur around the collar ouch kisten said his brow furrowed in the dim light seeping in from the sanctuary as he saw it tell you what he shrugged out of his coat you can wear mine its unisex now wait up i protested taking a step back before he could put it on me im smarter than that fangboy ill end up smelling like you this is a platonic date and im not going to break rule number one by mixing our scents before i even step out of my church he grinned his white teeth glinting in the dim light got me dead to rights he admitted but what are you going to wear that a wince pulled my face tight while i looked at my coat all right i agreed not wanting to ruin my new facade of elegance with fake fur and nylon and there was my new perfumebut im not putting this on to intentionally mix our scents understand he nodded but his smile made me think otherwise and i let him help me slip into it my gaze went distant as its heavy weight eased over my shoulders comforting and warm kisten might not be able to smell me but i could smell kisten and his lingering body warmth sank into me leather silk and the barest hint of a cleanscented aftershave made a mix i was hardpressed not to sigh into will you be okay i asked seeing he had only his suit jacket the car is already warm he intercepted my reach for the door his hand touching mine atop the handle allow me he said gallantly youre my date let me act like it thinking he was being silly i nevertheless let him open the door and take my arm as he helped me down the steps lightly dusted with snow the snow had started shortly after sundown and the ugly gray splotches kicked up by the snowplows were covered in pristine white the air was crisp and cold and there was no wind i wasnt surprised when he maneuvered to open the car door for me and i couldnt help but feel special as i arranged myself kisten shut the door and hustled around to the front the leather seats were warm and there was no cardboard tree hanging from the rearview mirror i took a quick look at the discs in the console as he got in they ranged from korn to jeff beck and he even had one of singing monks he listened to singing monks kisten settled himself as soon as the car started he flipped the heater on full i sank into the seat relishing the deep rumble of the engine it was markedly stronger than my little car vibrating through me like thunder the leather too was of a higher quality and the mahogany on the dash was real not fake i was a witch i could tell i refused to compare kistens car to nicks drafty ugly truck but it was hard not to and i liked being treated special not that nick didnt make me feel special but this was different it was fun to get dressed up even if we ended up eating at mickeyds which was a very real possibility as kisten had only sixty dollars to spend glancing at him sitting beside me i realized i didnt care eleven so i said slowly as i fought to keep myself from reaching for the handle of the door to keep it from swinging open when we went over a railroad track where are we going kisten gave me a sideways smile the lights from the car behind us illuminating him youll see my eyebrows rose and i took a breath to press for details when a soft chirping came from his pocket my playful mood faltered into one of exasperation as he gave me an apologetic look and reached for his phone i hope this isnt going to happen all night i muttered putting my elbow on the door handle and staring at the dark just turn around and take me home if it is nick never took a call when we were on a date nick wasnt trying to run half the city either kisten flipped the silver top up yes he said his sharp annoyance pulling my elbow from the door and my attention back to him the muted tiny sound of pleading filtered out in the background i could hear thumping music youre kidding kisten flicked his attention from the road to me and back to the road his eyes held a mix of hassle and disbelief well get out there and open the floor i tried that the tiny voice shouted theyre animals kist bloody savages the voice subsided into an unrecognizable highpitched panic kisten sighed as he looked at me okay okay well stop in ill take care of it the voice on the other end gushed in relief but kisten didnt bother to listen flipping the phone closed and tucking it away sorry love he said in that ridiculous accent one quick stop five minutes i promise and it had started off so well too five minutes i questioned somethings got to go i threatened half serious either the phone or that accent oh he said putting his hand to his chest dramatically wounded to the quick he looked askance at me clearly relieved i was taking this as well as i was i cant do without my phone the accent goes he grinned my love oh please i moaned enjoying the light banter i had been walking on eggshells around nick so long afraid to say anything lest i make things worse guess i didnt have to worry about that anymore i wasnt surprised when kisten turned toward the waterfront i had already surmised the trouble was at piscarys pizza since losing its mixed public license last fall it had gone to a strictly vamp cliental and from what i heard kisten was actually turning a profit it was the only reputable establishment in cincinnati without an mpl to do so savages i questioned when we pulled into the parking lot of the twostory restaurant mike is being histrionic kisten said as he parked in a reserved spot its only a bunch of women he got out of the car and i sat tight my hands in my lap as his door shut i would have expected him to leave the car running for me my head jerked up when he opened my door and i stared blankly at him arent you coming in he said hunched as the cold breeze off the river shifted his bangs its freezing out here ah should i i stammered surprised you lost your mpl kisten reached for my hand i dont think you need to be worried the pavement was icy and i was glad that i was wearing flat boots as i got out of his car but you dont have an mpl i said again the parking lot was full and watching vampires bleeding each other couldnt be a pleasant sight and if i willingly went in there knowing it lacked an mpl the law wouldnt help me if anything went wrong kistens coat was long dragging while he held my arm and escorted me to the canopy covered entrance everyone in there knows you beat piscary into unconsciousness he said softly inches from my ear to make me very aware of his breath on my cheek none of them would dare even think to do that and you could have killed him but you didnt it takes more guts to let a vampire live than to kill one no one will mess with you he opened the door and light and music spilled out or is it the blood youre worried about he questioned as i balked i fixed my eyes on his and nodded not caring if he saw my apprehension expression distant kisten gently led me forward you wont see any he said everyone here came to relax not feed the beast this is the only place in cincinnati where vampires can go in a public setting and be themselves without having to live up to some humans witchs or weres idea of what they should be and how they should act there wont be any blood unless someone cuts a finger opening a beer still unsure i let him guide me in stopping just inside the door while he knocked the snow from his dress shoes the heat of the place struck me first and i didnt think it was all coming from the fireplace at the far end of the room it had to be pushing eighty the warmth carrying the pleasant aroma of incense and dark things i breathed deeply as i untied kistens coat and it seemed to settle in my brain relaxing me the way a hot bath and a good meal did a stirring of unease ruined the feeling when a living vamp came forward with an unsettling quickness his shoulders looked as wide as i was tall and he massed three hundred pounds if he was an ounce but his eyes were sharp revealing a quick intelligence and he moved his muscular bulk with the sexy grace most living vamps had im sorry he said in an ironpumpinggym accent as he came close his hand was reaching outnot to touch but clearly indicating that i should leave piscarys lost its mpl vamps only kisten slid behind me and helped me slip his coat off hi steve any trouble tonight mr felps the large man exclaimed softly his speech taking on a welleducated accent to match the intelligence his eyes couldnt hide i wasnt expecting you until later no no trouble apart from mike upstairs were all quiet down here brown eyes apologetic he glanced at me sorry maam i didnt know you were with mr felps seeing a golden opportunity to pry i smiled does mr felps often bring young women not of the vampiric persuasion to his club i asked no maam the man said so naturally that i had to believe him his words and actions were so innocuous and unvampiric that i had to sniff twice to make sure he was one i hadnt realized how much of the vampire identity stemmed from attitude and as i scanned the lower floor i decided it was like any upscale restaurant more mundane than when it had its mpl the wait staff was appropriately dressed with most of their scars hidden and they moved with an efficient quickness that wasnt the least provocative my gaze roved over the pictures above the bar faltering when i saw a blurry shot of ivy in her biker leather riding her cycle with a rat and a mink perched on the gas tank oh god someone had seen us kisten gave me a wry look upon seeing where my eyes were steve this is ms morgan he said as he handed my borrowed coat to the bouncer we arent staying long yes sir the man said then stopped in his tracks and turned rachel morgan my smile grew wider pleasure to meet you steve i said a rush of fluster ran through me as steve took my hand and kissed the top of it the pleasure is mine ms morgan the large vampire hesitated gratitude passing behind his expressive eyes thank you for not killing piscary it would have made cincinnati hell i chuckled aw it wasnt just me i had help bringing him in and dont thank me yet i said not sure if he was serious or not piscary and i have an old argument and i simply havent decided if its worth the effort to kill him or not kisten laughed but it sounded somewhat forced all right all right he said as he pulled my hand from steves thats enough steve will you have someone get my long leather coat from downstairs were leaving as soon as i open the floor yes sir i couldnt hide my smile as kisten moved his grip to my elbow and subtly guided me to the stairway i decided that though he kept touching me it wasnt for any ulterior motiveyetand i could tolerate him moving me around like a barbie doll it kinda went with my sophisticated look tonight and made me feel special good god rachel his whisper in my ear made me shiver dont you think you have enough of a badass attitude already without dumping blood on the floor steve was already gossiping to the help and heads were turning to watch kisten escort me to the second floor what i said smiling confidently at anyone who would meet my eyes i looked good i felt good everyone could tell kisten pulled me close to put his hand at the small of my back do you really think it was a good idea to tell steve that piscary lives only because you havent decided if you want to kill him or not what kind of an image do you think that gives you i smiled at him i felt good relaxed like i had been sipping wine all afternoon it had to be the vamp pheromones but my demon scar had yet to even twinge this was something else apparently there was nothing more relaxed and comfortable than a sated vampire and they apparently liked to share the feeling how come ivy never felt like this well i did say i had help i admitted wondering if my words were slurring but killing piscary is gonna move to the top of my wish list if he ever gets out of prison kisten said nothing peering at me with his brow furrowed and i wondered if i had said something bad but he had given me egyptian embalming fluid that night thinking it would knock piscary out he had said he wanted me to kill him maybe hed changed his mind the music coming from the second floor grew louder the higher we rose up the stairway it was a steady dance beat and as it thumped into me i found myself wanting to move to it i could feel my blood humming and i swayed as kisten pulled me to a halt at the top of the stairs it was warmer up there and i fanned myself the huge plateglass windows that had once overlooked the ohio river had been replaced with walls unlike the openings remaining downstairs the dining tables had been removed to leave a buildingwide highceilinged open space ringed with tall cocktail tables pressed against the walls there were no chairs at the far end was a long bar again no chairs everyone was standing above the bar just below the ceiling was a dark loft where the dj and lightshow panel was behind that was what looked like a pool table a harriedlooking tall man was standing in the center of the dance floor with a cordless mike pleading to the mixed crowd of vampires living and dead men and women all dressed similar to what i had been wearing earlier it was a vamp dance club i decided wanting to cover my ears against the loud catcalls the man with the mike caught sight of kisten and his long face lifted in relief kisten he said his miked utterance turning heads and causing a cheer from the surrounding women in skimpy party dresses thank god the man beckoned to him and kisten took my shoulders rachel he questioned rachel he exclaimed pulling my attention from the pretty spinning lights above the floor his blue eyes went worried are you okay i nodded my head bobbing up and down yup yup yup i said giggling i felt so warm and relaxed i liked kistens dance club kistens brow furrowed he glanced at the overdressed man everyone was laughing at then back to me rachel this will only take a moment is that okay i was watching the lights again and he turned my chin to look at him yes i said moving my mouth slowly so it would come out right ill wait right here you go open the floor someone bumped me and i almost fell into him i like your club kisten its fab kisten stood me upright waiting until i had my balance before letting go the crowd had started to chant his name and he raised a hand in acknowledgment they redoubled their calls and i put my hands over my ears the music pounded into me kisten gestured to someone at the bottom of the stairs and i watched steve take them two at a time moving his hulking size like it was nothing is she what i think she is kisten asked the big man as he came close yeeeeah the big man drawled as they both peered at me shes bloodsugared but shes a witch steves eyes left me and fixed on kisten isnt she yes kisten said almost having to shout over the noise from the people for him to take the mike shes been bitten but shes not bound to anyone maybe thats why vampy vampy pheruhpher i licked my lips frowning pheromones i said my eyes wide mmmm nice how come ivy never feels like this because ivy is a tightass kisten frowned a sigh shifted him and i reached for his shoulders he had nice shoulders all hard with muscle and possibility kisten took my hands from him and held them before me steve stay with her sure boss the big vampire said moving to stand beside and slightly behind me thanks kisten peered into my eyes holding them im sorry rachel he said this isnt your fault i didnt know this would happen ill be right back he shifted away and i reached out after him blinking at the tumult that rose as he took the center of the room kisten stood for a moment looking sexy in his italian suit as he gathered his thoughts with his head bowed and waited he was working the crowd before he even said a word i couldnt help but be impressed a closedlipped roguish smile quirked his mouth when he pulled his head up eyeing them from under his blond bangs holy shit he whispered into the mike and the crowd cheered what the hell are you all doing here waiting for you a female voice shouted kisten grinned moving his body suggestively as he nodded in the direction of the voice hey mandy you here tonight when did they let you out she screamed happily at him and he smiled you are a baaaaad bunch of vixens you know that giving mickey a hard time whats wrong with mickey hes good to you the women cheered and i covered my ears almost falling over as my balance shifted steve took my elbow well i was trying to go out on a date kisten said dropping his head dramatically my first one in i dont know how long you see her over there by the stair a huge spotlight slammed into me and i winced squinting the heat from it made my skin tingle and i straightened almost falling when i waved steve caught my arm and i smiled up at him i leaned into him and he shook his head goodnaturedly running a finger along the underside of my jaw before gently standing me upright shes a little out of it tonight kisten said you are all enjoying yourself far too much and its rubbing off on her who knew witch runners needed to party like us the noise redoubled and the pace of the lights quickened racing over the floor and up the walls and ceilings my breath came faster as the beat of the music grew but you know what they say kisten said over the rhythm the bigger they are the better it is someone yelled the more they need to party kisten shouted over the laughs so take it easy on her okay she just wants to relax and have some fun no pretenses no games i say any witch with enough balls to bring down piscary and let him live has long enough fangs to party with are you all apositive with that the second floor exploded into sound pressing me into steve my eyes warmed as my emotions swung from one extreme to the other they liked me how cool was that then lets get this party started kisten yelled spinning to the dj nest behind him mickey give me the one i want the women screamed their approval and i watched in slackjawed surprise when the floor was suddenly covered in women their eyes wild and their motions sharp short revealing dresses high heels and extravagant makeup was the rule though there were a few older vampires dressed as classy as me the living barely outnumbered the undead music rolled from the speakers in the ceiling loud and insistent a heavy beat a tinny snare drum a corny synthesizer and a raspy voice it was rob zombies living dead girl and as i stared in disbelief the varying motions of the cleanlimbed and scantily clad female vamps shifted to the rhythmic simultaneous movements of a choreographed dance they were line dancing ohmygod the vampires were line dancing like a school of fish they swayed and moved together feet thumping with the strength to shake the dust from the ceiling not a one made a mistake or misstep i blinked as kisten did a michael jackson to move to the front looking indescribably alluring in his confidence and suave movements following it up with a staying alive the women behind him followed him exactly after the first gesture i couldnt tell if they had practiced or if their quicker reactions allowed them such a seamless improvisation blinking i decided it didnt matter lost in the power and intensity kisten all but glowed riding the combined agreement of the vampires behind him numb from an overload of pheromones music and lights i felt myself go hazy every motion had a liquid grace every gesture was precise and unhurried the noise beat at me and as i watched them party with a wild abandonment i realized that it stemmed from the chance to be as they wanted to be without fear of anyone reminding them that they were vampires and therefore had to be dark and depressed and carry a mysterious danger and i felt privileged to be respected enough to see them as they wished they could be swaying i leaned into steve while the base line beat my mind into a blessed numbness my eyelids refused to stay open a thunder of noise shook through me then subsided to mutate into a faster beat of different music someone touched my arm and my eyes opened rachel it was kisten and i smiled giddy you dance good i said dance with me he shook his head glancing at the vampire who was holding me upright help me get her outside this is fucking weird bad bad mouth i slurred my eyes closing again watch your mouth a giggle escaped me and it turned into a delighted shriek when someone picked me up to carry me cradled in his arms i shivered as the noise lessened and my head thumped into someones chest it was warm and i snuggled closer the thundering beat softened to casual conversation and the clatter of china a heavy blanket covered me and i made a sound of protest when someone opened a door and cold air hit me the music and laughter behind me subsided into an icy silence broken by twin steps crunching on grainy snow and the chiming of a car do you want me to call someone i heard a man ask as an uncomfortably cold draft made me shiver no i think all she needs is some air if she isnt right by the time we get there ill call ivy well take it easy boss the first voice said i felt a drop and then the cold of a leather seat pressed against my cheek sighing i snuggled deeper under the blanket that smelled of kisten and leather my fingers were humming and i could hear my heartbeat and feel my blood moving even the thump of the door closing did nothing to stir me the sudden roar of the engine was soothing and as the cars motion pushed me into oblivion i could have sworn i heard monks singing twelve the familiar rumble of driving over railroad tracks woke me and my hand shot out to grab the handle before the door could jiggle open my eyelids flashed apart when my knuckles smacked into the unfamiliar door oh yeah i wasnt in nicks truck i was in kistens corvette i froze slumped and staring at the door with kistens leather coat draped over me like a blanket kisten took a slow breath and the volume of the music dropped he knew i was awake my face warmed and i wished i could pretend i was still passed out depressed i sat up and put kistens long coat on the best i could in the tight confines of the car i wouldnt look at him gazing out the window to try to place where in the hollows we were the streets were busy and the clock on the dash said it was nearing two i had passed out like a drunk in front of a fair slice of cincinnatis uppermiddleclass vampires high on their pheromones they must have thought i was a weakwilled skinny witch who couldnt hold her own kisten shifted in his seat as he eased to a halt at a light welcome back he said softly lips pressed tight i subtly felt my neck to make sure everything was the way id left it how long was i out i asked this is going to do wonders for my reputation kisten moved the gearshift out and back into first you didnt pass out you fell asleep the light changed and he inched up on the car in front of us to bully it into moving passing out implies a lack of restraint falling asleep is what you do when youre tired he glanced at me as we went through the intersection everyone gets tired no one falls asleep in a dance club i said i passed out my mind sifted through the memories clear as holy water instead of mercifully blurred and my face flamed sugared he had called it i had been bloodsugared i wanted to go home i wanted to go home crawl into the priest hole the pixies had found in the belfry stairway and just die kisten was silent the tensing of his body while he drove telling me he was going to say something as soon as he doublechecked it against his patronizing meter im sorry he said surprising me but the admission of guilt fed my anger instead of pacifying it i was an ass for taking you into piscarys before finding out if witches could get bloodsugared it never occurred to me his jaw clenched and its not as bad as you think yeah right i muttered hand searching under the seat until i found my clasp purse i bet its halfway across the city by now hey anybody want to go over to morgans tonight and watch her get sugared all it takes is enough of us having fun and down she goes whoo hoo kistens attention was riveted on the road it wasnt like that and there were over two hundred vamps in there a good portion undead and thats supposed to make me feel better motions stiff he pulled his phone from a pocket punched a button and handed it to me yeah i questioned into the phone almost snarling who is this rachel god are you okay i swear ill kill him for taking you into piscarys he said you got sugared did he bite you ivy i stammered then glared at kisten you told ivy thanks a hell of a lot want to call my mom next like ivy wouldnt find out he said i wanted her to hear it from me and i was worried about you he added stopping my next outburst did he bite you ivy said jerking my attention from his last words did he i turned back to the phone no i said feeling my neck though i dont know why i was such an idiot come home she said and my anger shifted to rebellion if someone bit you i could tell come home so i can smell you a sound of disgust came from me im not coming home so you can smell me everyone there was really nice about it and it felt good to let go for five stinking minutes i scowled at kisten seeing why he had given me ivy to talk to the manipulative bastard smiled how could i stay angry with him when i was defending him you got bloodsugared in five minutes ivy sounded horrified yeah i said dryly maybe you ought to try it go sit and soak up the pheromones at piscarys they might not let you in though you might kill everyone elses buzz her breath caught and i immediately wished i could take it back shit ivyim sorry i said quickly i shouldnt have said that let me talk to kisten came her soft voice i licked my lips feeling like dirt sure fingers cold i handed the phone to him his unreadable eyes met mine for a flash he listened for a moment muttered something i didnt catch then ended the call i watched him for any hint of his mood as he tucked the little silver phone away behind his wool coat bloodsugared i questioned thinking i ought to know what happened you want to tell me what that is exactly his hands shifted on the wheel and he took a more relaxed position the comeandgo flashes from the streetlights made eerie shadows on him its a mild depressant he said that vampires kick out when theyre sated and relaxed sort of like an afterglow it came as a surprise the first time a few of the newest undead got sugared shortly after piscarys went to an allvamp clientele it did them a world of good so i took out the tables upstairs and put in a light show and dj made it into a dance club everyone got sugared after that he hesitated as we made a sharp turn into an enormous parking lot down by the riverfront piles of snow rose six feet up at the edges its a natural high he said as he downshifted and drove slowly to the small cluster of cars parked by a large brightly lit boat at the dock legal too everyone likes it and theyve started selfpolicing themselves kicking out anyone who comes in looking for a quick bleed and protecting the ones who come in hurting and fall asleep like you did its making a difference too go ask that fib captain of yours violent crimes being perpetrated by single young vamps have dropped no kidding i said thinking it sounded like an informal vampire support group maybe ivy should go nah shed ruin it for everyone else you wouldnt have been so receptive if you hadnt needed it so much he said parking at the outskirts oh so it is my fault i said dryly dont he said his words harsh as he yanked the parking brake up i let you yell at me once already tonight dont try to flip this back on me the more you need it the harder it hits you is all thats why no one thought anything less of youand maybe they think a little more taken aback i made an apologetic face sorry i kinda liked that he was too smart to be manipulated by wicked female logic it made things more interesting slowly he relaxed turning off the heater and the softly playing disc you were hurting inside he said as he took the singing monk cd out and put it in its case from nick ive watched you hurt since you drew on that line through him and he got scared and they got a kick out of seeing you unwind he smiled with a distant look it made them feel good that the big bad witch who beat up piscary trusted them trust is a feeling we dont get very often rachel living vampires lust after it almost as much as blood thats why ivy is ready to kill anyone who threatens your friendship with her i said nothing staring as it started to make sense you didnt know that did you he added and i shook my head uncomfortable with digging into the whys of my relationship with ivy the car was getting cold and i shivered and showing your vulnerability probably upped your reputation too he said that you didnt feel threatened by them and let it happen i looked at the boat sitting before us decorated with blinking holiday lights i didnt have a choice he reached out and adjusted the collar of his coat about my shoulders yes you did kistens hand fell from me and i gave him a weak smile i wasnt convinced but at least i didnt feel like so much of a fool my mind went over the events the slow slide from a relaxed state into sleep and the attitudes of those around me there hadnt been any laugher at my expense i had felt comforted cared for understood and there hadnt been a flicker of blood lust coming from any of them i hadnt known vampires could be like that line dancing kisten i said feeling my lips quirk into a wry smile a nervous laugh came from him and he bowed his head hey ah could you not tell anyone about that he asked the rims of his ears reddening what happens at piscarys stays at piscarys its an unwritten rule being stupid i reached out and ran a finger over the arch of his bloodreddened ear he beamed shifting to take my hand and brush his lips against my fingers unless you want to get yourself banned from there as well he said a shiver went through me at his breath on my fingers and i pulled my hand away his speculative look went right to my core pulling my stomach into knots of anticipation you looked good out there i said not caring if it was a mistake do you have a karaoke night mmmm he murmured shifting in his seat to fall into his badboy slump against the door karaoke theres an idea tuesdays are slow we never get enough people to get a good buzz going that might be just the thing i turned my attention to the boat to hide my smile the image of ivy on stage singing round midnight flitted through me and was gone kistens attention followed mine to the boat it was one of those remade riverboats two stories tall and almost entirely enclosed ill take you home if you want he said shaking my head i tightened the tie on his coat and the scent of leather puffed up no i want to see how you pay for a dinner cruise on an icedover river with only sixty dollars this isnt dinner this is the entertainment he went to toss his hair artfully aside then stopped midmovement the lights in my head started to go on its a gambling boat i said thats not fair piscary owns all the gambling boats you wont have to pay for a thing its not piscarys boat kisten got out of the car and came around to my side looking good in his wool coat he opened my door and waited for me to get out oh i said more lights turning on were here checking out the competition something like that he bent to look at me coming or are we going to leave if he wasnt going to get his chips for free it would be legal under our arrangement and id never gambled before it might be fun accepting his hand i let him help me out of the car his pace was rapid as we hustled to the railed gangplank a man in a parka and gloves waited at the foot of the ramp and as kisten talked with him i glanced at the boats waterline rows of bubbles kept the riverboat from becoming iced in it was probably more expensive than taking the boat out for the winter but city regulations stipulated you could only gamble on the river and even though the boat was tied to the dock it was on the water after speaking into a radio the big man let us pass kisten put a hand on the small of my back and pushed me forward thanks for letting me borrow your coat i said as my boots clattered up and we found ourselves on the covered walkway tonights snow made a white icing and i brushed it off the railing to make slushy clumps in the open water my pleasure he said pointing to a half wood half glass door there was an etched intertwined pair of capital ss on it and i shuddered when a shimmer of ley line force passed through me when kisten opened the door and we crossed the threshold it was probably the casinos antitampering charm and it gave me the willies like i was breathing air coated in oil another big man in a tuxa witch by the familiar scent of redwoodwas there to greet us and he took both kistens and my coat kisten signed the guest book putting me down as guest peeved i wrote my name below his with big loopy flourishes taking up three entire lines the pen made my fingers tingle and i looked at the metal barrel before i set it down all my warning flags went up and while kisten bought a single chip with most of our date allowance i made a precise line through both my and kistens name to prevent our signatures from possibly being used as a focusing object for a ley line charm and you did that because kisten questioned as he took my arm trust me i smiled at the stonefaced witch in a tux handling the guest book there were subtler ways to prevent such thefts of focusing objects but i didnt know them and that i had just insulted the host didnt bother me at all like i would ever be back there again kisten had my arm so i was free to nod as if i was important to anyone who looked up from his or her gaming i was glad kisten had dressed me id have looked like a whore here in what i had picked out the oak and teak paneling was comforting and the rich green carpet felt scrumptious on my feet clear through my boots the few windows were draped with deep burgundy and black fabric pulled aside to show the lights of cincinnati it was warm with the scent of people and excitement the clatter of chips and bursts of sound quickened my pulse the low ceiling could have been claustrophobic but it wasnt there were two tables of blackjack a craps table a wheel and an entire bank of onearmed bandits in the corner was a small bar most of the staff was of the witch or warlock persuasion if my gut instinct was right i wondered where the poker table was upstairs perhaps i didnt know how to play anything else well i could play blackjack but that was for sissies how about some blackjack kisten said as he subtly guided me that way sure i said smiling do you want a drink i glanced at the surrounding people mixed drinks were the rule except for the one guy with a beer he was drinking it out of the bottle and it ruined his entire look tux aside dead mans float i asked as kisten helped me up onto a stool double shot of ice cream the hovering waitress nodded and after getting kistens order the older witch left kisten my gaze rose drawn by an enormous disk of gray metal hanging from the ceiling ribbons of a shiny metal radiated from it like a sunburst running to the edges of the ceiling it could have been a decoration but id be willing to bet the metal continued behind the wood paneling and even under the floor kisten what is that i whispered as i nudged him his gaze flicked to the disk probably their security system his eyes met mine and he smiled freckles he said even without your spells youre the most beautiful woman here i blushed at his complimentsure now that the enormous disk was more than art decobut when he turned back to the dealer i frantically looked at the mirror wall by the stairway my shoulders slumped as i saw me in my sophisticated outfit with freckles and my hair starting to frizz the entire boat was a nospell zoneat least for us earth witches using amuletsand i suspected that big purple disk had something in there to hinder ley line witches too just having the boat on the water was some protection against ley line tampering since you couldnt tap a line over the water unless you went the roundabout way through a familiar in all likelihood the boats security system dampened already invoked ley line spells and would detect anyone tapping a line through a familiar to invoke a new one i had once had a smaller version on my longgone is issue cuffs while kisten made nice with the dealer over his paltry fiftydollar chip i sat back and studied the people there were about thirty all welldressed and most older than kisten and i a frown crossed me as i realized kisten was the only vamp here witches weres and a few redeyed humans up past their bedtime but no vampires that struck me as wrong so while kisten doubled his money with a few hands i unfocused my attention wanting to see the room with my second sight i didnt like using my second sight especially at night when i could see an overlay of the everafter but id rather suffer a bad case of the heebiejeebies than not know what was happening i spared a thought wondering if algaliarept would know what i was doing than decided there was no way he could unless i tapped a line which i wouldnt settling myself i closed my eyes so my little used second sight wouldnt have to compete with my more mundane vision and with a mental shove i opened my minds eye immediately the wisps of my hair that had worked themselves free moved in the wind that always blew in the everafter the memory of the ship dissolved to nothing and the broken landscape of the demon city took its place a soft sound of disgust slipped from me and i reminded myself just why i never did this so close to the center of cincinnati the demon city was broken and ugly the waning crescent moon was probably up now and there was a definite red glow to the bottoms of the clouds seeming to light the stark cascade of broken buildings and vegetationstained rubble with a haze that covered everything and made me feel slimy somehow it was said the demons lived belowground and seeing what they had done to their citybuilt on the same ley lines as cincinnatii didnt wonder why id seen the everafter once during the day it wasnt much better i wasnt in the everafter just viewing it but i still felt uncomfortable especially when i realized the reason everything looked clearer than usual was because i was coated in algaliarepts black aura reminded of my slipped bargain i opened my eyes praying that algaliarept wouldnt find a way to use me through the lines as he had threatened the gambling boat was just the way i left it the noises that had been keeping me mentally connected to reality taking on meaning again i was using both my visions and before my second sight could become overwhelmed and lost i hurriedly looked around my gaze was immediately drawn to the metal disk in the ceiling and my mouth twisted in distaste it pulsated with a thick purple smear coating everything i would have bet that this was what i had felt when i crossed the threshold it was everyones aura that interested me most though i couldnt see mine even when i looked in the mirror nick had once told me it was yellow and goldnot that anyone could see it under als now kistens was a healthy warm orangy red shot through with slices of yellow concentrating about his head and a smile quirked my lips he used his head to make decisions not his heart i wasnt surprised there was no black in it though almost everyone elses in the room was streaked with darkness i realized as i scanned the floor i stifled a twitch when i found a young man in the corner watching me he was in a tux but it had a comfortable look on him not the stiff uptight demeanor of the doorman or the professional dullness of the dealers and the full glass by his hand said patron not wait staff his aura was so dark it was hard to tell if it was a deep blue or deep green a hint of demon black ran through it and i felt a wash of embarrassment that if he was looking at me with his second sightwhich i was sure he washe could see me coated in algaliarepts black slime leaning back with his chin on his inwardcurled fingertips he fixed his gaze on mine from across the room evaluating he was deeply tanneda neat trick in midwinterand combined with the faint highlights in his straight black hair i guessed he was from out of state and somewhere warm of average build and average looks he didnt strike me as particularly attractive but his confident assurance warranted a second look he appeared wealthy too but who didnt in a tux my eyes slid from him to the guy swilling beer and i decided tuxtrash could be done after all and with that thought making me smile i turned back to surfer boy he was still watching me and upon seeing my smile he matched it tilting his head in speculation and inviting conversation i took a breath to shake my head then stopped why in hell not i was fooling myself that nick was coming back and my date with kisten was a onenightonly offer wondering if his trace of black was from a demon mark i narrowed my concentration to try to see past his unusually dark aura as i did the purple glow coming from the ceiling disk brightened to take on the first tinges of yellow the man started his attention jerking to the ceiling shock marred his cleanshaven face an abrupt call went through the room from about three different places and at my forgotten elbow kisten swore as the dealer said this hand had been tampered with and that all play was suspended until he could break a new deck i lost my second sight completely then as the witch manning the guest book pointed me out to a second man clearly security by his serious lack of any emotional expression oh crap i swore turning my back on the room and picking up my dead mans float what kisten said irately while he stacked his winnings according to color i winced meeting his eyes over the rim of my glass i think i made a booboo thirteen what did you do rachel kisten said flatly stiffening as he looked over my shoulder nothing i exclaimed the dealer gave me a tired look and broke the seal on a fresh deck of cards and i didnt turn when i felt a presence loom heavy behind me is there a problem kisten said his attention was fixed a good three feet above my head slowly i turned finding a really really big man in a really really big tux its the lady i need to talk with his voice rumbled i didnt do anything i said quickly i was just looking over um the security i finished weakly just as a professional interest here heres one of my cards im in security myself i fumbled in my clasp purse for one handing it to him really i wasnt going to tamper with anything i didnt tap a line honest honest how lame was that my black business card looked small in his thick hands and he glanced at it once quickly reading it he made eye contact with a woman at the foot of the stairs she shrugged mouthing she didnt tap a line and he turned to me thank you ms morgan the man said and my shoulders eased please dont assert your aura over the house spells he didnt smile at all any more interference and we will ask you to leave sure no problem i said starting to breathe again he walked away and play resumed around us kistens eyes were full of annoyance cant i take you anywhere he said dryly putting his chips into a little bucket and handing them to me here i have to use the little boys room i stared blankly as he gave me a warning look before he ambled off leaving me alone in a casino with a bucket of chips and no idea what to do with them i turned to the blackjack dealer and he arched his eyebrows guess ill play something else i said as i slipped from the stool and he nodded clutch purse tucked under my arm i glanced over the room with my chips in one hand and my drink in the other surfer boy was gone and i stifled a sigh of disappointment head down i looked at the chips seeing they were engraved with the same intertwined ss not even knowing the monetary value of what i had i drifted to the excitement of the craps table i smiled at two men who slid apart to make a spot for me setting my drink and chips on the lower rim of the table while i tried to figure out why some people were happy at the five that was rolled and some were upset one of the witches whod made room for me was standing too close and i wondered when he would inflict his pickup line on me sure enough after the next roll he gave me a sloppy grin and said here i am what are your last two wishes my hand trembled and i forced it to remain unmoving please i said just stop oh nice manners babe he said loudly trying to embarrass me but i could embarrass myself a hell of a lot easier than he could the chatter of the game seemed to vanish as i focused on him i was ready to let him have it my selfrespect wounded to the quick when surfer boy appeared sir he said calmly that was the worst line ive ever heard not only insulting but showing a severe lack of forethought youre obviously bothering the young woman you should leave before she does permanent damage to you it was protective yet implied i could take care of myself not an easy thing to accomplish in one paragraph much less one sentence i was impressed onelinewonder took a breath paused and with his eyes rising over my shoulder he changed his mind muttering he took his drink and his buddy on the other side of me and left my shoulders eased and i found myself sighing as i turned to surfer boy thank you i said taking a closer look at him his eyes were brown and his lips were thin and when he smiled the expression encompassed both of them full and honest there was some asian heritage in his nottoodistant past giving him straight black hair and a small nose and mouth he ducked his head seemingly embarrassed no thanks needed i had to do something to redeem all men for that line his strongjawed face took on a false sincerity whatre your other two wishes he asked chuckling i laughed ending it by looking at the craps table as i thought of my big teeth my name is lee he said stepping into the silence before it became awkward rachel i said relieved when he extended his hand he smelled like sand and redwood and he slipped his thin fingers into my grip to meet my pressure with an equal force our hands yanked apart and my eyes jerked to his when a slip of ley line energy equalized between us sorry he said as he tucked his hand behind his back one of us must be low its probably me i said refusing to wipe my hand i dont keep line energy in my familiar lees eyebrows rose really i couldnt help but notice you looking at the security now i was really embarrassed and i took a sip of my drink and turned to lean with my elbows on the upper railing about the table that was an accident i said as the amber dice rolled past i didnt mean to trip the alarms i was just trying to get a closer look atumyou i finished certainly as red at my hair oh god i was screwing this up royally but lee seemed amused his teeth white in his suntanned face me too his accent was nice west coast perhaps i couldnt help but like his easy demeanor but when he took a sip of his white wine my gaze fixed to his wrist peeping from behind his cuff and my heart seemed to stop it was scarred it was scarred exactly like mine you have a demon sca his eyes jerked to mine and my words cut off sorry lees attention flicked to the nearby patrons none seemed to have heard its okay he said softly his brown eyes pinched i got it by accident i put my back against the railing understanding now why my demontainted aura hadnt scared him off dont we all i said surprised when he shook his head my thoughts went to nick and i bit my lower lip how did you get yours he asked and it was my turn to be nervous i was dying he saved me i owe him for safe passage through the lines i didnt think it necessary to tell lee that i was the demons familiar how about you curiosity eyes squinting he frowned at a past memory curious myself i gave him another onceover i wouldnt say als real name and break the contract we had come to when i had bought a summoning name from him but i wanted to know if it was the same demon hey uh does yours wear crushed green velvet i asked lee jerked his brown eyes went wide under his sharply cut bangs and then a smile born of shared trouble came over him yes he talks in a british accent and has a thing for frosting and french fries i interrupted lee ducked his head and chuckled yes when he isnt morphing into my father how about that i said feeling an odd kinship its the same one tugging his sleeve down to cover the mark lee rested his side against the craps table you seem to have a knack for ley lines he said are you taking instruction from him no i said forcefully im an earth witch i twiddled my finger with my ring amulet and touched the cord of the one around my neck that was supposed to defrizz my hair his attention went from the scar on my wrist to the ceiling but you he drawled i shook my head and sipped my drink my back to the game i told you it was an accident im not a ley line witch i took a class is all well half of one the instructor died before the class was finished he blinked in disbelief dr anders he blurted you had a class with dr anders you knew her i pulled myself straighter ive heard of her he leaned close she was the best ley line witch east of the mississippi i came out here to take classes from her she was supposed to be the best she was i said depressed she was going to help get nick unbound as my familiar now not only was the spell book gone but she was dead and all her knowledge with her i jerked upright as i realized i had been wool gathering so youre a student i asked lee rested his elbows on the rail watching the dice skitter and roll behind me road scholar he said shortly i got my degree years ago from berkeley oh id love to see the coast some time i said playing with my necklace and wondering how much of this conversation had turned into exaggeration doesnt the salt make everything difficult he shrugged not so much for ley line witches i feel bad for earth witches locked into a path that has no power my mouth dropped open no power hardly earth magics strength stemmed from ley lines as much as ley line witches spells that it was filtered through plants made it more forgiving and perhaps slower but no less powerful there wasnt a ley line charm written that could physically change a persons form now that was power chalking it up to ignorance i let it slide lest i drive him away before i got a chance to know just how big of a jerk he was first look at me he said clearly recognizing that he had stuck his foot so far down his throat that his toes might wiggle out of his ass here i am bothering you when you probably want to play some before your boyfriend gets back hes not my boyfriend i said not as excited as i could be for the subtle inquiry as to my attached status i told him he couldnt take me out on a decent date for sixty dollars and he accepted the challenge lee ran his eyes over the casino hows it going i sipped my drink wishing the ice cream hadnt melted behind me there was a loud cheer as something good happened well so far ive gotten sugared and passed out in a vamp dance club insulted my roommate and tripped the security system of a casino boat i lifted a shoulder in a half shrug not bad i guess its early yet lees gaze followed the rolling dice behind me can i buy you a drink ive heard the house wine is good merlot i think it is i wondered where this was going no thanks red winedoesnt sit well with me he chuckled im not particularly fond of it either it gives me migraines me too i exclaimed softly truly surprised lee tossed his bangs from his eyes now if i had said that you would have accused me of dropping you a line i smiled feeling shy all of a sudden and he turned to the cheering at the table you dont gamble do you he said i glanced behind me and then back to him it shows huh he put a hand on my shoulder and turned me around theyve rolled three fours in a row and you havent noticed he said softly almost in my ear i did nothing to either discourage or encourage him the sudden pounding of my heart not telling me what to do oh is that unusual i said trying to keep my voice light here he said motioning to the craps man new roller he called loudly oh wait i protested i dont even know how to bet not to be deterred lee took my little chip bucket and guided me to the head of the table you roll ill bet for you he hesitated brown eyes innocent is thatokay sure i said grinning what did i care kisten had given me the chips that he wasnt there to spend them with me wasnt my problem teaching me how to throw craps was what he was supposed to be doing not some guy in a tux where was he anyway i glanced over the assembled faces around the table as i took the dice they felt slipperylike bone in my handand i shook them wait lee reached out and took my hand in his you have to kiss them first but only once he said his voice serious though his eyes glinted if they think theyll get loved all the time they wont put out right i said his hands falling when i pulled the dice to my lips but refused to touch them i mean really yuck people shuffled their chips around and heart faster than the game warranted i threw the dice i eyed lee not the dice as they skittered and danced lee watched in rapt attention and i thought that though he wasnt pretty like kisten he was far more likely to be on a magazine cover than nick just an average guy and a witch with a degree my mother would love me to bring this one home something had to be wrong with him besides his demon mark i thought dryly god save me from myself the watching people had various reactions to the eight i rolled not good i asked lee his shoulders rose and fell as he took the dice the craps man pushed to him its okay he said but you have to roll an eight again before a seven comes up to win oh i said pretending i understood mystified i threw the dice this time they came up nine keep going i said and he nodded ill place some oneroll bets for you he said then paused if thats okay everyone was waiting so i said sure that will be great lee nodded his brow furrowed for a moment then he set a pile of red chips on a square someone snickered leaning to whisper innocent slaughter in their neighbors ear the dice were warm in my hand and i sent them rolling they bounced off the wall coming to halt it was an eleven and everyone at the table groaned lee though was smiling you won he said putting a hand on my shoulder see he pointed odds are fifteentoone of rolling an eleven i figured youd be a zebra my eyes widened as the predominate color of my pile of chips went from red to blue as the craps man piled a stack on them beg pardon lee set the dice in my hand when you hear hoofbeats look for horses that would be the common rolls in this case i knew youd roll something odd a zebra i grinned rather liking the idea and the dice flew from me almost before he moved my chips to another square my pulse quickened and as lee explained the details of odds and betting i rolled again and again and again the table becoming louder and more excited it wasnt long before i caught on the risk the question of what would happen and the breathless wait until the dice settled was akin to being on a run only better because here it was little plastic chips on the line not my life lee switched his tutorial to other ways to wager and when i dared to make a suggestion he beamed gesturing that the table was mine delighted i took over the betting letting it ride where it was while lee put a hand on my shoulder and whispered the odds of throwing this and that he smelled like sand i could feel his excitement through the thin material of my silk shirt and the warmth of his fingers seemed to linger on my shoulder when he shifted to put the dice in my hand i looked up when the table cheered my latest roll surprised that almost everyone was clustered about us and that we had somehow become the center of attention looks like you have it lee smiled as he took a step back immediately my face went slack youre leaving i asked as the redcheeked guy drinking beer pressed the dice into my hand and urged me to throw them i need to go he said but i couldnt resist meeting you leaning close he said i enjoyed teaching you craps youre a very special woman rachel lee confused i set the dice down and the people around the table groaned lee slid the dice into his hand and put them in mine youre hot dont stop do you want my phone number i asked oh god i sounded desperate but lee smiled his teeth hidden youre rachel morgan the is runner who quit to work with last living tamwood vamp youre in the phone bookin four places no less my face flamed but i managed to stop myself before i told everyone i wasnt a hooker till next time lee said raising his hand and inclining his head before he walked away setting the dice down i backed from the table so i could watch him vanish up the stairway at the back of the boat looking good in his tux and purple sash it matched his aura i decided a new shooter took my place and the noise returned my good mood soured i retreated to a table by a cold window one of the wait staff brought me my three buckets of chips another set a fresh dead mans float on a linen napkin a third lit the red candle and asked me if i needed anything i shook my head and he eased away whats wrong with this picture i whispered as i rubbed my fingers into my forehead here i was dressed up like a young rich widow sitting alone in a casino with three buckets of chips lee had known who i was and never let on where in hell was kisten the excitement at the craps table nosedived and people started pulling away in twos and threes i counted to a hundred then two hundred angry i stood ready to cash in my chips and find kisten little boys room my ass he was probably upstairs playing pokerwithout me chip buckets in hand i jerked to a stop kisten was coming down the stairs movements sharp and quick with a living vampires speed where have you been i demanded when he came even with me his face was tight and i could see a line of sweat on him were leaving he said shortly lets go hold up i jerked out of the grip he had on my elbow whereve you been you left me all alone some guy had to teach me how to throw craps see what i won kisten glanced down at my buckets clearly not impressed the tables are fixed he said shocking me they were entertaining you while i talked to the boss i felt as if id been punched in the gut i jerked back when he went for my elbow again stop trying to drag me around i said not caring that people were watching and what do you mean you were talking to the boss he gave me an exasperated look the first hints of stubble showing on his chin can we do this outside he said obviously in a hurry i glanced at the big men coming down the stairway this was a gambling boat it wasnt piscarys kisten was handling the undead vampires affairs he was here leaning on the new guy in town and he had brought me in case there was trouble my chest tightened in anger as it all started to come together but discretion was the wiser part of valor fine i said my boots made muted thumps in time with my pulse as i headed for the door i dropped my buckets of chips on the counter and smiled grimly at the chip lady i want my winnings donated to the city fund for rebuilding the burned orphanages i said tightly yes maam the woman said politely weighing them out kisten took a chip from the pile were going to cash this one out i plucked it from his fingers mad at him for having used me like this this was where he wanted ivy to go with him and i had fallen for it whistling i tossed the chip to the craps dealer he caught it inclining his head in thanks that was a hundreddollar chip kisten protested really ticked i took another throwing it after the first i dont want to be a cheap ass i muttered the woman handed me a receipt for donated to the citys fund i stared at it for a moment then tucked it in my clutch purse rachel kisten protested his face going red behind his blond hair were keeping nothing ignoring kistens coat that the doorman was holding for me i blew out the door with its double ss one for saladan perhaps god i was a fool rachel anger made kistens voice hard as he leaned out the door after me come back here and tell her to cash one of them out you gave me the first ones and i won the rest i shouted from the foot of the ramp my arms wrapped around me in the falling snow im donating all of them and im pissed at you you bloodsucking coward the man at the foot of the ramp snickered steeling his face into impassivity when i glared at him kisten hesitated then closed the door and came down after me my borrowed coat over his arm i stomped to his car waiting for him to unlock the door for me or tell me to call a cab still putting on his coat kisten stopped beside me why are you mad at me he said flatly his blue eyes starting to go black in the dim light that is saladans boat isnt it i said furiously pointing i may be slow but i eventually catch on piscary runs the gambling in cincinnati you came out here looking for piscarys cut and saladan turned you down didnt he hes moving in on piscarys turf and you brought me as backup knowing i would fight for your ass if things got out of control incensed i ignored his teeth and his strength and put my face inches from his dont you ever trick me into backing you up again you could have gotten me killed with your little games i dont get a second chance kisten dead is dead for me my voice echoed off the nearby buildings i thought of the ears listening from the boat and my face burned but i was angry damn it and this was going to be settled before i got back in kistens car you dress me up to make me feel special i said my throat tight and my anger high treat me as if taking me out was something you wanted to do for me even if it was only in the hope of sinking your teeth in and then i find out its not even that but business i wasnt even your first choice you wanted ivy to come with you not me i was your alternate plan how cheap do you think that makes me feel he opened his mouth then shut it i can understand you using me as a secondchoice date because youre a man and therefore a jerk i exclaimed but you knowingly brought me out here into a potentially dangerous situation without my spells without my charms you said it was a date so i left everything at home hell kisten if you wanted backup i would have besides i added my anger starting to slow since he seemed to actually be listening instead of spending the time formulating excuses it would have been fun knowing what was going on i could have pumped people for information stuff like that he stared at me surprise mirrored in his eyes really yeah really you think i became a runner for their dental plan it wouldve made for more fun than having some guy teach me craps that was your job by the way kisten stood next to me a dusting of snow starting to accumulate on his leather coat draped over his arm his face was long and unhappy in the dim light from a streetlamp he took a breath and my eyes narrowed it escaped him in a quick sound of defeat i could feel my blood racing and my body was both hot and cold from my anger and the cutting wind off the river i liked even less that kisten could probably read my feelings better than i could his eyes with their growing rim of blue flicked past me to the boat as i watched they flashed to black chilling me youre right he said shortly his voice tight get in the car my anger flamed back son of a bitch dont patronize me i said tightly he reached out and i jerked away before he could touch me black eyes looking soulless in the dim light he turned his reach for me into opening my door im not he said his motions edging into that eerie vamp quickness there are three men coming off the boat i can smell gunpowder you were right i was wrong get in the damn car fourteen fear flashed through me and sensing it kisten took a breath as if i had slapped him i froze reading in his rising hunger that i had more to worry about than the feet booming down the gangplank heart pounding i got in the car kisten handed me my coat and his keys my door thumped shut and while he crossed in front of his car i jammed the key into the ignition kisten got in and the sudden rumble came simultaneously with him shutting his door the three men had shifted direction their pace quickening as they headed for an early model bmw theyll never catch us in that kisten scoffed wipers going to push off the snow he put the car in gear and i braced against the dash when he punched it we skidded fishtailing into the street and running a late yellow light i didnt look behind us kisten slowed as the traffic increased and pulse hammering i wiggled into his coat and put on my seat belt he flicked the heater on high but it only blew cold air i felt naked without my charms damn it i should have brought something but it was supposed to have been a date im sorry kisten said as he cut a sudden left you were right you idiot i shouted my voice harsh in the close confines of the car dont you ever make my decisions for me kisten those men had guns and i had nothing fading adrenaline made my words louder than i had intended and i glanced at him suddenly sobered as i remembered the black of his eyes when my fear had hit him he might look safe dressed in his italian suit and his hair slicked backbut he wasnt he could shift between one heartbeat and the next god what was i doing here i said i was sorry kisten said again not looking from the road as the lit buildings hazy with snow passed there was more than a hint of bother in his tone and i decided to stop shouting at him even if i was still pissed and shaking besides he wasnt cowering begging for forgiveness and his confident admission of having made a mistake was nice for a change dont worry about it i said sourly not yet ready to forgive him but not wanting to talk about it anymore either shit he said his jaw clenching as he watched the rearview mirror instead of the road in front of him theyre still following us i twitched managing to not turn and look satisfying myself with what i could see in the side mirror kisten took a sudden right and my lips parted in disbelief the road ahead of us was empty a dark tunnel of nothing compared to the lights and the security of commerce behind us what are you doing i asked hearing a tinge of fear in my voice his eyes were still on the road behind us when the dark cadillac jerked out in front of us blocking the road as it spun sideways kisten i shouted bracing my arms against the dash a tiny shriek escaped me as he swore and jerked the wheel my head smacked the window and i bit back a cry of pain breath held i felt the wheels lose contact with the pavement and we slipped on the ice still swearing kisten reacted with his vamp reflexes the car fighting him the little corvette gave a final little hiccup of motion as it found the curb and we swayed to a shaken halt stay in the car he reached for the door four men in dark suits were getting out of the cadillac ahead of us three were in the bmw behind us all witches probably and here i was with only a couple of vanity charms this was going to look really good in the obituaries kisten wait i said hand on the door he turned my chest clenched at the blackness in his eyes oh god he had vamped out it will be okay he said his voice a blackearth rich rumble that went to my core and gripped my heart how do you know i whispered a blonddyed eyebrow shifted up so slightly i wasnt sure it even moved because if they kill me then id be dead and ill hunt them down they want totalk stay in the car he got out and shut the door the car was still running the thrum of the engine tightening my muscles one by one falling snow hit the windshield to melt and i turned off the wipers stay in the car i muttered fidgeting i glanced behind me seeing the three guys from the bmw moving closer kisten was lit to a stark severity as he crossed in front of his lights approaching the four men with his palms forward with a casualness that i knew was false like hell im going to stay in the car i said reaching for the handle and lurching into the cold kisten turned i told you to stay in the car he said and i pushed down my fear at the starkness in his expression he had already divorced himself from what was going to happen yeah you did i shot back forcing my arms down it was cold and i shivered he hesitated clearly torn the approaching men spread out we were surrounded their faces were shadowed but confident all they needed was a bat or crowbar to thump against their hand to make it complete but they were witches their strength was in their magic my breath came slow and i rocked forward on my flat boots feeling the stir of adrenaline i moved into the cars headlights and put my back to kistens the black hunger in his eyes seemed to pause rachel please wait in the car he said his voice making my skin crawl this wont take long and i dont want you to get cold he didnt want me to get cold i thought watching the three guys from the bmw behind us settle in to make a living fence there are seven witches here i said softly it only takes three to make a net and one to hold it once its in place true but it only takes me three seconds to drop a man the men in my sight faltered there was a reason the is didnt send witches to bring in a vampire seven against one might do it but not without someone getting really hurt i risked a glance over my shoulder to see that the four guys from the cadillac were looking at the man in the long coat who had gotten out from the bmw top guy i thought thinking he was too confident as he adjusted his long coat and jerked his head to the men around us the two in front of kisten started forward and three dropped back their lips were moving and their hands were gesturing the hair on the back of my neck pricked at the sudden rise of power at least three ley line witches i guessed then went cold as one of the advancing men pulled out a gun crap kisten could come back from the dead but i couldnt kisten i warned my voice rising and my eyes fixed on the gun kisten moved and i jumped one moment he was next to me and the next he was among the men there was a pop of a gun gasping i ducked blinding myself in the corvettes headlights crouched i saw one guy was down but not the one with the gun encircling us almost lost in the glare the ley line witches muttered and gestured their net tightening when they took a step in my skin tingled as the lacework fell over us moving too fast to readily follow kisten grabbed the wrist of the man with the gun the snap of bone was clear in the cold dry air my stomach lurched as the man screamed and fell to his knees kisten followed it up with a powerful blow to his head someone was shouting the gun fell and kisten caught it before it hit the snow with a flick of his wrist kisten sent the gun arching to me it glinted in the headlights as i lurched forward to catch it the heavy metal landed in my grip it was hot surprising me there was another pop of a gun and i jerked the gun fell to the snow get that weapon the man in the long coat at the outskirts shouted i peeked over the hood of kistens corvette seeing he had a gun too my eyes widened as i saw the black shadow of a man coming at me there was a ball of orange everafter in his hand my breath hissed as he smiled and threw it at me i hit the pavement the snowcovered ice making a hard landing the everafter exploded into a shower of sulfursmelling sparkles as it struck kistens car and ricocheted away cold slush seeped against me the shock clearing my head from the ground i put my palms against the cold pavement and levered myself up my clothesmy clothes my silklined pants were covered in filthy gray snow look what you made me do i shouted furious as i shook the cold slop from me you son of a bitch kisten cried and i spun to see three witches down in a messy circle about him the one that had thrown the everafter made a pained motion and kisten savagely kicked him how had he gotten there so fast you burned my paint job you mother as i watched kistens mien shifted in a breathless instant eyes black he lunged at the closest gesturing ley line witch the mans eyes widened but he had no time for more kistens fist rammed into his face rocking his head back there was an ugly sounding crunch and the witch crumpled arms slack he arched backward through the air landing to skid into the headlights of the cadillac spinning before the first had stopped moving kisten landed before the next turning in a tight circle his dress shoes smacked into the back of the startled witchs knees the man cried out as his legs buckled the sound cut off with a frightening suddenness when kisten stiffarmed his throat my stomach clenched at the gurgle and crackle of cartilage the third witch backpedaled into a run mistake terrible terrible mistake kisten paced the ten feet between them in half a heartbeat grabbing the fleeing witch he spun him in a circle never letting go of his arm the pop of his arm dislocating hit me like a slap i put a hand to my stomach sickened it had taken a moments thought and nothing more kisten stopped before the last witch standing an aggressive eight feet back i shuddered remembering ivy looking at me like that he had a pistol but i didnt think it was going to help him you going to shoot me kisten snarled the man smiled i felt him tap a line my breath came quick to shout a warning kisten jerked forward catching the man about the throat the mans eyes bulged in fear as he struggled for air the pistol dropped his hand hanging useless kistens shoulders tensed his aggression shining from him i couldnt see his eyes i didnt want to but the man he held could and he was terrified kisten i shouted too afraid to interfere oh god please no i dont want to see this kisten hesitated and i wondered if he could hear my heart pounding slowly as if fighting himself kisten pulled the man closer the witch was gasping struggling to breathe headlights glinted on the spit frothing at the corner of his mouth and his face was red tell saladan ill be seeing him kisten almost growled i jerked when kistens arm thrust out and the witch went flying he landed against a defunct light post and the shock reverberated up the pole to make the light flicker on i was afraid to move as kisten turned seeing me standing in the falling snow lit by the cars headlights he paused eyes that awful black he brushed a spot of dampness from his coat poised and tense i tore my gaze from him to follow his attention when he glanced over the carnage brightly lit from the three pair of headlights and the one streetlamp men sprawled everywhere the one with the dislocated shoulder had vomited and was trying to get to a car from down the street a dog barked and a curtain fluttered against a lit window i put a hand to my stomach nauseous i had frozen oh god i had frozen unable to do anything i had let myself get stupid because my death threats were gone but because of what i did i would always be a target kisten strode into motion the ring of blue around his black pupils a thin rim i told you to stay in the car he said and i stiffened as he took my elbow and led me to his corvette numb i didnt resist he wasnt angry with me and i didnt want to make him any more aware of my pounding heart and lingering fear but a tingle of warning brought me stiff jerking out of kistens grip i turned eyes wide and searching from the under the streetlamp the broken man slitted his eyes his face ugly in pain you lose bitch he said then mouthed a savage word in latin look out i cried pushing kisten away from me he fell back catching his balance with his vampire grace i went sprawling when my boots slipped a raw scream shocked through me heart pounding i scrambled up my eyes going first to kisten he was all right it was the witch my hand went to my mouth horrified as his everafter smeared body writhed on the snowcovered sidewalk fear slithered through me as the kickedup snow took on a tinge of red he was bleeding through his pores god save him i whispered he shrieked then shrieked again the harsh sound striking a primal chord in me kisten strode to him quickly i couldnt stop him the witch was bleeding screaming in pain and fear he was pushing every button kisten had i turned away a trembling hand resting on the rumbling warm hood of the corvette i was going to get sick i knew it my head jerked up as the mans terror and pain ended in a sodden crack kisten stood from his crouch a horrible angry look on him the dog barked again filling the icy night with the sound of alarm a pair of dice rolled from the mans slack hand and kisten picked them up i couldnt think anymore kisten was suddenly next to me his hand on my elbow hustling me to the car i let him move me glad he hadnt succumbed to his vampiric instincts and wondering why he hadnt if anything his vampire aura was completely washed away his eyes normal and his reactions only mildly fast hes not dead he said handing me the dice none of them are dead i didnt kill anyone rachel i wondered why he cared what i thought taking the pieces of plastic i gripped them until my fingers ached get the gun i whispered my fingerprints are on it not acknowledging he heard me he tucked my coat in out of the door and shut it the sharp tang of blood drew my attention down and i forced my hand open the dice were sticky my gut twisted and i held a wintercold fist to my mouth they were the pair i had used in the casino the entire room had seen me kiss them he tried to use them as a focal object but i hadnt made a link to them and so the black charm swung back to its maker instead i stared out the window trying not to hyperventilate that was supposed to be me there limbs contorted and sprawled in a smear of bloodmelted snow i had been a wild card in saladans game and he had been prepared to take me out to tip the balance back to his men and i had done nothing too frozen by my lack of charms and shock to even make a circle there was a flash of brighter light as kisten stepped in front of the cars headlights bending to come up with the weapon his eyes met minetired and wearyuntil a soft movement behind him brought him spinning around someone was trying to leave i made a small moan as kisten took incredibly long fast steps and had him jerking him upright feet dangling a whimper came from the man going right to my core as he pleaded for his life i told myself that to pity him was foolish that they had planned worse for me and kisten but all kisten did was talk to him faces touching as the vampire whispered into his ear in a splurge of motion kisten threw him onto the hood of the cadillac wiping the weapon off on the hem of the witchs coat finished he dropped the gun and turned away kistens back was hunched when he stomped back to the car making him a bad mix of anger and worry i said nothing as he got in and turned the wipers on still silent he jerked the gearshift back and forth maneuvering the car to get out of the box the two cars had made i held onto the door handle and said nothing as our momentum shifted stalled and shifted again finally there was only clear road ahead of us and kisten floored it my eyes widened as the wheels spun and we started to drift on the ice to the left but then the tires caught and we lurched forward we left the way we had come in a sliding sound of racing engine i kept silent as kisten drove his motions quick and sudden the lights abruptly brightened around us falling onto his face lined with stress my stomach was tense and my back hurt he knew i was trying to figure out how to react watching him had been both exhilarating and scary as all hell living with ivy had taught me vamps were as changeable as a serial killer fun and captivating one moment aggressive and dangerous the next i knew it but seeing it had been a shocking reminder swallowing hard i looked at my posture seeing i was wound up tighter than a chipmunk on speed immediately i forced my clasped hands apart and my shoulders down i stared at the bloody dice in my hand and kisten muttered i wouldnt do that to you rachel i wouldnt the rhythm of the wipers was slow and steady maybe i shouldve stayed in the car therere hand wipes in the console his voice carried the softness of an apology dropping my eyes before he could meet them i flipped open the console and found some tissues my fingers were shaking as i wrapped the dice up and after a moment of hesitation dropped them into my clutch purse digging deeper i found the wipes unhappy i handed kisten the first then cleaned my hands with the second kisten easily drove the snowy busy streets and meticulously cleaned his cuticles at the same time when finished he held out his hand for my used wipe and i gave it to him there was a little trash bag hanging behind my seat and he effortlessly reached back and threw them both away his hands were as steady as a surgeons and i curled my fingers under my palms to hide their trembling kisten resettled himself and i could almost see him force the tension from him as he exhaled we were halfway across the hollows the lights of cincinnati sharp before us snap crackle pop he said lightly bewildered i looked at him i beg your pardon i said glad my voice was even yeah i had watched him down a coven of black art witches with the effortless grace of a predator but if he wanted to discuss breakfast cereals now id go along with it he smiled with his lips closed a hint of an apology or perhaps guilt in the back of his blue eyes snap crackle pop he said bringing them down sounded like a bowl of cereal my eyebrows rose and a wry smile came over me with a small movement i stretched my feet to the floor vent if i didnt laugh i was going to cry and i didnt want to cry i havent done too well tonight have i he said his eyes back on the road i didnt say anything not sure what i felt rachel he said softly im sorry you had to see that i dont want to talk about it i said recalling the mans terrified agonylaced screams i had known kisten did ugly things because of who he was and who he worked for but seeing it left me both repelled and fascinated i was a runner violence was part of my existence i couldnt blindly label what happened as bad without casting my own profession into darkness though his eyes had been black and his instincts wound tight he had acted quickly and decisively with a grace and succinct movement that i envied even more throughout it all i had felt kistens attention lightly on me always aware of where i was and who was threatening me i had frozen and he had kept me safe kisten accelerated smoothly into the intersection before us when the light turned green he sighed clearly unaware of my thoughts as he took the turn to head to the church the glowing clock on the dash read threethirty going out didnt sound like fun anymore but i was still shaking and if he didnt feed me i was going to end up eating cheese crackers and leftover rice for dinner yuck mickeyds i prompted it was just a date for gods sake one platonicdate kistens head jerked up lips parted in wonder he almost rammed the car ahead of us slamming on the brakes at the last moment used to the way ivy drove i simply braced myself and rocked forward and back you still want to have dinner he asked while the guy before us shouted unheard insults through his rearview mirror i shrugged i was coated in dirty snow slime my hair was falling down about my ears my nerves were shotif i didnt get something in my stomach i was going to get snippy or sick or worse kisten settled back a thoughtful expression smoothing his pinched features a wisp of his usual cocky self glimmered in his slumping posture fast food is all i can affordnow he grumbled lightly but i could see he was relieved i wasnt demanding he take me home i was planning on using some of those winnings to take you up to carew tower for a sunrise dinner the orphans need the money more than i need an overpriced dinner at the top of cincinnati i said kisten laughed at that the sound making it easy to stifle my last thread of lingering caution he kept me alive when i had frozen it wasnt going to happen again ever hey uh is there any way you might see to not tell ivy aboutthat he asked i smiled at the unease in his voice itll cost you fangboy a small noise escaped him and he turned his eyes wide in mock concern im in the position to offer you a supersized shake for your silence he intoned and i stifled a shiver at the play menace he had put in it yeah color me stupid but i was alive and he had kept me safe make it chocolate i said and youve got yourself a deal kistens smile widened and he gripped the wheel with more surety i settled back into the heated leather cushions stifling the small ohsosmall thought of concern what like i was going to tell ivy anyway fifteen the crunch of ice and salt was loud as kisten escorted me to my door his car was parked at the curb in a puddle of light diffuse from the falling snow i rose up the steps wondering what would happen in the next five minutes it was a platonic date but it was a date that he might kiss me had me nervous i turned as i reached the door smiling kisten stood beside me in his long wool coat and shiny shoes looking good with his hair falling over his eyes the sifting snow was beautiful and it was gathering on his shoulders the ugliness of the nights trouble drifted in and out of my thoughts i had a good time i said wanting to forget it mickeyds was fun kistens head drooped and a small chuckle escaped him ive never pretended to be health inspectors to get a free meal before how did you know what to do i winced i uh flipped burgers during high school until i dropped a charm into the fry vat his eyebrows rose and i added i got fired i dont know what the big deal was nobody got hurt and the woman looked better with straight hair he laughed turning it into a cough you dropped a potion in the fry vat it was an accident the manager had to pay for a day at a spa and i got pushed off the broomstick all she needed was a salt bath to break the spell but she was going to sue i cant imagine why kisten rocked to his toes and down his hands behind his back as he looked up through the snow at the steeple im glad you had a good time i did too he took a step back and i went still ill stop by sometime tomorrow night to pick up my coat hey um kisten i said not knowing why do youwant a cup of coffee he came to a graceful halt with one foot on the next step down turning back he smiled his pleased expression reaching all the way to his eyes only if you let me make it deal my pulse was just a shade faster as i opened the door and preceded him in the sound of slow jazz met us drifting up from the living room ivy was home and i hoped she had already been out and back from her twiceweekly fix a soulfully sung lilac wine made a soft mood accentuated by the darkness of the sanctuary i shuffled off kistens coat the sound of the silk lining a soft hush as it slid from me the sanctuary was dim and silent the pixies snug in my desk though they ought to have been up by now wanting to preserve the mood i slipped off my boots while kisten hung his coat beside the one he had let me borrow come on back i whispered not wanting to wake the pixies kistens smile was soft as he followed me into the kitchen we were quiet but i knew ivy had heard us when she turned the music down a shade tossing my clutch purse to my side of the table i felt like someone else as i padded in my stocking feet to the fridge for the coffee i caught sight of my reflection in the window if you ignored the snow stains and falling hair i didnt look too bad ill get the coffee i said searching the fridge as the sound of tinkling water intruded on the jazz grounds in hand i turned to find him looking relaxed and comfortable in his pinstriped suit as he stood at the sink and cleaned the new coffee carafe his mind was entirely on his task seemingly unaware that i was in the same room while he threw out the old grounds and pulled a filter from the cupboard with a smooth unthinking motion after an entire four hours with him without one flirting comment or sexualblood innuendo i felt comfortable i hadnt known he could be like this normal i watched him move seeing him with his thoughts on nothing i liked what i saw and i wondered what it would be like to be this way all the time as if feeling my eyes on him kisten turned what he asked smiling nothing i glanced at the black hallway i want to check on ivy kistens lips parted to show a glimpse of teeth as his smile widened okay not sure why that seemed to please him i gave him a last higheyebrow look and headed into the candlelit living room ivy was sprawled across her cushy suede chair her head on one arm her legs draped over the other her brown eyes flicked to mine as i entered taking in the smooth elegant lines of my clothes all the way to my feet in their nylons youve got snow all over you she said her expression and position unchanging i uh slipped i lied and she accepted that taking my nervousness as embarrassment why are the pixies still asleep she snortedsitting up to put her feet on the floorand i sat on the matching couch across from her with the coffee table between us jenks kept them up after you left so they wouldnt be awake when you got home a thankful smile came over me remind me to make him some honey cakes i said leaning back and crossing my legs ivy slumped into her chair mirroring my posture sohow was your date my eyes met hers very aware of kisten listening from the kitchen i shrugged ivy often acted like a cloying exboyfriend which was really really weird but now that i knew it stemmed from her need to keep my trust it was a bit easier to understand though still odd she took a slow breath and i knew she was scenting the air to make sure no one had bitten me at piscarys her shoulders eased and i rolled my eyes in exasperation hey um i started im really sorry about what i said earlier about piscarys her eyes jerked to mine and i quickly added you want to go sometime together i mean i think if i stay downstairs i wont pass out my eyes pinched not knowing why i was doing this except if she didnt find a way to relax soon she was going to snap i didnt want to be around for that and id feel better if i was there to keep an eye on her i had a feeling she would pass out quicker than i had ivy shifted in the chair moving back where she was when i came in sure she said her voice not giving me a clue to her thoughts as she looked at the ceiling and closed her eyes we havent had a girls night out in a while great i settled back into the cushions to wait for kisten from the stereo a softspoken voice dripping sex whispered as the songs changed the scent of brewing coffee became obvious a smile came over me as takatas newest single came on they were playing it even on the jazz stations ivy opened her eyes backstage passes she said smiling allllll the way backstage i countered she had already agreed to work the concert with me and i was eager to introduce her to takata but then i thought of nick no chance hed be going now maybe i could ask kisten to help us and since he was posing as piscarys scion he would be doubly effective as a deterrent kinda like a cop car parked in the median i looked at the black archway wondering if hed say yes if i asked and if i wanted him there listen ivy held up a finger this is my favorite part that low thrum goes all the way to my gut hear the pain in her voice this has got to be takatas best cd yet her voice i thought takata was the only one singing youre mine in some small fashion ivy whispered her eyes closed the inner pain showing on her brow making me uneasy youre mine though you know it not youre mine bond born of passion my eyes widened she wasnt singing what takata was her words were interlaced with his an eerie backdrop that set my skin to crawl that was the chorus he wasnt going to release youre mine yet wholly you she breathed by the way of your will ivy i exclaimed and her eyes flashed open where did you hear that she looked blankly at me as takata continued singing of bargains made in ignorance thats the alternate chorus i said sitting up to the edge of the couch he wasnt going to release that alternate chorus she said as kisten came in setting the tray with three cups of coffee on the table beside the thick red candles and pointedly sitting next to me the lyrics i pointed to the stereo you were singing them he wasnt going to release those he told me he was going to release the other ones ivy stared at me as if i had gone insane but kisten groaned hunching to put his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands its the vamp track he said his voice flat damn i thought something was missing bewildered i reached for my coffee ivy sat up and did the same vamp track i said kistens head came up his expression was resigned as he brushed his blond bangs back takata puts a track in his music that only the undead can hear he said and i froze my mug halfway to my lips ivy can hear it because shes piscarys scion ivys face went white you cant hear her she asked right there she said looking at the stereo as the refrain came back on you cant hear her singing between takata i shook my head feeling uneasy all i can hear is him the drum she asked can you hear that kisten nodded leaning back with his coffee and looking sullen yes but youre hearing a hell of a lot more than we are he set his cup down damn it he swore now ill have to wait until im dead and hope to find an old copy laying around he sighed in disappointment is it good ivy her voice is the eeriest thing ive ever heard shes in every cd but shes never listed in the credits he slumped i dont know why she doesnt burn her own album you cant hear her ivy said her words a sharp staccato she set the cup down hard enough to spill and i stared surprised kisten made a wry face and shook his head congratulations he said bitterly welcome to the club wish i was still in it my pulse quickened as ivys eyes flashed into anger no she said standing kisten glanced up his eyes wide only now realizing ivy wasnt pleased ivy shook her head wiretight no she said adamantly i dont want it understanding pulled me straight that she could hear it meant that piscarys grip on her was tightening i looked at kisten and his expression went worried ivy wait he soothed as her usually placid face went ugly with anger nothing is mine anymore she exclaimed her eyes flashing to black it was beautiful and now its ugly because of him hes taking everything kist she shouted everything kisten stood and i froze as he went around the table and reached for her ivy this is going to stop she said knocking his hand aside with a quick jerk before he could touch her right now my jaw dropped as she strode from the room with a vampire quickness the candles flickered then steadied ivy i set my coffee down and stood but the room was empty kisten had darted out after her i was alone where are you going i whispered i heard the muffled rumble of ivys sedan start borrowed from her mother for the winter in an instant she was gone i went into the hall the soft thump of kisten shutting the door and his steps on the hardwood floor clear in the silence wheres she going i asked him as he came even with me at the top of the hallway he put a hand on my shoulder in a silent suggestion that i go back into the living room in my stocking feet i felt the difference in our height keenly to talk to piscary piscary alarm brought me to a standstill i pulled out of his light grip and stopped in the hall she cant talk to him alone but kisten gave me a mirthless smile shell be fine its high time she talk to him as soon as she does hell back off thats why hes been bothering her this is a good thing not convinced i returned to the living room i was very conscious of him behind me silent close enough to touch we were alone if you didnt count the fiftysix pixies in my desk shell be all right he said under his breath as he followed me shoes silent on the gray carpet i wanted him to leave i was emotionally whipped and i wanted him to leave feeling his eyes on me i blew out the candles in the new darkness i gathered the coffee cups onto the tray in the hopes that he would take the hint but as my gaze rose to the hallway a thought stopped me cold do you think piscary can make her bite me he almost made her bite quen kisten shifted into motion his fingers brushing mine as he took the tray from me in the smokescented air no he said clearly waiting for me to go into the kitchen before him why not i padded into the brightly lit room squinting at the new glare kisten slid the tray beside the sink and dumped the coffee to make brown puddles in the white porcelain sink piscary was able to exert such an influence on her this afternoon because he caught her off guard that and she didnt have any set behavior to fight it shes been battling her instincts to bite you since you were partners in the is saying no has gotten easy piscary cant make her bite you unless she gives in first and she wont give in she respects you too much i opened the dishwasher and kisten stacked the cups in the top rack are you sure i asked softly wanting to believe yes his knowing smile made him a bad boy in an expensive suit again ivy takes pride in denying herself she values her independence more than i do which is why she fights him itd be easier if shed give it up hed stop forcing his dominance then its not degrading to let piscary see through your eyes channel your emotions and desires i found it uplifting uplifting i leaned against the counter in disbelief piscary exerting his will over her and making her do things she doesnt want to is uplifting not when you put it like that he opened the cupboard under the sink and pulled out the dish detergent i briefly wondered how he knew it was there but piscary is being a pain in the ass only because shes resisting him he likes her fighting him i took the bottle from him and filled the little cup in the door of the dishwasher i keep telling her that being piscarys scion doesnt make her less but more he said she doesnt lose any of herself and gains so much like the vampire track and having almost the full strength of an undead without any of the drawbacks like a soul to tell you its wrong to view people as walking snack bars i said tartly snapping the door shut a sigh slipped from him the fine fabric of his suit bunching at his shoulders when he took the bottle of soap from me and set in on the counter its not like that he said sheep are treated like sheep users are used and those who deserve more receive everything arms crossed over my chest i said and who are you to make that decision rachel he sounded weary as he cupped my elbows in his hands they make the decision themselves i dont believe that but i didnt pull away and i didnt push his hands off me and even if they do you take advantage of it kistens eyes went distant falling from mine as he gently pulled my arms into a less aggressive posture most people he said are desperate to be needed and if they dont feel good about themselves or think theyre undeserving of love some will fasten upon the worst possible way to satisfy that need to punish themselves theyre the addicts the shadows both claimed and unclaimed passed like the fawning sheep they make themselves into as they search for a glimmer of worth knowing its false even as they beg for it yes it is ugly and yes we take advantage of those who let us but which is worse taking from someone who wants you to knowing in your soul that youre a monster or taking from an unwilling person and proving it my heart pounded i wanted to argue with him but everything he had said i agreed with and then there are those who relish the power they have over us kistens lips thinned from a past anger and he dropped his hands from me the clever ones who know that our need to be accepted and trusted runs so deep it can be crippling those who play upon that knowing we will do almost anything for that invitation to take the blood we desperately crave the ones who exalt in the hidden domination a lover can exert feeling it elevates them to an almost godlike status those are the ones who want to be us thinking it will make them powerful and we use them too casting them aside with less regret than the sheep unless we grow to hate them upon which we make them one of us in cruel restitution he cupped my jaw with his hand it was warm and i didnt pull away and then there are the rare ones who know love who understand it who freely give of themselves demanding only a return of that love that trust his faultless blue eyes never blinked and i held my breath it can be beautiful rachel when there is trust and love no one is bound no one loses his or her will no one becomes less both become more than they can be alone but it is so rare so beautiful when it happens i shivered wondering if he was lying to me the soft touch of his hand down my jaw as he pulled away sent my blood humming but he didnt notice his attention on the coming dawn visible out the window i feel bad for ivy he whispered she doesnt want to accept her need for belonging even as it charts her every move she wants that perfect love but thinks she isnt deserving of it she doesnt love piscary i whispered you said there was no beauty without trust and love kistens eyes met mine i wasnt talking about piscary his attention went to the clock above the sink and when he took a backward step i knew he was leaving its getting late he said his distant voice telling me he was already mentally somewhere else then his eyes cleared and he was back i enjoyed our date he said as he drew away but next time there isnt going to be a limit on what i can spend youre assuming theres going to be a next time i said trying to lighten the mood he met my smile with his own the new bristles on his face catching the light maybe kisten started for the front door and i automatically followed to see him out in my stockings my feet were as soundless as his on the hardwood floor the sanctuary was quiet not a peep from my desk still not having said anything kisten shrugged into his wool coat thank you i said as i handed him the long leather coat that he had let me borrow his teeth were a glimmer in the dark foyer my pleasure for the night out not the coat i said feeling my nylons go wet from the snowmelt well thanks for letting me use your coat too i stammered he leaned closer again my pleasure he said the faint light a glimmer in his eyes i stared trying to tell if his eyes were black from desire or shadow i am going to kiss you he said his voice dusky and my muscles tensed no shirking no biting i said deadly serious anticipation bubbled up inside me but it was from me not my demon scar and accepting that was both a relief and a feari couldnt pretend it was the scar not his time his hands enfolded my lower jaw both rough and warm i inhaled as he drew closer his eyes closing the scent of leather and silk was strong the hint of something deeper primal tugging at my instincts making me not know what to feel eyes open i watched him lean in my heart pounding with the anticipation of his lips on mine his thumbs shifted following the curve of my jaw my lips parted but the angle was wrong for a full kiss and my shoulders eased when i realized he was going to kiss the corner of my mouth relaxing i leaned forward to meet him flashing into a near panic when his fingertips moved farther back burying themselves in my hair adrenaline pounded through me in a cold wash as i realized he wasnt headed for my mouth at all he was going to kiss my neck i thought freezing but he stopped just shy exhaling when his lips found the soft hollow between my ear and jaw relief mixed with fear making me incapable of anything the remnants of the adrenaline scouring through me made my pulse thunder his lips were gentle but his hands about my face were firm with restrained need a cool warmth took the place of his lips when he pulled away yet he held himself poised for a moment then another my heart beat wildly and i knew he could feel it almost as if it were his own his breath came in a slow exhalation that i mirrored in the sound of rustling wool kisten stepped back his eyes found mine and i realized my hands had risen and were about his waist they fell from him reluctantly and i swallowed hard shocked though he hadnt touched my lips or neck it had been one of the most exhilarating kisses id ever experienced the thrill of not knowing what he was going to do had put me in a tizzy that a fullmouthed kiss never could have thats the damnedest thing he said softly a puzzled arch to his eyebrow what i questioned breathily still not having shaken off the feeling he shook his head i cant smell you at all its kind of a turnon i blinked unable to say a word night rachel a new smile hovered about him as he shifted another step back good night i whispered he turned and opened the door the chill air shocked me out of my daze my demon scar hadnt made a single twinge dormant that i thought was frightening that he could do this to me without even playing upon my scar what in hell was wrong with me kisten gave me a final smile from the landing the snowy night a beautiful backdrop turning he walked down the icy steps his footsteps crunching on the salt bewildered i shut the door behind him wondering what had happened still feeling unreal i dropped the locking bar then reopened it upon remembering ivy was out arms clasped about myself i headed for my bedroom my thoughts were full of what kisten had told me about how people dictated their own fate when letting a vampire bind them that people paid for the ecstasy of vampire passion with different levels of dependency ranging from food to equal what if he was lying i thought lying to trick me into letting him bind me to him but then a more frightening thought pulled my feet to a halt and made my face go cold what if he was telling the truth sixteen boots thumping in the hallway i followed ivy to the front door her tall frame moved with a preoccupied grace predatorial as always in her tasteful leather pants she might get away solstice shopping in leather but i had opted for jeans and a red sweater even so we both looked good shopping with ivy was fun she always treated for cookies and dodging the offers for dates took on a delicious sense of danger as she attracted all sorts of people ive got to be back by eleven she said as we entered the sanctuary and she swung her long hair back ive got a run tonight someones underage daughter was lured into a bloodhouse and im going in to get her out you want some help i asked buttoning my coat and hitching my bag higher up my shoulder while i walked pixies were clustered at the stainedglass windows hovering at the lighter colors and squealing at something outside a harsh smile came over ivy no it wont take much the hard anticipation on her pale oval face worried me she had come back from visiting piscary in a very bad mood clearly it hadnt gone well and i had a feeling she was going to take her frustration out on whoever had abducted that girl ivy was rough with vampires who preyed on the underage someone was going to spend their holiday in traction the phone rang and ivy and i froze looking at each other ill get it i said but if its not a run ill let the machine pick it up she nodded heading out the door with her purse ill warm up the car taking a quick breath i jogged to the back of the church on the third ring the machine engaged the outgoing message spewed its spiel and my face tightened nick had recorded it for mei thought it posh for it to appear that we employed a male secretary though now seeing as we were listed with professionals of another sort it probably only added to the confusion my frown deepened when the outgoing message cut off and nicks voice continued hey rachel he said hesitantly are you there pick up if you are ii was hoping youd be home its what about six there i forced my hand to pick up the phone he was in a different time zone hi nick rachel the relief was thick in his voice in stark contrast to my flat tone good im glad i caught you caught me yeah how are you doing i asked trying to keep the sarcasm from my voice i was still stinging hurt and confused he took a slow breath i could hear water in the background and a hiss of something cooking the soft clink of glasses and the murmur of conversation intruded im doing okay he said im doing good i slept really well last night thats great why in hell didnt you tell my ley line practice i was waking you up you could have been sleeping well here too how are you doing he asked my jaw hurt and i forced my teeth apart im confused im hurt i dont know what you want i dont know what i want fine i said thinking of kisten at least i knew what he wanted im fine my throat hurt want me to get your mail or will you be home soon ive got a neighbor picking it up but thanks you didnt answer my question okay do you know if youll be back by the solstice or should i give your ticket tosomeone else i hadnt meant to hesitate it just happened it was obvious nick had heard it too given his silence a seagull cried in the background he was on a beach he was at a bar on a beach and i was dodging black charms in cold slush why dont you do that he said finally and i felt as if someone punched me in the gut i dont know how long im going to be here sure i whispered i miss you rachel he said and i closed my eyes please dont say it i thought please but im feeling much better ill be home soon it was exactly what jenks had told me he would say and my throat closed up i miss you too i said feeling betrayed and lost all over again he said nothing and after three heartbeats i stepped into the breach well ivy and i are going shopping shes in the car oh he sounded relieved the bastard i wont keep you um ill talk to you later liar all right bye i love you rachel he whispered but i hung up as if i hadnt heard i didnt know if i could answer him anymore miserable i pulled my hand from the receiver my red nail polish looked bright against the black plastic my fingers were trembling and my head hurt then why did you leave instead of telling me whats wrong i asked the empty room i exhaled with a measured slowness to try to wash the tension from me i was going shopping with ivy i wouldnt ruin it by brooding about nick he was gone he wasnt coming back he felt better when he was a time zone away from me why would he come back hitching my bag higher up my shoulder i headed for the front the pixies were still clustered at the windows in small knots jenks was somewhere else for which i was grateful hed only tell me i told you so if he had heard my conversation with nick jenks you have command of the ship i shouted as i opened the front door and a smile faint but real crossed me when a piercing whistle emanated from my desk ivy was in the car already and my eyes were drawn across the street to keasleys house pulled by the sound of kids and a dog barking my steps slowed ceri was in his yard wearing the jeans i had dropped off earlier and an old coat of ivys bright red mittens and a matching hat made a vivid splash against the snow as she and about six kids ranging from ten to eighteen rolled snowballs around a mountain was taking shape in the corner of keasleys small lot next door were four more kids doing the same it looked like there was going to be a snowball fight before too much longer i waved to ceri then keasleywho was standing on his porch watching with an intent hunch that told me hed like to be down there too both of them waved back and i felt warm id done something good i lifted the door latch of ivys borrowed mercedes slipping in to find it still blowing cold air from the vents it took forever for the big fourdoor sedan to warm up i knew ivy didnt like driving it but her mother wouldnt lend her anything else and a cycle in slush was asking for stitches who was it ivy asked as i angled the vent off me and buckled myself in ivy drove as if she couldnt be killed which i thought was a little ironic nobody she gave me a telling look nick lips pressed together i set my bag on my lap like i said nobody not looking behind her ivy pulled away from the curb rachel im sorry the sincerity in her gray silk voice pulled my head up i thought you hated nick i do she said not at all apologetic i think hes manipulative and withholds information that might get you hurt but you liked him maybe she hesitated her jaw tightening and relaxing maybe hes coming back he doeslove you she made an ugly sound oh god you made me say it i laughed nick isnt that bad i said and she turned to me my eyes flicked to the truck we were about to rearend at a stoplight and i braced myself against the dash i said he loved you i didnt say he trusted you she said her eyes on me as she braked smoothly to a halt ending with our grille six inches from his bumper my stomach clenched you dont think he trusts me rachel she cajoled inching forward as the light changed but the truck didnt move he leaves town without telling you then doesnt tell you when hes coming back i dont think someone has come between you i think something has you scared the hell out of him and hes not enough of a man to admit it deal with it and get over it i said nothing glad when we started moving again i hadnt just scared him i had made him seize it must have been awful no wonder he left great now id feel guilty all day ivy jerked the wheel and shifted lanes a horn blew and she eyed the driver in the rearview mirror slowly the car put space between us pushed back by the force of her gaze do you mind if we stop at my folks house for a minute its on the way sure i stifled a gasp when she cut a right in front of the truck wed just passed ivy you may have lightning reflexes but the guy driving that truck just had kittens she snorted dropping back two whole feet off the bumper of the car now ahead of us ivy made an obvious effort to drive normally through the busier areas of the hollows and slowly i relaxed my death grip on my bag it was the first time wed been together and away from jenks in about a week and neither one of us knew what to get him for the solstice ivy was tending to the heated doghouse she had seen in a catalog anything to get him and his brood out of the church id settle for a lockbox we could cover with a rug and pretend was an end table as ivy drove slowly the yards grew larger and the trees taller the houses began moving back from the street until only their roofs showed from behind stands of evergreens we were just inside the city limits right next to the river it really wasnt on the way to the mall but the interstate wasnt far and with that the city was wideopen ivy pulled unhesitatingly into a gated drive twin tracks made a black trail on the dusting of snow that had fallen since it had been plowed i leaned to look out the window never having seen her parents house the car slowed to a halt before an old romanticlooking threestory home painted white with hunter green shutters a little red twoseater was parked out front dry and free of snow you grew up here i asked as i got out the two names on the mailbox gave me pause until i remembered vampires maintained their names after marriage to keep living bloodlines intact ivy was a tamwood her sister was a randal ivy slammed her door and dropped her keys into her black purse yeah she looked to holiday lights making a tasteful subdued display it was getting dusky the sun was only about an hour from setting and i was hoping we would be gone before then i didnt particularly want to meet her mom come on in she said her boots thumping on the brushed steps and i followed her onto the covered porch she opened the door shouting hi im home a smile curved over me as i hesitated just outside to stomp the snow off i liked hearing her voice so relaxed coming inside i shut the door and breathed deeply cloves and cinnamonsomeone had been baking the large entryway was all varnished wood and subtle shades of cream and white it was as stark and elegant as our living room was warm and casual a runner of cedar bough made graceful loops up the railing of the nearby stairway it was warm and i unbuttoned my coat and stuffed my gloves in the pockets thats ericas car outside shes probably in the kitchen ivy said dropping her purse on the small table beside the door it was polished so highly that it looked like black plastic taking her coat off she draped it over an arm and headed for a large archway to the left coming to a halt at a thumping of feet on the steps ivy looked up her placid face shifting it took me a moment to realize she was happy my gaze followed her to a young woman slumping downstairs she looked to be about seventeen dressed in a skimpy goth short skirt to show her midriff with black fingernails and lipstick silver chains and bangles swung everywhere as she hopped down the stairs bringing that dogeared page to mind her black hair was cut short and styled into wild spikes maturity hadnt yet finished filling her out but i could tell already that she was going to look exactly like her big sister apart from being six inches shorter lean sleek predatory and with just enough oriental cast to make her exotic nice to know it ran in the family of course right now she looked like a teenage vamp out of control hi erica ivy said reversing her steps and waiting for her at the foot of the stairs my god ivy erica said her high voice heavy on the valley girl accent you have to talk to daddy hes being total big brother like i dont know the difference between good brimstone and bad brimstone listening to him youd think i was still two crawling around in diapers trying to bite the dog god he was in the kitchen she continued her mouth going as she eyed me up and down making mom her organically grown earthfriendly politically correct stinking cup of tea when i cant go out one night with my friends its so unfair are you staying shell be up rattling the windows soon no ivy drew back im here to talk to dad hes in the kitchen basement erica said mouth finally stopping she sent her gaze over me again as i stood in a bemused wonder at how fast she talked whos your friend she asked a faint smile curled up the corners of ivys mouth erica this is rachel oh the young woman exclaimed her brown eyes that were almost hidden behind her black mascara going wide she stepped forward and grabbed my hand pumping it up and down enthusiastically with her bangles jingling i shoulda known hey i saw you at piscarys she said giving me a whack on the shoulder that sent me forward a step man you were sugared up good riding the short bus walking with the ghost i didnt recognize you her eyes traveled over my jeans and winter coat you had a date with kisten did he bite you i blinked and ivy laughed nervously hardly rachel doesnt let anyone bite her she took a step to her sister giving her a hug i felt good when the young woman returned it with a careless attention apparently not knowing or caring how rarely ivy touched anyone the two pulled apart and ivys features stilled she took a breath nostrils widening erica grinned like the cat who ate the canary guess who i picked up at the airport ivy straightened skimmers here it was almost a whisper and erica all but danced back a step came in on a morning flight she said as proud as if she had landed the plane herself my eyes widened ivy was wiretight breath catching she spun to an archway at the sound of a door closing a feminine voice echoed erica is that my cab skimmer ivy took a step to the archway then rocked back she looked at me more alive than id seen her in a long time a small scuff at the archway pulled her attention from me emotion cascaded over her and the happiness settled in to stay telling me that skimmer was one of the few people ivy felt comfortable to be herself around so there were two of us i thought turning to follow her gaze to a young woman standing in the threshold i felt my brows rise in speculation as i took in what had to be skimmer she was dressed in faded jeans and a crisp white buttondown shirt to make a nice mix of casual sophistication understated black boots brought her height to about mine slim and wellproportioned the blond woman stood with a confident grace typical of living vampires she had a single silver chain about her neck and her blond hair was pulled back in a simple ponytail to accentuate a bone structure that models could spend a small fortune on plastic surgery to find i stared at her eyes wondering if they were really that blue or if they just seemed that way because of her incredibly long eyelashes her nose was small and turned up at the end to give her smile a look of shy confidence what are you doing here ivy said her face alight as she went to greet her the two women gave each other a long hug my lips parted and i froze at the lingering kiss before they parted okay ivy slipped me a glance but she was smiling when she turned back to skimmer smiling still smiling with her hands on the womans elbows i cant believe youre here she said skimmer glanced at me once before focusing on ivy she looked like she had enough confidence and smarts to break horses teach aboriginal children and dine out at a fivestar restaurant all in one day and she and ivy had kissed not just a peck but a realkiss im out here on business she said longterm business she added her pleasant voice thick with a pleased emotion a year im guessing a year why didnt you call me i would have picked you up the woman took a step back and ivys hold on her fell away i wanted to surprise you she said her smile rising to encompass her blue eyes besides i wasnt sure of your situation its been so long she finished softly her eyes fell on me and i warmed in my new understanding aw crap on toast how long had i been living with ivy how could i have not known was i blind or just stupid damn ivy swore still obviously excited its good to see you what are you out here for do you need a place to stay my pulse quickened and i tried to keep my worry from showing two of them together in the church not good even more disturbing was that skimmer seemed to relax at her offer losing interest in me and focusing entirely on ivy erica stood beside me grinning mischievously skimmer came out to work for piscary she said clearly eager to tell what she thought was good news but my face went cold its all arranged she looks to him now twirling her necklaces the young vampire beamed just like i always thought she should ivy took a breath and held it wonder crossed her and she reached out to touch skimmers shoulder as if not believing she was really there you look to piscary she breathed and i wondered what the significance was who or what did he give for you skimmer shrugged lifting one narrow shoulder and letting it fall nothing yet ive been trying the last six years to wiggle into his camarilla and if i work this right it will be permanent she dropped her head briefly her eyes alight and eager when they rose im staying at piscarys place meantime she said but thanks for the offer to bunk with you piscarys i thought my worry strengthening that was where kisten was living this was getting better and better ivy too seemed to have to think about that you left your place with natalie to run piscarys restaurant she asked and skimmer laughed it was comfortable and pleasant and the volumes that were left unsaid made me uneasy no kist can have that job she said lightly im here to get piscary out of prison my permanent inclusion into piscarys camarilla is contingent upon it if i win my case i stay if i lose i go back home i froze oh my god she was piscarys lawyer skimmer hesitated at ivys lack of response ivy turned to me a panicked look on her face i watched the wall come down sealing everything away her happiness her joy her excitement at reuniting with an old friend it was all gone something slipped between us and i felt my chest tighten ericas bangles clanked as the young vampire clearly realized something was wrong but not understanding hell i didnt think i understood suddenly wary skimmer glanced from me to ivy so whos your friend she asked into the awkward silence ivy licked her lips and turned to face me more fully i shifted forward not knowing how to react rachel ivy said id like you to meet skimmer we roomed together for our last two years of high school out on the west coast skimmer this is rachel my partner i took a breath trying to decide how i should handle this my hand went out to shake hers but skimmer walked past it taking me into an expansive hug i tried not to stiffen determined to go with the flow until i had a chance to talk to ivy about just what we were going to do about this piscary couldnt get out of prison id never sleep again my arms went about her in a loose generic hug and i froze when the woman put her lips under my ear and breathed pleasure to meet you adrenaline jolted through me as my demon scar flashed into waves of heat shocked i shoved her away collapsing to a defensive posture the living vampire fell back surprise making her long lashes and blue eyes look enormous she caught her balance a good five feet away erica gasped and ivy was a black blur coming between us skimmer ivy shouted her voice almost panicked as she stood with her back to me my heart pounded and sweat broke out the flaming promise on my neck hurt it was so strong and i put a hand to it feeling betrayed and shocked shes my business partner ivy exclaimed not my blood partner the slim woman stared at us flashing into a redfaced embarrassment oh god she stammered hunching into a slightly submissive posture im sorry she put a hand to her mouth i am really really sorry she looked at ivy who was slowly relaxing ivy i thought youd taken a shadow she smells like you i was just being polite skimmers gaze darted to me as i tried to slow my heartbeat you asked me to stay with you i thoughtgod im sorry i thought she was your shadow i didnt know she was yourfriend its all right i lied forcing myself upright i didnt like the way she had said friend it implied more than what we were but i currently wasnt up to trying to explain to ivys old roommate that we werent sharing blood or a bed ivy wasnt much help standing with a deerintheheadlights look and i had this weird feeling i was still missing something god how did i get to this place erica was standing by the foot of the stairs her eyes wide and her mouth open skimmer looked distressed as she tried to cover her error smoothing her hands on her pants and touching her hair she took a deep breath still flushed she stiffly extended her hand in an obvious show of intent and stepped forward im sorry she said as she halted before me my name is dorothy claymor you can call me that if you want to i probably deserve it i managed to dredge up a stilted smile rachel morgan i said shaking her hand the woman froze and i pulled away she looked at ivy the pieces falling into place the one who put piscary in prison i added just to be sure she knew where i stood a sick smile came over ivy dropping back a step skimmers gaze went between us confusion made her cheeks bright red this was a mess this was a sticky stinking mess of crap and the levels were steadily rising skimmer swallowed hard its a pleasure to meet you hesitating she added boy this is awkward i felt my shoulders ease at her admission she was going to do what she had to do and i was going to do what i had to do and ivy ivy was going to go insane erica moved forward the jingling of her jewelry sounding loud hey ah does anyone want a cookie or something oh yeah a cookie that would make everything better dunked in a shot of tequila maybe or better yet just the bottle yeah that ought to do it skimmer forced a smile her crisp mien was wearing thin but she was holding up well considering she had left her home and master to rekindle a relationship with her high school girlfriend who was rooming with the woman who had put her new boss behind bars join us next time for days of the undead when rachel learns her long lost brother is really a crown prince from outer space my life was so screwed up skimmer glanced at her watchi couldnt help but notice it had diamonds on it in place of numbers ive got to go im meeting withsomeone in about an hour she was going to meet someone in about an hour just after the sun went down why didnt she just say piscary you need a ride ivy said sounding almost wistful if she would ever let that particular emotion come from her skimmer looked from ivy to me and back to ivy hurt and disappointment flickering in the back of her eyes no she said softly ive got a cab coming she swallowed trying to scrape herself back together actually i think thats it now i didnt hear anything but i didnt have a living vampires hearing skimmer shifted awkwardly forward it was nice meeting you she said to me then turned to ivy ill talk to you later sweets she said eyes closed as she gave her a long hug ivy was still in a shocked quandary and she returned it looking numb skimmer i said as they broke apart and the shaken subdued woman took a thin jacket from the hall closet and put it on this isnt what you think she stopped with her hand on the doorknob looking at ivy for a long moment with deep regret its not what i think that matters she said as she opened the door its what ivy wants i opened my mouth to protest but she left latching the door softly behind her seventeen skimmers departure left an awkward silence as the cab accelerated down the drive i looked at ivy standing in the sterile white entryway with its elegant decorations that utterly lacked any warmth guilt was thick on her i knew it was from the reminder that she still harbored the belief that someday id be her scionapparently with a little extra something on the side it was a position that i think skimmer had moved out here hopefully to fill not sure what i was feeling i faced her why did you let her think we were lovers i said shaking inside god ivy we arent even sharing blood and she thinks were lovers ivys face closed the barest tightening of her jaw giving away her emotion she doesnt think that at all she strode out of the room do you want some juice she called back no i said softly as i followed her deeper into the house i knew if i pressed the issue right now she would likely become more closed this conversation wasnt over but having it in front of erica wasnt a good idea my head hurt maybe i could get her to talk about it over coffee and cheesecake while we were shopping maybe i should move to timbuktu or the tennessee mountains or somewhere else where there werent any vampires dont ask its weird even for inderlanderswhich is saying a lot erica was tight on my heels her mindless chatter an obvious attempt to cover up the issues that skimmer had raised her bright voice filled the sterile house with life as she trailed after us through large dim rooms full of hardwood furniture and cold drafts i made a mental note to never get erica and jenks in the same room no wonder ivy didnt have a problem with jenks her sister was cut from the same cloth ivys boots were slow on the polished floor when we left a dark blue formal dining room and entered a brightly lit spacious kitchen i blinked ivy met my startled gaze and shrugged i knew that ivy had remodeled the churchs kitchen before i had moved in and as i looked around i realized she had patterned it after the one she grew up with the room was nearly as spacious that same center island counter taking up the middle castiron pots and metal utensils hung over it instead of my ceramic spoons and copper spell vats but it made the same comfortable spot to lean against there was a heavy antique tabletwin to oursagainst the near wall right where id expect it even the cupboards were the same style and the counters had an identical color the floor though was tile instead of linoleum past the sink where i had a single window overlooking the graveyard there was a bank of windows that showed a long snowfield running down to the gray ribbon of the ohio river ivys parents owned a lot of property you could graze cattle down there a kettle steamed on the stove and as ivy moved it off the burner i dropped my bag on the table where my chair would be if i was home this is nice i said wryly ivy gave me a cautious look clearly glad i had shelved the pending discussion about skimmer it was cheaper to do both kitchens at once she said and i nodded it was warm and i took my coat off draping it on the back of the chair stretching to show the small of her back erica stood on one foot to reach a glass jar half full of what looked like sugar cookies leaning against the counter she ate one offering ivy another but none to me i had a feeling they werent sugar cookies but those awful cardboardtasting disks that ivy had kept shoving down my throat last spring when i was recovering from a massive blood loss sort of a vampire pickmeup that helped support theirahlifestyle a muffled thumping grew louder and i turned to what i had thought was a pantry door it creaked opened to show a staircase leading down a tall gaunt man was coming up and out of the shadows hi dad ivy said and i straightened smiling at the softness in her voice ivy the man beamed as he set a tray with two tiny empty cups down on the table his voice was gravely matching his skin rough and pebbly i recognized the texture as scars left from the turn it had affected some more than others and witches pixies and fairies not at all skimmers here he said gently i saw her ivy said and he hesitated at the lack of anything more he looked tired his brown eyes content as he gave ivy a quick hug gently waving black hair framed his serious face softly lined with what looked like worry rather than age it was obvious that this was where ivy got her height the living vampire was tall with a refinement that turned his gaunt frame pleasing rather than unattractive he was wearing jeans and a casual shirt small almost unseen lines scarred his neck and his arms showing past his rolledup sleeves had the same marks on the underside it must be hard being married to an undead im glad you came home the man said his eyes flicking briefly to me and the cross on my charm bracelet before settling back on his daughter with an obvious warmth your mother will be up in a bit she wants to talk to you skimmer put her in a rare mood no ivy dropped back out of his touch i wanted to ask you something is all he nodded once his thin lips falling into a resigned disappointment i felt a slight tingle from my demon scar as he poured the steaming water into a second teapot the clanking of the porcelain was loud arms crossed before me i leaned to rest against the table to distance myself i hoped the tingle was a lingering sensation from skimmer and didnt stem from ivys dad i didnt think it was him he looked too calm to be fighting a need to slack his hunger dad ivy said seeing my unease this is rachel rachel this is my dad as if aware my scar was tingling ivys dad stayed at the other end of the kitchen taking the cookies from erica and putting them back into the cookie jar the girl huffed then grimaced at her dads raised eyebrow its a pleasure to meet you he said his attention returning to me hello mr randal i said not liking the way he was eyeing ivy and me standing beside each other i suddenly felt as if i was on a date meeting the parents and i flushed i didnt like his knowing smile apparently neither did ivy stop it dad ivy pulled out a chair and sat rachel is my roommate not my livein youd better make sure skimmer knows that his narrow chest moved as he breathed deeply to take in the emotions on the air she came out here for you left everything think hard before you walk away from that she has good breeding behind her an unbroken millennium line is hard to find tension slammed back into me and i felt myself stiffen oh god erica moaned her hand back in the cookie jar dont start daddy we just had an ugly in the hallway smiling to show teeth he reached across to take the cookie from her and ate a bite dont you have to be to work soon he said when he swallowed the young vampire jiggled daddy i want to go to the concert all my friends are my eyebrows rose ivy shook her head with the smallest of movements a private answer to my question as to whether we should tell him we were going and that wed keep an eye on her no her father said brushing the crumbs from himself as he finished his cookie but daddy opening the jar he took out three more you dont have enough control erica puffed slumping against the counter my control is fine she said sulkily he straightened the first hints of steel tightening his face erica your hormones are jumping up and down right now one night you have control in a stressful situation the next you lose it while youre watching tv you arent wearing your caps like youre supposed to and i dont want you to accidentally bind someone to you daddy she cried flushing a dull embarrassed red getting two glasses from the cupboard ivy snickered my uneasiness faded slightly i know her father said his head bowed and a hand raised a lot of your friends have shadows and it looks like fun having someone trailing behind you seeking your attention and always there youre the center of their world and they see only you but erica bonded shadows are a lot of work they arent pets you can give to a friend when you tire of them they need reassurance and attention youre too young to have that kind of responsibility daddy stop erica said clearly mortified i sat as ivy got a carton of orange juice from the fridge i wondered how much of this was for erica and how much of it was his way of trying to scare me off from his eldest daughter it was working not that i needed any encouragement the living vampires face went stern youre being careless he said his gravely voice harsh taking risks that might put you in a place you dont want to be yet dont think i dont know you take your caps off as soon as you leave this house you arent going to that concert thats not fair she shouted spiked hair bobbing im pulling all as and working parttime its just a concert there wont even be any brimstone there he shook his head as she huffed until that bad brimstone is off the streets you will be home before sunrise young lady im not going down to the city tombs to identify and bring a member of my house home ive done that once and im not ready to do it again daddy ivy handed her father a glass of juice then sat down with her drink in the chair adjacent to mine crossing her legs at the knees she said im going to the concert erica gasped her jewelry tinkling as she jumped daddy she cried ivys going i wont take any brimstone and i wont bite anyone i promise oh god please let me go eyebrows high ivys dad looked at ivy she shrugged and erica held her breath if its all right with your mother its all right with me he finally said thank you daddy erica squealed she flung herself at him almost knocking her taller father down in a clatter of boots she yanked the door to the stairwell open and thumped downstairs the door arched closed and ericas shouts grew muffled the man sighed his thin shoulders moving just how long were you going to let her beg before you told me you were going he asked wryly her eyes on her juice ivy smiled long enough that she will listen to me when i tell her to wear her caps or ill change my mind a chuckle rose you learn well young grasshopper he said affecting a strong accent there was a thumping on the stairs and erica burst out eyes black in excitement chains swinging she said yes gotta go love you daddy thanks ivy she made a pair of bunny ears with her fingers crooking them as she said kiss kiss and darted out of the room do you have your caps her father shouted after her yes she called back her voice faint take some of those necklaces off young lady he added but the door slammed the quiet was a relief and i met ivys smile with bemused wonder erica could really fill a room ivys father put his glass down his face seemed to take on more wrinkles and i could see the strain his body was enduring to supply the blood his undead wife needed to stay sane i watched ivy shift her fingers on her glass to spin it where it sat slowly her smile faded has she been to see piscary she asked softly the sudden worry in her voice drawing my attention this was why ivy had come to talk to her dad and as i thought of ericas carefree wild innocence in piscarys manipulative embrace i worried too ivys dad though didnt seem to have a problem with it taking a slow sip of juice before answering yes she visits him every two weeks as is respectful my brow pinched at the implied question and i wasnt surprised when he followed up with have you ivy stilled the fingers encircling her glass uncomfortable i looked for a way to excuse myself and go hide in the car ivy glanced at me then her father he leaned back waiting from outside came the rumble of ericas car fading to leave the hum of the clock on the oven the only sound ivy took a breath dad i made a mistake i felt ivys dads eyes land on me even though i was staring out the window trying to divorce myself from the conversation we should talk about this when your mother is available he said and i took a quick breath you know i said as i got up i think ill go wait in the car i dont want to talk about it with mom i want to talk about it with you ivy said crossly and theres no reason rachel cant hear this the hidden request in ivys voice stopped me short i sank back down ignoring the obvious disapproval from her dad this wasnt going to be fun maybe she wanted my opinion of the conversation to balance out her own i could do that for her i made a mistake ivy said softly i dont want to be piscarys scion ivy there was a tired weariness in that one word its time to start taking on your responsibilities your mother was his scion before she died the benefits i dont want them ivy said and i watched her eyes closely wondering if the ring of brown about her pupil was shrinking maybe if he wasnt in my head all the time she added moving her juice away but i cant take it anymore he just keeps pushing he wouldnt if you would go see him ivy sat straighter eyes on the table i did go see him i told him that i wasnt going to be his scion and to get out of my head he laughed at me he said i had made a choice and now i had to live and die by it you did make a choice and now im making another one she shot back her eyes lowered submissively but her voice determined im not going to do it i dont want to run cincinnatis underground and i wont she took a deep breath her eyes rising to his i cant tell if i like something anymore because i like it or because piscary likes it dad will you talk to him for me my eyes widened at her pleading tone the only time i had heard it before was when she thought she was dead and was begging me to keep her safe my jaw clenched as i remembered god that had been awful when i looked up at his continued silence i was startled to find ivys dad watching me his lips were pressed tight and his gaze was angry as if this was my fault youre his scion he said his eyes accusingly on mine stop shirking your duties ivys nostrils flared i really didnt want to be here but if i moved i would only draw attention to myself i made a mistake she said angrily and im willing to pay the cost to get out of it but hes going to start hurting people to make me do what he wants thats not fair he made a scoffing laugh and rose did you expect anything different hes going to use everything and everyone he can to manipulate you hes a master vampire putting his hands on the table he leaned toward ivy its what they do cold i sent my gaze down to the river below it didnt matter if piscary was in jail or not all he had to do was say the word and his minions would not only bring ivy in line but get me out of his hair as well expensive but effective but ivy pulled her head up shaking it in reassurance before turning her damp eyes to her father dad he said hes going to start calling on erica the mans face went ashen to make the small fever scars stand out starkly relief that piscary wasnt targeting me flashed through me then guilt that i could feel such a thing ill talk to him he whispered the worry in his voice for his innocent soalive daughter clear i felt sick in their conversation were the dark ugly shadows of the hidden pacts older children made to each other to protect a younger innocent sibling from an abusive parent the feeling solidified when her dad repeated softly ill talk to him thank you all of us seemed to draw away in an uncomfortable silence it was time to go ivy stood first quickly followed by me i grabbed my coat from the back of the chair and shrugged into it ivys dad rose slowly seeming twice as tired as when we came in ivy he said as he came close im proud of you i dont agree with what youre doing but im proud of you thanks dad smiling a closelipped smile in relief she gave him a hug we gotta go ive got a run tonight darvans girl he asked and she nodded the hint of guilt and fear on her still good you keep doing what youre doing ill talk to piscary and see what i can work out thanks he turned to me it was a pleasure meeting you rachel same here mr randal i was glad the vampire talk seemed to be over we could all pretend to be normal again hide the ugliness under the fivethousanddollar rug wait ivy here the man reached into his back pocket and pulled out a worn wallet turning himself from a vampire into just another dad dad ivy protested ive got my own money he smiled with half his mouth think of it as a thankyou for watching erica at the concert have lunch on me i said nothing as he shoved a hundred dollar bill into ivys hand pulling her forward into a onearmed hug ill call you tomorrow morning he said softly ivys shoulders lost their usual upright posture ill come by i dont want to talk over the phone she shot me a forced closelipped smile ready to go i nodded giving ivys dad a head bob as i followed her out into the dining room and to the front door knowing how good vamp hearing was i kept my mouth shut until the elegantly carved door thumped shut behind us and our feet were again on the snow it had grown dusky and the snowdrifts seemed to glow in the light reflected off the sky ericas car was gone keys jingling ivy hesitated hold up she said boots squeaking in the snow as she went to where the red car had been parked i think she ditched her caps i stood by my open door and waited while ivy came to a standstill beside the wheel marks eyes closed she flung her hand as if throwing something and then strode to the other side of the drive as i watched in a mystified silence she searched the snow bending at the waist twice she picked something up she came back and got into the car without comment i followed her in and fastened my belt wishing it were darker so i didnt have to watch her drive at my questioning silence ivy held out her hand and dropped two bits of hollow plastic into my grip the car started and i aimed the vents at me hoping the engine was still warm caps i asked looking at them small and white in my palm as ivy pulled away how on earth did she find these in the snow guaranteed to keep from breaking skin ivy said her thin lips pressing together and with that she cant accidentally bind anyone to her shes supposed to wear them until dad says so and at this rate shes going to be thirty before that happens i know where she works mind if we drop them off i shook my head extending them back to her ivy checked both ways at the end of the drive before pulling out in front of a blue station wagon wheels spinning in the slush ive got an empty caps case in my purse would you put them in there for me sure i didnt like digging around in her purse but if i didnt shed do it while driving and my stomach was in enough knots already i felt odd as i put ivys purse on my lap and opened it up it was disgustingly tidy not a single used tissue or lintcovered candy mine is the one with the colored glass on it ivy said watching the road with half her attention i should have a plastic one in there somewhere the disinfectant is probably still good dad would kill her if he knew she threw them in the snow they cost as much as her summer camp last year in the andes oh my three summers spent at kalamacks makeawish camp for dying children suddenly looked pale shifting past a small container that looked like an elaborately decorated pillbox was a thumbsized white vial i unscrewed the top to find it full of a bluish liquid thats the one ivy said and i dropped them in they floated and when i went to stick my pinky in to sink them she added just put the top on and give it a shake theyll sink i did just that dropping the vial into her purse and setting it beside her thanks ivy said the time i lost mine he grounded me for a month i gave her a weak smile thinking it was kind of like losing your glasses or retaineror maybe your diaphragm oh god did i really want to know all this you still wear caps i said curiosity getting the better of me she didnt seem to be embarrassed about it maybe i should just go with it ivy shook her head signaling an instant before she crossed two lanes of traffic to get to the expressways onramp no she said as i clutched the door handle not since i was seventeen but i keep them in case she cut her words off just in case just in case what i wondered then decided i didnt want to know uh ivy i questioned as i tried not to figure out where she was going to force herself into traffic i held my breath while we merged and from behind us horns blew what the heck does bunny ears and kiss kiss mean she stared at me and i made a peace sign and crooked my fingers twice in quick succession an odd smile quirked the corners of her mouth those arent bunny ears she said those are fangs i thought about that then flushed oh ivy chuckled i eyed her for a moment then deciding there would be no better time i took a slow breath um about skimmer her good mood vanished she shot me a look then put her eyes back on the road we were roommates a faint flush came over her telling me it was more than that we were very close roommates she added carefully as if i hadnt already figured it out ivy hit the brakes hard to avoid a black bmw that wanted to pen her in behind a minivan accelerating quickly she darted around to the right leaving him behind she came out here because of you i said feeling my blood quicken why didnt you tell her we arent like that her grip on the wheel tightened because she took a soft breath and tucked her hair behind her ear it was a nervous tic that i didnt see very often because i didnt want to she said as she settled in behind a red transam doing fifteen over the posted limit eyes worried she looked at me ignoring the green minivan that both the transam and we were roaring up on im not going to apologize rachel the night you decide taking and giving blood isnt sex im going to be there ill take what i can until you do horribly uncomfortable i shifted in my seat ivy dont she said lightly as she yanked the car to the right hitting the gas to dart ahead of both of them i know how you feel about it i cant change your mind youre going to have to figure it out for yourself skimmer being here doesnt change anything she slipped in front of the van giving me a soft smile that convinced me even more that blood was sex and then youll spend the rest of your life kicking yourself for waiting so long to take that chance eighteen the commercial cut in the volume jarring me as i sat on the couch sighing i pulled my knees to my chin and hugged my legs it was early just after two in the morning and i was trying to find the gumption to go make something to eat ivy was still on her run and even with the awkward conversation in the car i was hoping shed be home early enough so we could go out warming up a potpie and eating alone had all the appeal of pulling the skin off my shins grabbing the remote i muted the tv this was depressing i was sitting on the couch on a friday night watching die hard alone nick should have been there with me i missed him i think i missed him i missed something maybe i just missed being held was i that shallow tossing the remote down i realized a voice was coming from the front of the church i sat up it was a mans voice alarmed i tapped the line out back between one breath and the next my center filled with the force of the line running through me i gathered myself to rise only to sink down when jenks flew into the room at head height the soft hum of his wings told me in an instant that whatever was up front wasnt going to kill me or put money in my pocket eyes wide he landed on the lampshade the dust sifting from him floated upward with the rising heat of the bulb he was usually tucked in my desk asleep at this hour which was why i was having my pity party now so i could sulk without interference hey jenks i said as i let go of the line and the unfocused magic left me whos here his face became worried rachel we might have a problem i eyed him sourly i was sitting alone watching die hard that was a problem not whatever had come waltzing in our door who is it i said flatly i already ran off the jehovah witnesses you would think living in a church they might get the idea but noooo jenks frowned some were in a cowboy hat he wants me to sign a paper saying i ate that fish we stole for the howlers david i jerked out of the chair and headed for the sanctuary jenkss wings were a harsh buzz as he flew beside me whos david an insurance adjustor my brow furrowed i met him yesterday sure enough david was sanding in the middle of the empty room looking uncomfortable in his long coat and hat pulled down over his eyes pixy children were watching from under the crack of the rolltop desk their pretty faces all lined up in a row he was on a cell phone and upon seeing me he muttered a few words closed the cover and tucked it away hello rachel he said cringing as his voice echoed his eyes ran over my casual jeans and red sweater and then went to the ceiling as he shifted from foot to foot it was obvious he wasnt comfortable in the church like most weres but it was psychological not biological im sorry to bother you he said as he took off his hat and crushed it in a tight grip but hearsay wont stand up in this case i need your partner to verify he ate that wishing fish holy crap it was a wishing fish there was a chorus of shrill cries from the desk jenks made a harsh sound and the faces lining the crack scattered back into the shadows david took a trifolded paper from a pocket of his duster and unfolded it atop ivys piano if you could sign here he said then straightened his eyes suspicious you did eat it jenks looked scared his wings a blue so dark they were almost purple yeah we ate it are we going to be all right i tried to hide my smile but david grinned his teeth looking white in the dim light of the sanctuary i think youll be fine mr jenks he said clicking open a pen and holding it out my eyebrows rose david hesitated looking from the pen to the pixy the pen was the larger of the two ummm he said shifting on his feet ive got it jenks zipped to the desk returning with a pencil lead i watched him carefully write his name the ultrasonic chatter from the desk making my eyes hurt jenks rose pixy dust sifting from him hey uh we arent in any trouble are we the pungent scent of ink assailed me and david looked up from notarizing it not from our end of things thank you mr jenks he looked at me rachel a soft rattling of the windows from an airpressure shift brought both our heads up someone had opened the back door to the church rachel came a high voice and i blinked it was my mom bewildered i looked at david ah its my mom maybe you ought to go unless you want her to bully you into taking me on a date davids face went startled as he tucked the paper away no im done thanks i probably should have called first but it is normal business hours my face warmed i had just added ten thousand to my bank account courtesy of quen and his little problem i could sit on my butt and sulk for one night if i wanted and i wasnt going to prep the charms id be using on said run tonight spelling after midnight under a waning moon was asking for trouble besides how i arranged my day was not his business bothered i looked at the back of the church not wanting to be rude but not wanting my mom to play twenty questions with david either ill be right there mom i shouted then turned to jenks will you see him out for me sure thing rache jenks rose up to head height to accompany david into the foyer bye david i said and he gave me a raisedhand goodbye and put his hat on why does it all happen at once i thought hustling to the kitchen my mom visiting unannounced would top off an already perfect day tired i entered the kitchen to find her with her head in my fridge from the sanctuary came the boom of the front door closing mom i said trying to keep my voice pleasant its great to see you but its business hours my thoughts went to my bathroom wondering if my undies were still atop the dryer smiling she straightened peeking at me from around the door of the fridge she was wearing sunglasses and they looked really odd with her straw hat and sundress sundress she was in a sundress it was below twenty out there rachel smiling she shut the door and opened her arms give me a hug honey thoughts whirling i absently returned her embrace maybe i should call her psychologist and make sure she was still making her appointments an odd smell clung to her and as i pulled away i said what is that youre wearing it smells like burnt amber thats because it is love shocked my eyes went to her face her voice had dropped several octaves adrenaline shook me i jerked back only to find a whitegloved hand gripping my shoulder i froze unable to move as a ripple of everafter cascaded over her revealing algaliarept oh crap i was dead good evening familiar the demon said smiling to show me flat blocky teeth lets find a ley line and get you home hmm jenks i shrieked hearing my voice harsh with terror leaning back i swung my foot up kicking him square in the nads al grunted his red goatslitted eyes widening bitch he said reaching down and grabbing my ankle gasping i went down as he yanked me onto my butt i hit with a thump panicking as i kicked ineffectively at him he dragged me out of the kitchen and into the hall rachel jenks shrilled black pixy dust sifting from him get me a charm i shouted as i grabbed the archway and hung on oh god he had me if he got me to a line he could physically drag me to the everafter me saying no or not arms tensing i fought to hold onto the wall long enough for jenks to open my charm cupboard and grab one i didnt need a finger stick my lip was already bleeding from the fall here jenks cried hovering at ankle height to look me right in the eye he had the cord to a sleep charm in his grip his eyes were frightened and his wings were red dont think so witch al said giving me a jerk pain sliced through my shoulder and my grip was torn away rachel jenks exclaimed as my fingernails scraped the hardwood floor and then the carpet in the living room al muttered latin and i cried out as an explosion blew the back door off its hinges jenks get out get your kids safe i shouted when cold air raced in to replace the air the explosion had blown out dogs barked as i slid down the stairs on my stomach snow ice and rock salt scraped my middle and my chin i stared up at the shattered doorframe as davids silhouette showed black against the light i held my hand out for the charm jenks had dropped the charm i screamed when he clearly had no idea what i wanted throw me the charm al came to a halt his english riding boots making prints on the unshoveled walk he turned detrudo he said clearly a trigger word for a curse imprinted on his memory i gasped as a black and red shadow of everafter struck david throwing him into the far wall and out of my sight david i called as al started dragging me again wiggling i twisted so i was on my butt and not my stomach i cut a small swath through the snow behind al as he pulled me kicking to the wooden gate at the front of the garden that led to the street al couldnt use the ley line in the graveyard to drag me into the everafter as it was entirely encircled by holy ground that he couldnt cross the nearest ley line i knew about was eight blocks away i had a chance i thought the cold snow soaking my jeans let go i demanded kicking the back of als knees with my one free foot his leg buckled and he stopped his irate look clear in the light from the streetlamp he couldnt turn misty to avoid the strikes since i would be able to slip his grip what a canicula you are he said taking both ankles with one hand and continuing i dont want to go i shouted grabbing onto the edges of the gate as we passed through it we jerked to a stop and al sighed let go of the fence he said sounding tired no my muscles started to shake as i fought to keep unmoving while al pulled i had only one ley line charm imprinted on my subconscious but trapping al and me in a circle would get me nowhere he could break it as easily as i now that his aura would be tainting it a cry slipped from me when al gave up trying to drag me through the gate and he picked me up and threw me over his shoulder my breath exploded out of me as his musclehard shoulder cut into my middle he stank of burnt amber and i fought to get free this would be a lot easier he said as i jabbed my elbows between his shoulder blades to no effect if you would accept that i have you just say youll come willingly and i can pop us into a line from here and it will save you a lot of embarrassment im not worried about embarrassment i stretched to reach a passing limb of a tree my breath coming out in relief as i snagged one al jerked back pulled off balance oh look he said as he yanked me free and my palms came away scraped and bleeding your wolfie friend wants to play david i thought twisting to see past als shoulder as i struggled to breathe i saw a huge shadow standing at the center of the lamplit snowpacked street my mouth dropped he had wered he had wered in less than three minutes god that must have hurt and he was huge having retained his entire human mass his head would come to my shoulder id guess black silky fur more like hair shifted in the cold wind his ears were flat against his head and an impossibly low warning growl came from him feet the size of my spread hands dug into the snow as he barred our way he gave an indescribably deep warning bark and al chuckled lights were coming on in adjacent houses and curtains were being peeked around shes legally mine al said lightly im carting her home dont even try al started down the street leaving me torn between screaming for help and admitting i was a gonner a car was coming its lights throwing everything into stark relief good doggie al muttered as we passed david with a good ten feet between us looking harsh in the light from the headlamps david bowed his head and i wondered if he had given up knowing he could do nothing but then his head came up and he started after us david theres nothing you can do david no i shrieked when his slow lope shifted into a full run eyes lost in a killing frenzy he barreled right for me sure i didnt want to be pulled into the everafter but i didnt want to be dead either swearing al turned around vacuefacio he said his whitegloved hand outstretched i twisted on his shoulder to see a black ball of force shot from him meeting davids silent attack two feet in front of us davids huge feet skidded but he ran right into it yelping he rolled tumbling into a snow pile the scent of singed hair rose and was gone david i cried not feeling the cold that pinched me are you all right i yelped as al dumped me on the ground a blocky hand squeezing my shoulder until i cried out in pain the thick sheet of compressed snow on the pavement melted up through me and my rear went numb with hurt and cold idiot al grumbled to himself youve got a familiar why by your mothers ashes arent you using her he smiled at me thick eyebrows high in anticipation ready to work rachel love my breath froze in me panicking i stared up at him feeling my face go pale and my eyes go wide please dont i whispered he grinned all the wider hold this for me he said a scream of pain ripped from me as al tapped a line sending its strength thundering into me my muscles jerked and a spasm shook me until my face hit the pavement i was on fire and i clenched into a fetal position hands over my ears scream upon scream beat upon me i couldnt block them out they hammered at me the only thing that was real besides the agony in my head like an explosion the force of the line ran through me settling into my center spilling over to set my limbs on fire my brain felt as if it had been dipped in acid and all the time that awful screaming racked my ears i was on fire i was burning i suddenly realized the screaming was coming from me huge racking sobs took their place as i managed to stop an eerie keening wail rose and i managed to stop that too panting i opened my eyes my hands were pale and shaking in the light from the car they werent charred the scent of burnt amber wasnt my skin peeling away it was all in my head oh god my head felt like it was three places at once i was hearing everything twice smelling everything twice and having no thoughts that werent my own al knew everything i was feeling everything i was thinking i could only pray that i hadnt done this to nick better al said and i jerked as if whipped hearing his voice in my head as well as my ears not bad he said yanking me unresisting to my feet ceri passed out with only half that much and it took her three months to stop making that awful noise numb i felt spittle slip from me i couldnt remember how to wipe it away my throat hurt and the cold air i sucked into me seemed to burn i could hear dogs barking and a car engine the light from its headlamps wasnt moving and the snow sparkled i hung loose in als grip feet trying to move as he began walking again he dragged me out from in front of the car and in a slippery squeak of snow and ice it sped away come along rachel love al said in the new darkness clearly in a good mood as he pulled me over a snowplowed hill and onto the shoveled walk your wolf has given up and unless you submit to me we have a good bit of city to walk before i can get you to a ley line stumbling i lurched after al my feet in my socks long cold and unresponsive his hand gripped my wrist in a shackle stronger than any metal als shadow stretched behind us to where david panted shaking his head as if to clear it i could do nothing feeling nothing as davids lips pulled back from his muzzle silently he lunged numb and uncaring i watched as if from a distance al though was very much aware celero fervefacio he exclaimed angry and i screamed as the curse burned through me the force of als magic exploded from his outstretched hand and struck david in a flash the snow melted underneath the were and he writhed on the black circle of pavement i screamed from the agony catching itsmothering ithearing it trail into the keen of a banshee pleaseno more i whispered spit falling from me to melt a spot of snow i stared at the dirty white thinking it was my soul pitted and sullied paying for als black magic i couldnt think the pain burned through me still becoming a familiar hurt the sound of frightened people pulled my bleary gaze up the neighborhood was watching from doors and windows id probably make the news a sharp bang drew my attention to the house we had passed an elegant snow castle with turrets and towers gracing one corner of the yard the light from the open door spilled over the trampled snow falling almost to al and me i caught my breath at ceri standing in the threshold ivys crucifix about her neck her nightgown flowed to the porch white and billowy her unbound hair floated about her coming almost to her waist her posture was stiff with anger you she said her voice ringing clear over the snow from behind me came a warning yip and i felt a tug of a pull through als knowledge i instinctively knew that ceri had set a circle around al and me a futile sob escaped me but i fastened on the feeling like a hungry cur on trash i had felt something that wasnt from al the demons own emotion of annoyance was quick behind my depression covering it up until i forgot what i felt like from al i knew the circle was useless you can make a circle without drawing it first but only a drawn circle is strong enough to hold a demon al didnt even bother to slow down dragging me into the sheet of everafter my breath hissed in as the force ceri had put in the circle flowed into me i screamed as a new wave of fire coated my skin it ran from where i first touched the field flowing like liquid to cover me pain searched for my center it found it and i screamed again twisting out of als grip as it found my chi full and bursting the everafter rebounded scouring through me to settle in the only place it could force room my head sooner or later it would be too much and id go insane i clenched into myself the rough sidewalk scraped my thigh and shoulder as i convulsed slowly it became bearable and i was able to stop screaming the last one trailed off into a moan that silenced the dogs oh god i was dying i was dying from the inside out please i begged ceri knowing she couldnt hear me dont do that again al yanked me upright youre an excellent familiar he encouraged his face split in a wide grin im so proud of you you managed to stop screaming again i think ill make you a cup of tea when we get home and let you nap before i show you off to my friends no i whispered and al chuckled at my defiance even before the word escaped me i could have no thoughts without him knowing them first now i realized why ceri had numbed her emotion preferring to have none rather than share them with al wait ceri said her voice ringing clear over the snow as she ran down the porch steps past the chainlink fence and into the yard before us i sagged in als grip as he stopped to look at her her voice flowed over me soothing my skin and mind alike my eyes warmed at the hint of respite from the pain and i almost sobbed in relief she looked like a goddess she granted release from pain ceri al said warmly his attention only half on david as he circled us his hackles raised and a frightening savagery in his eyes youre looking well love his eyes traveled over the elaborate castle of snow behind her miss your homeland i am ceridwen merriam dulciate she said the command in her voice like a whip im not your familiar i have a soul give me the respect that calls for al snickered i see you found your ego how does it feel to be growing old again i saw her stiffen she came to stand before us and i could see her guilt i dont fear it anymore she said softy and i wondered if an unaging life was what al had lured her into being his familiar with its the way of the world let rachel mariana morgan go al threw his head back and laughed showing his thick flat teeth to the cloudy sky she is mine youre looking well care to come back you could be sisters how nice is that her mouth twitched she has a soul you cant force her panting i hung from where al held me if he got me into a line whether i had a soul or not wouldnt matter yes i can al said cementing it into fact his brow furrowed and he jerked his attention to david i had seen him circling us in a wide path trying to make a physical circle with his footsteps with which he could bind al the demons eyes narrowed detrudo he said gesturing i gasped jerking as a thread of everafter flowed from me to work als charm head erect i choked back whatever awful sound was going to come out of my raw throat i managed to keep silent as it raced from me but all my efforts to stay quiet did no good when a wave of everafter surged in from a line to replace what al had used again fire immolated my center overflowing and making my skin burn finally settling in my thoughts i couldnt think there was nothing but hurt in me i was burning my very thoughts my soul were burning shocked i fell to my knees the pain from the icy sidewalk going almost unnoticed as a cry of misery escaped me my eyes were open and ceri cringed standing barefoot before us in the snow a shared pain was mirrored in her eyes and i fastened on them finding peace in their green depths she had survived this i could survive this i would survive this god help me find a way to survive this al laughed as he felt my resolve good he encouraged i appreciate your effort to be silent youll get there your god cant help you but call for him anyway id like to meet him i took a shuddering breath david was a shaking puddle of silky fur in the snow some distance from where he had been i was screaming when the spell hit him and didnt see him knocked aside ceri went to him when he rose grasping his muzzle in both hands and peering into his eyes she looked dwarfed beside him his absolute blackness looking dangerous and somehow right beside her frailty dressed in flowing white give this to me she whispered as she gazed unafraid into his eyes and davids ears pricked dropping his face she paced forward until she was standing where davids footprints left off keasley joined her buttoning his thick fabric coat as he moved from my right to halt beside her he took her hand murmuring its yours before letting go and they both stepped back i wanted to weep but didnt have the strength they couldnt help me i admired ceris confidence her proud and impassioned stance but it was misplaced i might as well be dead demon she said her voice chiming thorough the still air like a bell i bind you al jerked as a sheet of smokey blue everafter blossomed over us and his face reddened es scortum obscenus impurua he shouted letting me go i stayed where i fell knowing he wouldnt have released me if i could escape how dare you use what i taught you to bind me panting i pulled my head up only now realizing why she had touched david and then keasley david had started the circle ceri had made a second portion of it and keasley had made the third they had given her permission to bind their paths together as one the circle had been made he was caught and as i watched him pace to the edge of the bubble and a victorious ceri i thought it wouldnt take much for him to decide to kill me out of spite moecha putida he shouted hammering on the force between them ceri i will tear your soul from you again i swear it et de she said her narrow chin high and her eyes glinting acervus excerementum you can jump to a line from here leave now before the sun rises so we can all go back to bed algaliarept took a slow breath and i shuddered at the bound anger in the movement no he said im going to widen rachels horizons and you will listen to her scream as she learns to take the full capacity of what i demand he could draw more through me i thought feeling my lungs press together as i temporarily lost the will to breathe there was worse than this ceris confidence faltered no she said she doesnt know how to store it properly any more and her mind will bend shell be insane before you teach her how to make your tea you dont need to be sane to make tea or do my toast upon one side he snarled snatching my arm he jerked me unresisting to my feet ceri shook her head standing in the snow as if it were summer youre being petty youve lost her she outsmarted you youre a sore loser al pinched my shoulder and i gritted my teeth refusing to cry out it was only pain it was nothing compared to the steady burning of the everafter he was forcing me to hold for him sore loser he shouted and i heard the cries of fear from the people in the shadows she cant hide on holy ground forever if she tries ill find a way to use her through the lines ceri glanced at david and i closed my eyes in despair she thought he could do it god help me it was only a matter of time before he figured out how my gamble to save my soul was going to fail go away she said pulling her attention from david go back to the everafter and leave rachel mariana morgan in peace no one here has called you you cant banish me ceri he raged jerking me upright until i fell into him my familiar opened a summoning path for me to follow when she tapped a line break this circle and let me take her as is my right ceri took an exultant breath rachel he acknowledged you called him banish him my eyes widened no algaliarept shouted sending a flow of everafter into me i nearly passed out the waves of pain washing through me building upon themselves until there was nothing left but agony but i took a breath smelling the stink of my burned soul algaliarept i choked out my voice a ragged gasp return to the everafter you little bitch he snarled backhanding me the force of the blow picked me up throwing me into ceris wall i landed in a crumpled heap unable to think my head hurt and my throat was raw the snow under me was cold i snuggled into it burning go away go away now i whispered the overwhelming everafter energy humming through my brain vanished in a clocktick i moaned at its absence i heard my heart beat pause and beat again it was all i could do to keep breathing empty with just my own thoughts in my head it was gone the fire was gone get her out of the snow i heard ceri say urgently her voice easing into me like ice water i tried to open my eyes failing someone picked me up and there was the warmth of body heat it was keasley a small part of me decided as i recognized the smell of redwood and cheap coffee my head thumped into him and my chin dropped to my chest i felt small cool hands upon my forehead and with ceri singing to me i felt myself shift into movement nineteen oh god i whispered my words sounding as raw as my throat felt it was a raspy utterance more like gravel in a tin pail than a voice my head hurt and a wet washcloth smelling of ivory soap was over my eyes i dont feel so good ceris cool hand touched my cheek im not surprised she said wryly keep your eyes shut im going to change your compress around me was the soft breathing of two people and a very big dog i vaguely remembered being carried in wavering on passing out but never quite managing it hard as i tried i could tell by the smell of my perfumes that keasley had put me in my room and the pillow under my head had a familiar comfortable feel the heavy weight of the afghan i kept at the foot of my bed was draped over me i was alive go figure ceri lifted the damp washcloth from me and despite her warning i cracked my lids ow i moaned as the light from a candle on the dresser seemed to pierce my eyes going all the way to the back of my skull and ricocheting my headache tripled she told you to keep your eyes shut jenks said sardonically but the relief in his voice was obvious the click of davids nails intruded shortly followed by a warm snuff in my ear shes fine ceri said softly and he retreated fine i thought concentrating on my breathing until the light bouncing around in my head lost momentum and died this was fine the throbbing in my head retreated to a mild agony and when i heard a soft puff of breath and the biting scent of blownout candle reached me i opened my eyes again in the streetlight leaking past my curtains i could see ceri on a kitchen chair beside my bed a pan of water was on her lap and i cringed when she set it on ivys vampire dating guide out where everyone could see it on my other side stood keasley a hunched shadow perched on the bedpost jenks glowed a dull amber and lurking in the background was david taking up half the floorspace with his wolf bulk i think were back in kansas toto i murmured and keasley harrumphed my face was damp and cold and a draft from the broken door mixed with the musty smell of the heater blowing from the vent jenks i croaked when i remembered the wash of winter air that had hit him are your kids all right yeah theyre fine he said and i slumped back to the pillow my hand crept up to hold my throat it felt as if it was bleeding inside david i questioned softer how about you his panting increased as he pushed keasley out of the way to snuff warm and moist in my ear his jaws opened ceri gasped when david gripped my entire face in his mouth adrenaline cut through the pain hey i exclaimed struggling as he gave me a gentle shake and let go heart pounding i froze at the soft growl rumbling up and the wet nose nudging my cheek making a doggie huff he padded into the hall what in hell does that mean i said heart jackhammering against my chest jenks rose in a sprinkling of pixy dust that made me squint it wasnt bright but my eyes hurt that bad hes glad youre okay he said his tiny features serious this is okay i said and from the sanctuary came an odd yodeling bark of laughter my throat hurt and i held a hand to it as i sat up there was were spit on my face and i wiped it off with the damp washcloth and set it over the edge of the pan my muscles hurt hell everything hurt and i hadnt liked my head being in davids mouth at all the sound of manicured nails clacking on the floorboards drew my attention to the dark hallway as he trotted past headed for the back of the church his backpack and clothes were in his mouth and his coat trailed behind like a downed animal jenks ceri said softly see if hes going to change here or if hed like some help getting his things in his satchel jenks rose up falling back at a short negative bark from the living room jaw clenched against a texassized headache i decided it was likely hed change back before leaving it was illegal to were in public outside of the three days around the full moon once the restriction had only been tradition now it was law to make humans feel better what weres did in their own homes was their own business i was confident no one would say anything about him shifting to help save me from a demon but he couldnt drive his car in the shape he was in and catching a ride on a bus wasnt going to happen well keasley said as he sat on the edge of my bed lets take a look at you ow i exclaimed when he touched my shoulder and the bruised muscle sent a stab of pain through me i pushed his hand off me and he shifted closer id forgotten what a paininthebutt patient you are he said reaching out again i want to know where youre hurting stop i croaked trying to slap his knobby arthritic hands my shoulder hurts where al pinched it my hands hurt where i scraped them my chin and stomach hurt where he dragged me down the steps my knees hurt from i hesitated falling in the road and my face hurts where al slapped me i looked at ceri do i have a black eye you will in the morning she said softly wincing in sympathy and my lip is cut i finished touching it the faint scent of bane joined the smell of snow david was turning back nice and slow hed have to after the hurt he must have endured to shift so quickly before i was glad he had some bane the herb was a mild pain depressant and sedative to make it easier too bad it only worked on weres keasley groaned as he rose ill get you a pain amulet he said shuffling into the hallway mind if i make some coffee im staying until your roommate is back make it two amulets i said not knowing if it would help my head pain amulets worked only on physical pain and i had a feeling this was more of an echo left from channeling so much ley line force was this what id done to nick no wonder he had left i squinted when the light flicked on in the kitchen and a slice of it spilled into my room ceri watched me carefully and i nodded to tell her it was okay patting my hand atop the coverlet she murmured tea would be easier for you to stomach than coffee her solemn green eyes went to jenks will you stay with her yeah his wings flashed into motion babysitting rachel is what i do third best i sneered at him and ceri hesitated i wont be long she said rising to leave in the soft sound of bare feet on wood the comfortable rhythm of conversation drifted in from the kitchen and i awkwardly pulled my afghan up about my shoulders every muscle ached as if i had been in a fever my feet were cold in my soggy socks and i was probably making a damp spot on my bed from my snowwet clothes depressed my eyes landed on jenks atop the bedpost at my feet thanks for trying to help i said you sure youre okay he blew the door right off i should have been faster with that amulet his wings turned a dismal blue i shrugged immediately wishing i hadnt when my shoulder started throbbing where was keasley with my charms they might not even work on demons jenks flitted close to land on the bump of my knee damn rache you look like crap thanks the heavenly scent of coffee started to mix with the musty heater a shadow eclipsed the light from the hallway and i creakily turned to see ceri eat these while your tea is brewing she said setting down a plate with three of ivys cookies on them my lips curled down in a frown do i have to i complained wheres my amulet wheres my amulet jenks mocked in a high falsetto god rachel suck it up shut up i muttered you try channeling a demons ley line and see if you even survive i bet youd explode in a flash of pixy dust you little twit he laughed and ceri frowned at us as if we were children ive got it right here she said and i leaned forward so she could drape the cord over my head a blessed relief soaked in to ease my muscleskeasley must have invoked it for mebut my headache remained all the worse now that there was nothing to distract me from it im sorry ceri said its going to take a good day when i didnt say anything she shifted to the door adding ill get your tea she walked out a scuffing pulling my gaze up excuse me she murmured gazing at the floor when she almost ran into david the were looked tired seeming older as he adjusted the collar of his coat his stubble was thicker and the thick spice of bane was heavy on him would you like some tea she said and my eyebrows rose as her usual confidence shifted to meek awe david shook his head accepting her submissive mien with a grace that made him seem noble head still lowered she edged past him and went into the kitchen jenks and i exchanged wondering looks as he came in and dropped his backpack nodding to jenks he pulled the kitchen chair farther away from me and sat down leaning back with his arms crossed and eyeing me speculatively from under his cowboy hat you want to tell me what that was all about before i go he said im starting to think theres a good reason no one will insure you i made an embarrassed face and took a cookie remember that demon that testified to put piscary behind bars his eyes widened son of my mothers bitch jenks laughed his voice tinkling like wind chimes damn stupid of her if you ask me ignoring jenks i met davids shocked look part worry part pain part disbelief he came to collect his due for services rendered i said which he got im his familiar but i still have my soul so he cant cart me off to the everafter unless i let him i looked to the ceiling wondering what kind of a runner i was going to be if i couldnt tap a line after sunset without bringing demons down on me david made a soft whistle no tag is worth that my eyes flicked to his ordinarily id agree with you but at the time piscary was trying to kill me and it seemed like a good idea good idea hell it was damn stupid jenks muttered clearly of the belief that if he had been there things never would have degraded that far he might have been right feeling as if i had a hangover i took a bite of cookie the dry things made me hungry and nauseated at the same time thank you for helping me i said brushing the crumbs away he would have had me if you hadnt done something are you going to be okay ive never seen anyone were that fast before leaning forward he shifted his backpack to rest between his feet i watched his eyes stray to the door and i knew he wanted to leave my shoulder hurts but ill be all right im sorry i finished the first cookie and started on another it seemed as if i could feel it starting to hum through me you ever need anything you tell me i owe you big i know how bad it hurts last year i went from witch to mink in three seconds twice in one week his breath hissed and lines appeared in his brow ouch he said respect in his eyes i smiled a new warmth growing in me you arent kidding but you know its likely going to be the only time ill ever be that skinny and have a fur coat a faint smile came over him where does the extra mass go anyway there was only one cookie left and i forced myself to eat it slowly back to a ley line his head bobbed we cant do that i noticed you make one hell of a big wolf david his smile widened you know what i changed my mind even if you ever want to go into insurance dont call me jenks dropped to the empty plate so i wouldnt have to keep shifting my head to see both of them that will be the day he snickered i can just see rachel in a gray business suit with a briefcase her hair in a bun and glasses on her nose i laughed immediately falling into a coughing jag arms clasped about me i hunched into myself shaking with rough hacking coughs my throat felt like it was on fire but that paled next to the throbbing ache in my head that exploded at the sudden movement that pain amulet bumping about my neck wasnt doing much good david patted my back in concern the hurt from my shoulder broke through the amulet and my stomach roiled eyes watering i fended him off ceri came in making soft admonishments as she set a mug of tea down and put a hand on my shoulder her touch seemed to calm the spasm and gasping i let her ease me back into the pillows she propped up behind me finally i stopped and met her gaze her shadowy face was pinched in concern behind her jenks and david watched i didnt like david seeing me like this but it wasnt as if i had much choice drink your tea she said holding it up to me and putting my hand around it my head hurts i complained taking a sip of the bland brew it wasnt real tea but something with flowers and weeds in it what i wanted was a cup of that coffee but i didnt want to hurt ceris feelings i feel like runover crap i complained you look like runover crap jenks said drink your tea it was tasteless but soothing i took another swallow scraping up a smile for ceri mmmm good i lied she straightened clearly pleased as she picked up the washbasin drink it all do you mind if keasley tacks a blanket over your door to stop the draft that would be great thanks i said but she didnt leave until i took another sip her shadow left the hall and my smile fell into a grimace this stuff is tasteless i whispered why does everything good for me have to be tasteless david glanced at the empty doorway and the light spilling in jenks flew to land on his shoulder as the were unzipped his backpack ive got something that might help david said my old partner used to swear by it begged me for some when he partiedtoohearty whoa hand over his nose jenks flitted upward how much bane you got in there johnny appleseed davids smile grew sly what he said his brown eyes innocent its not illegal and its organic no carbs even the familiar spicy scent of bane rose thicker in the small room and i wasnt surprised when david brought out a cellophane bag with a zippy top i recognized the name brand wolfs head organic here he said as he took the cup out of my hand and set it on my bedside table hiding what he was doing from the hallway he shook a good tablespoon into my drink running his eyes over me he shook in a little more try it now he said handing it to me i sighed why was everyone giving me stuff all i wanted was a sleep charm or maybe one of captain eddens strange aspirins but david looked so hopeful and the smell of bane was more appealing than rosehips that i stirred it with my pinky the crushed leaves sank to leave the tea a richer color what good will this do i asked as i took a sip im not a were david dropped the bag into his backpack and zipped it shut not much your witch metabolism is too slow for it to really work but my old partner was a witch and he said it helped with his hangovers its got to taste better if nothing else he stood to leave and i sipped again agreeing my jaw relaxed i hadnt even known i had been clenching it warm and smooth the bane tea slipped down my throat with a mixed taste of ham broth and apples my muscles seemed to unknot like taking a shot of tequila a sigh slipped from me and the soft weight of jenks landing on my arm pulled my eyes to his hey rache you okay i smiled and took another swallow hi jenks youre all sparkly jenkss face blanked and david looked up from working the buttons closed on his coat his brown eyes were questioning thanks david i said hearing my voice slow precise and low i owe you okay sure he picked up his backpack you take care of yourself i will i gulped half my tea and it slid down to make a warm spot in me i dont feel too bad right now which is good seeing as i have a date with trent tomorrow and if i dont go his security officer is gonna kill me david jerked to a stop in the threshold from beyond him came the taptaptap of keasley hammering a blanket over the door trent kalamack the were questioned yeah i took another drink swirling the tea with my pinky until the bane made a whirlpool and shifted the brew even darker hes going to talk to saladan his security officer is making me go with him i squinted up at david the light from the hallway seeming bright but not painful i wondered where davids tattoos were weres always had tattoos dont ask me why have you ever met trent i asked mr kalamack david rocked back into the room no i squirmed under my afghan and focused on my cup davids partner was right this stuff was great i didnt hurt anywhere trent is a prick i said remembering what we were talking about ive got the goods on him and hes got the goods on me but i dont have anything on his security officer and if i dont do this hes going to tell jenks hovered making an uncertain swoop from david to the door and back to me david eyed him then asked tell what i leaned closer my eyes widening as my tea threatened to slop when i moved faster than i thought i should frowning i finished it off not minding the bits of leaves that came with it smiling i leaned close enjoying the smell of musk and bane my secret i whispered wondering if david would let me hunt for his tattoos if i asked he looked great for an older guy ive got a secret but im not going to tell you ill be back jenks said swooping close i want to know what she put in that tea he zipped out and i blinked watching the sparkles of his pixy dust settle id never seen so many before and they were the colors of the rainbow jenks must have been worried secret david prompted but i shook my head and the light seemed to brighten im not going to tell i dont like the cold david put his hands on my shoulders and eased me into the pillows i smiled up at him happy when jenks flew in jenks david said softly has she been bitten by a were no he protested unless it was before i met her my eyes had slid shut and they opened when david shook me what i protested pushing at him when he peered at me his liquid brown eyes too close to mine now he reminded me of my dad and i smiled at him rachel honey he said you been bitten by a were a sigh came from me nope never you and never ivy no one bites me but mosquitoes and i squish them little bastards jenks hovered backward and david drew away i closed my eyes listening to them breathe it seemed awfully loud shhhh i said quiet maybe i gave her too much david said ceris soft padding of feet seemed loud whatwhat did you do to her she asked her voice sharp pulling my eyes open nothing david protested his shoulders hunched i gave her some bane it shouldnt have done this ive never seen it do this to a witch before ceri i said im sleepy can i go to sleep her lips pursed but i could tell she wasnt angry with me yes she tugged the coverlet to my chin go to sleep i slumped back not caring that i was still wearing wet clothes i was really really tired and i was warm and my skin was tingling and i felt like i could sleep for a week why didnt you ask me before you gave her bane ceri asked sharply her words a whisper but very clear shes already on brimstone its in the cookies i knew it i thought trying to open my eyes boy i was going to let ivy have it when she got home but she wasnt and i was tired so i did nothing id had it with people getting me drunk i swear i wasnt going to eat anything i didnt make myself ever again the sound of davids chuckle seemed to set my skin to tingle where the coverlet didnt come between him and me i got it now he said the brimstone upped her metabolism to where the bane is going to do some real good shes going to sleep for three days i gave her enough to knock a were out for a full moon a jerk of alarm went through me my eyes flashed open no i said trying to sit up as ceri pushed me into the pillows i have to go to that party if i dont quen will tell david helped her and together they kept my head on the pillow and my feet under the afghan take it easy rachel he soothed and i hated that he was stronger than i dont fight it or its going to come back up on you be a good little witch and let it work itself out if i dont go hell tell i said hearing my blood race through my ears the only thing i have on trent is that i know what he is and if i tell quen will freaking kill me what jenks shrieked his wings clattering as he rose too late i realized what i had said shit i stared at jenks feeling my face go white the room went deathly still ceris eyes were round with question and david stared in disbelief i couldnt take it back you know jenks shouted you know what he is and you didnt tell me you witch you knew you knew rachel youyou disapproval was thick in davids eyes and ceri looked frightened pixy children peeked around the doorframe you knew jenks yelled pixy dust sifting from him in a golden sunbeam his kids scattered in a frightened tinkling sound i lurched upright jenks i said hunching into myself as my stomach clenched shut up he shouted just shut the hell up were supposed to be partners jenks i reached out i wasnt sleepy anymore and my gut twisted no he said a burst of pixy dust lighting my dim room you dont trust me fine im outta here i gotta make a call david can i and my family bum a ride from you jenks i tossed the covers from me im sorry i couldnt tell you oh god i should have trusted jenks shut the hell up he exclaimed then flew out pixy dust flaming red in his path i stood to follow i took a step then reached for the doorframe my head swinging to look at the floor my vision wavered and my balance left me i put a hand to my stomach im going to be sick i breathed oh god im going to be sick davids hand was heavy on my shoulder motions firm and deliberate he pulled me into the hall i told you it was going to come back up on you he muttered while he pushed me into the bathroom and elbowed the light on you shouldnt have sat up what is it with you witches think you know everything and never listen to a damn thing needless to say he was right hand over my mouth i just made it to the toilet everything came up the cookies the tea dinner from two weeks ago david left after my first retch leaving me alone to hack and cough my way into the dry heaves finally i got control over myself knees shaking i rose and flushed the toilet unable to look at the mirror i rinsed my mouth out gulping water right from the tap i had thrown up all over my amulet and i took it off rinsing it under a steady stream of water before setting it beside the sink all my hurts came flowing back and i felt like i deserved them heart pounding and feeling weak i splashed water off my face and looked up past my raggedy looking reflection ceri stood in the doorway her arms clasped about her the church was eerily silent wheres jenks i rasped her eyes fell from mine and i turned around im sorry rachel he left with david he left he couldnt leave it was freaking twenty out there was a soft scuff and keasley shuffled to stand beside her where did he go i asked shivering as the lingering bane and brimstone churned inside ceris head drooped he asked david to take him to a friends house and the entire sídh left in a box he said he couldnt risk his family anymore and her gaze went to keasley her green eyes catching the fluorescent light he said he quit he left i lurched into motion headed for the phone didnt want to risk his family my ass he had killed two fairy assassins this spring letting the third live as a warning to the rest and it wasnt the cold the door was going to be fixed and they could always stay in ivys or my room until it was he left because i had lied to him and as i saw keasleys wrinkled grim face behind ceris i knew i was right words had been said that i hadnt heard stumbling into the living room i looked for the phone there was only one place hed go the were who had despelled my stuff last fall i had to talk to jenks i had to tell him i was sorry that i had been an ass that i should have trusted him that he was right to be angry with me and that i was sorry but keasley intercepted my reach and i drew back at his old hand i stared at him cold in the thin protection the blanket had put between me and the night rachel he said as ceri drifted to a melancholy stop in the hall i thinki think you should give him a day at least ceri jerked and she looked down the hallway faint on the air i heard the front door open and the blanket moved in the shifting air currents rachel came ivys voice wheres jenks and why is there a home depot truck unloading sheet plywood in our drive i sank down onto a chair before i fell over my elbows went on my knees and my head dropped into my hands the brimstone and bane still warred within me making me shaky and weak damn what was i going to tell ivy twenty the coffee in my oversized mug was cold but i wasnt going to go into the kitchen for more ivy was banging around there baking more of her vile cookies despite us having already gone over that i wasnt going to eat them and was madder than a troll with a hangover that shed been slipping me brimstone the clatter of my pain amulet against the complexion charm hiding my bruised eye intruded as i set my mug aside and reached for the desk lamp it had gotten dusky while ceri tried to teach me how to store line energy cheery yellow light spilled over the plants strewn on my desk the glow just reaching ceri sitting on a cushion she had brought over from keasleys we could have done this in the more comfortable living room but ceri had insisted on hallowed ground despite the sun being up and it was quiet in the sanctuary depressingly so ceri sat crosslegged on the floor to make a small figure in jeans and a casual shirt under the shadow of the cross a pot of tea sat beside her steaming though my own mug was long cold i had a feeling she was using magic to keep it warm though i had yet to catch her at it a delicate cup was cradled reverently in her thin handsshe had brought that from keasleys tooand ivys crucifix glimmered about her neck the womans hands were never far from it her fair hair had been plaited by jenkss eldest daughter that morning and she looked at peace with herself i loved seeing her like this knowing what she had endured there was a thump from the kitchen followed by the clatter of the oven door shutting a frown crossed me and i turned to ceri as she prompted are you ready to try again setting my sockfooted feet firmly on the floor i nodded quick from practice i reached out with my awareness and touched the line out back my chi filled taking no more or less than it ever did the energy flowed through me much like a river flows through a pond i had been able to do this since i was twelve and accidentally threw trent into a tree at his fathers makeawish camp what i had to do was pull some of that energy out of the pond and lift it to a cistern in my mind so to speak a persons chi whether human inderlander or demon could hold only so much familiars acted as extra chi that a magic user could draw on as his or her own ceri waited until i gestured i was ready before she tapped the same line and fostered more into me it was a trickle instead of algaliarepts deluge but even so my skin burned when my chi overflowed and the force rippled through me seeking somewhere to puddle going back to the pond and river analogy the banks had overflowed and the valley was flooding my thoughts were the only place it could settle and by the time it found them i had made the tiny threedimensional circle in my imagination that ceri had spent most of the afternoon teaching me how to craft shoulders easing i felt the trickle find the small enclosure immediately the warm sensation on my skin vanished as the energy my chi couldnt hold was drawn into it like mercury droplets the bubble expanded glowing with a red smear that took on the color of my and als aura yuck say your trigger word ceri prompted and i winced it was too late my eyes met hers and her thin lips twitched you forgot she accused and i shrugged immediately she stopped forcing energy into me and the excess ran out in a brief spark of heat back to the line say it this time she said tightly ceri was nice but she wasnt a particularly patient teacher again she made ley line energy overflow my chi my skin warmed the bruise from where algaliarept slapped me throbbing the amperage if you will was a touch more than usual and i thought that it was ceris notsosubtle encouragement to get it right this time tulpa i whispered hearing it in my mind as well as my ear the word choice wasnt important it was building the association between the word and the actions that were latin was generally used as it was unlikely that i would say it accidentally triggering the spell by mistake the process was identical to when i had learned to make an instant circle the word tulpa wasnt latinit hardly qualified as englishbut how often was it used in conversation faster this time the energy from the line found my enclosure and filled it i pulled my gaze to ceri and nodded for more green eyes serious in the dim light from the heat lamp on my desk she returned it my breath seeped out and my focus blurred when ceri upped the level and a flash of warmth tingled over my skin tulpa i whispered pulse quickening the new force found the first my spherical protection circle within my unconsciousness expanded to take it in again my focus cleared and i nodded to ceri she blinked when i gestured for more but i wasnt going to let al knock me out with an overload of force im fine i said then stiffened when the bruised skin around my eye throbbed burning with the sensation of a sunburn even through the pain amulet tulpa i said slumping as the heat vanished see i told my frazzled brain its an illusion im not really on fire thats enough ceri said uncomfortably and i pulled my chin up from my chest the fire was gone from my veins but i was exhausted and my fingers were trembling i dont want to sleep tonight until i can hold what he pushed into me i replied but rachel she protested and i raised a hand slowly in denial hes going to come back i said i cant fight him if im convulsing in pain face pale she bobbed her head and i jerked as she forced more into me oh god i whispered then said my trigger word before ceri could stop this time i felt the energy flow like acid through me following new channels pulled by my word rather than finding its way to my bubble by accident my head jerked up eyes wide i stared at ceri as the pain vanished you did it she said looking almost frightened as she sat crosslegged before me swallowing i pulled my legs under me so she wouldnt see my knees tremble yeah unblinking she held her cup in her lap let it go you need to recenter yourself i found my arms were wrapped around myself forcing them down i exhaled letting go of the energy spindled in my head sounded easier than it was i had enough force in me to throw ivy into the next county if it didnt flow back to my chi and then the line using the gently seared channels that ceri had been burning through my nervous system it was really going to hurt steeling myself i set my will around the bubble and squeezed breath held i waited for the pain but the ley line energy smoothly returned to my chi and then the line leaving me shaking from spent adrenaline enormously relieved i brushed my hair out of my eyes and put my gaze on ceri i felt awful tired exhausted sweaty and shakingbut satisfied youre improving she said and a thin smile crossed me thanks taking my mug i took a sip of cold coffee she was probably going to ask me to pull it off the line by myself next i wasnt yet ready to try ceri i said as my fingers trembled this isnt that hard compared to the benefits why dont more people know this she smiled her dusky shape in the shadow of the lamp going sage looking they do in the everafter its the first thingno the second thingthat a new familiar is taught whats the first i asked before i remembered i really didnt want to know the death of selfwill she said and my expression froze at the ugliness in how casually she said it letting me escape knowing how to be my own familiar was a mistake she said al would kill me if he could to cover it up he cant i said suddenly frightened that the demon might try ceri shrugged maybe but i have my soul black as it is thats whats important i suppose i didnt understand her cavalier attitude but i hadnt been als familiar for a millennium i dont want a familiar i said glad nick was so distant he couldnt feel any of this i was sure if he was close enough he wouldve called to make sure i was okay i think youre doing well ceri sipped her tea and glanced at the dark windows al told me it took me three months to get to where you are now i looked at her shocked there was no way i could be better than her youre kidding i was fighting him she said i didnt want to learn and he had to force me into it using the absence of pain as a positive reinforcement you were in pain for three months i said horrified her eyes were on her thin hands laced about her teacup i dont remember it it was a long time ago i do remember sitting at his feet every night his hand soft on my head while he relaxed as he listened to me cry for the sky and trees imagining this beautiful wisp of a woman at algaliarepts feet suffering his touch was almost too much to bear im sorry ceri i whispered she jerked as if only now realizing she had said it aloud dont let him take you she said her wide eyes serious and solemn he liked me and though he used me as they all use their familiars he did like me i was a coveted jewel in his belt and he treated me well so i would be useful and at his side for a longer time you though her head bowed breaking our eye contact and pulling her braid over her shoulder he will torment you so hard and so fast that you wont have time to breathe dont let him take you i swallowed feeling cold i wasnt planning on it her narrow chin trembled you misunderstand if he comes for you and you cant fight him off make him so angry that he kills you her sincerity struck me to the core hes not going to give up is he i said no he needs a familiar to keep his standing he wont give up on you unless he finds someone better al is greedy and impatient hell take the best he can find so all this practice is making me a more attractive target i said feeling sick ceri squinted apologetically you need it to keep him from simply stunning you with a massive dose of ley line force and dragging you into a line i gazed at the darkening windows damn i whispered not having considered that but being your own familiar will help in your profession ceri said persuasively youll have the strength of a familiar without the liabilities i suppose i set my mug aside gaze unfocused it was getting dark and i knew she wanted to be home before the sun set do you want me to try it alone i prompted hesitantly her attention flicked to my hands id advise a small rest youre still shaking i looked at my fingers embarrassed that she was right curling them into a fist i gave her a sheepish smile she took a sip of her teaclearly willing herself to be patient when i had no control over the situationand i jumped when she whispered consimilis calefacio she had done something i had felt a drop in the line even though i wasnt connected to it sure enough her gaze meeting mine was bright in amusement you felt that she said around a beautiful laugh youre getting very attached to your line rachel mariana morgan it belongs to the whole street even if it is in your backyard what did you do i asked not wanting to delve into what she had meant by that she held her cup up in explanation and my smile grew you warmed it up i said and she bobbed her head slowly my smile faded thats not a black charm is it ceris face lost its expression no its common ley line magic that acts on water i will not add to the smut on my soul rachel ill be hard pressed to get rid of it as it is but al used it on david it almost cooked him i asserted feeling sick people were mostly water heat that up and you could cook them from the inside god i was sick for even thinking of it no she reassured me it was different this one works only on things without auras the curse strong enough to break through an aura is black and needs a drop of demon blood to twist the reason david survived was because al was drawing on a line through you and he knew you couldnt handle the lethal amountyet i thought about that for a moment if it wasnt black there was no harm in it and being able to warm up my coffee without the microwave would blow ivy away is it hard to do ceris smile blossomed ill walk you through it give me a moment i have to remember how to do it the long way she said extending her hand for my mug oh gotta slow to the witchs pace i thought leaning forward and handing it to her but seeing as it was most likely the charm she used three times a day to cook als meals she could probably do it in her sleep its sympathetic magic she explained theres a poem to help remember the gestures but the only two words you have to say are latin and it needs a focal object to direct the magic where to go she explained and took a sip of my cold coffee making a face this is swill she muttered her words awkward as she spoke around the drop on her tongue barbaric its better when its hot i protested not having known you could hold a focal object in your mouth and still have it be effective she could do the spell without it but then she would have to throw the spell at my cup this was easier and less likely to spill my coffee too her face still showing her distaste she raised her thin expressive hands from candles burn and planets spin she said and i moved my fingers mimicking her gesturei suppose if you used your imagination it kind of looked like lighting a candle though how her suddenly dropping hand related to spinning planets was beyond me friction is how it ends and begins i jumped when she brought her hands together to make a loud pop simultaneously saying consimilis similar i thought thinking it might be a catch phrase for sympathetic magic and the pop might be an audible show of air molecules undergoing friction in sympathetic magic it didnt matter how nebulous the relationship was as long as it was real cold to hot harness within she continued making another unfamiliar gesture but i recognized the next finger movement from when i used a ley line charm to break the howlers bat in practice perhaps it was the motion that tapped into the focal object for direction huh maybe there was some sense to this ley line stuff after all calefacio she said happily invoking the charm and setting it all into motion i felt a mild drop through me as the charm pulled energy from the line to excite the water molecules in the cup warming the coffee wow i breathed when she handed me back my mug softly steaming thanks youre welcome she said you have to regulate the ending temperature yourself by how much line energy you put into it the more energy the hotter it gets i took a careful sip deciding it was perfect it must have taken her years to gain this much proficiency depending on the amount you have to warm up ceri whispered her eyes distant in memory so be careful with your bathwater until you know what youre doing visibly pulling herself back to the present she turned to me are you settled now adrenaline zinged through me and i set my warm coffee down i can do this if ceri can warm her tea and spindle line energy in her head then so can i fill your center she encouraged then pull some from it as if youre going to work a spell as you say your invocation word i tucked a curl behind my ear and settled myself exhaling i closed my eyes and i tapped the line feeling the pressures equalize in an instant setting my mind to the poised calmness i cultivated when i said a ley line charm a curious new sensation tingled through me a tinge of energy flowed in from the line replacing what i had unconsciously pulled from my chi tulpa i thought hope bringing me tight my eyes flew open as a wash of force flowed in from the line to replace what had darted from my chi to my head in a torrent the line raced through me and settled in my thoughts my enclosure expanded to take it in shocked i did nothing to stop it enough ceri cried rising to her knees rachel let go of the line i jerked pulling my focus from the ley line there was a brief swish of warmth through me as a dribble of force backwashed from my thoughts to my chi topping it off breath held i froze in my chair staring at her i was afraid to move there was so much energy in my head are you all right she said not settling back down and i nodded from the kitchen came a faint you okay in there were fine i carefully shouted back then looked at ceri were fine right green eyes wide she bobbed her head not dropping my gaze for an instant youre holding a lot of energy outside your center she said but ive noticed your chi doesnt hold as much as mine i think she hesitated i think an elfs chi can hold more than a witchs but witches seem to be able to hold more in their thoughts i could taste the energy in me tinfoillike on my tongue witches make better batteries huh i quipped weakly she laughed her clear voice going up to the dusky rafters i wished there were pixies up there to dance amid the sound maybe thats why witches abandoned the everafter sooner than elves she said demons seem to prefer witches over elves or humans for their familiars i thought it was because there were so few of us but maybe not maybe i said wondering how long i could hold all this force without spilling it my nose tickled i desperately didnt want to sneeze ivys boots in the hallway intruded and we both turned as she strode toward us with her purse over her shoulder and a plate of cookies in her hand im headed out she said lightly tossing her hair over her shoulder want me to walk you home ceri immediately ceri stood thats not necessary ire flickered in ivys eyes i know its not necessary ivys plate of steaming cookies hit the desktop before me in a harsh clatter my eyebrows rose and i swung my feet to the floor ivy wanted to talk to ceri aloneabout me bothered i tapped my fingernails in a sharp staccato im not eating those i said flatly its medicinal rachel she said her voice heavy with threat its brimstone ivy i shot back ceri shifted from foot to foot in obvious discomfort but i didnt care i cant believe you gave me brimstone i added i arrest people who do brimstone i dont share rent with them i was not going to tag ivy i didnt care if she broke every law in the is handbook not this time ivys stance went aggressive her hip cocked and her lips almost bloodless its medicinal she said sharply its specially processed and the amount of stimulant in it is so low you cant even smell it you cant smell brimstone can you can you the ring of brown about her pupils had shrunk and i dropped my gaze not wanting to trip her into pulling an aura not now with the sun almost down there was enough in it to jerk the bane into play i said sullenly ivy too calmed knowing she had reached her limits that wasnt my fault she said softly i never gave you enough to even trigger a brimstone dog ceri raised her narrow chin there was no remorse in her green eyes i apologized for that she said tightly i didnt know it was illegal it wasnt the last time i gave it to someone see ivy said gesturing to ceri she didnt know and that insurance guy was only trying to help now shut up eat your cookies and stop making us feel bad youve got a run tomorrow and you need your strength leaning back in my swivel chair i pushed the plate of vamp cookies away i wasnt going to eat them i didnt care that what i had kept down yesterday had upped my metabolism so my black eye was already turning yellow and my cut lip was healed im fine ivys usually placid face clouded over fine she said sharply fine i shot back crossing my legs and turning so i was eyeing her askance ivys jaw clenched ceri ill walk you home ceri glanced between us face empty of emotion she bent to get her teapot and cup ill take care of my dishes first she said i can do that i rushed to say but ceri shook her head watching her feet so as not to spill as she made her way to the kitchen i frowned not liking her doing domestic work it was too much like what i imagined algaliarept had forced on her let her do it ivy said when the sound of ceris steps ended it makes her feel useful shes royalty i said you do know that dont you ivy glanced into the dark hallway as the sound of running water filtered out maybe a thousand years ago now shes nothing and she knows it i made a puff of air dont you have any compassion doing my dishes is degrading i have a lot of compassion a flicker of anger set ivys thin eyebrows high but the last time i looked there werent any openings for princesses in the want ads what is she supposed to do to give her life meaning there arent any treaties for her to make no rulings to judge and her biggest decision is to have eggs or waffles for breakfast theres no way to give herself a feeling of worth with her old royalty crap and doing dishes isnt degrading i leaned back in my chair in a show of acquiescence she was right but i didnt like it so you have a run i prompted when the silence stretched ivy sent one shoulder up and down im going to talk to jenks good i met her eyes relieved something we could talk about without arguing i stopped at that weres house this afternoon the poor guy wouldnt let me in the pixy girls had been at him his hair was solid cornrows i had woken up one morning with my hair braided into the fringe of my afghan matalina had made them apologize but it took me forty minutes to untangle myself i would give just about anything to wake up like that again yeah i saw him ivy said and i sat up from my slouch youve been over there i asked watching ivy get her coat from the foyer and return she slipped it on the short leather jacket making a soft hush of silk against silk ive been over there twice she said the were wont let me in either but one of my friends is taking him out on a date so jenks will have to answer the door the little prick typical little man he has an ego the size of the grand canyon i chucked and ceri came in from the back her borrowed coat was over her arm and the shoes that keasley bought her were in her grip i wasnt going to tell her to put them on she could walk in the snow barefoot as far as i was concerned ivy though gave her a pointed look you going to be all right for a while ivy asked as ceri dropped her shoes to the floor and snugged her feet into them good god i muttered twisting the chair back and forth ill be fine stay on holy ground she added as she gestured for ceri to head out dont tap a line eat your cookies not going to happen ivy i said pasta i wanted pasta in alfredo sauce thats what nick had cooked up for me the last time ivy was bent on shoving these things down my throat i couldnt believe shed been slipping me brimstone yes i could ill call you in about an hour to make sure youre all right i wont answer i said irritated im going to take a nap i stood and stretched until my sweater and halter top rose to show my belly button it would have gotten a wolf whistle from jenks and the silence in the rafters was depressing ceri came forward with her cushion to give me a hug goodbye it startled me and i hesitantly returned it rachel can take care of herself she said proudly shes been holding enough everafter to blow a hole in the roof for the last five minutes and has forgotten about it holy crap i exclaimed feeling my face warm i am arent i ivy sighed as she strode to the churchs front door dont wait up for me she called over her shoulder im having dinner with my folks and wont be home until after sunup you should let it go ceri said as she edged after ivy at least when the sun is down someone else might summon him and if they dont banish him properly hell come looking for you he might try to knock you out by adding to what youre holding now she shrugged in a very modern gesture but if you stay on holy ground you should be all right ill let it go i said absently my thoughts whirling ceri smiled shyly thank you rachel she said softly its good to feel needed i jerked my attention back to her youre welcome the scent of cold snow filtered in i looked up seeing ivy standing impatiently in the threshold of the open door the fading light making her a threatening silhouette in tight leather byyyyye rachel she prompted mockingly and ceri sighed turning the slender woman made her unhurried way to the door kicking off her shoes at the last moment and going barefoot out onto the icy cement steps how can you stand the cold i heard ivy say before the door shut behind them i soaked in the silence and the dusky light reaching over i clicked off the desk lamp and it seemed to brighten outside i was alonefor what was probably the first timein my church no roommate no boyfriend no pixies alone my eyes closed and i sat on the slightly raised stage and breathed i could smell plywood over the almond scent of ivys stupid cookies a soft pressure behind my eyes reminded me i was still holding that ball of everafter and with a nudge of my will i broke the threedimensional circle in my thoughts and the energy flowed back to the line in a warm wash i opened my eyes and headed for the kitchen my sock feet soundless i wasnt going to take a nap i was going to make brownies as part of ivys present there was no way i could compete with thousanddollar perfume i had to take the handmadegoodie track detouring into the living room i searched for the remote the smell of plywood was almost an assault and i glanced at the window ivy had sketched on the panel freehanding the view of the graveyard i clicked on the stereo and offsprings come out and play spilled out grinning i cranked it wake the dead i said tossing the remote and dancing into the kitchen while the bouncy music lured me into a better mood i pulled out my dented spell pot which i couldnt use for spelling anymore and the recipe book i had swiped from my mom thumbing through it i found grandmas fudgy brownie recipe penciled in beside the gourmet recipe that tasted like cardboard timing my motions with the music i got out the eggs sugar vanilla and dumped them on the center island counter i had the chocolate chips melting on the stove and the evaporated milk measured out when the air shifted and the front door slammed the egg in my hand slipped cracking as it hit the counter forget something ivy i shouted adrenaline stabbed through me as my gaze went from the broken egg to everything scattered over the kitchen id never get it hidden before she made it back here couldnt that woman stay away for even an hour but it was kistens voice that answered twentyone its me rachel kisten called his voice faint over the music blaring from the living room i froze the memory of the kiss hed given me keeping me where i stood i must have looked like an idiot when he turned the corner and stopped in the threshold ivys not here he said his eyes giving me the onceover shoot i took a breath to settle myself shoot i questioned sliding the cracked egg off the counter and into the bowl i didnt think anyone said shoot anymore can i say shit hell yes shit then his gaze went from me to the kitchen lacing his hands behind his back as i picked the bigger chunks of shell out hey would you ah turn the music down for me i said sneaking a glance at him when he nodded and walked out it was saturday and he was dressed casually in leather boots and faded jeans that were nice and tight his short leather coat was open and a burgundy silk shirt showed a wisp of chest hair just enough i thought as the music softened i could smell his coat i was a sucker for the scent of leather this might be a problem are you sure ivy didnt send you over to babysit i questioned as he returned and i wiped the egg slime off on a damp dishcloth he chuckled and sat in ivys chair no he hesitated is she going to be gone for a while or can i wait i didnt look up from the recipe not liking how he had said that there had been more inquiry in his voice than the question warranted ivy went to talk to jenks i ran my finger down the page without looking at the words then shes having dinner with her folks sunup he murmured and i felt my warning flags go up all of them the clock above the sink ticked and i took the melted chocolate off the stove i wasnt about to stand with my back to him so i set it on the counter between us crossing my arms in front of me and putting my backside against the sink watching me he tossed his hair out of his eyes i took a breath to tell him to go but he interrupted are you all right i stared blankly at him then remembered oh the demonthing i muttered embarrassed as i touched the pain charms about my neck you heard about that huh he smiled with half his mouth you made the news and i had to listen to ivy for three solid hours while she bitched about not being here at the time going back to my recipe i rolled my eyes sorry yeah im okay a few scrapes and bruises nothing major but i cant tap a line after sundown anymore i didnt want to tell him i wasnt entirely safe after dark either unless i was on holy groundwhich the kitchen and living room werent its really going to put a crimp in my runs i said sourly wondering how i was going to get around this latest mountain oh well it wasnt as if i relied on ley line magic i was an earth witch after all kisten didnt seem to think it mattered much either if his casual shrug meant anything im sorry to hear jenks left he said stretching his legs out and crossing his boots at his ankles he was more than an asset to your company hes a good friend my face screwed up into an unpleasant expression i should have told him what trent was when i figured it out surprise cascaded over him you know what trent kalamack is no shit jaw clenched i dropped my eyes to the recipe book and nodded waiting for him to ask it what is he i stayed silent my eyes fixed on the page the soft sound of him moving pulled my gaze up never mind he said it doesnt matter relieved i gave the chocolate a clockwise stir it matters to jenks i should have trusted him not everyone needs to know everything you do if youre four inches tall with wings he got up drawing my attention as he stretched with a soft satisfied sound his shoulders eased and he collapsed in on himself taking his coat off he headed to the fridge i tapped the spoon on the side to flick most of the chocolate off my brow furrowed sometimes it was easier to talk to a stranger what am i doing wrong kisten i said frustrated why do i drive the people i like away he came out from behind the fridge door with the bag of almonds id bought last week ivys not leaving those are mine i said and he paused until i gestured sourly that he could have them im not leaving he added mouth gently moving as he ate one i exhaled noisily dumping the measured sugar into the chocolate he looked really good over there and memories kept intruding thoughts of us dressed up and enjoying ourselves the spark his black eyes drew through me when saladans heavies lay broken in the street piscarys elevator with me wrapped around him wanting to feel him taking everything i had the crunch of the sugar against the pan was loud as i stirred damn vamp pheromones im glad nick left kisten said he wasnt good for you i kept my head down but my shoulders tensed what do you know about it i said tucking a long red curl behind my ear i looked up finding him calmly eating my almonds nick made me feel good i made him feel good we had fun together we liked the same movies the same places to eat he could keep up with me when we ran at the zoo nick was a good person and you have no right to pass judgment on him i snatched a damp dishcloth wiping up my spilled sugar and shaking it into the sink you may be right he said as he jiggled a handful of nuts into his palm and rolled the bag shut but i find one thing fascinating he put a nut between his teeth and crunched through it noisily you put him in the past tense my mouth dropped open torn between anger and shock my face went cold in the living room the music changed to something fast and bouncyand totally inappropriate kisten cracked the fridge open set the nuts back into the door and closed it ill wait for ivy for a while she might come back with jenksif youre lucky you have a tendency to demand more of a person than most are willing to give he shook the nuts still left in his hand as i sputtered kind of like a vampire he added as he picked up his coat and walked out my hand was dripping and i realized i was squeezing the dishcloth so hard that water was seeping out i threw it into the sink furious and depressed not a good combination from the living room happy pop music bounced and skittered will you turn that off i shouted my jaw ached where i was clenching it and i forced my teeth to part when the music stopped fuming i measured out the sugar and dumped it in i reached for the spoon a sound of frustration coming from me as i remembered i had already added the sugar damn it back to the turn i muttered now id have to make a double batch spoon held tightly i tried to stir it in sugar went everywhere spilling over the edge my teeth gritted and i stomped back to the sink for the dishcloth you dont know squat i whispered as i scraped the spilled sugar into a little pile nick might come back he said he was i have his key i pushed the gathered sugar into the cup of my hand hesitating before i dumped it into the bowl with the rest brushing the last of the grit from my fingers i looked at the dark hallway nick wouldnt give me his key if he wasnt coming back music started up soft with a steady beat my eyes narrowed i never said he could put something else in angry i took a step toward the living room then jerked to a halt kisten had left in the middle of a conversation he had taken food with him crunchy food according to ivys dating book that was a vampiric invitation and following him would be saying i was interested even worse he knew i knew i was still staring at the hallway when kisten walked past he backpedaled to a stop as he saw me there with a blank look on my face ill wait in the sanctuary he said is that okay with you sure i whispered his eyebrows rose and with that same little smile he ate an almond okay kisten vanished down the dark hallway his boots silent on the hardwood floor i turned away and stared at the nightblackened window i counted to ten i counted to ten again i counted to ten a third time finding myself in the hallway by the time i reached seven ill go in say my piece and leave i promised myself when i found him at the piano his back to me as he sat on the bench he pulled himself straight as my feet scuffed to a halt nick is a good man i said my voice shaking nick is a good man he agreed not turning around he makes me feel wanted needed kisten slowly spun his stubble caught the faint light filtering in from the street the outline of his wide shoulders tapered down to his slim waist and i mentally shook myself at how good he looked he used to his low smooth voice sent a shiver through me i dont want you to talk about him anymore i said he gazed at me for a heartbeat then said okay good i took a quick breath turned and walked out my knees were shaking and listening for any steps behind me i took a right into my room heart pounding i reached for my perfume the one that hid my scent dont gasping i turned finding kisten behind me ivys bottle slipped from my fingers his hand darted out and i jumped as it enfolded mine imprisoning the precious bottle safe within my grip i froze i like the way you smell he whispered far far too close my stomach clenched i could risk bringing al down on me by tapping a line to knock him unconscious but i didnt want to you need to get out of my bedroom i said his blue eyes looked black in the dim light the faint glow from the kitchen made him an alluring dangerous shadow my shoulders were so tense they hurt as he opened my hand and took the perfume from me the click as it hit my dresser jerked me straight nick isnt coming back he said unaccusing and blunt my breath slipped from me and i closed my eyes oh god i know my eyes jerked open when he took my elbows i froze waiting for my scar to flash into play but it didnt he wasnt trying to bespell me a foolish part of me respected that and like an idiot i did nothing instead of telling him to get the hell out of my church and away from me you need to be needed rachel he said inches away as his breath shifted my hair you live so brightly so honestly that you need to be needed youre hurting i can feel it i know his solemn eyes took on a shade of pity nick is human no matter how he tries hell never understand you entirely i know i swallowed hard there was a wet warmth in my eyes my jaw tightened until my head hurt i will not cry he cant give you what you need kistens hands slipped to my waist hell always be just a little afraid i know my eyes closed opening as i let him pull me closer and even if nick learns to live with his fear he said earnestly his eyes asking me to listen he wont ever forgive you for being stronger than he is a lump formed in my throat ii have to go i said excuse me his hands fell from me and i pushed past him and into the hall confused and wanting to scream at the world i strode into the kitchen i stopped seeing among the pots and flour a huge aching emptiness that had never been there before arms wrapped about myself i lurched into the living room i had to get the music off it was beautiful i hated it i hated everything snatching up the remote i pointed it at the player jeff buckley i couldnt handle jeff in the state i was in who in hell put jeff buckley in my player clicking it off i tossed the remote to the couch adrenaline jerked me straight as the remote hit not the suede of ivys couch but someones hand kisten i stammered as he turned the music back on watching me with halflidded eyes what are you doing listening to music he was calm and wiretight and panic struck me at his calculating surety dont sneak up on me like that i said my breath coming short ivy never sneaks up on me ivy doesnt like who she is his eyes were unblinking i do he reached out breath coming in a quick surge i knocked his arm aside tension sang through me as he jerked me forward holding me to him panic then anger flashed there wasnt a twinge from my scar kisten i exclaimed trying to move let me go im not trying to bite you he said softly his lips brushing my ear stop it his voice was firm soothing there was no blood lust in it my thoughts flashed back to waking up in his car to the sound of singing monks let go i demanded strung out and feeling like i was either going to hit him or start to cry i dont want to youre hurting too much how long has it been since someone held you touched you a tear leaked out and i hated that he saw it hated he knew i was holding my breath you need to feel rachel his voice grew soft pleading this is killing you slowly i swallowed the lump in my throat he was seducing me i wasnt such an innocent that i knew he wouldnt try but his hands upon my arms were warm and he was right i needed anothers touch ached for it damn me to hell i had almost forgotten how it felt to be needed nick had given that back to me that tiny thrill of excitement knowing someone was wanting to touch you wanting you and you alone to touch him i had endured more shortterm relationships than a socialite has shoes either it was my is job or my wacko mother pushing for commitment or that i attracted jerks who simply saw a redhead as a potential notch on their broomstick maybe i was a crazy bitch demanding trust without being able to give it i didnt want another onesided relationship but nick was gone and kisten smelled good he made me feel the pain less my shoulders eased and he exhaled as he felt me stop fighting him eyes closing i dropped my forehead into his shoulder as my folded arms made a small space between us the music was soft and slow i wasnt crazy i could trust i did trust i had trusted nick and he had left youll leave i breathed they all leave they get what they want and they leave or they find out what i can do and then they leave his arms about me tightened for an instant then relaxed im not going anywhere you already scared the hell out of me when you took piscary down he buried his nose in my hair and breathed in my scent and i still am here lulled by his body warmth and his touch my tension tricked away kisten altered my balanceand i moved with him moving hardly moving our weight shifted as the slow and seductive music lured me into swaying with him you cant hurt my pride kisten whispered his fingers tracing the middle of my back ive lived my entire life with people stronger than i i like that and have no shame in being the weaker one ill never be able to cast a spell and i dont give a shit that you can do something i cant the music and our almostnotmoving started a warm spot in me licking my lips i slipped my arms from between us to find they felt natural about his waist my heartbeat quickened and my eyes were wide as i stared at the wall my breath slipping in and out of me in an unreal evenness kisten ill always be here he said softly you can never fill my need never drive me away no matter how much you give me the good or the bad ill always be hungry for emotion always and forever and i can feel you hurting i can turn it to joy if youll let me i swallowed as he drew us to a stop he pulled back and with a gentle touch on my jaw he tilted my head so he could see my eyes the pulsing beat of the music pattered on my mind numbing and soothing his gaze was heady let me do this he whispered deeply dangerous but with his words he put me in a position of power i could say no i didnt want to my thoughts pinged through me too fast to be realized his hands felt good and his eyes held passion i wanted what he could give mewhat he promised why i whispered his lips parted and he breathed because i want to because you want me to i didnt look from him his pupils never shifted never grew my grip on him became firmer as my arms pressed into him there will be no sharing of blood kisten ever his breath came and went and his hands tightened expression dusky with the knowledge of what was to come he leaned closer one he said as he kissed the corner of my mouth step he kissed the other side at a time he continued as he kissed me gently so gently it made me ache for more my love he finished a stab of desire went right to my core my eyes closed oh god save me from myself i make no promises i whispered i dont ask for any he said where are we going i dont know my hands drifted downward from his waist we were swaying to the music again i felt alive and as we almostdanced a hint of fire came from my demon scar can i do this kisten asked moving closer so more of our bodies touched i knew he was asking my permission to play upon my scar to willingly let him bespell me that he asked gave me a feeling of security i knew was probably false no yes i dont know so torn it felt good just my body touching his his arms about my waist a new demand in their strength i dont know then i wont where were we going exhaling he ran his hands down my arms lacing his fingers in mine gently he pulled my hands to the small of his back holding them there as we swayed shifting to the slow seductive music a shiver rose inside me the scent of leather grew thick and warm where he touched sent a sliver of heat to tingle my fingers my head dropped into the hollow between his neck and shoulder i wanted to put my lips there knowing what he would feel knowing how he would taste if i dared but i didnt contenting myself to send my breath there instead afraid of what he would do if my lips touched him heart pounding i moved his hands to the small of my back and i left them there moving pressing massaging my hands rose to twine my fingers behind his head my thoughts touched upon us in the elevator when i thought piscary was going to kill me it was too much to resist the memory of my demon scar alive and alight please i whispered my lips brushing his neck to make him tremble his torn earlobe was inches from me tempting i want you to pulling my gaze up i searched his eyes seeing but not fearing the narrowing band of blue i trust you but i dont trust your instincts a deep understanding and relief pinched his eyes his hands dropped lower caressing until they found the top of my legs then reversed their motion moving always moving as we swayed i dont trust them either he said fake accent utterly gone not with you my breath caught as his fingers traced from my back to my front a whisper against my jeans tugging at the top button hinting im wearing caps he said the vampire has been defanged startled my lips parted as he smiled showing me that his sharp canines were indeed capped it sent a surge of heat through me disquieting and thought provoking sure he couldnt draw blood but now id let him explore a hell of a lot more of me and he knew it but safe no he was more dangerous now than if he hadnt capped his teeth oh god i whispered knowing i was lost as he nuzzled his head into the hollow of my shoulder and gently kissed me eyes closing i sent my fingers into his hair clenching as his kiss shifted moving to the very edge of my collarbone where my scar started waves of demand pulsed from it and my knees buckled sorry kisten breathed huskily as he caught my elbows and kept me upright i didnt know it was that sensitive just how much saliva did you get dosed with his lips were off my neck and by my ear almost panting i leaned into him the blood in me pounded wanting me to do something i almost died i said kisten ill be careful he said the tenderness going right to my core i willingly followed his lead as he sat me on the couch nestling me between the back and the arm taking his hands i pulled kisten down beside me my scar was tingling and waves of promise scoured me where were we going rachel i heard the same question in his voice but i didnt want to answer smiling i pulled him closer across the couch you talk too much i whispered and covered my mouth with his a soft sound came from him as his lips pushed back his stubble rough fingers spaced wide across my cheek he held me still as i pulled his weight farther down upon me nudging my hip he made room for his knee between me and the back of the couch my skin tingled where his fingers touched my jaw i slipped a hesitant tongue between his lips and my breath came quick as he darted his tongue deep into me he tasted faintly of almonds and when he moved to draw away i twined my fingers at the nape of his neck to keep him there just a moment longer he made a surprised sound pushing more aggressively now i pulled back running my tongue across the smoothness of his teeth as i went kisten shuddered the tremor felt clearly as he supported his weight over me i didnt know how far i wanted to go but this this was good i couldnt lead him on promising more than i could give wait i said reluctantly meeting his gaze but seeing him above me breathless with his passion held in check i hesitated his eyes were black heady with desire and need i searched for and found a carefully checked blood lust his shoulders were tense under his shirt a hand was firm against my side his thumb massaging under my halter the look of wanting in him sent adrenaline to my core rousing me more than his rough and gentle touch that rose higher to find my breast oh to be wanted needed what he said poised and waiting the hell with it never mind i said playing with the hair about his ear his soft hand under my halter top went still you want me to stop a second stab of feeling struck though me i felt my eyes close no i breathed hearing a hundred wellthoughtout convictions die in that word heart pounding i slipped my amulets from me and dropped them to the carpeti wanted to feel everythingbut it wasnt until i reached for his belt buckle that he understood a low guttural sound escaped him and he dropped his head to mine his weight was a welcomed warmth pressing on me as his lips found my demon scar and gently mouthed it fire spilled like molten stone through me to my groin and i gasped as the sensation rebounded and multiplied the dull aches from my recent demon attack mutated into pleasure courtesy of the old vampire saliva he was playing upon i couldnt think i couldnt breathe my hands jerked out from where i had been trying to undo his pants and i clutched his shoulder kisten i breathed when i was able to take a shuddering breath but he didnt let up pushing me down until my head was on the arm of the couch my fingers dug into him as gentle teeth replaced his lips a groan escaped me and he worked the scar his teeth soft and his breath harsh i wanted him i wanted all of him kisten i pushed at him i had to ask first i had to know what he said flatly as he pushed my shirt and halter out of the way and his fingers found my breast and began moving promising more in the gap between us i finally got his belt undone i gave a tug and i heard a rivet snap through his head dropped back to me and before he could find my neck again and send me into an unaware ecstasy i undid his zipper and sent my hands searching god save me i thought as i found him the smooth skin tight under my questing fingers youve had sex with a witch before i whispered pushing his jeans down and running my hand across his backside i know what im getting into he said breathily i felt myself melt into the couch as my thoughts and shoulders eased my hands found him again and he exhaled long and slow i didnt want to assume i said then gasped as he dropped his weight lower and pulled my shirt up i didnt want you to be surprised oh god kisteni panted almost frantic with need as his lips moved from under my jaw to my collarbone and then to my breast waves of promise rose high and i arched my back as he pulled his hands warm against my skin where was he i couldnt reach that far he silenced my whisper as he lifted his face and kissed me now i could reach and my breath slipped from me in bliss as i grasped him and sent my fingers moving lower kisten you talk too much he said his lips moving against my skin you ever have sex with a vamp he said his eyes half closed watching me i exhaled as he turned his attention to my neck again his fingers traced the path his lips were going to take and waves of ecstasy rolled through me when they did no i panted as i yanked his jeans down id never get them off over his boots anything i should be aware of he ran his hands under my breast again tracing the path his lips soon followed back arched i tried not to moan with need as i reached down trying to find all of him we bite he said and i cried out when he did just that gently pinching me between his teeth get my pants off before i kill you i panted almost insane with desire yes maam he growled and his stubble scraped me as he pulled away i took a much needed deep breath following him up to push him back down and straddle him his hands worked my zipper as i fumbled with the buttons of his shirt a sigh escaped me when i got the last one undone and sent my hands over him my fingers tracing up and across the definition of his abs and chest i leaned over him my hair hiding what i was doing as my lips hopskipped from his middle to the hollow at his neck i lingered there hesitantly daring to run my teeth against his skin pulling against it with a slight pressure under me he shivered and his hands working my jeans down my hips shook eyes wide i pulled away thinking i had gone too far no he whispered putting his hands on my waist to keep me there his face was strained with emotion dont stop itsi wont break your skin his eyes flashed open oh god rachel i promise i wont break your skin the passion in his voice struck me abandoning myself i pinned him to the couch knees to either side lips searching i found his neck turning my kisses into something more substantial his heavy breaths and light hands drove my desire into pulsing demands pounding through me in time with my heartbeat teeth replaced my lips and his breath grew ragged his hands grasped my waist and i was lifted up enough that i could push my jeans off they caught on my socks and with a cry of impatience i pulled my lips from him long enough to kick them off then i was back my skin warm where it touched him under me i leaned over him holding his neck unmoving as i used my teeth against his skin instead of my lips kistens breath came in a shuddering sound rachel he breathed his hands firm against my middle as he sent his hand downward searching a low sound barely audible came from me as his fingers brushed me in his touch i felt his need flash into demand my eyes closed and i sent one hand downward finding him feeling him against me i shifted forward then back our breath slipped out in tandem as we joined heavy and potent my want and relief rose he slipped deep inside me soon god help me if it wasnt soon i was going to die his soft breathing rose to swirl in my thoughts sending surges from my neck to my groin my heart pounded and his fingers traced my neck resting atop my pulsing skin we moved together a pace steady with promise his free arm wrapped about me holding me closer its weight both imprisoning and secure give me this he whispered drawing me closer and i willingly bent to his will letting his lips find my demon scar my breath came in a loud gasp i shuddered our rhythm shifting he held me close as the waves of desire built upon themselves his lips on my neck became teeth hungry demanding there was no pain and i urged him to do what he would a small part of me knew if he hadnt his caps i would have been bitten it only drove me to a more desperate need i heard myself cry out and his grip trembled becoming tighter wild with passion i clutched his shoulders it was there i only needed to catch it my breath came fast against his neck there was nothing but him and me and our bodies moving together his rhythm shifted and feeling his passions beginning to crest i found his neck and sent my teeth into him again harder he whispered you cant hurt me i promise you cant hurt me it tipped me over the edge and as i played pretend with my vampire i lunged hungrily into him with no thought of what id leave behind kisten groaned his arms tightening around me his head pushed mine aside and with a guttural sound he buried his face in my neck i cried out as his lips found my scar fire struck my body alight with that fulfillment crashed upon me and i climaxed wave after wave rose each building on the one before kisten shuddered his motion under me ceasing as his passions crested an instant after my own my breath came in a pained sound and i trembled unable to move fearing and wanting the last tingling jolts kisten i managed as they faded to nothing and i found myself panting against him his grip about me hesitated and his hands fell away my forehead dropped to his chest and i took a shaking breath exhausted and spent i could do nothing as i lay atop him my eyes half closed slowly i realized my back was cold and that kistens hand was tracing a warm path up and down my spine i could hear his heartbeat and smell our scents mingling muscles trembling with fatigue i pulled my head up to find his eyes shut and a contented smile on him my breath caught holy shit what had i just done kistens eyes opened finding mine they were clear and blue the black of his pupil normal and calming now youre afraid he said its a little late for that his gaze lingered on my black eyeonly now seeing it with my amulets on the floor i pulled myself up from him immediately falling back as it was cold my limbs started shaking um that was fun i said and he laughed fun he said running a finger down my jawline my wicked witch thought that was fun his smile wouldnt leave him nick was a fool to let you go what do you mean i said shifting to move but his hands held me to him i mean he said softly that you are the most erotic woman ive ever touched that youre both a wideeyed innocent and an experienced slut all at the same time i stiffened if this is your attempt at pillow talk it sucks eggs rachel he cajoled the heavy look of satisfied tenderness the only thing keeping me where i was that and i didnt think i could stand up quite yet you have no idea how arousing it is to have your tiny little teeth on me struggling to break through tasting without tasting an innocent experienced and hungry all at the same time i raised my eyebrows blowing a strand of hair out of my eyes you had this all planned didnt you i accused thought you could come in here and seduce me like you do everyone else it wasnt as if i could be angry lying atop him as i was but i tried no not like everyone else he said the glint in his eyes going right to my core and yes i came over here fully intending to seduce you he lifted his head and whispered in my ear its what im good at just like youre good at evading demons and kicking ass kicking ass i questioned as he dropped his head back to the arm of the couch his hand was exploring again and i didnt want to move yeah he said and i jumped as he found a ticklish spot i like a woman who takes care of herself not much of a white knight on a horse huh he raised one eyebrow oh i could he said but im a lazy son of a bitch i laughed at that and he joined me with his own chuckle as his grip about my waist tightened with a little lurch he lifted me from him hold on he said as he stood swinging me into the cradle of his arms as if i was a fivepound bag of sugar with his vamp strength he held me with one arm and hoisted his pants up loose about his hips shower my arms were laced about his neck and i inspected it for bite marks there wasnt a one though i knew i had bit down hard enough to leave them i also knew without looking that he hadnt made a visible mark on me despite his roughness that sounds great i said as he shuffled forward his jeans still unzipped ill get you a shower he said as i looked behind me to my amulets pants and one sock strewn on the floor and then well open all the windows and air the church out ill help you finish making your fudge too that will help its brownies even better that uses the oven he hesitated before my bathroom door and feeling cared for and wanted in his arms i pushed it open with my foot the man was strong id give him that this was as satisfying as the sex well almost you have scented candles dont you he asked as i flicked on the light with my toe i have two xchromosomes i said dryly as he set me atop the washer and pulled off my last sock i have a candle or two he was going to help me into the shower how sweet good ill get one going in the sanctuary tell ivy you put it there in the window for jenks and you can keep it going until sunup a whisper of unease pulled me straight and my motions grew slow as i pulled my sweater over my head and dropped it onto the washer ivy i questioned kisten leaned against the wall and took off his boots you dont mind telling her his boot thumped into the far wall and my face went cold ivy scented candles airing out the church making brownies to scent the air washing his scent off me swell smiling his badboy smile kisten padded to me in his socks and open jeans his wide hand cupped my jaw and he leaned close i dont mind if she knows he said and i didnt move enjoying the warmth shes going to find out eventually but id break it to her gently if i were you not dump it on her he gave me a soft kiss on the corner of my mouth his hand trailed reluctantly from me as he backed up and opened the door to the shower crap id forgotten about ivy yeah i said distantly recalling her jealousy her dislike of surprises and how badly she reacted to both you think shes going to be upset kisten turned his shirt off and water beading on his hand from feeling the temperature upset shes going to be as jealous as a green apple that you and i have a physical way to express our relationship and she doesnt frustration filled me damn it kisten im not going to let her bite me so she knows i like her sex and blood blood and sex its the same thing and i cant do that with ivy im not wired that way he shook his head a sad smile on him you cant say blood and sex are the same thing youve never given blood to another you have nothing to base your view on i frowned every time a vamp puts his eyes on me looking for a snack it feels sexual he came forward wedging his body between my knees pressing close up to the washer his hand went out and he pushed my hair back over my shoulder most living vampires who are looking for a quick fix find a willing partner faster when they stir them sexually but rachel the meaning behind the giving and receiving blood isnt supposed to be based on sex but respect and love that you cant be moved by the promise of great sex is why ivy gave up that tack with you so quickly but shes still hunting you i thought of all the facets of ivy that skimmers appearance had forced me to openly acknowledge i know once she gets over her initial anger i think shell be all right with us dating i never said i was dating you he smiled knowingly and touched my cheek but if i took your blood even in accident or a moment of passion kistens blue eyes pinched in worry one scratch and shed stake me the entire city knows shes put a claim on you and god help the vamp that gets in her way i took your body if i touch your blood im dead twice i went cold kisten youre scaring me you should be scared little witch shes going to be the most powerful vampire in cincinnati someday and she wants to be your friend she wants you to be her savior she thinks youll either find a way to kill the vamp virus in her so she can die with her soul intact or be her scion so she can die knowing that youll be there to take care of her kisten stop smiling he kissed my forehead dont worry nothing has changed from yesterday tomorrow will be the same shes your friend and she wont ask anything you cant give that doesnt help he shrugged and with a last touch on my side he took a step back steam billowed out from the crack in the door as kisten shimmied out of his jeans and leaned into the shower to adjust the temperature again my eyes ran from his welltoned calves to his tight behind to his broad back lightly muscled all thoughts of ivys coming anger vanished damn as if feeling my eyes on him he turned catching me ogling him the steam eddied about him drops of moisture from the showerhead clung to his stubble let me help you get your camisole off he said the timbre of his voice shifting i ran my eyes down him again grinning as i brought my gaze up double damn he slipped his hands behind my back and with a little help on my part he nudged me forward to the edge of the dryer and slipped my halter top off wrapping my legs around him i laced my hands behind his neck and tucked my chin into the hollow of his neck god help me he was beautiful kisten i questioned as he nuzzled my hair out of the way and found the ticklish spot behind my ear a warm feeling started in my middle stemming from where his lips touched me demanding i recognize it accept it call it a good thing do you still have that tight leather biker outfit i asked kind of embarrassed lifting me off the washer and carrying me into the shower he laughed twentytwo i smiled as the music ended to leave a comfortable silence the ticking of the clock above the sink became loud in the candlelit air my eyes went to the hand jerking about the dial it was creeping up on four in the morning and i had nothing to do but sit and daydream about kisten he had left about three to handle the crowd at piscarys leaving me warm content and happy we had spent the entire early evening together eating blts and junk food ransacking ivys and my music collection and then using her computer to burn a cd of our favorites in retrospect i think it had been the most enjoyable evening of my entire adult life as we laughed over each others memories and i realized i enjoyed sharing more than my body with him every candle i owned was lit as insurance that id be able to pick the time i told ivy about my new arrangement with kisten and their glow added to the peace instilled by the soft burble of potpourri over the stove and the slight lethargy from the pain amulet about my neck the air smelled of ginger popcorn and brownies and as i sat at ivys table with my elbows to either side of me i played with my amulets and wondered what kisten was doing much as i didnt want to admit it i really liked him and that i could have gone from fear to dislike to attraction and interest in less than a year left me concerned and embarrassed it wasnt like me to overlook my healthy distrust of vampires because of a tight butt and a charming demeanor living with a vampire might have something to do with it i thought dipping my hand into the nearby bowl of popcorn and eating a piece because it was there rather than out of any need to satisfy hunger i didnt think my new attitude was because of my scar i had liked kisten before the sex or there wouldnt have been anyand he hadnt played upon it to influence me either wiping my fingers free of the salt i stared into nothing i had been thinking of kisten differently since hed dressed me up and made me feel good maybe i thought picking out another kernel maybe i could find something with a vampire that id never been able to hold on to with a witch warlock or human chin in the cup of my palm i sent my fingers lightly over the demon scar as i recalled his careful attention as he shampooed my hair and soaped my back and how good it felt to be able to return the favor he had let me hog the showerhead most of the time that kind of stuff was important the sound of the front door opening jerked my attention to the clock ivy was home already i had wanted to be tucked in bed pretending sleep when she came in you up rachel she said loud enough to be heard and soft enough to not wake me kitchen i called back nervous i glanced at the potpourri it was enough kisten had said it was standing i flicked on the overhead light and resettled myself as the fluorescent bulbs flickered on i tucked my amulets behind my sweater and listened to her thump about in her room her steps in the hall were quick and stilted hi i said when she walked in a vision of tight leather and tall boots a black satchel was over one arm and a silkwrapped package about the size of a broken fishing pole was in her hand my eyebrows rose as i realized she had put on makeup her image was both professional and sexy where was she going this late and dressed like that what happened with dinner with the folks i prompted change of plans setting her stuff beside me on the table she crouched to dig in a lower drawer i came to get a few things then im gone still at knee level she smiled at me to show teeth ill be back in a couple of hours okay i said slightly confused she looked happy she actually looked happy its cold in here she said as she pulled out three of my wooden stakes and set them clattering on the counter by the sink it smells like you had the windows open um it must be from our plywood door my brow furrowed as she stood tugging the hem of her leather jacket down crossing the room with a speed just shy of eerie she unzipped the satchel and jammed the stakes into it i silently watched her wondering ivy hesitated can i use them she asked mistaking my silence for disapproval sure keep them i said wondering what was up i hadnt seen her in this much leather since she took that run to liberate a vamp child from a jealous ex and i really didnt want a stake back if it had been used thanks boot heels clacking on the linoleum she went to the coffeemaker her oval face creased in annoyance as she peered at the empty carafe you have a run i asked sort of her enthusiasm dimmed and i watched her throw the old grounds away curiosity got the better of me and i flicked back the silk covering to see what was under it holy crap i exclaimed as i found a shiny length of steel smelling faintly of oil where did you get a sword nice isnt it not turning she added three scoops of coffee to the filter and set it to brew and you cant trace it like bullets or charms oh such a warm and fuzzy thought can you use it ivy pushed herself from the counter i leaned back in my chair as she shook the wrap off grasping the handle of the thin sword and pulling it from the back sheath it came free with a whisper of ringing steel that tickled my inner ear like collapsing silk her posture melted into a classic pose her free arm arched over her head and her sword arm bent and extended her face was empty as she looked at the wall her black hair swinging to a slow stop i had a freaking vampire samurai warrior for a roommate this was getting better and better and you know how to use it too i said faintly she flashed me a smile as she stood and wedged it back into its sheath i took lessons from fifth grade through high school she said as she set it on the table i grew so fast that it was hard to keep my balance i kept running into things mostly people who irritated me adolescence is when the faster reflexes kick in the practice helped and i stuck with it i licked the salt off my fingers and pushed the popcorn away i was willing to bet the classes had a good section devoted to selfcontrol feeling more relaxed since the candles seemed to be working i stretched my legs out under the table wanting some of the coffee ivy rummaged in an upper cupboard to bring out her thermos i eyed the dripping coffee hoping she wasnt going to take it all well she said as she filled the metal vacuum bottle with hot water to warm it up you look like the vamp who bled the cat beg pardon i said stomach clenching she turned and dried her hands off on a dishcloth did nick call no i said flatly her smile widened swinging her hair out of her way she said good then softly she repeated thats good this was not where i wanted the conversation to go rising i wiped my palms on my jeans and padded in my bare feet to turn the flame up under the potpourri ivy yanked open the fridge and came out with the cream cheese and a bag of bagels the woman ate as if calories couldnt stick to her no jenks i asked though the answer was obvious no jenks he did talk to me though her eyes were pinched with frustration i told him i knew what trent was too and to get over it now he wont talk to me either she popped the lid on the cream cheese and scraped a knifeful across her bagel do you think we should put an ad in the paper my head rose to replace him i stammered ivy took a bite and shook her head just shake him up she said around her full mouth maybe if he sees our ad for pixy backup hell talk to us frowning i sat down in my spot and slouched extending my legs to put my bare feet on her unused chair i doubt it it would be just like him to tell us to take a flying leap ivy lifted one shoulder and let it fall its not like we can do anything until spring i suppose god this was depressing i had to find a way to apologize to jenks maybe if i sent him a clowndelivered telegram maybe if i was the clown ill talk to him again i said take him some honey maybe if i get him drunk hell forgive me for being such an ass ill pick some up while im out she offered i saw some gourmet honey made from japanese cherry blossoms dumping the water from the thermos she refilled it with the entire carafe of coffee sealing the heavenly scent in metal and glass biting back my disappointment i pulled my feet off her chair obviously she had been thinking about how to soothe jenkss pride as well so where are you going this late with a thermos of coffee a bag of stakes and that sword i asked ivy leaned against the counter with the sleek grace of a black panther the halfeaten bagel perched on her finger tips i have to lean on some uppity vamps keep them up past their bedtime the sword is for show the stakes to remember me by and the coffee is for me i made a face imagining just how nasty it could be to have ivy keep you up especially if she applied herself but then my eyes widened as i put two and two together youre doing this for piscary i said sure i was right when she turned to look out the window yup silently i waited hoping shed say something she didnt i ran my attention over her taking in her closed posture your dad worked something out i hinted she sighed and turned to me as long as i handle piscarys affairs the bastard wont be dipping into my head she looked at her halfeaten bagel frowning she clacked her boots to the trash and threw it away i said nothing surprised she had capitulated so easily apparently hearing in my silence an accusation that wasnt there her smooth face went ashamed piscary agreed to let me continue using kisten as my frontman she said he likes the notoriety and anyone who is important will know that whatever he says is really coming from mei mean piscary i dont have to do anything unless kisten runs into something he cant handle then ill go in as the muscle to bail him out my memories returned to kisten taking down seven witches with the ease and nonchalance of breaking a candy bar i couldnt imagine anything he couldnt handle but then again he wouldnt be able to go up against undead vampires without leaning on piscarys strength and youre okay with this i said stupidly no she said crossing her arms before her but its what my dad came up with and if i cant accept how he helped me i shouldnt have asked for it sorry i muttered wishing i had kept my mouth shut apparently mollified ivy crossed the kitchen and put the thermos in with the stakes i dont want piscary in my head she said giving her satchel a shake to settle everything before zipping it closed as long as i do what he says hell stay out and hell leave erica alone kisten should be his scion not me she muttered he wants it i absently agreed and her fingers on the bag went still her face carrying a shadow of the pain i recognized from the night piscary had raped her in more ways than one a chill struck through me as her nostrils flared and her focus went distant kisten was here she said softly my skin tightened damn i hadnt been able to keep it from her for even a night uh yeah i said as i pulled myself straighter in my chair he was here looking for you about half the day ago the chill inside me deepened when her focus narrowed reading my unease her head shifted to look at the potpourri on the stove double damn lips pressed tight she walked out heels clacking the wood chair scraped loudly as i stood um ivy i called following her out my breath caught and i jerked to a stop when i almost ran into her in the dark hallway on her way back from the sanctuary excuse me she muttered shifting around me with a vamps speed her posture was tense and in the light leaking in from the kitchen i could see her eyes were dilated crap she was vamping out ivy i said to the empty hall as she had walked into the living room about kisten my words choked off and i halted my feet edging the gray carpet in the candlelit living room ivy stood with a ridged stiffness before the couch the couch kisten and i had had sex on emotions cascaded over her frightening in their rapidity dismay fear anger betrayal i jumped when she jerked into motion jabbing at the cdcheck button the five cds came rolling halfway out ivy stared at them stiffening ill kill him she said her fingers touching jeff buckley shocked i opened my mouth to protest finding my words dying to nothing at the anger black and heavy in her tight expression ill kill him twice she said she knew somehow she knew my heart pounded ivy i started hearing the fear in my voice and with that i jerked her instincts into play gasping i backpedaled far too slow where is it she hissed her eyes wide and wild as she reached for me ivy my back hit the wall of the hallway and i knocked her hand aside he didnt bite me where is it adrenaline surged smelling it she jerked her hand out reaching her eyes were black and lost it was only our former sparring that kept her grip from landing as i blocked her reach and dove under her arm to come to a stand in the middle of the candlelit living room back off ivy i exclaimed trying not to fall into a defensive crouch he didnt bite me but i didnt have time to breathe before she was on me jerking the collar of my sweater where did he bite you she said her gray voice trembling ill kill him ill freaking kill him i can smell him all over you her hand jerked to the hem of my sweater it tripped me over the panic line and instinct took over ivy stop i shouted frightened i tapped the line she reached for me face twisted in anger the line filled my chi wild and out of control a burst of energy flamed from my hands burning them as i hadnt harnessed it with a charm we both cried out as a black and gold sheet of everafter expanded from me knocking ivy back into the plywood door she slid to the floor in an awkward heap her arms over her head and her legs askew the windows shook at the boom i rocked back then caught my balance anger replaced my fear i didnt care if she was all right or not he didnt bite me i shouted spitting my hair out of my mouth as i stood over her okay we had sex all right god help you ivy it was only sex ivy coughed redfaced and gasping she found her breath the plywood sheet behind her was cracked shaking her head she peered up at me clearly not focusing yet she didnt get up he didnt bite you she rasped her face shadowy in the candlelight my legs trembled from adrenaline no i exclaimed you think im stupid clearly shaken she looked askance at me taking a slow breath she wiped her lower lip with the back of her hand my gut tightened as it came away red with blood ivy stared at it then gathered her legs under her and got to her feet i breathed easier when she reached for a tissue wiping her hand off and crumpling it into a ball she reached out and i sprang back dont touch me i said and she raised a hand in acquiescence sorry she looked at the cracked plywood then winced as she felt her back carefully she tugged her coat down eyes going to mine she took a slow breath my heart pounded in time to the pain in my head you slept with kisten and he didnt bite you she asked yes and no he didnt bite me and if you ever touch me again im walking out the front door forever damn it ivy i thought we were clear on this i expected an apology or something but all she did was eye me speculatively and ask are you sure you might not even notice if he cut your inner lip goose bumps rose and i ran my tongue across the inside of my mouth he wore caps i said feeling ill for how easily he could have tricked me but he hadnt ivy blinked slowly she sat on the edge of the couch her elbows on her knees and her forehead cupped in the cradle of her hands her thin body looked vulnerable in the light from the three candles on the table crap it suddenly occurred to me that not only did she want a closer relationship with me but that kisten was her old boyfriend ivy are you okay no i cautiously sat on the chair across from her the corner of the table between us by any standards this was a complete shitfest i cursed silently then reached out ivy god this is awkward she jumped at the weight of my hand on her arm looking up with frighteningly dry eyes i pulled back laying my hand like a dead thing in my lap i knew i shouldnt touch her when she wanted more but to sit and do nothing was so cold it just kind of happened ivy touched her lip to see that it had stopped bleeding it was just sex you didnt give him your blood the vulnerability in her voice struck me my head bobbed i felt like a doll my eyes wide and my thoughts empty im sorry i said i didnt think you and kisten i hesitated this wasnt about the sex but the blood she thought i had given him i didnt think you and kisten had a formal relationship anymore i fumbled unsure if i was putting it right i dont share blood with kisten but for the rare occasion when hes been dumped and needs some tlc she said her gray silk voice soft still she wouldnt look up blood is not sex rachel its a way to show you care for someone a way to showyou love them it was barely a whisper my breath grew fast i felt we were balanced on a knifes edge and it scared the crap out of me how can you say sex isnt blood when youll have sex with anyone i said adrenaline making my voice harsher than i intended good god ivy when was the last time you had sex without blood only now did she bring her head up shocking me with the fear in her eyes she was afraid and not because she thought id given my blood to kisten she was afraid of the answers i was demanding i dont think she had faced them before even in the chaos her desires had left her in i felt hot then cold pulling my knees to my chin i tucked my bare heels against me okay she said with the last of her exhaled breath and i knew the next thing she said would be stark honesty you have a good point i usually include blood with sex i like it that way its a rush rachel if you would only she said her hands coming up from her knees i felt myself pale i shook my head and she changed her mind about what she was going to say she seemed to deflate all the tension pooling out of her rachel its not the same she finished weakly brown eyes pleading my thoughts went to kist the twinge from my scar dove to my groin and brought my breath even faster swallowing i forced the feeling from me i pulled back glad the table was between us thats what kisten says but i cant separate it and i dont think you can either ivys face went red and i knew i was right damn it ivy im not saying its wrong theyre the same i said hell ive been living with you for seven months dont you think by now youd know if i thought it was but thats not the way im put together youre the best friend ive ever had but im not going to share a pillow with you and im never going to let anyone taste my blood i took a breath im not put together that way either and i cant live my life avoiding a real relationship with someone because it might hurt your feelings i told you its not going to happen between us and its not maybe i felt sick maybe i should move out move out it was a breathy sound of dismay and the warmth of tears stung my eyes i stared at the wall jaw clenched the last seven months had been the most frightening scary and best months of my life i didnt want to leaveand not just because she was protecting me from another vampire biting and claiming mebut staying here wasnt fair to either of us if she couldnt let it go jenks is gone i said my voice low so it wouldnt shake i just slept with your old boyfriend its not fair to stay here if there is never going to be anything more than friendship between us especially now that skimmer is back i looked at the broken door hating myself we should just call everything quits god why was i almost crying i couldnt give her any more and she desperately needed it skimmer could skimmer wanted to i should leave but when i looked up i was shocked to see the candlelight glinting upon a ribbon of moisture under her eye i dont want you to go she said and the lump in my throat thickened a good friendship is reason enough to stay isnt it she whispered her eyes so full of pain that a tear leaked out of me damn it i said wiping a finger under my eye look what you made me do i jerked when she reached across the table and took my wrist my eyes were riveted to hers as she pulled it to her and touched my teardamp fingertips to her lips her eyes closed and her lashes fluttered a zing of adrenaline struck me my pulse quickened the memory of vampireinduced ecstasy high in my thoughts ivy i said weakly pulling away she let go my heart pounded as she took a slow breath tasting the air with her senses running my emotions through her incredible brain reading the balance of what i might and might not do i didnt want to know what her calculations totaled to ill pack my things i said frightened that she might know more about me than i did her eyes opened i thought i saw a faint glimmer of strength no she said the first hint of her iron will returning were both crap when were alone and im not just talking about the stupid firm i promise i wont ask anything of you except to be my friend please she took a breath please dont go because of this rachel do what you want with kist hes a good man and i know he wont hurt you just she held her breath her determination faltering just be here when i come home tonight i nodded i knew she wasnt just asking about tonight and i didnt want to leave i loved it here the kitchen the witchs garden the coolfactor of living in a church that she valued our friendship meant a lot to me and after avoiding true friendship for years because of what had happened to my dad having a best friend meant a lot to me too she had once threatened to withdraw her desperately needed protection from me if i left this time she hadnt i was afraid to look for the reason afraid that it might stem from that tiny thrill i had felt when she had tasted my tears thank you she said and i froze as she leaned forward over the table to give me a quick hug the scent of almonds and leather filled my senses if kisten can convince you that blood isnt sex she said promise to tell me i stared at her the memory of skimmer kissing her flashed through me and was gone apparently satisfied she let go stood and went into the kitchen ivy i breathed too numb and strung out to speak louder knowing she could hear me how many rules are we breaking she hesitated as she appeared in the hallway satchel and sword in hand shifting from foot to foot and not answering me ill be back after sunrise maybe we can have a late dinner gossip about kisten over lasagna hes actually a nice guyhell be good for you giving me an awkward smile she left her voice had held a faint ribbon of regret but i didnt know if it was for having lost me or kisten i didnt want to know i stared at the carpet not seeing the candles or smelling the scent of wax and perfume as the faint boom of the door shifted the air how had my life gotten this screwed up all i had wanted to do was quit the is help a few people make something of myself and my degree since then i had found and driven away my first real boyfriend in years insulted a pixy clan become ivys golden ring and had sex with a living vampire that wasnt even counting the two death threats id survived or the precarious situation with trent what the hell was i doing rising i stumbled into the kitchen face cold and legs feeling like rubber looking up at the sound of running water i froze algaliarept was at the sink filling the teapot its tarnished copper beading with condensation good evening rachel he said smiling to show me flat teeth hope you dont mind me making a pot of tea we have a lot to do before the sun comes up oh god id forgotten about that twentythree damn i swore backpedaling the sanctuary if i could reach holy ground he couldnt touch me i shrieked as a heavy hand fell on my shoulder spinning i clawed at his face it went misty and i lurched when his grip vanished in an instant he had my ankle and jerked me off my feet let go i shouted when i hit the floor my voice harsh as i kicked him he spun me sliding into the fridge his long face took on a sunstarved complexion and his red goat eyes turned eager over his smoked glasses i scrambled up and he lunged grabbing me with his whitegloved hand and giving me a shake to rattle my teeth he shoved me and i landed against the center island counter like a rag doll turning i put my back against it wideeyed and heart beating fast i was so stupid i was so stupid if you run again ill call you in breach of our agreement he said calmly thats your warning please run it will make everything soooo much simpler shaking i held onto the counter for balance go away i said i didnt summon you its not that simple anymore he said it took me a day in the library but i found precedence his precise accent became even more officious and he put the back of his knuckles to his velvet green frock and quoted if said familiar is stationed at a beta site by way of loan or similar event the master may seek the familiar out to perform dutiesyou opened the door by tapping a line he added and since i have a task for you im here until you finish it i felt sick what do you want there was a spell pot on my counter full of an amber liquid smelling of geranium i hadnt counted on him bringing his work to me what do you wantmaster al prompted smiling to show me his thick blocky teeth i tucked my hair behind my ear i want you to get the hell out of my kitchen his smile never flickered as with a powerful motion he backhanded me i stifled a gasp lurching for balance adrenaline surged as he gripped my shoulder keeping me upright funny funny girl he murmured his british elegance chilling me and his beautiful chiseled looks turning harsh say it the sharp taste of blood edged my tongue my back pressed into the counter painfully what do you want oh gracious master from my ass i didnt have time to duck as the flat of his hand swung pain shocked through my cheek and i hit the floor als silverbuckled boots edged my vision he was wearing white stockings and there was lace where they met the bottom of his trousers nausea rose i touched my cheek feeling it burn and hating him i tried to rise unable to when he put a foot on my shoulder and forced me down hating him all the more i tossed my hair aside so i could see him what difference did it make what do you want master i felt like i was going to vomit his thin lips curled up in a smile tugging the lace from his sleeves he bent to solicitously help me up i refused but he yanked me up so fast that i found myself pressed against him breathing in the scent of crushed velvet and burnt amber i want this he whispered running a hand up under my sweater searching my heart raced stiffening i clenched my teeth ill kill him somehow ill kill him such a touching conversation with your roommate he said and i twitched as his voice had shifted to ivys everafter zinged through me as his appearance shifted while still touching me red goat eyes stared at me from ivys perfect face lean and tight the image of her body wrapped in leather pressed against me pinning me to the counter the last time he had bitten me oh god not again but maybe you want this instead he said with her gray silk voice and sweat started at the small of my back her long straight hair brushed my cheek the silky whisper pulling an unstoppable shiver from my skin feeling it where our bodies touched he leaned close until i recoiled dont pull away he said with her voice and my resolve grew he was slime he was a bastard id kill him for this im sorry rachel he breathed long fingers burninginto tingles where they touched tracing a line from my shoulder to my hip im not angry i understand youre afraid but the things i could teach youif you knew the heights of passion we could find his breath shuddered ivys arms were around me cool and lightgentling me to him against my will i could smell her rich scent of dark incense and ash he had her perfectly let me show you the vision of ivy whispered and i closed my eyes just a tastei know i can change your mind it was pleading heavy with her vulnerable desires it was everything she hadnt said everything she wouldnt my eyes opened as my scar flashed to life god no fire raced to my groin knees buckling i tried to push away demonred eyes shifted to a liquid brown and his grip grew firmer pulling me closer until his breath came and went on my neck gently rachel her voice whispered i could be so gentle i could be everything a man cant be everything you want just one little word rachel tell me you will i couldnti couldnt deal with this right now didnt you have something for me to do i said the sun will be up soon and i need to get to bed slowly he crooned ivys breath smelling of oranges theres only one first time let go of me i said tightly you arent ivy and im not interested ivys passionfilled black eyes narrowed but als attention was over my shoulder and i didnt think it was anything i had said he let go of me and i stumbled to catch my balance a shimmer of everafter cascaded over him melting his features back to his usual vision of a young british lord of the eighteenth century the glasses were back to hide his eyes and he adjusted them on his thinbridged nose how grand he said his accent shifting as well ceri there was the distant boom of the front door crashing open rachel came her voice high and frightened hes this side of the lines heart pounding i spun i took a breath to warn her but it was too late my outstretched hand fell as she lurched into the room her simple white dress furling about her bare feet as she stopped in the archway green eyes wide and soulful she put a hand to her chest atop ivys crucifix rachel she breathed dismay slumping her shoulders al took a step and she spun in a dancers circle toe pointed and unbound hair furling she recited an unheard poem laced with darkness and a ripple of line energy cascaded between us whitefaced and holding her arms she stared at him trembling within her small circle the stately demon beamed adjusting the lace about his collar ceri how splendid to see you i miss you love he almost purred the young womans chin trembled banish him rachel she said her fear obvious i tried to swallow failing i tapped a line he found precedence he has a task for me her eyes widened no al frowned i havent been in the library in a thousand years they were whispering behind my back ceri i had to renew my card it was most embarrassing everyone knows youre gone zoë is making my tea its the most awful tea ive ever hadhe cant hold the sugar spoon with only two digits do come back his pleasant face creased into a smile ill make it worth your soul ceri jerked chin high she said haughtily my name is ceridwen merriam dulciate a rough sound of mirth escaped him taking off his glasses he leaned an elbow against the counter mocking gaze on mine he murmured ceri be a dear and make a spot of tea my face went slack as ceri dropped her head and took a step al chuckled when she made a cry of selfdisgust and stopped at the edge of her circle tiny fists clenched she fumed old habits die hard he mocked bile bubbled up even now she was his leave her alone i snarled from nowhere a whitegloved hand struck me i spun into the counter jaw burning gasping i hunched over it with my hair falling about my face i was getting tired of this dont hit her ceri said her voice high and virulent does it bother you he said lightly pain moves her more than fear which is goodpain keeps a person alive longer than fear my hurt turned to anger eyebrows high he dared me to protest as i found my breath his goat eyes slid to the headsized vat he had brought with him lets get started shall we i looked at the pot recognizing the brew by the smell it was the one to make a person into a familiar fear chilled me and i wrapped my arms about myself im already coated with your aura i said making me take more isnt going to make a difference i didnt ask for your opinion i sprang back as he moved grinning he extended the basket that had appeared in his hand i could smell wax set the candles he ordered amused at my quick reaction rachel ceri whispered but i couldnt look at her i had promised to be his familiar and now i would be miserable my thoughts went to ivy as i set the milky green candles at the spots marked by black nail polish why couldnt i make good choices my grip on the last candle trembled it had gouges on it as if something had tried to break the circle by going through it something with big nasty claws rachel al barked and i jumped you didnt set them with their place names still holding the last candle i stared blankly past him ceri nervously licked her lips you dont know their place names al added and i shook my head not wanting to be hit again but al only sighed ill set them myself when i light them he grumbled his pale face taking on a ruddy tinge i expected more of you than this apparently youve been spending most of your time with earth magic neglecting your ley line arts im an earth witch i said why would i bother ceri jerked as al threatened to smack me again her almost translucent hair swirling let her go algaliarept you dont want her for a familiar offering to take her place he mocked and i took a fearful breath that she might no i shouted and he laughed dont fret rachel love he crooned and i flinched when he ran a gloved finger across my jawline tracing the path down my arm to my hand to take the last candle from me i keep my familiars until something better comes along and despite you being as ignorant as a frog youre capable of holding almost twice the line energy that she can he leered lucky you clapping his whitegloved hands once he spun to make his coattails furl now watch closely rachel youll be lighting my candles tomorrow these are words that move mortals and gods alike making all equal and capable of keeping my circle whole against even newt swell salax he said as he lit the first candle from the pencilthick red taper that had appeared in his gloved hand aemulatio he said as he lit the second adfictatio cupidus and my favorite inscitia he said as he lit the last one smiling the stillglowing taper vanished i felt him tap a line and with a translucent swirl of red and black his circle rose to arch closed over our heads my skin prickled from its strength and i clasped my arms about myself these are a few of my favorite things i heard patter through my mind and i stifled a hysterical giggle i was going to be a demons familiar there was no way out of it now als head jerked up at the ugly choking sound and ceris face went still algaliarept she pleaded youre pushing her too hard her will is too strong to bend easily ill break my familiars the way i see fit he said calmly a little grounding and shell be as right as rain in the desert one hand on his hip and the other cupping his chin he eyed me speculatively time for your bath love algaliarept snapped his fingers with a showmans flair his hand opened and a cedarslatted bucket appeared hanging from it my eyes widened as he threw its contents at me cold water smacked into me my breath whooshed out in an affronted yelp it was saltwater stinging my eyes and dribbling into my mouth reality washed through me clearing my head he was making sure i didnt have any potions in me to contaminate the coming spell i dont use potions you big green turd i shouted shaking my arms in my sodden sleeves see al was clearly pleased all better the slight ache of my ribs intruded as my pain charm broke most of the water was soaking my spell book library if i survived this id have to air them all out what a jerk ooooh your eye is doing nicely he said as he reached forward to touch it eating your roommates brimstone are we wait until you try the real stuff it will knock your socks off i jerked back when his gloved hand brushed my skin with the scent of lavender but als hand dropped lower to grasp my hair shrieking i swung my foot up he caught it moving faster than i could follow ceri watched in pity as i fought helpless holding my foot high he forced me against the counter his glasses had been knocked aside and he smiled at me with a domineering delight the hard way he whispered marvelous no i exclaimed as a pair of sheers suddenly glinted in his hand hold still he said dropping my foot and pinning me against the counter i wiggled and spit at him but he had me against the counter and i could do nothing i panicked as i heard metal sheering he let go by turning misty and i fell to the floor hand clutching my hair i scrambled to my feet stop it just stop it i shouted alternating my attention between his glee and the chunk he had cut from my hair damn it it was at least four inches long do you know how long it takes to grow my hair out al gave ceri a sidelong glance as the scissors disappeared and he dropped my hair into the potion shes worried about her hair my gaze shot to the red strands floating on top of als brew and as i stood there in my soggy sweater i went cold that vat of potion wasnt for al to give me more of his aura it was for me giving him mine oh hell no i exclaimed backing up im not giving you my aura al plucked a ceramic spoon from the rack hanging over the center island counter and pushed the strands of hair down he had a refined elegance in his velvet and lace every inch of him as trim and debonair as inhumanly possible is that a refusal rachel he murmured please tell me it was no i whispered there was nothing i could do nothing his smile went wider now your blood to quicken it love pulse pounding i looked from the needle between his finger and thumb to the vat if i ran i was his if i did this he could use me through the lines damn damn and double damn numbing my thoughts i took the tarnished silver needle my mouth went dry as its heavy weight filled my grip it was as long as my palm and elaborately tooled the tip was copper so the silver wouldnt interfere with the charm peering closer i felt my stomach turn there was a naked twisted body writhing around the barrel god save me i whispered hes not listening hes too busy i stiffened al had come up behind me and was whispering in my ear finish the potion rachel his breath was hot on my cheek and i couldnt move as he pulled my hair back a shudder rippled through me as he tilted his head and bent closer finish it he breathed his lips brushing my skin i could smell starch and lavender teeth gritted i gripped the needle and stabbed it into me my held breath came out and i held it again i thought i heard ceri crying three drops al whispered nuzzling my neck my head hurt blood pounding i held my finger over the vat and massaged three drops into it the scent of redwood rose briefly overpowering the cloying stench of burnt amber mmmm richer his hand wrapped around mine taking the needle back it vanished in a smear of everafter and his grip shifted to my bleeding finger give me a taste i jerked back as far from him as i could my arm stretched out between us no leave her alone ceri pleaded slowly als grip loosened he watched me a new tension rising in him i wrestled my hand away and put another step between us i clutched my arms about me cold despite the heater blowing on my bare feet get on the mirror he said his face expressionless behind his smoked glasses my gaze shot to it waiting for me on the floor ii cant i whispered his thin lips pressed together and i gritted my teeth to keep silent when he picked me up and set me on it i inhaled eyes widening when i felt like i slipped two inches into the mirror oh god oh god i moaned wanting to reach for the counter but al was in the way grinning push your aura off he said i cant i panted feeling myself hyperventilate al pulled his glasses down his thin nose and looked at me over them doesnt matter its dissolving like sugar in the rain no i whispered my knees started shaking and the pounding in my head worsened i could feel my aura slipping away and als taking a stronger hold on me capital and fine al said his goat eyes on the mirror my gaze followed his and i clutched at my stomach i could see myself in it my face was covered in als aura black and empty only my eyes showed a faint glow flickering about them it was my soul trying to make enough aura to put between als aura and me it wasnt enough as the mirror sucked it all up and i could feel als presence sink into me i found i was panting i imagined what it must have been like for ceri her soul utterly gone and als aura seeping into her like this all the time alien and wrong i shook hands clasped over my mouth i looked frantically for something to throw up in gagging i lurched off the mirror i would not spew i wouldnt marvelous al said as i hunched over my teeth clenched and my bile rising you got all of it here ill just slip it into the vat for you his voice was cheery and bright and as i peered at him from around my hair al dropped the mirror into the potion the brew flashed to clear just like i knew it would ceri was sitting on the floor crying with her head on her knees she pulled her head up and i thought she looked all the more beautiful for her tears i only looked ugly when i cried i jumped when a thick yellowed tome hit the counter beside me the light through the window was starting to brighten but the clock said it was only five almost three hours before the sun would rise to end this nightmare unless al ended it sooner read it looking down i recognized it it was the book i had found in my attic the one that ivy claimed wasnt among the ones she planted up there for me the very same one that i had given to nick to hold for me after i accidentally used it to make him my familiar and the same book that al had tricked away from us the one algaliarept wrote to make people into demon familiars shit i swallowed hard my fingers looked pale as i put them on the text running down to find the incantation it was in latin but i knew the translation some to you but all to me i whispered bound by ties made so by plea pars tibi totum mihi al said grinning vinctus vinculuis prece fractis my fingers started shaking moon made safe ancient light made sane chaos decreed taken tripped if bane luna servata lux sanata chaos statutum pejus minutum go on finish there was only one line left one line and the spell would be complete nine words and my life would be a living hell whether i was on this side of the lines or not i took a breath then another lee of mind i whispered my voice trembled and it was getting harder to breathe bearer of pain slave until the worlds are slain als grin widened and his eyes flashed black mentem tegens malum ferens he intoned semper servus dum duretmundus with an eager impatience al pulled his gloves from his hands and plunged his hands into the vat i jerked a twang reverberated through me followed by gutwrenching dizziness black and smothering the charm wrapped about my soul numbing me redknuckled hands dripping al steadied himself against the counter a shimmer of red cascaded over him and his image blurred before settling he blinked seemingly shaken i took a breath then another it was done he had my aura for goodall but what my soul was desperately trying to replace to insinuate between my being and als aura still coating me maybe in time it would get better but i doubted it good he said tugging his sleeves down and wiping his hands off on a black towel that had appeared in his grip white gloves materialized hiding his hands good and done capital ceri cried softly but i was too drained to even look at her my cell phone chirped from my bag on the far counter sounding absurd the last of als fleeting disquiet vanished oh do let me answer he said breaking the circle as he went to get it i shuddered as i felt a slight pull from my empty center as the energy went back through al and into the line it originated from als eyebrows were high in delight when he turned with my cell phone in his gloved hand i wonder who it is he simpered unable to stand any longer i slipped to the floor my back to the counter as i hugged my knees the vent air was warm on my bare feet but my damp jeans soaked up the cold i was als familiar why was i even bothering to keep the air moving in and out of my lungs thats why they take your soul ceri whispered you cant kill yourself if they have your will i stared only now understanding helloooo al purred leaning against the sink the pink cylinder looking odd against his old world charm nicholas gregory sparagmos what a delight my head came up nick i breathed al held a long hand over the receiver and simpered its your boyfriend ill field it for you you look tired wrinkling his nose he turned to the phone feel that did you he said cheerfully something missing now is there be careful what you wish for little wizard wheres rachel came nicks voice thin and tinny he sounded panicked and my heart sank i reached out knowing al wouldnt give the phone to me why shes at my feet al said grinning mine all mine she made a mistake and now shes mine send her flowers for her grave its all you can do the demon listened for a moment emotions flickering over him oh dont be making promises you cant keep it is soooo lower class as it happens im not in need of a familiar anymore so i wont be responding to your little summons dont call me she saved your soul little man too bad you never told her how much you loved her humans are so stupid he broke the connection with nick in midprotest snapping the phone closed he dropped it back in my bag it started ringing immediately and he tapped it once my phone played its obnoxious goodbye song and shut off now al clapped his hands where were we ah yes ill be right back i want to see it work red eyes glowing in delight he vanished with a small shift of air rachel ceri cried she fell into me dragging me out of the broken circle i pushed at her too depressed to try to get away it was coming al was going to fill me with his force making me feel his thoughts turning me into a coppertop battery that could make his tea and do his dishes the first of my helpless tears dribbled out but i couldnt find the will to hate myself for them i knew i should be crying i had gambled my life to put piscary away and lost rachel please ceri pleaded her grip on my arm hurting as she tried to drag me my damp feet made a squeaking noise and i pushed at her trying to get her to stop a red bubble of everafter popped into existence where al had pinged out the air pressure violently shifted and both ceri and i clasped our hands to our ears damn it all to heaven and back al swore his velvet green frock open and in disarray his hair was wild and his glasses were gone you did everything right he shouted gesturing violently ive got your aura youve got mine why cant i reach you through the lines ceri knelt behind me her arm protectively about me it didnt work she quavered pulling me back a little more her wet finger traced a quick circle about us do i look like it worked he exclaimed do i look happy to you no she breathed and her circle expanded about us blacksmeared but strong rachel she said giving me a squeeze youre going to be okay al went still deathly quiet he turned his boots making a soft sound against the flooring no she isnt my eyes widened at his frustrated anger oh god not again i stiffened as he tapped a line and sent it crashing into me with it came a whisper of his emotion satisfied and anticipatory fire coursed through me and i screamed pushing ceri away her bubble burst in a glittering sensation of hot needles adding to my agony curled into a fetal position i frantically thought the word tulpa slumping in relief as the torrent coursed through me and settled in the sphere in my head panting i slowly pulled my head up als confusion and frustration filled me my anger grew until it overshadowed his emotions als thoughts in mine shifted to stark surprise vision blurring as what i was seeing conflicted with what my brain said was true i stumbled to my feet most of the candles were out knocked over to make puddles of wax and scenting the air with smoke al felt my defiance through our link and his face turned ugly when my pride for having learned to store energy seeped into him ceri he threatened his goat eyes narrowing it didnt work i said my voice low as i watched him from around my stringy wet hair get out of my kitchen im going to have you morgan al snarled if i cant take you by right ill by god beat you into submission and pull you in broken and bleeding oh yeah i came back with i glanced at the pot that had held my aura his eyes widened in surprise as he knew my thought the instant i had it the bond now went both ways he had made a mistake get out of my kitchen i exclaimed dumping the line energy he had forced me to hold back through our familiar link and into him i jerked upright as it all flowed from me and into him leaving me empty al stumbled backward shocked you canicula he cried his image blurring staggering to remain upright he tapped the line adding more force eyes narrowing i set my thoughts to loop it right back at him whatever he was going to send into me was going to end up right back in him al choked as he sensed what i was going to do there was a sudden wrench in my gut and i stumbled catching myself against the table as he broke the live connection between us i stared at him across the kitchen breath rough this was going to be settled right here and now one of us was going to lose and it wasnt going to be me not in my kitchen not tonight al put one foot behind him taking a deceptively relaxed stance he ran a hand over his hair smoothing it his round smoked glasses appeared and he buttoned his frock this isnt working he said flatly no i rasped it isnt safe in her circle ceri snickered you cant have her algaliarept you big stupid she mocked making me wonder at her word choice you made the familiar gate swing both ways when you forced her to give you her aura youre her familiar as much as she is yours als momentary placid face blossomed into anger ive used this spell a thousand times to milk auras and this has never happened before and i am not her familiar i watched feeling tense and ill as a threelegged stool appeared behind al it looked like something attila the hun would have used with a red velvet cushion and horsehair fringe going to the floor not bothering to see if it was behind him he sat his expression puzzled thats why nick called i said and al gave me a patronizing look when he took my aura it broke the bond i had with nick he had felt it aw crap al was my familiar ceri gestured that i should join her in her circle but i couldnt chance that al might hurt her in the instant it would take to reform it al though was preoccupied with his own thoughts this isnt right he mumbled ive done this before with hundreds of witches with souls and its never forged a bond this strong whats so different about my stomach dropped as all visible emotion drained from him he glanced at the clock above the sink then me come here little witch no he pressed his lips together and stood gasping i backpedaled but he had my wrist and pulled me to the island counter youve done this spell before he said as he squeezed my pricked finger making it bleed again when you made nicholas gregory sparagmos your familiar it was your blood in the brew little witch that invoked it you know it was i was too drained to be frightened anymore you were there i couldnt see his eyes but my reflection in his glasses looked ugly and pale with wet stringy hair and it worked he said thoughtfully it didnt just bind you it bound you tight enough for you to draw a line through him thats why he left i said surprised i could still feel the pain your blood kindled the spell fully speculation wasthick in his goat eyes as he looked at me from over his glasses he drew my hand up and though i tried to wiggle free of him he licked the blood from my finger with a cold tingling sensation so subtly scented he breathed his eyes never leaving mine like perfumed air your lover has walked through let go i said pushing at him you should be dead he said his voice full of wonder how is it that youre still alive jaw clenched i worked at his grip on me trying to get my fingers between him and my wrist i work hard at it with a gasp i fell back as he released his hold you work hard at it smiling he took a step back and gave me a onceover the mad have a grace all their own i must go start a study group frightened i hunched over my wrist and held it and i will have the likes of you as my own rachel mariana morgan count on it im not going into the everafter i said tightly youll have to kill me first you dont have a choice he intoned chilling me you tap a line when the sun is down and ill find you you cant make the circle that can keep me out if you arent on holy ground ill beat you silly and drag you into the everafter and from there you will not escape try it i threatened reaching behind me to find the meattenderizing hammer hanging on the overhead rack you cant touch me unless you go solid and its going to hurt red man brow furrowed in concern al hesitated the thought flitted through me that it must be like swatting at a wasp timing is everything ceri was wearing a smile i didnt understand algaliarept she said softly you made a mistake she found a loophole in your contract and now youll accept it and leave rachel mariana morgan alone if you dont im going to start a school on holding line energy the demons face went blank ah ceri wait a moment love hammer in hand i backed up until her bubble was cold at my back her hand reached out and i jumped when she pulled me in her circle flashing up almost before i knew it had fallen my shoulders eased at the shimmer of black between us and al there was only the faintest glimmer of pale blue from her damaged aura visible through the smutal had left on her i patted her hand as she gave me a relieved sideways hug is that a problem i asked not understanding why al was so upset ceri was positively smug i escaped him knowing how hell get in trouble for it big trouble im surprised he hasnt been called up on it yet but then no one knows she turned her mocking green eyes on al yet i felt an odd stab of alarm as i took in the savage satisfaction on her she had known this all along simply waiting until the information could best be used the woman was more contriving than trent and she didnt seem to have a problem gambling with peoples lives either mine included thank god she was on my side she was wasnt she al raised a protesting hand ceri we can talk about this in a week she said confidently there wont be a ley line witch in cincinnati that wont know how to be their own familiar in a year the world will be closed to you and your kind and you will have to answer for it is it that big of a deal i asked as al adjusted his glasses and shifted from foot to foot it was cold away from the vent and i shivered in my damp clothes its harder to lull a person into foolish choices if they can fight back ceri said if it gets out their pool of potential familiars will be weak and undesirable in a matter of years my mouth dropped open oh im listening al said sitting with an uncomfortable stiffness hope so strong it was almost painful raced through me take your demon mark off me break the familiar bond agree to leave me alone and i wont tell al snorted not shy about asking for things are you ceri gave my arm a warning squeeze and let go let me do this ive written most of his nonverbal contracts the last seven hundred years can i speak for you i looked at her her eyes alight and savage with her need for revenge slowly i set the hammer down sure i said wondering just what exactly i had saved from the everafter she pulled herself straighter an official air falling over her i propose that al will take his mark off you and break the familiar bonds between you both in return for your solemn vow to not teach anyone how to hold line energy furthermore you and your kin by blood or the laws of man shall remain free of reprisal from the demon known as algaliarept and his agents in this world or the everafter from now until the two worlds collide i tried to find enough spit to swallow failing i never would have thought of that no al said firmly thats three things to my one and ill not lose my hold on the likes of her completely i want a way to recoup my loss and if she crosses the lines i dont care what agreement we have shes mine can we force him i said softly i mean we do have him over a barrel al chuckled i could call newt in to arbitrate if you like ceri went pale no taking a steadying breath she looked at me her confidence cracked but not shattered what of the three can you bear to keep i thought of my mother and my brother robbie nick i want him to break the familiar bonds i said and i want him to leave me and my kin by blood or law alone ill keep the demon mark and settle up later algaliarept brought his foot up and propped his ankle atop a bent knee clever clever witch he agreed if she breaks her word she forfeits her soul ceris eyes went serious rachel if you teach anyone how to hold line energy your soul belongs to algaliarept he can pull you into the everafter at his will and you are his do you understand i nodded believing for the first time that i might see the sunrise again what happens if he breaks his word if he harms you or your kinby his own volitionnewt will put algaliarept in a bottle and you have a genie its standard boilerplate but im glad you asked my eyes widened i looked from al to her no shit she smiled at me her hair floating as she tucked it behind an ear no shit al harrumphed and we jerked our attentions back to him what about you he said clearly annoyed what do you want for keeping your mouth shut the satisfaction of getting something back from her former captor and tormentor was in ceris eyes you will take back the stain on my soul that i took in your stead and you will not seek reprisal against me or my kin in body or law from now until the two worlds collide im not taking back a thousand years of curse imbalance al said indignantly thats why you were my damn familiar he put both feet on the floor and leaned forward but i wont have it said im not agreeable you keep the smut but ill let you teach one person how to hold line energy a smile contriving and satisfied filled his unholy eyes one child a girl child your daughter and if she tells anyone her soul is forfeit to me immediately ceri paled and i didnt understand she can tell one of her daughters and so on she countered and al smiled done he stood the glow of everafter energy hovered about him like a shadow lacing his fingers together he cracked his knuckles oh this is grand this is good i looked at ceri in wonder i thought hed be upset i said softly she shook her head clearly worried he still has a hold on you and hes counting on one of my kin to forget the seriousness of the arrangement and make a mistake the familiar bonds i insisted glancing at the dark window he breaks them now the time of dissolution was never stated al said he was touching the things he had brought into my kitchen making them disappear in a smear of everafter ceri drew herself up it was tacitly implied break your hold algaliarept he looked over his glasses at her smiling when he put a hand before and behind him and made a mocking bow it is a small thing ceridwen merriam dulciate but you cant think less of me for trying humming he adjusted his frock a bowl cluttered with bottles and silver implements appeared on the island counter there was a book atop it all small with a handwritten title the script elegant and looping why is he so happy i whispered ceri shook her head the tips of her hair moving after her head stopped ive only seen him like this when he discovers a secret im sorry rachel you know something that makes him very happy swell holding the book at reading height he rifled through it a scholarly air about him i can break a familiar bond as easy as snapping your neck you though will have to do it the hard way im not going to waste a stored curse on you and since ill not have you knowing how to break familiar bonds we will add a little something here it is lilac wine itstarts with lilac wine his eyes met mine over the book for you a flash of cold went through me as he beckoned me out of the circle a small smoky purple bottle appearing behind his long fingers i took a quick breath youll break the bonds and leave i said nothing extra rachel mariana morgan he admonished do you think so little of me i glanced at ceri and she nodded for me to go trusting her not al i stepped forward she broke the circle as i did setting it in place immediately behind me he uncorked the bottle pouring out a glimmering drop of amethyst into a tiny cut crystal cup the size of my thumb putting a gloved finger to his thin lips he extending it grimacing i took it my heart pounded i had no choice coming close with an eagerness i didnt trust he showed me the open book it was in latin and he pointed at a handwritten set of instructions see this word he said i took a breath umb not yet al shouted making me start heart pounding not until the wine coats your tongue stupid my god you think youd never twisted a curse before im not a ley line witch i exclaimed my voice harsher than it probably should be als eyebrows rose you could be his eyes went to the glass in my grip drink it i glanced at ceri at her encouragement i let the tiny amount pass my lips it was sweet making my tongue tingle i could feel it seeping into me relaxing my muscles al tapped the book and i looked down umbra i said holding the drop on my tongue the wild sweetness went sour auck i said leaning forward to spit it out swallow al warned softly and i started when he clamped a hand under my chin and tilted my head back so i couldnt open my mouth eyes tearing i swallowed my pounding heart echoed in my ears al leaned closer his eyes going black as he loosened his grip on me and my head drooped my muscles went loose and watery and when he let go of me i fell to the floor he didnt even try to catch me and i landed in a pained crumple my head hit the floor and i took a quick breath closing my eyes i gathered myself wedging my palms under me and sitting up thanks a hell of a lot for the warning i said angrily looking up and not finding him confused i stood to find ceri sitting at the table with her head in her hands and her bare feet tucked under her the fluorescent light was off and a single white candle sent a soft glow into the gloom of a cloudy dawn i stared at the window the sun was up i must have passed out where is he i breathed blanching when i saw it was almost eight she pulled her head up shocking me with how weary she seemed you dont remember my stomach rumbled and there was an uneasy lightness to it no hes gone she turned to face me squarely he took back his aura you took back yours you broke the bond with him you cried and called him a son of a bitch and told him to leave he didafter he struck you so hard you lost consciousness i felt my jaw then the back of my head it felt about the same really really bad i was damp and cold and i got up clasping my arms around me okay i felt my ribs deciding nothing was broken anything else i ought to know you drank an entire carafe of coffee in about twenty minutes that might explain the shakes it had to be that outsmarting demons was becoming old hat i sat beside ceri exhaling in a long breath ivy would be home soon you like lasagna a smile blossomed over her oh yes please twentyfour my sneakers were silent on the flat carpet of trents back hallways both quen and jonathan were with me leaving me trying to decide if they were escort or prison guard we had already woven through the sundaysilent public areas of his offices and conference rooms that trent hid his illegal activities behind publicly trent controlled a good portion of the transportation that ran through cincinnati coming in from all directions and leaving the same railways roadways and even a small municipal airport privately trent ran a good deal more using those same transportation systems to get his illegal genetic products out and expanding his brimstone distribution that saladan was cutting into his business in his hometown probably cheesed the man off to no end it was a finger in the air if anything was and tonight ought to be an education as trent either broke that finger off and jammed it into one of saladans convenient orifices or took a hit i didnt like trent but id keep him alive if it was the latter though i dont know why i thought as i followed quen it was barren down here lacking even the institutional holiday decorations that graced the front the man was slime he had hunted me down like an animal the time he caught me stealing evidence from his secondary office and my face warmed when i realized we were in the hallway that led to that very room a half step ahead of me quen was tense dressed in his vaguely uniformlike black body stocking he had a snug black and green jacket on over it today making him look like scotty might beam him up at any moment my hair brushed my neck and i purposely shifted my head to feel the tips tickle my shoulders i had gotten it cut that afternoon to match the chunk al had taken out and the cream rinse the stylist had used wasnt doing much to tame it my garment bag with the outfit kisten had picked out for me was over my shoulder back from the cleaners i had even remembered the jewelry and boots i wasnt going to put them on until i knew i was taking this run i suspected trent might have other ideasand my jeans and sweatshirt with the howlers logo looked out of place beside jonathans tailored elegance the distasteful man hung an irritating three steps behind us he had met us at the steps of trents main building and remained a silent accusing professionally cold presence since the man was sixten if he was a foot his features pointy and sharp an aristocratic hawklike nose gave him an air of smelling something offensive his eyes were a cold blue and his carefully styled black hair was graying i hated him and i was trying really hard to overlook that he had tormented me when i was a mink trapped in trents office for three unreal days warming at the memory i took off my coat as we walked struggling as neither man offered to take my garment bag there was a definite moistness to the air the farther back we went faint to the point of being almost subliminal was the sound of running water piped in from who knew where my steps slowed when i recognized the doorway to trents secondary office behind me jonathan stopped quen continued without pause and i hurried to catch up jonathan clearly wasnt pleased where are you taking her he asked belligerently quens steps grew stiff to trenton he never turned around or changed his pace quen jonathans voice was thick in warning i glanced mockingly back pleased to see his long wrinkled face showing worry rather than his perpetual stuckup sneer brow furrowed jonathan hastened forward as we halted before the arched wooden door at the end of the hall the overly tall man pushed in front placing a hand atop the heavy metal latch as quen reached for it you arent taking her in there jonathan warned i shifted my garment bag in a sound of sliding nylon my eyes going from one to the other as the political currents passed between them whatever was behind the door was good the smaller more dangerous man narrowed his eyes and the pox scars went white in his suddenly red face she is going to keep him alive tonight he said im not going to make her change and wait for him in a secondary office like a paid whore jonathans blue eyes went even more determined my pulse quickened and i stepped out from between them move quen intoned his surprisingly deep voice resonating through me flustered jonathan stepped back quen pulled it open the muscles in his back tensing thank you he said insincerely as the door swung out slow with inertia my lips parted the door was a freaking six inches thick the sound of running water chattered out accompanied by the scent of wet snow it wasnt cold though and i peered past quens narrow shoulders to see a soft mottled carpet and a wall paneled in a dark wood that had been oiled and rubbed until it glistened with golden depths this i thought as i followed quen in had to be trents private quarters the short hallway immediately expanded into a secondstory walkway my feet stopped as i looked out over the large room below us it was impressive maybe feet long half as much wide and twenty feet tall we had come out on the second floor which hugged the ceiling below amid the rich carpet and woods were casually placed seat ing arrangements of couches chairs and coffee tables everything was in soft earth tones accented with maroon and black a fireplace the size of a fire truck took up one wall but what drew my attention was the floortoceiling window that stretched the entirety of the wall across from me letting in the dusky light of early evening quen touched my elbow and i started down the wide carpeted stairs i kept one hand on the banister since i couldnt look away from the window fascinated window not windows as it seemed to be one plate of glass i didnt think glass that large was structurally sound but there it was looking as if it was only a few millimeters thick with no distortion it was as if nothing was there its not plastic quen said softly his green eyes on the view its ley line energy my eyes jerked to his reading the truth in his eyes seeing my wonder a faint smile edged his turnscarred features its everyones first question he said showing how he knew where my thoughts had been sound and air are the only things to pass through it must have cost a fortune i said wondering how they got the usual red haze of everafter out of it beyond it was a stunning vista of trents private snowslumped gardens a crag of stone rose almost as high as the roof a waterfall cascading over it to leave thickening bands of ice to glint in the last of the days light the water pooled into a naturallooking basin that i would have bet wasnt turning into a stream that meandered through the wellestablished evergreens and shrubs until it vanished a deck gray with age and swept clear of snow stretched between the window and the landscaping as i slowly descended to the lower level i decided the round disk of cedar flush with the deck and leaking steam was probably a hot tub nearby was a sunken area with seating for backyard parties i had always thought ivys grill with its gleaming chrome and huge burners was over the top but whatever trent had was probably obscene my feet found the first floor and my gaze dropped to my feet as it suddenly seemed i was walking on loam instead of carpet nice i breathed and quen indicated that i should wait at the nearest gathering of chairs ill tell him the security officer said he shot jonathan what i thought was a warning look before he retraced his steps to the second floor to vanish into an unseen area of the house i laid my coat and garment bag on a leather couch and made a slow spin on my heel now that i was downstairs the fireplace looked even bigger it wasnt lit and i thought i could probably stand up in the hearth without stooping at the opposite end of the room was a low stage with builtin amps and a light display a nicesized dance floor spread before it surrounded by cocktail tables hidden and cozy under the shelter of the secondstory overhang was a long bar the welloiled wood and chrome gleaming there were more tables here bigger and lower huge planters full of dark green foliage that could flourish in the dimmer light surrounded them to give a measure of privacy that the large open floor plan lacked the noise from the waterfall had quickly retreated into an unnoticed background babble and the stillness of the room soaked into me there were no attendants no one moving through the room on other business not even one holiday candle or dish of sweets it was as if the room was caught under a storybook spell waiting to be woken i didnt think the room had been used for what it was designed for since trents father died eleven years was a long time to be silent feeling peace in the quiet of the room i took a slow breath and turned to find jonathan eyeing me with obvious distaste the faint tension in his jaw sent my eyes to where quen had vanished a faint smile quirked the corner of my mouth trent doesnt know you two cooked this up does he i said he thinks quen is going with him tonight jonathan said nothing the twitch in his eye telling me i was right smirking i dropped my shoulder bag to the floor beside the couch i bet trent could throw a hell of a party i prompted hoping for something jonathan was silent and i wove past a low coffee table to stand with my hands on my hips to look out the window my breath made the sheet of everafter ripple unable to resist i touched it gasping i jerked my hand back an odd drawing sensation pulled through me and i clutched my hand within the other as if id been burned it was cold the sheet of energy was so cold that it burned i looked behind me to jonathan expecting to see him smirking but he was staring at the window his long face slack in surprise my gaze followed his my stomach tightening as i realized the window wasnt clear anymore but swirling with amber shades of gold damn it had taken on the color of my aura clearly jonathan hadnt expected this my hand ran through my short hair ahoops what did you do to the window he exclaimed nothing i took a guilty step back i just touched it thats all sorry jonathans hawklike features took on more ugliness steps long and jerky he strode to me you hack look what you did to the window i will not allow quen to entrust mr kalamacks safety to you tonight my face warmed and finding an easy outlet for my embarrassment i let it turn to anger this wasnt my idea i snapped and i said i was sorry about the window you should be lucky im not suing for pain and suffering jonathan took a loud breath if he comes to any harm because of you ill anger flashed through me fed by the memory of three days in hell as he tormented me shut up i hissed ticked that he was taller than me i stepped up onto a nearby coffee table im not in a cage anymore i said keeping enough presence of mind not to poke him in the chest with a finger his face went startled then cloric the only thing between your head and my foot becoming real close and personal right now is my questionable professionalism and if you ever threaten me again ill slam you halfway across the room before you can say numbertwo pencil got it you tall freak of nature frustrated he clenched his long thin hands tight go ahead elfboy i seethed feeling the line energy i had spindled in my head earlier almost spill over to fill my body give me a reason the sound of a closing door jerked our attentions to the secondstory walkway jonathan visibly hid his anger and took a step back suddenly i felt really stupid on top of the table trent came to a startled halt above us in a dress shirt and pants blinking rachel morgan he said softly to quen standing beside and a little behind him no this isnt acceptable trying to scrape something from the situation i threw one hand extravagantly into the air putting the other on my hip i posed like a prop girl showing off a new car tada i said brightly very conscious of my jeans sweatshirt and the new haircut i wasnt particularly fond of hi trent im your babysitter tonight where do your folks hide the good booze trents brow furrowed i dont want her there put on your suit we leave in an hour no sahan trent had turned to walk away but he jerked to a stop can i speak to you for a moment he said softly yes sahan the smaller man murmured deferentially not moving i hopped off the table did i know how to make a good first impression or what trent frowned his attention going from an unrepentant quen to jonathans nervous stance youre both in on this he said jonathan laced his hands behind his back subtly shifting himself another step from me i trust quens judgment sahan he said his low voice rising clear in the empty room i do not however trust ms morgans affronted i huffed at him go suck on a dandelion jon the mans lips twitched i knew he hated the shortened name trent too wasnt happy glancing at quen he started down the stairway with a fast even pace half dressed in his dark designer suit and looking like a cover model for gq his wispy blond hair had been slicked back and his shirt pulled slightly across his shoulders as he descended to the lower floor the spring in his step and the glint in his eye told me more clearly than anything that elves were at their best the four hours around sunup and sundown a deep green tie was draped casually across the back of his neck not yet fastened into place god help me but he looked good everything anything of the female persuasion could ever want young handsome powerful confident i wasnt pleased that i liked the way he looked but there it was question high in his expression trent shook his sleeves down and buttoned the cuffs with a preoccupied quickness as he came down the stairs the top two buttons of his shirt were undone making an intriguing sight his head came up as he reached the lower landing and he paused for a heartbeat when he saw the window what happened to the ward he questioned ms morgan touched it jonathan had the smug glee of a sixyearold tattling on his older sibling id advise against quens plans morgan is unpredictable and dangerous quen shot him a dark look that trent missed since the man was buttoning the top of his shirt lights full trent said and i squinted when huge lights in the ceiling flickered on one by one to make it bright as day my stomach clenched as i looked at the window crap i had broken it but good even my streaks of red were in it and i didnt like that the three of them would know i had that much tragedy in my past but at least als black was gone thank god trent came closer his smooth face unreadable the clean smell of aftershave drifted from him as he stopped it did this when you touched it he asked his gaze going from my new haircut to the window i uh yeah quen said it was a sheet of everafter i thought it was a modified protection circle quen ducked his head and stepped closer its not a protection circle its a ward your aura and the aura of the person who set it up must resonate to a similar frequency his young features creased in worry trent squinted at it an unshared thought passed through him and his fingers twitched i eyed the tell knowing he thought it more than odd and significant it was a notion that solidified when trent glanced at quen and something of a security nature passed between them quen made a small shrug and trent took a slow breath have someone from maintenance look at it trent said tugging at his collar he added loudly lights revert i froze when the glare vanished and my eyes tried to adjust i dont agree with this trent said in the soothing dimness and jonathan smiled yes sahan quen said softly but you will take morgan or you will not be going well well well i thought as the rims of trents ears went red i hadnt known quen had the authority to tell trent what to do clearly though it was a right seldom invoked and never without consequences beside me jonathan looked positively ill quen trent started the security officer took a firm stance looking over trents shoulder at nothing with his hands laced behind his back my vampire bite makes me unreliable sahan he said and i winced at his obvious pain of openly admitting it im no longer sure of my effectiveness damn it quen trent exclaimed morgan has been bitten too what makes her any more sure than you ms morgan has been living with a vampire for seven months and hasnt succumbed quen said stiffly she has developed a series of defensive strategies for combating a vamp trying to bespell her i havent yet and so im no longer reliable in questionable situations his scarred face was tight with shame and i wished trent would shut up and just go with it this confession was killing quen sahan he said evenly morgan can protect you i cannot dont ask me to do this i fidgeted wishing i was somewhere else jonathan glared at me as if it were my fault trents face was pained and worried and quen flinched when he put a comforting hand upon his shoulder with a reluctant slowness trent let his hand fall away get her a corsage and see if theres something suitable for her to wear in the green suite she looks about the same size the flash of relief that crossed quen was replaced by a deeper selfdoubt that looked wrong and worrisome quen appeared broken and i wondered what he was going to do if he felt he couldnt protect trent anymore yes sahan he murmured thank you trents gaze fell on me i couldnt tell what he was thinking and i felt cold and uneasy the feeling strengthened when trent nodded once to quen and said do you have a moment of course sahan the two of them headed into one of the unseen downstairs rooms to leave me with jonathan the unhappy man gave me a look rife with disgust leave your dress here he said follow me i have my own outfit thanks i said picking up my shoulder bag coat and my garment bag from where i had left them and following him to the stairs at the foot of the stairs jonathan turned his cold eyes traveled over me and my garment bag and he sniffed patronizingly its a nice outfit i said warming when he snickered he took the steps quickly forcing me to scramble to keep up you can look like a whore if you like he said but mr kalamack has a reputation he eyed me over his shoulder as he reached the top hurry up you dont have much time to get presentable seething i took two steps for every one of his as he cut a sharp right into a large common room holding a comfortable more normalsized living room there was an efficiency at the back and what looked like a breakfast nook one of trents liveshot video feeds showed a second view of the dim garden several heavylooking doors opened up onto the area and i was guessing this was where trent did his normal living i became sure of it when jonathan opened the first one to show a small sitting room opening onto an extravagant bedroom it was decorated entirely in shades of green and gold managing to look wealthy without dipping into gaudy another fake window past the bed showed the forest dusky and gray with twilight i assumed that the other doors led to other such suites of rooms all the wealth and privilege couldnt hide that the entire area was set up to be very defensible there probably wasnt a real window in the place other than the one downstairs covered in ley line energy not that way jonathan all but barked as i took a step to the bedroom thats the bedroom stay out of it the changing room is over here sorry i said sarcastically then hitched my garment bag higher atop my shoulder and followed him into a bathroom at least i thought it was a bathroom there were so many plants it was hard to tell and it was the size of my kitchen the multitude of mirrors reflected the lights that jonathan flicked on until i was squinting the glare seemed to bother him too since he worked the bank of switches until the multitude of bulbs reduced to one over the commode and one over the single sink and expansive counter my shoulders eased in the dimmer light this way jonathan said as he passed through an open archway i followed stopping short just inside i suppose it was a closet as there were clothes in itexpensivelooking womens clothesbut the room was huge a ricepaper screen took up one corner with a vanity against the back of it a small table with two chairs was tucked to the right of the door to the left was a trifold mirror all it needed was a wet bar damn i was so in the wrong line of work you can change here jonathan said through his nose try not to touch anything ticked i dropped my coat on a chair and hung my garment bag on a convenient hook shoulders tight i unzipped the bag and turned knowing jonathan was judging me but my eyebrows rose at his surprised look while he took in the outfit kisten had put together for me then his expression returned to its usual ice you arent wearing that he said flatly shove it up your ass jon i snapped movements stilted he strode to a set of sliding mirror doors opening them to pull out a black dress as if he knew exactly where it was you will wear this he said thrusting it at me im not wearing that i tried to make my voice cold but the dress was exquisite made of a soft fabric cut low down the back and flatteringly high in the front and around the neck it would fall to my ankles to make me look tall and elegant swallowing back my envy i said its cut too low in back to hide my splat gun and its too tight to run in thats a lousy dress his extended arm dropped and it was all i could do to keep from wincing when the beautiful fabric puddled on the carpet you pick one out then maybe i will i stepped hesitantly to the closet the evening dresses are in that one jonathan said sounding patronizing duh i mocked but my eyes widened and my hand went out to touch god help me they were all beautiful each having an understated elegance they were organized by color and matching shoes and purses were carefully arranged underneath some had hats in the rack above them my shoulders slumped when i touched a flaming red dress but jonathans whispered whore encouraged me to keep moving my eyes left it reluctantly so jon i said as he watched me shuffle through the dresses either trent is a crossdresser or he enjoys bringing size eight tall women to his house wearing evening gowns and sending them home in rags i eyed him or does he just knock them up and knock them off jonathans jaw clenched and his face flushed these are for miss ellasbeth ellasbeth my hands fell from a purple dress that would cost me a month of runs trent had a girlfriend oh hell no im not wearing another womans dress without asking he snickered his long face taking on a hint of annoyance they belong to mr kalamack if he says you can wear them you can not fully reassured i turned back to my search but all my apprehensions vanished when my hands touched a soft filmy gray oh look at this i breathed pulling the top and skirt from the closet and holding them triumphantly up as if he gave a flying flip jonathan looked from the cabinet of scarves belts and purses he had just opened i thought we threw that out he said and i made a face knowing he was trying to make me feel like it was ugly it wasnt the tight bustier and matching skirt were elegant the fabric soft to the touch and thick enough for winter without being binding it was a shimmering black once i got it into the light the skirt went to the floor but was split in a multitude of narrow bands from the knees so it would flutter about my ankles and with the slits that high my splat gun in its thigh holster would be an easy reach it was perfect is it suitable i asked as i took it to the hanger and hung it over my outfit i looked up when he was silent finding his face twisted it will do he raised his watchband to his wrist pushing a button and speaking into the spiffykeen communicator i remembered was there make the corsage black and gold he muttered glancing at the door he added to me ill get the matching jewelry from the safe i have my own jewelry i said then hesitated not wanting to see what my imitation stuff would look like against fabric such as this but okay i amended unable to meet his eyes jonathan harrumphed ill send someone to do your makeup he added as he walked out that was downright insulting i can touch up my own makeup thank you i said loudly after him i was wearing mundane makeup atop the complexion spell that hid the remnants of my still healing black eye and i didnt want anyone to touch it then i only have to get the stylist to do something with your hair came echoing back my hair is fine i shouted i looked in one of the mirrors touching the loose curls starting to frizz its fine i added softer i just had it done but all that i heard was jonathans sniggering laughter and the sound of a door opening im not going to leave her alone in ellasbeths room came quens gravely voice in answer to jonathans mutter shed kill her my eyebrows rose did he mean i would kill ellasbeth or ellasbeth would kill me that kind of detail was important i turned when quens silhouette took up the doorway to the bathroom you babysitting me i said as i grabbed my slip and nylons and took the black dress behind the screen miss ellasbeth isnt aware youre on the grounds he said i didnt think it necessary to tell her as shes returning home but shes been known to change her plans without notice i eyed the rice paper between quen and me then kicked off my sneakers feeling vulnerable and short i shimmied out of my clothes folding them instead of letting them sit in a crumpled heap as i usually did youre really big on that needtoknow kick arent you i said and i heard him speak softly to someone who had just come in what is it you arent telling me the second unseen person left nothing quen said shortly yeah right the dress was lined in silk and i stifled a moan as it eased over me i looked down at the hem deciding that it would fall right when i put my boots on brow pinching i hesitated my boots werent going to work id have to hope ellasbeth was a size eight shoe and that tonights butt kicking could be accomplished in heels the bustier gave me a smidgen of trouble and i finally gave up trying to zip it the last inch i gave myself one last look tucking my complexion amulet between me and my waistband splat gun in my thigh holster i came round the screen zip me up honey i said lightly earning what i thought was a seldomgiven smile from quen he nodded and i showed him my back thanks i said when he finished he turned to the table and chairs stooping to pick up a corsage that hadnt been there when i went behind the screen it was a black orchid bound with a gold and green ribbon straightening he took the pin from it hesitating as he looked at the narrow strap right off i knew his dilemma and i wasnt going to help him a bit quens scarred face pinched eyes on my dress his lips pressed together excuse me he said reaching forward i froze knowing he wouldnt touch me unless he had to there was enough fabric to attach it but he would have to put his fingers between that pin and me i exhaled collapsing my lungs to give him a smidgen more room thank you he said softly the back of his hand was cold and i stifled a shiver trying not to fidget i sent my attention to the ceiling a faint smile crossed me growing as he got the orchid fastened and stepped away with an exhalation of relief something funny morgan he said sourly i dropped my head watching him from around my drooping bangs not really you reminded me of my dadfor a minute there quen adopted a look both disbelieving and questioning shaking my head i grabbed my shoulder bag from the table and went to sit at the vanity against the screen see we had this big seventhgrade dance and i had a strapless dress i said as i brought out my makeup my dad wouldnt let my date pin the flower on so he did it himself my focus blurred and i crossed my legs he missed my prom quen remained standing i couldnt help but notice he had put himself where he could see me and the door both your father was a good man hed be proud of you tonight quick and painful my breath caught slowly i let it out my hands resuming their primping i really wasnt surprised quen had known himthey were the same agebut it hurt nonetheless you knew him i couldnt stop myself from asking the look he gave me through the mirror was unreadable he died well died well god what was it with these people angry i turned in my seat to see him directly he died in a cruddy little hospital room with dirt in the corners i said tightly he was supposed to stay alive damn it my voice was even but i knew it wouldnt stay that way he was supposed to be there when i got my first job then lost it three days later after i slugged the bosss son when he tried to feel me up he was supposed to be there when i graduated from high school and then college he was supposed to be there to scare my dates into behaving so i wouldnt have to find my own way home from wherever the prick dumped me when he found id fight back but he wasnt was he no he died doing something with trents father and no one has the balls to tell me what great thing it was that was worth screwing up my life for my heart pounded and i stared at quens quiet poxscarred face youve had to be your own keeper for a long time he said yeah lips pressed tight i turned back to the mirror my foot bobbing up and down what doesnt kill you hurts i watched his reflection it hurts it hurts a lot my black eye throbbed under my higher blood pressure and i reached to touch it im strong enough i said bitterly i dont want to be any stronger piscary is a bastard and if he gets out of prison hes going to die twice i thought of skimmer hoping she was as bad a lawyer as she was good a friend to ivy quens feet shifted but he didnt move piscary the question in his voice brought my gaze up he said he killed my dad did he lie to me need to know did i finally need to know according to quen yes and no the elfs eyes flicked to the doorway i spun in the chair he could tell me i think he wanted to well which is it quen ducked his head and took a symbolic step back its not my place heart pounding i stood my hands clenched into fists what happened i demanded again quen looked toward the bathroom a light flicked on and a beam spilled into the room to diffuse into nothing an effeminate mans voice chattered seemingly to itself filling the air with a bright presence jonathan answered back and i looked at quen in a panic knowing he wouldnt say anything in front of him it was my fault quen said softly they were working together i should have been there not your father piscary killed them as sure as if he had pulled the trigger feeling unreal i stepped close enough to see the sweat on him it was obvious he had overstepped his bounds telling me even this much jonathan came in trailing a man dressed in tight black and shiny boots oh the small man ex claimed hustling to the vanity with his fishingtackle boxes its red i adore red hair and its natural too i can tell from here come sit dove the things i can do for you you wont recognize yourself i spun to quen tired eyes haunted looking he stepped away leaving me breathless i stood staring wanting more knowing i wouldnt get it damn it quens timing sucked and i forced my hands to remain at my side instead of throttling him sit your fanny down the stylist exclaimed when quen inclined his head at me and walked out i only have half an hour frowning i gave jonathans mocking expression a tired look then sat down in the chair and tried to explain to the man that i liked it the way it was and could he just give it a quick brush through but he hissed and shushed me pulling out bottle after bottle of spray and oddlooking instruments whose use i couldnt even guess i knew it was a battle already lost twentyfive i settled into the seat of trents limo crossing my legs and arranging one of the narrow panels of my skirt to cover my knee the shawl i was using instead of a coat slid down my back and i let it stay there it smelled like ellasbeth and my subtler perfume couldnt compete the shoes were a half size too small but the dress fit perfectly the bustier tight but not confining and the skirt riding high on my waist my thigh holster was as subtle as dandelion fluff completely unseen randy had styled my shorter hair up off my neck binding it with thick gold wire and vintage beads into an elaborate coiffure that had taken the man twenty minutes of unending prattle to fix but he was right i felt completely unlike myself and expeeeeensive this was the second limo id been in that week maybe it was a trend if so i could handle that jittery i glanced at trent staring out at the huge trees as we approached the gatehouse their black trunks standing out against the snow he seemed a thousand miles away not even aware i was sitting next to him takatas car is nicer i said breaking the silence trent twitched recovering smoothly the reaction made him look as young as he was mines not a rental he said i shrugged foot jiggling as i looked out the smoked window warm enough he asked what oh yes thank you jonathan drove us past the guardhouse without slowing the rising bar reaching its apex the second we passed under it it closed equally fast i fidgeted checking my clutch purse for my charms feeling for the press of my splat gun and touching my hair trent was looking out the window again lost in his own world which had nothing to do with me hey sorry about the window i said not liking the silence ill send you a bill if it cant be fixed he turned to me you look nice thank you i sent my eyes over his silklined wool suit he wasnt wearing an overcoat and it was tailored to show off every inch of him his boutonniere was a tiny black bud rose and i wondered if he had grown it himself you wash up good yourself he gave me one of his professional smiles but there was a new glint to it and i thought it might actually have a tinge of real warmth the dress is beautiful i added wondering how i was going to get through tonight without resorting to talk about the weather i leaned to tug my nylons straight that reminds me trent twisted to dip a hand into a pocket these go with it he held out his hand dropping a heavy set of earrings into my palm theres a necklace too thanks i tilted my head to take out my simple hoops dropping them into my clutch purse and snapping it closed trents earrings were a series of interlocking circles and heavy enough to be real gold i worked them into place feeling their unfamiliar weight and the necklace trent held it up and my eyes widened it was gorgeous made of interlaced rings the size of my thumbnail and matching the earrings they made a delicate lace panel and i would have labeled it goth but for its richness a wooden pendant in the shape of the celtic rune for protection hung from the nadir and i hesitated in my reach it was beautiful but i suspected its peekaboo lace would make me a veritable vampire slut and celtic magic gave me the willies it was a specialized art much of it depending upon ones belief not if you did the spell right or not more of a religion than magic i didnt like mixing religion and magicit made for terribly strong forces when something unmeasurable mixed its will with that of the practitioners intent making the results not necessarily in line with what was expected it was wild magic and i preferred mine nicely scientific if you invoke the help of a higher being you cant complain when things dont go to your plan but to its turn around trent said and my eyes darted to his ill put it on you it has to be snug for it to look right i was not about to show trent i was squeamish and as protection charms were fairly reliable i took the simple fake gold cord from around my neck and dropped it into my clutch bag with my earrings i wondered if trent knew what wearing this was saying deciding he probably did and thought it was a big joke tension tightened my shoulders as i gathered strands of hair that randy had pulled for effect the necklace settled about my neck in a heavy feeling of security still warm from his pocket trents fingers touched me and i yelped in surprise as a surge of ley line energy rose through me and into him the car swerved and trents fingers jerked away the necklace hit the carpeted floor with a tinkle of metal hand to my throat i stared at him he had put himself into the corner the amber light from the ceiling glinted to make shadows on him eyeing me with a look of annoyance he scooted forward and scooped the necklace from the floor jiggling it until it hung properly across one hand sorry i said heart pounding and my hand still covering my neck trent frowned meeting jonathans gaze in the rearview mirror before gesturing for me to turn back around i did very conscious of him behind me quen said youve been working on your ley line skills trent said while he draped the metal over me again it took me a week to learn how to keep my familiars energy from trying to equalize when i touched another practitioner of course i was three at the time so i had an excuse his hands fell from me and i settled into the supple cushions his expression was smug his usual professionalism gone it wasnt any of his business that this was the first time i had tried to spindle line energy in me as a matter of convenience i was ready to bag it my feet hurt and thanks to quen i wanted to go home eat a carton of ice cream and remember my dad quen knew my dad i said sullenly so i hear he looked not at me but the passing view as we made our way into the city my breath came faster and i shifted in my seat piscary said he killed my dad quen implied there was more to it than that trent crossed his legs and unbuttoned his suit coat quen talks too much tension pulled my stomach tight our fathers were working together i prompted doing what his lip twitched and he ran a hand across his hair to make sure it was lying flat from the drivers seat jonathan coughed in warning right like his threats meant anything to me trent shifted in the seat to look at me his face holding a shade of interest ready to work with me i cocked an eyebrow at him work with me last time it was work for me no i smiled though i wanted to step on his foot quen seems to blame himself for my dads death i find that fascinating especially when piscary claimed responsibility a sigh came from trent his hand went out to steady himself when we eased onto the interstate piscary killed my father outright he said your father was bitten while trying to help him quen was supposed to be there not your father thats why quen went to help you subdue piscary he felt he needed to take your fathers place seeing as he believes it was his fault your father wasnt there to help you himself my face went cold and i pushed myself back into the leather seat i had thought trent had sent quen to help me trent had nothing to do with it but a niggling thought surfaced through my confusion but my father didnt die of a vampire bite no trent said carefully his eyes on the growing skyline he didnt he died when his red blood cells started attacking his soft tissues i prompted waiting for more but trents posture went closed thats all im getting isnt it i said flatly and the man gave me half a smile charming and sly my offer of employment is ever open ms morgan it was hard but i managed to keep a somewhat pleasant expression on my face as i slumped in the seat i suddenly felt like i was being lulled lured into places that i once vowed id never go places like working for trent sex with a vampire crossing the street without looking all of them you could get away with but eventually you were going to get blasted by a bus what in hell was i doing in a limo with trent we had passed into the hollows and i sat up taking more interest the holiday lights were thick primarily green white and gold the silence stretched sooo who is ellasbeth trent shot me a poisonous look and i smiled sweetly not my idea he said how very interesting i thought i found a nerve wouldnt it be fun to stomp on it old girlfriend i guessed brightly livein ugly sister you hide in the basement trents expression had returned to its professional emptiness but his restless fingers were evermoving i like your jewelry he said maybe i should have had jonathan put it into the house safe while we were gone i put a hand to his necklace feeling it warm from my body i was wearing crap and you know it damn it i had enough of his gold on me to make a set of false teeth for a horse we can talk about nick then trents soothing voice carried a derisive edge id much rather talk about nick it was nick wasnt it nick sparagmos hes moved out of the city i hear after you sent him into an epileptic seizure hands clasped at his knee he gave me a telling look pale eyebrows high what did you do to him i never could find that out nick is fine i pulled my hands down before they could play with my hair im watching his apartment while hes away on business i looked out the window reaching behind me to pull the shawl back up over my shoulders he could sling mud better than the best richbitch at school we need to discuss what it is im supposed to be protecting you against from the drivers seat came jonathans snort trent too chuckled im not in need of protection he said if i was quen would be here youre a semifunctioning decoration semifunctioning yeah i shot back wishing i could say i was surprised yeah he said right back the word sounding odd coming from him so sit where youre put and keep your mouth shut face warming i moved so that my knees almost touched his thigh listen to me mr kalamack i said sharply quen is paying me good money to keep your ass above the grass so dont leave the room without me and dont get into my line of sight with the bad guys got it jonathan turned into a parking lot and i had to brace myself when he applied the brakes too sharply trent glanced at him and i watched their gazes lock through the rearview mirror still angry i looked out to find ugly piles of snow a good six feet high we were down by the riverfront and my shoulders tensed at the gambling boat with its stacks steaming slightly saladans gambling boat again my thoughts went back to my night with kisten and the guy in a tux who had taught me craps shit hey uh do you know what saladan looks like i asked is he a witch the hesitancy in my tone was probably what caught trents attention and while jonathan parked in the long spot reserved for a car of this length he eyed me hes a ley line witch black hair dark eyes my age why are you worried you should be hes better than you no crap or should i say craps grabbing my clutch purse i slumped back into the cushions when jonathan opened the door and trent got out with a grace that had to be practiced a blast of cold air replaced him making me wonder how trent could stand there as if it was summer i had a feeling id already met saladan idiot i berated myself but showing lee i wasnt afraid of him after his failed little black charm would be extremely satisfying becoming eager for the encounter i slid across the bench seat to the open door jerking back when jonathan slammed it in my face hey i shouted adrenaline making my head hurt the door opened and jonathan gave me a satisfied smirk sorry maam he said past him was trent a tired look on his face holding my borrowed shawl close i watched jonathan as i slid out why thank you jon i said brightly you freaking bastard trent ducked his head hiding a smile i jerked the shawl higher and making sure i kept my line energy where it was supposed to be i took trents arm so he could help me up the icy ramp he stiffened to pull away and i grabbed his arm with my free hand pinching my purse between us it was cold and i wanted to get inside im wearing heels for you i muttered the least you can do is make sure i dont fall on my can or are you afraid of me trent said nothing his posture shifting into an uneasy acceptance as we went step for step across the parking lot he turned to look over his shoulder at jonathan indicating that he should stay with the car and i simpered at the tall un happy man giving him ericas crookedbunnyear kiss goodbye it was fully dark now and the wind blew bits of snow against my legs bare but for my nylons why hadnt i insisted on borrowing a coat i wondered this shawl was worthless and it stank like lilac i hated lilac arent you cold i questioned seeing trent seemingly as warm as if it was july no he said and i remembered ceri walking in the snow with a similar tolerance must be an elf thing i muttered and he chuckled yup he said my eyes jerking to his at the casual word they were bright with amusement and i glanced at the beckoning ramp well im frozen through i grumbled can we move a little faster he quickened his pace but i was still shivering by the time we got to the entry door trent solicitously held it for me ushering me in ahead of him letting go of his arm i went inside my hands clasping my upper arms to try to warm myself i gave the doorman a brief smile and got a stoic blank look taking my shawl off i held it between two fingers to the coat attendant wondering if i could conveniently leave it hereby accident of course mr kalamack and ms morgan trent said ignoring the guestbook were expected yes sir the doorman gestured for someone to take his place right this way trent offered me his arm i hesitated trying to read his quiet face and failing taking a breath i linked my arm in his as my fingers brushed the top of his hand i made a conscious effort to maintain my level of line energy when i felt a slight pull from my chi better he said his eyes searching the busy game room as we followed the doorman youre improving by leaps and bounds ms morgan shove it trent i said smiling at the people who looked up when we entered his hand was warm under my fingers and i felt like a princess there was a lull in the noise and when the conversations rose again they had an excitement that couldnt be laid entirely at the feet of gambling it was warm and the air pleasantly scented the disk hanging over the center of the room seemed quiet but i imagined if i bothered to look at it with my second sight that it would be pulsating with that ugly purple and black i glanced at my reflection to see if my hair was behaving under the stylists sprays and wires glad the yellow of my black eye was still hidden behind the mundane makeup then i looked again damn i thought slowing trent and i looked fantastic no wonder people were staring he was trim and debonair and i was elegant in my borrowed dress with my hair up off my neck and bound with that heavy gold wire both of us were confident both of us were smiling but even as i thought we made the perfect couple i realized that though we were together each of us was alone our strengths were not dependent upon each other and while that wasnt bad it didnt lend itself to being a couple we were simply standing next to each other looking good what is it trent asked gesturing that i should go up the stairs ahead of him nothing gathering my slit skirt as best i could i went up the narrow carpeted stairway after the doorman the sound of gaming people went faint turning into a background hum to stir my subconscious a cheer rose and i wished i could be down there feeling my heart pound in the breathless wait to see what the dice would show i thought theyd search us trent said softly so the man escorting us couldnt hear i shrugged for what did you see that big disk on the ceiling he glanced behind us and i added its a huge spell damper kind of like the charms i used to have on my cuffs before you burned them all to hell but it affects the whole boat didnt you bring a weapon he whispered as we reached the second floor yes i said through my teeth smiling and i could shoot someone with it but the potions wont take effect until whoever it is leaves the boat what good is it then i dont kill people trent get over it though i might make an exception for lee i saw his jaw tighten and relax our escort opened a narrow door gesturing for me to enter i stepped in finding lee looking pleasantly surprised as he brought his attention from the paperwork on his desk i tried to keep my expression neutral the memory of that man writhing on the street under a black charm aimed at me making me angry and ill all at the same time a tall woman stood behind him leaning to breathe upon his neck she was leggy and lean dressed in a black jumpsuit with bellbottom hems the neckline went almost to her navel vamp i decided when her eyes dropped to my necklace and she smiled to show me small pointy canines my scar twinged and my anger slowed quen wouldnt have stood a chance eyes alight lee rose and tugged the coat of his tux straight physically pushing the vampire out of his way he came out from around the desk trent entered and his gaze became even more animated trent he exclaimed striding forward with his hands extended how are you old man i stepped back as trent and lee warmly clasped hands youve got to be kidding me stanley he said smiling and it finished falling into place stanley long for lee damn lee said pounding trent on the back how long has it been ten years trents smile flickered his annoyance at that back slap nearly undetectable but for the slight tightening in his eyes almost that you look good still hitting the waves lee ducked his head a roguish grin turning him into a scalawag despite him being in a tux now and again not as much as i like my damn knee has been giving me trouble but you look good got some muscle on you now not that skinny boy trying to keep up with me trents eyes flicked to mine and i gave him a mute look thanks word is youre getting married married i was wearing his fiancées dress oh this was getting better and better lee brushed his hair out of his eyes and sat against the desk the vamp behind him started to rub his shoulders in a sultry whorebitch sort of a way she hadnt taken her eyes off me and i didnt like it anyone i know lee prompted and trents jaw clenched a beautiful young woman named ellasbeth withon he said from seattle ah brown eyes wide lee smiled as if he was laughing at trent congratulations youve met her trent said sourly and lee chuckled ive heard of her he made a pained face am i invited to the wedding i puffed impatiently i had thought we came here to knock heads not have a reunion ten years would put them in their late teens college and i didnt like being ignored but i supposed that was standard for hired help at least whorebitch hadnt been introduced either of course trent said the invitations will go out as soon as she decides between the eight options shes narrowed it down to he said dryly id ask you to be my best man if i thought youd ever get on a horse again lee pulled himself off the desk and out of the vamps reach no no no he protested going to a small cabinet and bringing out two glasses and a bottle not again not with you my god what did you whisper into that beasts ear anyway trent smiled a real one this time and took the offered shot glass fair is fair surfer dude he said and i blinked at the accent he affected seeing as you almost drowned me me lee sat back on the desk one foot off the floor i had nothing to do with that the canoe had a leak i didnt know you couldnt swim thats what you keep saying trents eye twitched taking a tiny sip he turned to me stanley this is rachel morgan shes my security tonight i beamed a false smile hello lee i held out my hand careful to keep my ley line energy reined though with the memory of that mans screams echoing through me it was hard not to give him a jolt nice to see the upstairs this time rachel lee said warmly turning my hand to kiss the top of it instead of shaking it you cant imagine how bad i felt for getting you mixed up in that ugly business im so pleased you came away from it unscathed i trust youre being compensated properly tonight i yanked my hand back before his lips touched it making a show of wiping it off no apologies needed but id be remiss for not thanking you for teaching me how to play craps my pulse quickened and i stifled the urge to slug him want your dice back the vampire slid behind him her hands going possessively atop his shoulders lee kept his smile in place seemingly oblivious to my barb god the man had been bleeding from his pores and that had been aimed at me bastard the orphanage was most grateful for your donation lee said smoothly they put a new roof on with it so im told fantastic i said honestly pleased beside me trent fidgeted clearly dying to interrupt im always glad when i can help those less fortunate lee took the vampires hands in his and moved her to stand beside him trent took my arm while they were distracted you bought the new roof he breathed apparently i muttered noting he was surprised about the roof not the scuffle in the streets trent rachel lee said as he held the vampires hand in his this is candice candice smiled to show her teeth ignoring trent she fixed her brown eyes on my neck a red tongue edging the corner of her mouth exhaling she eased closer lee sweetheart she said and i gripped trents arm tighter when her voice ran like ripples over my scar you told me id be entertaining a man her smile went predatory but this is okay i forced a breath waves of promise were coming from my neck making my knees weaken my blood pounded and my eyes almost slipped shut i took a breath then another it took all my experience with ivy to keep from responding she was hungry and she knew what she was doing if she had been undead i would have been hers as it was even with my scar she couldnt bespell me unless i let her and i wasnt going to aware of trent watching i gained control of myself though i could feel the sexual tension rising in me like fog on a damp night my thoughts slid to nick then kisten where they lingered to make things worse candice i said softly leaning closer i wouldnt touch her i wouldnt its nice to meet you and i will break off your teeth and use them to pierce your belly button if you even as much as look at my scar again candices eyes flashed to black the warmth in my scar died angry she drew away her hand atop lees shoulder i dont care if you are tamwoods plaything she said trying to be all queen of the damned but i lived with a truly dangerous vampire and her efforts were pathetic i can take you down she finished my jaw clenched i live with ivy im not her plaything i said softly hearing a muted cheer from downstairs what does that tell you nothing she said her pretty face going ugly and nothing is exactly what youre going to get from me so back off lee stepped between us candice he said putting a hand on the small of her back and pushing her to the door do me a favor sweetheart get ms morgan some coffee will you shes working tonight black no sugar i said hearing my voice rasp my heart was pounding and sweat had broken out black witches i could handle skilled hungry vampires were a little harder unkinking my fingers from trents arm i pulled away his face was quiet as he looked at me and then the vamp lee was escorting to the door quen he whispered quen wouldnt have had a chance i said my heart slowing if she had been an undead neither would i but saladan wouldnt have been able to convince an undead vampire to back him lest piscary find out and kill him or her twice there was honor among the dead or maybe it was just fear lee said a few words to candice and the woman slunk out into the hall giving me a sly smile before she left red heels were the last i saw of her my thoughts spun when i noticed she had an anklet identical to ivys there couldnt be more than one like that without a reasonperhaps kisten and i ought to chat not knowing what it meant if anything i sat in one of the green upholstered chairs before i fell over from the fading adrenaline hands clasped to hide their faint trembling i thought of ivy and the protection she gave me no one had made a play for me like that in months not since the vamp at the perfume counter had mistaken me for someone else if i had to fight that off every day it would only be a matter of time before i became a shadow of myself thin anemic and belonging to someone or worse belonging to anyone the sound of sliding fabric pulled my attention to trent as he sat in the second chair you all right he breathed when lee shut the door behind candice with a firm thump his voice was soothing surprising me forcing myself to straighten i nodded wondering why he cared or even if he did exhaling i forced my hands open and loose bustling with efficiency lee edged back around his desk and sat he was smiling to show his white teeth amid his suntanned face trent he said leaning back in his chair it was larger than ours and i think it put him several inches taller subtle im glad you came to see me we should talk before anything gets more out of hand than it has out of hand trent didnt move and i watched his concern for me melt into nothing green eyes hard he set his shot glass on the desk between them the soft click sounding louder than it should never looking from saladans sloppy grin he took over the room this was the man who killed his employees in his office and got away with it the man who owned half the city the man who thumbed his nose at the law living above it in his fortress in the middle of an oldgrowth plannedout forest trent was angry and i suddenly didnt mind that they were ignoring me you derailed two of my trains caused a near strike of my trucking line and burned down my primary public relations effort trent said a wisp of his hair starting to float i stared at him while lee shrugged primary public relations effort it had been an orphanage god how cold could you be it was the easiest way to get your attention lee sipped his drink youve been inching your way past the mississippi the last ten years did you expect anything less trents jaw tightened youre killing innocent people with the potency of the brimstone youre putting on the streets no lee barked pushing the glass from him there are no innocents thin lips pressed together he leaned forward angry and threatening you crossed the line he said shoulders tense under his tux and i wouldnt be here culling your weak clientele if you stayed on your side of the river as agreed my father made that agreement not me ive asked your father to lower the levels he allows in his brimstone people want a safe product i give it to them i dont care where they live lee fell back with a sound of disbelief spare me the benefactor crap he simpered we dont sell to anyone who doesnt want it and trent they want it the stronger the better the death levels even out in less than a generation the weak die off the strong survive ready and willing to buy more to buy stronger your careful regulation weakens everyone theres no natural balance no strengthening of the species maybe thats why there are so few of you left youve killed yourself by trying to save them i sat with my hands deceptively slack in my lap feeling the tension rise in the small room culling weak clientele strengthening the species who in hell did he think he was lee made a quick movement and i twitched but the bottom line lee said easing back when he saw me move is that im here because you are changing the rules and im not leaving its too late for that you can hand everything over to me and graciously move off the continent or i will take it one orphanage one hospital one train station street corner and bleedingheart innocent at a time he took a sip of his drink and cradled it in his laced hands i like games trent and if you remember i won whatever we played trents eye twitched it was his only show of emotion you have two weeks to get out of my city he said his voice a smooth ribbon of calm water hiding a deadly undertow im going to maintain my distribution if your father wants to talk im listening your city lee flicked his eyes over me then back to trent looks to me like its split he arched his thin eyebrows very dangerous very attractive piscary is in prison his scion is ineffective youre vulnerable from the veneer of honest businessman you hide behind im going to take cincinnati and the distribution net you have so painstakingly developed and use it as it ought to be its a waste trent you could control the entire western hemisphere with what you have and youre pissing it away on halfstrength brimstone and biodrugs to dirt farmers and welfare cases that wont ever make anything of themselvesor anything for you a seething anger warmed my face i happened to be one of those welfare cases and though i would probably be shipped off to siberia in a biocontainment bag if it ever got out i bristled trent was scum but lee was disgusting i opened my mouth to tell him to shut up about things he didnt understand when trent touched my leg with his shoe in warning the rims of trents ears had gone red and his jaw was tight he tapped at the arm of the chair a deliberate show of his agitation i do control the western hemisphere trent said his low resonating voice making my stomach clench and my welfare cases have given me more than my fathers paying customersstanley lees tanned face went white in anger and i wondered what was being said that i didnt understand perhaps it hadnt been college maybe they had met at camp your money cant force me out trent added ever go tell your father to lower his brimstone levels and ill back off from the west coast lee stood and i stiffened ready to move he placed his hands spread wide bracing himself you overestimate your reach trent you did when we were boys and nothing has changed its why you almost drowned trying to swim back to shore and why you lost every game we played every race we ran every girl we made a prize he was pointing now underscoring his words you think youre more than you are having been coddled and praised for accomplishments that everyone else takes for granted face it youre the last of your kind and its your arrogance that put you there my eyes shifted between them trent sat with his legs comfortably crossed and his fingers laced he was absolutely still he was incensed none of it showing but for the hem of his slacks trembling dont make a mistake you cant walk away from he said softly im not twelve anymore lee backed up a misplaced satisfaction and confidence in him as he eyed the door behind me you could have fooled me the door latch shifted and i jerked candice walked in an institutionalwhite mug of coffee in her hand excuse me she said her kittensoft voice only adding to the tension she slunk between trent and lee breaking their gazes on each other trent shook out his sleeves and took a slow breath i glanced at him before reaching for the coffee he looked shaken but it was from repressing his anger not fear i thought of his biolabs and ceri safely hiding with an old man across the street from my church was i making choices for her that she should be making for herself the mug was thick the warmth of it seeping into my fingers when i took it my lip curled when i realized she had put cream in it not that i was going to drink it thanks i said making an ugly face right back at her when she took a sexually charged pose atop lees desk her legs crossed at the knee lee she said leaning to make a provocative show there is a slight problem on the floor that needs your attention looking annoyed he pushed her out of his way deal with it candice im with friends her eyes went black and her shoulders stiffened its something you need to attend get your ass downstairs it wont wait i flicked my gaze to trent reading his surprise apparently the pretty vamp was more than decoration partner i wondered she sure was acting like it she cocked one eyebrow at lee in mocking petulance making me wish i could do the same i still hadnt bothered to learn how now lee she prompted slipping off the desk and going to hold the door for him his brow furrowed brushing his short bangs from his eyes he pushed his chair back with excessive force excuse me thin lips tight he nodded to trent walked out his feet thumping on the stairway candice smiled predatorily at me before she slipped out after him enjoy your coffee she said closing the door there was a click as it locked twentysix i took a deep breath listening to the silence trent shifted his legs to put his ankle atop a knee eyes distant and worried he chewed on a lower lip looking nothing like the drug lord and murderer he was funny you couldnt tell by looking she locked the door i said jumping at the sound of my own voice trent lifted his eyebrows she doesnt want you to wander i think its a good idea snarky elf i thought stifling a frown i went to the small round window looking out across the frozen river using the flat of my hand i wiped the condensation from it and took in the varied skyline carew tower was lit up with holiday lights glowing with the gold green and red film they covered the top floor windows with so they would shine like huge bulbs it was clear tonight and i could even see a few stars through the citys light pollution turning i put my hands behind my back i dont trust your friend i never have youll live longer that way trents tight jaw eased and the green of his eyes went a little less hard lee and i spent our summers together when we were boys four weeks at one of my fathers camps four weeks at his familys beach house on a manmade island off the coast of california it was supposed to foster goodwill between our families hes the one who set the ward on my great window actually trent shook his head he was twelve quite an accomplishment for him at the time still is we had a party my mother fell into the hot tub she was so tipsy i should replace it with glass now that werehaving difficulties he was smiling in a bittersweet memory but i had stopped listening lee set the ward it had taken the color of my aura just like the disk in the game room our auras resonated to a similar frequency eyes squinting i thought about our shared aversion to red wine he has the same blood disease i do doesnt he i said it couldnt be a coincidence not with trent trents head jerked up yes he said cautiously thats why i dont understand this my father saved his life and now hes squabbling over a few million a year few million a year pocket change for the rich and filthy restless i glanced at lees desk deciding i had nothing to learn by sifting through the drawers you ah monitor the levels of brimstone you produce trents expression went guarded then as if making a decision he ran a hand across his hair to make it lie flat very carefully ms morgan im not the monster youd like me to be im not in the business of killing people im in the business of supply and demand if i didnt produce it someone else would and it wouldnt be a safe product thousands would die he glanced at the door and uncrossed his legs to put both feet on the floor i can guarantee it my thoughts went to erica the thought of her dying under the flag of being a weak member of the species was intolerable but illegal was illegal my hand smacked into his gold earrings as i tucked a strand of hair behind my ear i dont care how pretty the colors are that you paint your picture with youre still a murderer faris didnt die because of a bee sting his brow furrowed faris was going to give his records to the press faris was a frightened man who loved his daughter i put a hand on my hip and watched him fidget it was very subtle the tension in his jaw the way he held his manicured fingers the lack of any expression so why dont you kill me i asked before i do the same my heart pounded and i felt as if i was at a cliffs edge trent broke his persona of professional welldressed drug lord with a smile because you wont go to the press he said softly they will bring you down with me and survival is more important than the truth to you my face warmed shut up its not a failing ms morgan shut up and i knew eventually youd work with me i wont you already are stomach churning i turned away i gazed unseeing over the frozen river a frown creased my brow it was so silent i could hear the thumping of my heartwhy was it that quiet i spun hands gripping my elbows trent looked up from arranging the crease in his pants his gaze was curious at the frightened look i knew i had what he said carefully feeling unreal and disconnected i took a step to the door listen i dont hear anything i reached out and wiggled the knob thats the problem i said the boat is empty there was a heartbeat of silence trent rose his suit making a pleasant hush he looked more concerned than alarmed as he shook his sleeves down and came forward nudging me out of the way he tried the handle what you think its going to work for you when it wont work for me i said grabbing his elbow and pulling him out from in front of the door balancing on one foot i held my breath and kicked at the jamb thankful that even luxury boats tried to keep everything as light as possible my heel went right through the thin wood my foot catching the strips of my beautiful dress dangled and waved as i hopped ungainly backward to disentangle myself hey wait i exclaimed when trent picked the splinters from the hole and reached through to unlock it from the outside ignoring me he opened the door and darted into the hall damn it trent i hissed snatching up my clutch purse and following him ankle hurting i caught up with him at the foot of the stairs reaching out i jerked him back sending his shoulder into the wall of the narrow passage what are you doing i said inches away from his angry eyes is this how you treat quen you dont know whats out there and if you die im the one thats going to suffer not you he said nothing his green eyes choleric and his jaw tight now get your scrawny ass behind mine and keep it there i said giving him a shove sullen and worried i left him there my hand wanted to reach for my splat gun but as long as that purple disk was up and running the potions in it wouldnt do anything but tick someone off as i got a nasty concoction of monkshood and spiderwort all over their nice dress clothes a faint smile curved over my face i didnt mind doing this the physical way what i could see of the room was empty i listened hearing nothing crouching to put my head at knee level i peeked around the corner i was down here for two reasons first if anyone was waiting to hit me theyd have to adjust their swing giving me time to get out of the way second if i were hit i wouldnt have so far to go to find the floor but as i took in the elegant room my stomach churned the floor was littered with bodies oh my god i said softly as i rose trent he killed them was that it was lee going to frame us for murder trent pushed past me slipping my grasping reach easily he crouched by the first body knocked out he said flatly his beautiful voice turned to steel my horror turned to confusion why i scanned the floor guessing they had fallen where they stood trent rose his eyes went to the door i agreed lets get out of here i said his steps behind me were quick as we hustled to the foyer to find it predictably locked through the frosted glass i could see cars in the parking lot trents limo parked where we left it i got a bad feeling about this i muttered and trent pushed me aside to look i stared at the thick wood knowing i wouldnt be able to kick through that tense i dug through my clutch purse while trent wasted his energy trying to break a window with a bar stool i punched speed dial number one its bulletproof glass i said as the phone rang he lowered the stool and ran a hand over his wispy hair to make it perfect again he wasnt even breathing hard how do you know i shrugged turning sideways for some privacy its what i would have used i returned to the gaming room as ivy picked up hey ivy i said refusing to lower my voice lest i give mr elf the impression i hadnt planned this saladan locked us in his gambling boat and ran away could you come on out and jimmy the door for me trent was peering out at the parking lot jonathan is there call him ivy was saying something but trents voice was louder i covered the receiver with a hand and said to trent if he was still conscious dont you think that he might be a little curious as to why lee left and already have come to take a look trents face went a little whiter what i said as i focused back on ivy she was almost frantic get out she shouted rachel kist had a bomb put on the boiler i didnt know thats where you were going get out my face went cold um i gotta go ivy talk to you later as ivy yelled i closed the cover to my phone and tucked it away turning to trent i smiled kisten is blowing up lees boat as an object lesson i think we need to leave my phone started ringing i ignored it and the callivywas shunted into voice mail trents confidence melted away to leave an attractive welldressed young man trying to show he wasnt afraid lee wouldnt let anyone burn his boat he said he doesnt work that way i clutched my arms about myself scanning the room for somethinganythingto help me he burned down your orphanage that was to get my attention i looked at him tired would your friend let his boat burn and take you with it if piscary was blamed for it heck of an easy way to take over the city trents jaw tightened the boiler room he asked i nodded how did you know he headed for a small door behind the bar its what i would have done swell i followed him my pulse quickening as i stepped around the unconscious people where are we going i want to look at it i stopped dead in my tracks as trent turned to go down a ladder backward you can dismantle a bomb it would be the only way to save everyone there had to be a dozen people from the bottom of the ladder trent peered up at me looking odd in his dress suit among the filth and clutter no i just want to look at it are you nuts i exclaimed you want to look at it we have to get out of here trents upturned face was placid it might have a timer on it are you coming sure i said stifling a laugh i was pretty sure it would come out sounding hysterical trent wove through the boat with a disturbing lack of urgency i could smell hot metal and smoke trying not to snag my dress i peered into the dimness there it is i shouted pointing my finger was shaking and i dropped my hand to hide it trent strode forward and i followed hiding behind him when he crouched before a metal box with wires coming out of it he reached to open it and i panicked hey i cried grabbing his shoulder what the turn are you doing you dont know how to turn it off he caught his balance without getting up looking at me in annoyance every hair on his head still perfect thats where the timer will be morgan i swallowed hard peering over his shoulder as he carefully opened the lid how much time i whispered my breath sending his wispy hair drifting he stood and i took a step back about three minutes oh hell no my mouth went dry and my phone started ringing i ignored it leaning i looked closer at the bomb starting to feel a little unsteady trent pulled on a watch fob to bring out an antiquelooking timepiece and set the modern timer on it weve got three minutes to find a way off three minutes we cant find a way off the boat in three minutes the glass is bulletproof the doors are thicker than your head and that big purple disk will soak up any spell we throw at it trents eyes were cold on me get ahold of yourself morgan hysterics wont help dont tell me what to do i exclaimed my knees starting to shake i think best when im having hysterics just shut up and let me have them arms wrapped around myself i glanced at the bomb it was hot down there and i was sweating three minutes what in hell could you do in three minutes sing a little song dance a little dance make a little love find a new romance oh god i was making up poetry maybe he has an escape route in his office trent suggested and thats why he locked us in there i said come on i grabbed his sleeve and pulled we dont have enough time to find a way off my thoughts went to the purple disk in the ceiling i had influenced it once maybe i could bend it to my will come on i repeated as his sleeve slipped through my fingers when he refused to move unless you want to stay and watch numbers count down i might be able to break the nospell zone lee has on his boat trent rocked into motion i still say we can find a weak point in his security i headed up the ladder not caring if trent noticed i wasnt wearing undies or not not enough time damn it why didnt kisten tell me what he was doing i was surrounded by men who kept secrets from me nick trent and now kisten could i pick em or what and kist was killing people i didnt want to like a guy who killed people what was wrong with me heart pounding as if marking the reducing seconds we went back to the gaming room it was silent and still waiting my mouth twisted at the sight of the sleeping people they were dead i couldnt save them and trent i didnt even know how i was going to save myself the disk above me looked innocuous enough but i knew it was still functioning when trent glanced at it and paled i guessed he was using his second sight you cant break that he said but you dont need to can you make a protection circle big enough for both of us my eyes widened you want to ride it out in a protection circle you are crazy the minute i hit it down it goes trent looked angry how big morgan but i tripped the alarms last time just looking at it so what he exclaimed his confidence cracking it was nice to see him shaken but under the circumstances i couldnt enjoy it trip the alarms the disk doesnt stop you from tapping a line and making a spell it only catches you when you do make the damned circle oh i looked at him in understanding my first wild hope dying i couldnt tap a line to make a protection circle not sitting on water as i was um you make it i said he seemed to start me it takes me a good five minutes with chalk and candles frustrated i groaned what kind of an elf are you what kind of a runner are you he shot back i dont think your boyfriend will mind if you tap a line through him to save your life do it morgan were running out of time i cant i spun in a tight circle through the unbreakable glass cincinnati glowed screw your damned honor rachel break your word to him or were dead miserable i turned back to him he thought i was honorable thats not it i cant draw on a line through nick anymore the demon broke my link with him trent went ashen but you gave me a shock in the car that was too much for what a witch can hold in his or her chi im my own familiar okay i said i made a deal with a demon to be its familiar so it would testify against piscary and i had to learn how to store ley line energy for it oh ive got tons of energy but a circle requires you stay connected to a line i cant do it youre a demons familiar his face looked horrified frightened scared of me not anymore i shouted angry to have to admit it had even happened i bought my freedom okay get off my case but i dont have a familiar and i cant tap a line over water from my bag came the faint sound of my phone ringing trent stared at me what did you give it for your freedom my silence my pulse hammered what difference did it make if trent knew we were both going to die grimacing as if having decided something trent took off his coat shaking his sleeve down he undid the cuff link and pushed his sleeve past his elbow you arent a demons familiar it was a soft worried whisper no i was shaking as i watched in slackeyed confusion he grabbed my arm just below the elbow hey i shouted pulling away deal with it he said grimly gripping my arm harder he used his free hand to force me to take his wrist in the same grip acrobats use when working the trapeze dont make me regret this he muttered and my eyes widened when a rush of line energy flowed into me holy crap i gasped almost falling it was wild magic having the uncatchable flavor of the wind he had joined his will to mine tapping a line through his familiar and giving it to me as if we were one the line coming through him and into me had taken on a tinge of his aura it was clean and pure with the taste of the wind like ceris trent groaned and my eyes shot to his his face was drawn and sweat had broken out on him my chi was full and though the extra energy was looping back to the line apparently the stuff i had spindled already in my head was burning through him oh god i said wishing there was a way i could shift the balance im sorry trent his breath came in a ragged gasp make the circle he panted eyes jerking to his timepiece swinging from its fob i said the invocation we both staggered as the force running through us ebbed i didnt relax at all as the bubble of ley line energy blossomed about us i glanced at his watch i couldnt see how much time was left trent tossed his hair from his eyes not letting go of my arm eyes looking haggard he ran his gaze over the gold smeared bubble over us to the people beyond his expression went empty swallowing hard he shifted his grip tighter clearly it wasnt burning him any longer but the pressure would steadily build to its previous levels its really big he said looking at the shimmer you can hold an undrawn circle this big i can hold it i said avoiding his eyes his skin pressing against mine was warm and there were tingles coming from it i didnt like the intimacy and i wanted it large so we have some leeway when the shock hits us as soon as you let go or i touch it it falls trent finished for me i know youre babbling morgan shut up i exclaimed nervous as a pixy in a room full of frogs you may be used to having bombs blow up around you but this is my first time if youre lucky it wont be the last he said just shut up i snapped i hoped my eyes werent as scared looking as his if we survived the blast there was still the aftermath to get through falling chunks of boat and icy water great um how long i asked hearing my voice shake my phone was ringing again he glanced down ten seconds maybe we should sit down before we fall sure i said thats probably a good ide i gasped as a boom shook the floor i reached for trent desperate that our grip on each other not break the floor pushed up at us and we fell he clutched at my shoulder pulling me into him to keep me from rolling away pressed against him i could smell silk and aftershave my stomach dropped and a flash of fire burst around us i screamed as my ears went numb in an unreal soundless motion the boat broke apart as we rose the night became smears of black sky and red fire the tingle of the circle breaking washed over me then we fell trents grip was torn away and i cried out when fire raced over me my explosionnumbed ears filled with water and i couldnt breathe i wasnt burning i was drowning it was cold not hot panicking i fought against the heavy water pushing at me i couldnt move i didnt know which way was up the dark was full of bubbles and chunks of boat a faint glow to my left caught my attention i gathered myself and aimed for it telling my brain it was the surface even though it seemed to be sideways not up god i hoped it was the surface i burst from the water my ears still not working the cold struck me freezing i gasped the air like knives in my lungs i took another thankful breath i was so cold it hurt pieces of boat were still falling and i tread water thankful that i wore a dress i could move in the water tasted like oil and the swallow i had taken in hung heavy in me trent i shouted hearing it as if through a pillow trent here i shook the wet hair from my eyes and turned relief went though me it was dark but through the floating ice and wood i saw trent his hair was plastered against him but he looked unhurt shivering i kicked off the one heel that i still had on and started toward him bits of boat were making the odd splash how could it still be falling i wondered there was enough flotsam between us to build two boats trent started forward with a professional looking stroke apparently he had learned to swim the glimmer of fire on the icy water brightened around us looking up i gasped something big and burning had yet to come down trent i shouted but he didnt hear me trent look out i screamed pointing but he wasnt listening i dove trying to escape i was flung as if smacked the water around me turned red i lost most of the air from my lungs when something hit me bruising my back the water saved me though and with my lungs aching and my eyes smarting i followed my exhaled breath to the surface trent i called as i emerged from the icy water and into the burning cold of the night i found him holding a cushion that was rapidly filling with water his eyes met mine unfocused the light from the burning boat was dimming and i swam for him the dock was gone i didnt know how we were going to get out of there trent i said coughing when i reached him my ears were ringing but i could hear myself i spit the hair out of my mouth are you okay he blinked as if trying to focus blood seeped from under his hairline making a brown streak in his fair hair his eyes closed and i watched in horror when his grip on the cushion went slack no you dont i said reaching out before he could slip under shivering i wrapped an arm about his neck tucking his chin against the inside of my elbow he was breathing my legs were going slow from the cold and my toes were cramping i looked for help where in hell was the is someone must have seen that explosion never around when you need them i muttered shoving a chunk of ice as large as a chair out of my way probably out giving someone a ticket for selling expired charms the dock was gone i had to get us out of the water but the break wall was three feet of concrete the only way out was to get back onto the ice and walk to another dock a sound of desperation came from me as i struck out for the edge of the hole the blast had ripped in the ice id never make it even with the slow current the water was starting to creep higher up me and my movements were slower and harder to make i wasnt cold anymore either and that scared the hell out of me i could probably make itifi werent dragging trent damn it all to hell i shouted using my anger to keep moving i was going to die here trying to save his ass why didnt you tell me what you were doing kisten i exclaimed feeling my tears like fire leaking out of me as i swam why didnt i tell you where i was going i yelled back at myself im a dumbass and your stupid watch is fast trent did you know that your stupid i took a sobbing breath watch is fast my throat hurt but the motion seemed to warm me the water felt positively balmy now panting i stopped swimming treading water my vision blurred when i realized i was almost there a big chunk of ice was in my way though and id have to swim around it taking a resolute breath i shifted my leaden arm and kicked my legs i couldnt feel them anymore but i assumed they were moving since the eightinchthick shelf of ice seemed to be moving closer the last of the light from the burning boat made little red smears on the ice as i reached out and touched it my hand slid cleanly away to pull in snow and i sank adrenaline pounded through me and i kicked back to the surface trent sputtered and coughed oh trent i said water filling my mouth i forgot you were here you first come on up on the ice using the questionable leverage of what looked like part of the casinos bar i got trent halfway up onto the frozen river tears slipped down my face as i was now able to use both arms to keep myself afloat i hung for a moment my hands unfeeling in the snow while i rested my head atop the ice i was so tired trent wasnt drowning i had done my job now i could save myself i reached up to pull myself onto the iceand failed snow fell in to make puddles of slush switching tactics i tried to lever my leg up it wouldnt move i couldnt move my leg okay i said not as scared as i thought i ought to be the cold must have numbed everythingeven my thoughts felt blurry i was supposed to be doing something but i couldnt remember what i blinked as i saw trent his legs still in the water oh yeah i whispered i had to get out of the water the sky above me was black and the night was silent but for the ringing in my ears and the faint sound of sirens the light from the fires was dim and going dimmer my fingers wouldnt work and i had to use my arms like clubs to pull a chunk of boat closer concentrating to not lose my thought i pushed it under to buoy me up a groan slipped from me when with its help i managed to slip a leg up onto the ice i rolled awkwardly and lay panting the wind was like fire on my back and the ice was warm id done it where is everyone i breathed feeling my flesh hard against the cold ice wheres ivy wheres the fire department wheres my phone i giggled as i remembered it was at the bottom of the river with my purse then sobered as i thought of the unconscious people drifting downward through the icy water in their best finery to join it hell id kiss even denon my old despised boss from the is if he showed up that reminded me jonathan i whispered oh jooooonathan i sang where are you come out come out wherever you areyou tall freak of nature i lifted my head glad i was pointed in the right direction squinting past my stringy hair i could see a light where the limo sat the headlights were aimed at the river shining to show the destruction and the sinking bits of boat jonathans silhouette stood at the quay i could tell it was him because he was the only person i knew who was that tall he was looking the wrong way hed never see me and i couldnt shout anymore damn it i was going to have to get up i tried i really did but my legs wouldnt work and my arms just lay there ignoring me besides the ice was warm and i didnt want to get up maybe if i shouted hed hear me i took a breath jonathan i whispered oh hell this wasnt going to work i took another breath jonathan i said hearing it around my ringing ears i pulled my head up watching as he didnt move to look never mind i said letting my head fall back onto the ice the snow was warm and i pressed into it this is nice i mumbled but i dont think it made it past my thoughts into real words it felt as if the world was spinning and i could hear the slosh of water snuggling into the ice i smiled i hadnt slept well for days i exhaled drifting off into nothing enjoying the warmth of the sun that was suddenly shining on the ice someone curled their arms around me and i felt my head thump into a soggy chest as i was lifted denon i heard myself murmur come here denon i owe you a bigkiss denon someone echoed ill carry her sahan i tried to open my eyes swirling back into nothing when i felt myself move i drowsed not awake but not quite not asleep then i was still and i tried to smile and go to sleep but a faint pinch and throb kept intruding on my cheek and my legs hurt irritated i pushed at the ice finding it was gone i was sitting up and someone was slapping me thats enough i heard trent say youre going to leave a mark the pinch vanished to leave just the throbbing jonathan was slapping me hey you freakin bastard i breathed you hit me again and ill take care of your family planning i could smell leather my face screwed up as feeling started to come back into my legs and arms oh god it hurt i opened my eyes to find trent and jonathan peering down at me blood seeped from trents hairline and water dripped from his nose above their heads was the interior of the limo i was alive how did i get to the car bout time you found us i breathed my eyes closing i heard trent sigh shes okay i suppose maybe compared to being dead i guess i was okay pity jonathan said and i heard him shift away from me it would have simplified things if she wasnt not too late to slip her in the water with the rest jon trent barked his voice was as hot as my skin felt i was freaking burning up she saved my life trent said softly i dont care if you like her or not but she has earned your respect trenton jonathan started no it was cold she has earned your respect there was a hesitation and i would have drifted off to nothing if the pain in my legs would let me and my fingers were on fire yes sahan jonathan said and i jerked awake get us home call ahead and have quen draw a bath for her we have to get her warmer than this yes sahan it was slow and reluctant the is is here why dont we leave her with them i felt a small pull upon my chi as trent tapped a line i dont want to be seen here just dont get in anyones way and we wont be noticed hurry up my eyes wouldnt listen to me anymore but i heard jonathan get out and shut the door there was another thump when he got in the drivers door and the car eased into motion the arms around me tightened and i realized i was in trents lap the warmth of his body doing more than the air to warm me i felt the softness of a blanket against me i must have been swaddled up right tight i couldnt move my legs or arms im sorry i murmured giving up on trying to open my eyes im getting water all over your suit then i giggled thinking that had sounded really pathetic he was already soaked your celtic charm isnt worth a damn i whispered i hope you kept your receipt shut up morgan trent said his voice distant and preoccupied the car picked up speed and the sound seemed to lull me i could relax i thought as i felt the tingling of circulation in my limbs i was in trents car wrapped in a blanket and held in his arms he wouldnt let anything hurt me he wasnt singing though i mused shouldnt he be singing twentyseven the warm water i was sitting in was nice i had been in it long enough to prune twice but i didnt care ellasbeths sunken tub was fab i sighed leaning my head back and staring at the tenfoot ceilings framed by the potted orchids lining the bathtub maybe there was something to this drug lord business if you got to have a tub like this id been in it for over an hour trent had called ivy for me even before we reached the citys limits id talked to her myself not too long ago telling her i was okay and was soaking in warm water and wasnt getting out until hell froze over she had hung up on me but i knew we were okay dragging my fingers through the bubbles i adjusted trents borrowed pain amulet hanging about my neck i didnt know who had invoked it maybe his secretary all my charms were at the bottom of the ohio river my smile faltered as i remembered the people i hadnt been able to save i would not feel guilty that i breathed and they didnt their deaths were laid at saladans feet not mine or maybe kistens damn it what was i going to do about that i closed my eyes and said a prayer for them but they jerked open when a faint cadence of brisk steps grew louder they quickly grew closer and i froze as a thin woman dressed smartly in a creamcolored suit clacked and clicked in over the bathroom tile unannounced there was a depart ment store bag over her arm her steely gaze was fixed on the doorway to the changing room and she never saw me as she vanished into it it had to be ellasbeth crap what was i supposed to do wipe the bubbles from my hand and offer to shake hers frozen i stared at the door my coat was on one of the chairs and my garment bag was still hanging by the changing screen pulse quickening i wondered if i could reach the green towel before she realized she wasnt alone the faint rustling stopped and i shrank down into the bubbles when she strode back in house afire her dark eyes were narrowed in anger and her high cheekbones were red posture stiff she halted bag still over her arm and apparently forgotten her thick waving blond hair was held back to give her narrow face a stark beauty lips tight she held her head high her eyes fixing vehemently upon me as soon as she cleared the archway so thats what it looked like when hell froze over who are you she said her strong voice domineering and cold i smiled but i knew it looked rather sickly ah im rachel morgan of vampiric charms i started to sit up then changed my mind i hated the question that had crept into my tone but there it was course it might have been there because i was naked except for bubbles and she was standing in fourinch heels and a casually tasteful outfit that kisten might pick out for me if he took me shopping in new york what are you doing in my bathtub she gazed disparagingly at my healing black eye i reached for a towel and dragged it in with me covering myself trying to warm up her mouth twitched i dont wonder why she said sharply hes a cold bastard i sat up in a rush of water as she walked out trenton her voice rang out harsh against the peace i had been wallowing in my breath puffed out and i looked at the soaked towel clinging to me sighing i got up and opened the drain with my foot the water swirling about my calves settled and began to escape ellasbeth had thoughtfully left all the doors open and i could hear her shouting at trent she wasnt far away perhaps as close as the common room deciding that as long as i could hear her out there it was probably safe enough to get dried off in here i wrung out the soaked towel and grabbed two new ones from the warmer god save you trenton came her voice bitter and abusive couldnt you even wait until i was gone before bringing in one of your whores i reddened and my motions to dry my arms grew rough i thought you had left trent said calmly not helping matters and shes not a whore shes a business associate i dont care what you call her shes in my rooms you bastard there wasnt anywhere else to put her there are eight bathrooms this side of the wall and you put her in mine i was glad my hair was somewhat dry and that it smelled like ellasbeths shampoo made me feel all peachykeen hopping ungainly on one foot i tried to get my underwear on thankful i had only been wearing the nylons that i brought from home when i went into the drink my skin was still damp and everything was sticking i almost went down when my foot got stuck halfway into my jeans leg and lurching i caught myself against the counter damn you trenton dont even try to say that is business ellasbeth was shouting theres a naked witch in my bathtub and youre sitting in your robe no you listen to me trents voice was iron hard and i could hear his frustration even from two rooms away i said shes a business associate and thats what she is ellasbeth made a harsh bark of laugher from vampiric charms she told me the name of her bloodhouse herself shes a runner if its any of your business trent said so coldly i could almost see his clenched jaw her partner is a vampire its a play on words ellasbeth rachel was my security escort tonight and she fell into the river saving my life i wasnt going to drop her at her office half dead from hypothermia like an unwanted cat you told me you were taking the seven oclock flight out i thought you were gone and i wasnt about to put her in my rooms there was a moment of silence i shimmied into my sweatshirt somewhere on the bottom of the river was several thousand dollars of soft ribbon gold from randys coiffure and one earring at least the necklace had survived maybe the charm worked only on the necklace you were on that boat the one that blew up itwas softer but there wasnt a hint of apology in her sudden concern in the silence i fumbled at my hair grimacing maybe if i had half an hour i could do something with it besides there was no way to recover from the first stellar impression id made taking a steadying breath i squared my shoulders and padded in my sock feet to the common room coffee i could smell coffee coffee would make everything better you can understand my confusion ellasbeth was saying as i hesitated by the door unnoticed but able to see them ellasbeth stood beside the round table in the breakfast nook looking meek in the way a tiger looks when it realizes it cant eat the man with the whip trent was seated wearing a green robe edged in maroon there was a professionallooking bandage on his forehead he looked botheredas he should with his fiancée accusing him of cheating thats the closest to an apology im going to get isnt it trent said ellasbeth dropped the department store bag and put a hand on her hip i want her out of my rooms i dont care who she is trents eyes fell on mine as if drawn to them and i winced apologetically quen is taking her home after a light dinner he said to her youre welcome to join us as i said i thought you had left i changed to a vamp flight so i could shop longer trent glanced back at me again to tell ellasbeth that they werent alone you spent six hours in the stores and have only one bag he said the faintest accusation in his voice ellasbeth followed his gaze to me quickly masking her anger with a pleasant expression but i could see her frustration it remained to be seen how it would show itself i was betting on hidden barbs and slights disguised as compliments but i would be nice as long as she was smiling i came out in my jeans and howlers sweatshirt hey uh thanks for the pain amulet and letting me get cleaned up mr kalamack i stopped beside the table the awkwardness as thick and choking as bad cheesecake no need to bother quen ill call my partner to come and get me shes probably banging on your gatehouse already trent made a visible effort to purge the anger from his posture elbows on the table so the sleeves of his robe fell to show the fair hair upon his arms he said id rather have quen take you home ms morgan i dont particularly want to talk to ms tamwood he glanced at ellasbeth do you want me to call the airport for you or are you staying another night it was entirely devoid of any invitation ill be staying she said tightly bending at the waist she picked up her bag and walked to her door i watched her quick stilted steps seeing in them a dangerous combination of callous disregard and ego shes an only child isnt she i said as the sound of her heels was lost on the carpet trent blinked his lips parting yes she is then he gestured for me to sit please not really sure i wanted to eat with the two of them i gingerly sat on the chair opposite trent my gaze went to the fake window spanning the entirety of the wall that the small nearby sunken living room took up it was just after eleven according to the clocks i had seen and it was dark with no moon sorry i said my gaze flicking to the archway to ellasbeths rooms his jaw tightened for an instant then relaxed can i get you some coffee sure that would be great i was almost faint from hunger and the heat of my bath had drained me i looked up with wide eyes as a matronly woman in an apron made her unhurried way out of the small kitchen tucked in at the back of the room it was partially open to the seating arrangement but i hadnt noticed her until now giving me a smile that encompassed all her face the woman set a mug of that heavenly scented coffee in front of me before topping off trents smaller teacup with an amber brew i thought i could smell gardenias but i wasnt sure bless you i said as i wrapped my hands around it and breathed in the steam youre welcome she said with the professional warmth of a good waitress smiling she turned to trent what will it be tonight mr kalamack its almost too late for a proper dinner as i blew on the surface of my coffee my thoughts went to the different schedules of witches and elves thinking it interesting that one of our species was awake at all times and that dinner happened about the same time for both of us oh lets make it light trent said clearly trying to ease the mood i have about three pounds of ohio river sitting in me somewhere how about a breakfast instead the usual maggie the woman nodded the white hair clipped close to her head not moving at all and how about you dear she asked me i glanced between trent and the woman whats the usual four eggs over easy and three slices of rye toast done on one side i felt myself blanch thats eating light i said before i could stop my mouth trent arranged his jammies collar peeking from behind his robe high metabolism my thoughts went back to how he and ceri never seemed to get cold the temperature of the river too hadnt affected him um i said as i realized she was still waiting the toast sounds good but ill pass on the eggs eyebrows high trent took a sip of his tea eyeing me over the rim thats right he said his voice unaccusing you dont tolerate them well maggie lets go with waffles shocked i leaned back in my chair how did you trent shrugged looking good in his bathrobe and bare feet he had nice feet you dont think i know your medical history my wonder died as i recalled faris dead on his office floor what in hell was i doing here eating dinner with him waffles would be great unless youd like something more traditional for dinner chinese doesnt take long would you rather have that maggie makes fabulous wontons i shook my head waffles sound good maggie smiled turning to putter back into the kitchen wont be but a moment i put my napkin in my lap wondering how much of this letsbenicetorachel scene was because ellasbeth was in the next room listening and trent wanted to hurt her for accusing him of cheating deciding i didnt care i put my elbows on the table and took a sip of the best coffee id ever tasted eyes closing in the rising steam i moaned in delight oh god trent i breathed this is good the sudden thump of heels on carpet pulled my eyes open it was back i straightened in my chair as ellasbeth came in her dress coat open to show a starched white shirt and a peachcolored scarf my gaze went to her ring finger and i blanched you could run a city on the sparkle that thing put out ellasbeth sat beside me a shade too close for my liking maggie she said lightly ill have tea and biscuits please i ate while out yes maam maggie said as she leaned through the open archway her tone lacked utterly in any warmth clearly maggie didnt like ellasbeth either ellasbeth fixed a smile to her face setting her long fragilelooking fingers on the table to best show off her engagement ring bitch seems we got off the horse on the wrong side ms morgan she said cheerfully have you and trenton known each other long i didnt like ellasbeth i think id be pretty upset myself if i came home and found a girl in nicks bathtub but after seeing her shouting at trent i couldnt find any sympathy for her accusing someone of cheating is harsh my smile faltered as i realized i had almost done the same thing to nick i had accused him of dumping me asking if there was someone else there was a difference but not much shit i had to apologize that he hadnt told me where hed been going the last three months while avoiding me didnt seem like enough reason anymore at least i hadnt called him any names jerking myself from my thoughts i smiled at ellasbeth oh trent and i go back a long way i said lightly twirling a curl of my hair about my finger and remembering its new shortness we met at camp as children sort of romantic when you think about it i smiled at trents suddenly blank look really she turned to trent the hint of a tiger growling in her voices soft cadence sitting up i tucked my legs under me to sit crosslegged running my finger across the rim of the mug suggestively he was such a cub when he was younger full of fire and spirit i had to fight him off the dear boy thats where he got that scar on his lower arm i looked at trent i cant believe you havent told ellasbeth trent you arent still embarrassed about that are you ellasbeths eye twitched but her smile never faltered maggie set a delicate looking cup full of an amber liquid by her elbow and quietly walked away her carefully shaped eyebrows high ellasbeth took in trents silent posture and his lack of denial her fingertips made one rolling cadence against the table in agitation i see she said then stood trenton i do believe i will catch a flight out tonight after all trent met her gaze he looked tired and a bit relieved if that is what you want love she leaned close to him her eyes on me its to give you the chance to settle your affairssweetness she said her lips shifting the air about his ear still watching me she lightly kissed his cheek there was no feeling in her eyes beyond a vindictive glint call me tomorrow not a flicker of emotion crossed trent nothing and its very absence chilled me ill count the hours he said his voice giving no clue either both of their eyes were on me as his hand rose to touch her cheek but he didnt kiss her back should maggie pack up your tea no still watching me she straightened her hand lingering possessively on his shoulder the picture they made was both beautiful and strong and united i remembered the reflection of trent and me at saladans boat here was the bond that had been lacking between us it wasnt love though it wasmoreofmybrowfurrowed abusiness merger it was a pleasure meeting you rachel ellasbeth said pulling my thoughts back to the present and thank you for accompanying my fiancé tonight your services are undoubtedly wellpracticed and appreciated its a shame he wont be calling upon them again i leaned across the table to shake her offered hand with a neutral pressure i think she had just called me a whoreagain i suddenly didnt know what was going on did he like her or didnt he have a nice flight out i said i will thank you her hand slipped from mine and she drew a step back walk me to the car she asked trent her voice smooth and satisfied im not dressed love he said softly still touching her jonathan can take your bags a flicker of annoyance crossed her and i flashed her a catty smile turning she walked out to the hallway overlooking the great room jonathan she called her heels clacking my god the two played mind games with each other as if it was an olympic sport trent exhaled putting my feet on the floor i made a wry face shes nice his expression went sour no she isnt but shes going to be my wife id appreciate it if you wouldnt imply anymore that we are sleeping together i smiled a real one this time i just wanted her to leave maggie bustled close putting down table settings and taking away ellasbeths teacup and saucer nasty nasty woman she muttered her motions quick and sharp and you can sack me if you want mr kalamack but i dont like her and i never will you watch shell bring some woman with her who will take over my kitchen rearrange my cupboards push me out never maggie trent soothed his posture shifting to a companionable ease we all have to make the best of it oh worra worra worra she mumbled as she made her way back into the kitchen feeling more relaxed now that ellasbeth was gone i took another sip of that wonderful coffee shes nice i said looking at the kitchen his green eyes boyishly soft he nodded yes she is shes not an elf i said and his eyes jerked to mine ellasbeth is i added and his look went closed again youre getting uncomfortably adept ms morgan he said leaning away from me putting my elbows to either side of the white plate i rested my chin on the bridge my hands made thats ellasbeths problem you know she feels like she is a broodmare trent shook out his napkin and put it on his lap his robe was slowly coming undone to show a pair of executivelooking pajamas it was somewhat of a disappointmentid been hoping for boxers ellasbeth doesnt want to move to cincinnati he said unaware that i was sneaking glances at his physique her work and friends are in seattle you wouldnt be able to tell by looking at her but shes one of the worlds best nuclear transplant engineers my surprised silence brought his attention up and i stared at him she can take the nucleus of a damaged cell and transplant it into a healthy one he said oh beautiful and smart she could be miss america if she learned how to lie better but it sounded really close to illegal genetic manipulation to me ellasbeth can work from cincinnati as easily as seattle trent said mistaking my silence for interest ive already financed the universitys research department to update their facilities shes going to put cincinnati on the map for her developments and shes angry that shes being forced to move instead of me he met my questioning eyes its not illegal tomato tomatto i said leaning back when maggie set a crock of butter and a pitcher of steaming syrup on the table and walked away trents green eyes met mine and he shrugged the scent of cooking batter drifted close heady with promise and my mouth watered as maggie returned with two steaming plates of waffles she set one before me hesitating to make sure i was pleased this looks wonderful i said reaching for the butter trent adjusted his plate while he waited for me thanks maggie ill take care of the settings its getting late enjoy the rest of your evening thank you mr kalamack maggie said clearly pleased as she rested a hand atop his shoulder ill clean up the spills before i go more tea or coffee i looked up from pushing the butter to trent they were both waiting for me um no i said as i glanced at my mug thank you this is fine trent echoed maggie nodded as if we were doing something right before she returned to the kitchen humming i smiled when i recognized the odd lullaby all the pretty little horses lifting a lid to a covered container i found it full of crushed strawberries my eyes widened tiny whole ones the size of my pinky nail made a ring around the rim as if it was june not december and i wondered where he had gotten them i eagerly ladled berries on top of my waffle looking up when i realized trent was watching me you want some of these when youre done with them i went to take another scoop then hesitated dropping the spoon back in i pushed them across the table the small noise of clinking silverware seemed loud as i poured the syrup you do know the last man i saw in a robe i beat into unconsciousness with a chair leg i quipped desperate to break the silence trent almost smiled ill be careful the waffle was crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside easily cut with a fork trent used a knife i carefully put the perfect square into my mouth so i wouldnt dribble oh god i said around my full mouth and giving up on manners is it because we almost died that this tastes so good or is she the best cook on earth it was real butter and the maple syrup had the dusky flavor that said it was a hundred percent real not two percent not seven percent it was real maple syrup remembering the stash of maple candy i once found while searching trents office i wasnt surprised trent put an elbow on the table his eyes on his plate maggie puts mayonnaise in them it gives them an interesting texture i hesitated staring at my plate then deciding if i couldnt taste it there wasnt enough egg to worry about mayonnaise a faint sound of dismay came from the kitchen mr kalamack maggie came out wiping her hands on her apron dont be giving my secrets away or youll find tea leaves in your brew tomorrow she scolded leaning to look over his shoulder he widened his smile to become an entirely different person then ill be able to read my fortune have a good night maggie harrumphing she walked out passing the sunken living room and making a left turn at the walkway overlooking the great hall her steps were almost soundless and the closing of the main door was loud hearing running water in the new silence i ate another bite drug lord murderer bad man i reminded myself but he wasnt talking and i was starting to feel uncomfortable hey im sorry about the water in your limo i offered trent wiped his mouth i think i can handle a little dry cleaning after what you did still i said as my gaze slid to the crock of strawberries im sorry seeing my eyes flick from the fruit to him trent made a questioning face he wasnt going to offer them to me so i reached out and took them takatas car isnt nicer than yours i said upending the container over the remains of my waffle i was just jerking you around i figured that out he said wryly he wasnt eating and i looked up to see him with knife and fork in hand watching me scrape the last of the strawberries out with my butter knife what i said as i put the crock down you werent going to have any more he carefully cut another square of waffle youve been in contact with takata then i shrugged ivy and i are working security at his concert next friday i wedged a small bite into my mouth and closed my eyes as i chewed this is really good he didnt say anything and my eyes opened are youahgoing no turning back to my plate i glanced at him from around my hair good i ate another bite the man is something else when we talked he was wearing orange pants and hes got his hair out to here i gestured showing trent but you probably know him personally trent was still working on his waffle with the steady pace of a snail we met once content i slid all the strawberries off the remnants of my waffle and concentrated on them he picked me up off the street gave me a ride dumped me off on the expressway i smiled at least he had someone bring my car along have you heard his early release music i could always keep the conversation going if it was about music and trent liked takata i knew that much about him red ribbons trent asked an odd intentness to his voice nodding i swallowed and pushed my plate away there were no more strawberries and i was full have you heard it i asked settling back in my chair with my coffee ive heard it leaving a shallow wedge of waffle uneaten trent set his fork down and pushed it symbolically away his hands went to his tea and he leaned back in his chair i went to take a sip of coffee freezing as i realized trent had mirrored both my posture and my motion oh crap he likes me mirroring motions was classic in the body language of attraction feeling as if id stumbled into somewhere i didnt want to go i intentionally leaned forward and put the flat of my arm on the table my fingers encircling my warm mug of coffee i wouldnt play this game i wouldnt youre mine yet wholly you trent said dryly clearly oblivious to my thoughts the man has no sense of discretion its going to catch up with him someday eyes distant and unaware he put the flat of his arm on the table my face went cold and i choked but it wasnt because of what he had done it was because of what he had said holy crap i swore youre a vamps scion trents eyes jerked to mine excuse me the lyrics i sputtered he didnt release those its on the vamp track only undead vampires and their scions can hear oh my god youve been bitten lips pressed together trent picked up his fork and cut a triangle of waffle using it to sop up the last of the syrup on his plate im not a vampires scion and ive never been bit my heart pounded and i stared then how do you know them i heard you i heard you say them straight off the vamp track he arched his thin eyebrows at me how do you know about the vamp track ivy trent rose wiping his fingers clean he tightened his robe and crossed the room to the casual livingroom pit with the wallsized tv and stereo i watched him pluck a cd from atop a shelf and drop it into a player while it spun up he punched in a track and red ribbons came from hidden speakers though it was soft i could feel the base line thumping into me trent showed a tired acceptance as he turned with a set of wireless headphones they were professional looking the type that fit over your ears instead of resting on them listen he said extending them to me i drew back suspiciously and he wedged them on my head my jaw dropped and my eyes flew to his it was red ribbons but it wasnt the same song it was incredibly rich seeming to go right to my brain skipping my ears it echoed within me swirling behind and through my thoughts there were impossible highs and rumbling lows that set my tongue tingling it was the same song but there was so much more i realized i was staring at my plate what i had been missing was beautiful pulling in a breath of air i drew my head up trent had sat again watching stunned i reached to touch the headphones reassuring myself that they were really there the vamp track was indescribable and then the woman started to sing i looked at trent feeling panicked it was so beautiful he nodded with a cheshire cat smile her voice was lyrical both rough and tragic it pulled emotion from me i wasnt aware i could feel a deep painful regret unrequited need i didnt know i whispered as i listened to the end unable to take the headphones off trent took our plates to the kitchen he came back with an insulated pot of tea topping off his cup before sitting down the track ended leaving only silence numb i slid the headphones off and set them by my coffee i didnt know i said again thinking that my eyes must look haunted ivy can hear all that why doesnt takata release them sounding like that trent adjusted his position in his chair he does but only the undead can hear it i touched the headphones but you i made them after finding out about the vamp track i wasnt sure they would work with witches i gather by your expression that they did my head bobbed loosely ley line magic i questioned a smile almost shy flickered over him i specialize in misdirection quen thinks it a waste of time but youd be surprised what a person will do for a pair of those i pulled my eyes from the headphones i can imagine trent sipped his tea leaning back in speculation you dontwant a pair do you i took a breath frowning at the faint taunt in his voice not for what youre asking no setting my mug of coffee at arms length i stood his earlier behavior of mimicking my motions was suddenly abundantly clear he was an expert in manipulation he had to know what signals he was sending most people didntat least consciouslyand that he had tried to lay the groundwork to try to romance my help when money wouldnt buy it was contemptible thanks for dinner i said it was fabulous surprise brought trent straight ill tell maggie you en joyed it he said his lips tightening hed made a mistake and he knew it i wiped my hands off on my sweatshirt id appreciate that ill get my things ill tell quen youre ready to go his voice was flat leaving him sitting at the table i walked away i caught a glimpse of him as i turned and went into ellasbeths rooms he was touching the headphones his posture unable to hide his annoyance the bandage on his head and his bare feet made him look vulnerable and alone stupid lonely man i thought stupid ignorant me for pitying him twentyeight i scooped my shoulder bag up from the bathroom floor making a slow circuit to be sure id gotten everything remembering my garment bag i went to retrieve it and my coat from the changing room my jaw dropped at the open phone book on the low table and my face flamed she had it open to escorts not independent runners she thinks im a hooker i muttered ripping the page out and jamming it into my jeans pocket damn it i didnt care that we both did legit escort service occasionally ivy was going to take it out ticked i shrugged into my ugly coat with the fake fur about the collar snatched up my unworn outfit and left almost running into trent on the open walkway whoa sorry i stammered taking two steps back he tightened the tie on his robe his eyes empty what are you going to do about lee the nights events rushed back making me frown nothing trent rocked back surprise making him look young nothing my focus blurred as i recalled the people scattered where they fell past my saving lee was a butcher he could have gotten them out but had left them so it would look like a hit by piscary which it was but i couldnt believe that kisten would do that he must have warned them he had to have but trent was standing before me his green eyes questioning its not my problem i said and pushed past him trent was right behind me his bare feet silent he tried to kill you not slowing i said over my shoulder he tried to kill you i got in the way twice youre not going to do anything my gaze went to the huge window it was hard to tell in the dark but i thought it was clear again i wouldnt say that im going to go home and take a nap im tired i headed for that sixinchthick door at the end of the walkway trent was still behind me you dont care hes going to flood cincinnati with unsafe brimstone killing hundreds my jaw tightened as i thought of ivys sister the jarring from my steps went up my spine youll take care of him i said dryly seeing as it touches your business interests you have no desire to seek revenge none whatsoever his voice was thick with disbelief and i stopped look i got in his way hes stronger than me you on the other handid just as soon see you fry elfboy maybe cincinnati would be better without you trents smooth face went blank you dont seriously believe that shifting my garment bag i exhaled i dont know what i believe you arent honest with me excuse me i have to go home and feed my fish i walked away headed for the door i knew the way to the front and quen would probably catch up with me somewhere in between wait the pleading tone in his voice pulled me to a stop my hand touching the door i turned as quen appeared at the foot of the stairway his face worried and threatening somehow i didnt think it was because i was about to go wandering through the kalamack compound but of what trent might say my hand fell from the doorknob this might be worth staying for if i tell you what i know of your father will you help me with lee at the ground floor quen shifted sahan trents brow furrowed defiantly exitus acta probat my pulse quickened and i adjusted the fake fur collar of my coat hey keep it english boys i snapped and the last time you said you would tell me about my dad i came away with his favorite color and what he liked on his hot dog trents attention went to the floor of the great room and quen his security officer shook his head would you like to sit down trent said and quen grimaced sure eyeing him warily i retraced my steps and followed him to the ground floor he settled himself in a chair tucked between the window and a back wall his comfortable posture telling me this was where he sat when he was in this room he had a view of the dark waterfall and there were several books their ribbon bookmarks giving evidence of past afternoons in the sun behind him on the wall were four tattered visconti tarot cards each carefully protected behind glass my face went cold as i realized that the captive lady on the devil card looked like ceri sahan quen said softly this is not a good idea trent ignored him and quen retreated to stand behind him where he could glower at me i put my garment bag over a nearby chair and sat my legs crossed at the knees and my foot bobbing impatiently helping trent with lee would be a small thing if he told me anything of importance hell i was taking the bastard out myself as soon as i got home and whipped up a few charms yeah i was a liar but i was always honest with myself about it trent edged to the end of his seat his elbows on his knees and his gaze on the night two millennium ago the tide turned in our effort to reclaim the everafter from the demons my eyes widened foot stilling i took my coat off this might take a while to get to my dad trent met my gaze and seeing my acceptance of this roundabout way he eased back in a squeak of leather quen made a pained sound deep in his throat the demons saw their end coming trent said softly in an unusual effort of cooperation they set aside their internal squabblings for supremacy and worked to twist a curse upon all of us we didnt even realize it had happened for almost three generations not recognizing the higher fatality percentage of our newborn for what it was i blinked the demons were responsible for the elves failure i thought it had been their habit of hybridizing with humans infant mortality increased exponentially each generation trent said our tenuous grip on victory slipped from us in tiny coffins and the sound of mourning eventually we realized they had twisted a curse on us changing our dna so that it spontaneously broke each generation becoming progressively worse my stomach roiled genetic genocide you tried to repair the damage by hybridizing with humans i asked hearing the smallness of my voice his eyes flicked from the window to me that was a last ditch effort to save something until a way could be developed to fix it it was ultimately a disaster but it did keep us alive until we improved the genetic techniques to arrest and ultimately repair most of the degradation when the turn made it illegal the labs went underground desperate to save the few of us who managed to survive the turn scattered us and i find a confused child about every other year feeling unreal i whispered your hospitals and orphanages i had never guessed there was a motive other than public relations behind them trent smiled faintly upon seeing the understanding in my eyes quen looked positively ill his wrinkles sliding into each other his hands behind his back staring at nothing in a silent protest trent eased forward again i find them sickly and dying and theyre always grateful for their health and the chance to seek out more of their kin its been a thin line the last fifty years were balanced this next generation will save or damn us the thought of ceri intruded squelched what does this have to do with my dad a quick nod bobbed his head your father was working with mine trying to find an old sample of elven dna in the everafter that we could use as a pattern we can fix what we know is wrong but to make it better to bring the infant mortality down to where we can survive without medical help we needed a sample from someone that died before the curse was twisted something that we can pattern the repairs upon a sound of disbelief escaped me you need a sample over two thousand years old he lifted one shoulder in a half shrug his shoulders didnt seem as wide in the robe and he looked comfortably vulnerable its possible there were many pockets of elves that practiced mummification all we need is one cell even marginally perfect just one my eyes flicked to a stoic quen then him piscary almost killed me trying to find out if you hired me to go into the everafter its not going to happen im not going there i thought of al waiting for me my agreement worthless on his side of the lines no way an apologetic slant came into trents eyes as he watched me from across the coffee table im sorry i didnt mean for piscary to focus on you i would have rather told you the entire story last year when you quit the is but i was concerned he took a slow breath i didnt trust you to keep your mouth shut about our existence you trust me now i said thinking of jenks not really but i have to not really but i have to what the hell kind of an answer is that were too few to let the world know we exist trent was saying his eyes on his laced fingers it would be too easy for a zealot to pick us off and i have enough trouble with piscary trying to do just that he knows the threat we will pose to his standing if our numbers increase my mouth twisted and i pushed back into the leather politics it was always political cant you just untwist the curse his face was weary as he turned to the window we did when we discovered what had happened but the damage remains and would be worsening if we didnt find every elven child and fix what we can my lips parted in understanding the camp thats why you were there he shifted reluctantly in his chair looking suddenly nervous yes i pressed back farther into the cushions not knowing if i wanted him to answer my next question whywhy was i at that camp trents stiff posture eased you have a somewhat unusual genetic defect a good five percent of the witch population has ita recessive gene which is harmless unless they pair up one in four chance i guessed if both parents have it and if the two recessive genes pair up it kills you before your first birthday my father managed to keep it suppressed in you until you were old enough to handle a full course of treatment he did this a lot i asked my stomach knotting i was alive because of illegal genetic manipulation it was what i had guessed but now i knew for sure maybe i shouldnt let it bother me the entire elf race relied on illegal medicine to remain in existence no trent said records indicate that with very few exceptions he allowed infants with your affliction to die their parents not knowing there was a cure its rather expensive money i said and trents jaw clenched if the decision was based on money you wouldnt have seen your first birthday he said tightly my father didnt take one cent for saving your life he did it because he was friends with your father you and lee are the only two running about under the sun that he pulled back from that death and that was because of friendship he didnt take a dime for saving either of you personally im starting to think he made a mistake this isnt making me want to help you i said snidely but trent gave me a tired look my father was a good man he said softly he wouldnt refuse to help your father save your life when your father had already devoted his life to help him save our entire race frowning i put a hand to my stomach i didnt like what i was feeling my father didnt sacrifice his life in exchange for minewhich was a good thing but he wasnt the upright honest hardworking is runner i had thought he had willingly helped trents father with his illegal activities long before i got sick im not a bad person rachel trent said but i will eliminate anyone who threatens to stop the flow of money coming in my research to repair the damage the demons did to my peoples genome isnt cheap if we could find an old enough sample we could fix it completely but it has degraded to the point where we dont know even the color of the pieces anymore my thoughts lighted on ceri and i steeled my face the thought of her and trent meeting was intolerable besides she was only a thousand years old trents smooth features went tired with a worry far beyond his years if the money stops the next generation of elves will start to slip again only if we find a sample from before the curse was twisted can we fix it completely and my species will have a chance your father thought it was a task worth dying for my eyes flicked to the tarot card with ceris likeness and i kept my mouth shut trent would use her like a tissue and throw her away trent leaned back his gaze going sharp on mine well ms morgan he said managing to appear in control even wearing a robe and pjs have i given you enough for a long moment i looked at him watching his jaw slowly tighten when he realized i was balancing and not knowing which way i was going to jump feeling cocky and selfassured i raised my eyebrows oh hell trent i was going after lee anyway what do you think i was doing in your bathtub for two hours washing my hair i had no choice but to tag lee after he tried to blow me up if i didnt every mark i put behind bars was going to come out gunning for me trents face went annoyed youve got it figured out already dont you he asked irritation thick in his rivergray voice mostly i beamed and quen sighed clearly having seen beforehand that i was going to snooker his boss but good i just need to call my insurance agent and set it up knowing i had gotten the better of trent was worth more than he could ever line my pockets with and i snorted when quen whispered her insurance agent still sitting i pointed a finger at trent ive got two things for you to do two things then you back off and let me work im not doing this as a committee understand eyebrows high trent said flatly what do you want first i want you to go to the fib and tell them lee knocked out all those people and locked the doors knowing there was a bomb on the boat trent laughed his warm voice taking on a biting edge what is that going to get you theyll go looking for him hell go underground a warrant will be filed and with that i have a legal right to pick him up trents eyes widened behind him quen nodded thats why trent murmured i couldnt help my smile you can run from the law but standing up your insurance adjustor i shook my head not a good idea youre going to get in to kill him posing as an insurance agent i wished i could say i was surprised god he was so arrogant i dont kill people trent i haul their asses to lockup and i need a reason for keeping him there i thought he was your friend a hint of uncertainty flickered over trent i thought he was too maybe his girlfriend knocked him on the head and forced him into leaving i said not believing it wouldnt you feel bad if you killed him then found out he had tried to save you trent gave me a weary look always seeing the best in a person ms morgan yeah except with you i started making a mental list of who i had to tell i was alive kisten jenksif hed listenceri keasleynick oh god my mom that one ought to be fun pushing his fingers into his forehead trent sighed you have no idea how this works affronted i puffed at him and his smarterthanthou attitude work with me here huh letting the bad guy live might be good for your soul he didnt look convinced he looked patronizing letting lee live is a mistake his family wont like him in jail theyd rather have him dead than be an embarrassment well isnt that just too bad im not going to kill him and im not going to let you kill him either so sit down shut up hold on and watch how real people solve problems trent shook his head to make his hair float about his redrimmed ears whats arresting lee going to get you his lawyers will have him out before he can sit on a jailcell cot voice of experience i mocked seeing as i almost had him there last fall yes he said darkly the fib has my fingerprints on file thanks to you and the is has a sample of my dna for identification purposes suck it up quen made a soft sound and i suddenly realized we were arguing like children looking peeved trent settled back in his chair and laced his fingers over his middle fatigue pulled at him admitting i was on that boat is going to be difficult we werent seen leaving and it would be hard to explain how we survived and everyone else died be inventive maybe the truth i said cockily pushing trents buttons was kinda fun everybody knows hes trying to jerk cincinnati out from under you and piscary go with it just leave me dead in the river trent eyed me carefully youre going to tell your fib captain youre alive yes thats one of the reasons youre going to file with the fib and not the is my gaze went to the stairway as jonathans tall form started down it he seemed irritated and i wondered what was up no one said anything as he approached and i wished i hadnt pushed trent so far the man didnt look happy it would be just like him to kill lee out from under me you want saladan out of the city i said ill do that for you for free all i want is you to file a complaint and pay for the lawyer to keep him in prison can you do that for me his face went empty as thoughts he didnt want to share with me passed through his mind nodding slowly he beckoned jonathan closer taking that as a yes i felt my shoulders ease thanks i muttered as the tall man bent to whisper in trents ear and trents gaze shot to me i strained to hear getting nothing keep him at the gate trent said glancing at quen i dont want him on the grounds who i said wondering trent stood and tightened the tie on his robe i told mr felps id arrange for your return but he seems to think youre in need of rescuing hes waiting for you at the gatehouse kisten i stifled a jerk id be glad to see him but i was afraid of the answers he would have for me i didnt want him to have planted that bomb but ivy had said he did damn it why did i always fall for the bad boys while the three men waited i stood and gathered my things hesitating before i stuck my hand out thank you for your hospitalitytrent i said pausing only briefly as i tried to decide what to call him and thanks for not letting me freeze to death i added a soft smile quirked the corners of his lips at the hesitation and he met my firm grip with his own it was the least i could do seeing as you kept me from drowning he answered his brow furrowed clearly wanting to say more breath held he changed his mind and turned away jonathan will you accompany ms morgan to the gatehouse i want to talk to quen of course sahan i glanced back at trent as i followed jonathan to the stairs my mind already on what i had to do next id call edden first at his home number soon as i got to my rolodex he might still be up then my mother then jenks this was going to work it had to but as i quickened my pace to keep up with jonathan a wash of concern went though me sure i was going to get in to see saladan but then what twentynine kisten had the heat on full and the warm air shifted a strand of my shorter hair to tickle my neck i reached to turn it down thinking he was laboring under the false assumption that i was still suffering from hypothermia and warmer was better it was stifling the sensation only strengthened by the darkness we drove through i cracked the window and eased back as the cold night slipped in the living vamp snuck a look at me jerking his gaze back to the headlightlit road as soon as our eyes met are you okay he asked for the third time you havent said a word shaking my open coat to make a draft i nodded he had gotten a hug at trents gate but it was obvious he felt the hesitation thanks for picking me up i said i wasnt too keen on quen taking me home i ran my hand across the door handle of kistens corvette comparing it to trents limo i liked kistens car better kisten blew out his breath in a long exhalation i needed to get out ivy was driving me crazy he glanced away from the dark road im glad you told her as soon as you did you talked i asked surprised and a little worried why couldnt i like nice men well she talked he made an embarrassed noise she threatened to cut off both my heads if i jerked your blood out from under her sorry i looked out the window becoming more upset i didnt want to have to walk away from kisten because he had meant for those people to die in some stupid power struggle they werent aware of he took a breath to say something and i interrupted with a quick would you mind if i used your phone his expression wary he pulled his shiny phone from a belt holster and handed it to me not particularly happy i called information and got the number for davids company and for a few dollars more they connected me why not it wasnt my phone while kisten silently drove i worked my way through their automated system it was almost midnight he ought to have been in unless he was on a run or had gone home early hi i said when i finally got a real person i need to talk to david hue im sorry an older woman said with an overabundance of professionalism mr hue isnt here presently can i give you to one of our other agents no i said before she could dump me back into the system is there a number i can reach him at its an emergency note to self never ever throw anyones card away again if youd like to leave your name and number what part of emergency didnt she understand look i said with a sigh i really need to talk to him im his new partner and i lost his extension if you could just youre his new partner the woman interrupted the shock in her voice gave me pause was david that hard to work with yeah i said flicking a glance at kisten i was sure he could hear both ends of the conversation with his vamp ears i really need to talk to him ah can you hold for a moment you bet kistens face brightened in the glare of oncoming cars his jaw was fixed and his eyes were riveted to the road there was a crackling of the phone being passed then a cautious this is david hue david i said smiling its rachel he didnt say anything and i rushed to keep him on the line wait dont hang up ive got to talk to you its about a claim there was the sound of a hand going over the phone its okay i heard him say ill take this one why dont you make an early night of it ill close down your computer thanks david ill see you tomorrow his secretary said faintly and after a long moment his voice came back on the line rachel he said warily is this about the fish ive already filed the claim if youve perjured me im going to be very upset what is it with you thinking the worst of me i questioned miffed my eyes slid to kisten as he gripped the wheel tighter i made a mistake with jenks okay im trying to fix it but ive got something you might be interested in there was a short silence im listening he said cautiously my breath puffed out in relief fidgeting i dug for a pen in my shoulder bag opening my datebook i clicked my pen open ah you work by commission right something like that david said well you know that boat that exploded i snuck a glance at kisten the light from the oncoming traffic made little glints in his stubble as he clenched his jaw there was a rattling of computer keys in the background still listening my pulse quickened does your company own the policy on it the sound of keys quickened and vanished seeing as we insure everything piscary isnt interested in probably there was another spurt of tapping keys yes we have it great i sighed this was going to work i was on it when it exploded i heard the squeak of a chair through the line somehow that doesnt surprise me you saying it wasnt an accident ah no i flicked a glance at kisten his knuckles gripping the wheel were white really it wasnt a question and the sound of tapping keys started up again shortly followed by the hum of a printer i shifted in kistens heated leather seats and stuck the end of the pen in my mouth would i be correct that your company doesnt pay out when property is destroyed because of acts of war or gangrelated activity david interrupted no we dont fantastic i said not thinking it necessary to tell him i was sitting next to the guy who had arranged the whole thing god please let kisten have an answer for me how would you like me to come down there and sign a paper for you id like that really fine david hesitated then added you dont strike me as the kind of woman who commits acts of random kindness rachel what do you want out this my gaze ran down kistens clenched jaw to his strong shoulders then lingered on his hands gripping the wheel as if he was trying to squeeze the iron out of it i want to be with you when you go out to adjust saladans claim kisten jerked apparently only now understanding why i was talking to david the silence on the other end of the line was thick ah david murmured im not going to kill him im going to arrest him i quickly offered the thrum of the engine rumbling up through my feet shifted and steadied its not that he said i dont work with anyone and im not working with you my face burned i knew he thought very little of me after finding i had kept information from my own partner but it was davids fault it came out look i said turning away from kisten as he stared at me i just saved your company a wad of money you get me in when you go to adjust his claim then back out of the way and let me and my team work i glanced at kisten something had shifted in him his grip on the wheel was loose and his face was empty there was a short silence and afterward afterward the moving lights made kistens face unreadable nothing we tried working together it didnt work out you get an extension on finding a new partner there was a long silence thats it thats it i clicked my pen closed and threw it and my datebook into my bag why did i even try to be organized okay he finally said ill bark down the hole and see what comes up fantastic i said genuinely glad though he seemed less than pleased hey in a few hours im going to have died in that explosion so dont worry about it okay a tired sound escaped him fine ill call you tomorrow when the claim comes in great ill see you then davids lack of excitement was depressing the phone clicked off without him saying goodbye and i closed it and handed it back to kisten thanks i said feeling very awkward i thought you were turning me in kisten said softly mouth falling open i stared only now understanding his previous tension no i whispered feeling afraid for some reason he had sat there and done nothing as he thought i was turning him in shoulders stiff and eyes on the road he said rachel i didnt know he was going to let those people die my breath caught i forced it out then took another talk to me i said feeling lightheaded i stared out the window hands in my lap and my stomach clenched please let me be wrong this time i looked across the car and after his eyes flicked to the rearview mirror he pulled off to the side of the road my gut clenched damn it why did i have to like him why couldnt i like nice men why did the power and personal strength that attracted me always seem to translate into callous disregard for other peoples lives my body shifted forward and back when he came to a sudden halt the car shook as traffic continued to pass us at eighty miles an hour but here it was still kisten shifted in his seat to face me reaching over the gearshift to cradle my hands in my lap his dayold stubble glinted in the lights from the oncoming traffic across the median and his blue eyes were pinched rachel he said and i held my breath hoping he was going to tell me it had all been a mistake i arranged to have that bomb strapped to the boiler i closed my eyes i didnt intend for those people to die i called saladan he continued and i opened my eyes when a passing truck shook us i told candice there was a bomb on his boat hell i told her where it was and that if they touched it it would detonate i gave them plenty of time to get everyone off i wasnt trying to kill people i was trying to make a media circus and sink his business it never occurred to me he would walk away and leave them to die i misjudged him he said a bitter recrimination in his voice and they paid for my shortsightedness with their lives god rachel if i even guessed he would do that id have found another way that you were on that boat he took a breath i almost killed you i swallowed hard feeling the lump in my throat grow less but youve killed people before i said knowing the problem wasnt tonight but a history of belonging to piscary and having to carry out his will kisten leaned back though his hands never left mine i killed my first person when i was eighteen oh god i tried to pull away but he gently tightened his grip you need to hear this he said if you want to walk away i want you to know the truth so you dont come back and if you stay then its not because you made a decision based on too little information steeling myself i looked at his eyes gauging them sincere and perhaps carrying a hint of guilt and past hurt youve done this before i whispered feeling afraid i was one in a string of women they had all left maybe they were smarter than me he nodded his eyes closing briefly im tired of being hurt rachel im a nice guy who just happened to kill his first person at eighteen i swallowed taking my hands back under the pretense of tucking my hair behind an ear kisten felt me draw away and turned to look out the front window placing his hands back on the wheel i had told him not to make my decisions for me i suppose i deserved every sordid detail stomach twisting i said go on kisten stared at nothing as the traffic passed accentuating the point of stillness in the car i killed my second about a year later he said his voice flat she was an accident i managed to keep from ending anyone elses life again until last year when i watched him as he took a breath and exhaled my muscles trembled waiting for it god im sorry rachel he whispered i swore id try to never have to kill anyone again maybe thats why piscary doesnt want me as his scion now he wants someone to share the experience and i wont do it he was the one who actually killed them but i was there i helped i held them down kept them busy while he gleefully butchered them one by one that they deserved it hardly seems justification anymore not with the way he did it kisten i said hesitantly pulse fast he turned and i froze trying not to be frightened his eyes had gone black in the memory that feeling of pure domination is a twisted addictive high he said the lost hunger in his voice chilling me it took me a long time to learn how to let go of that so i could remember the inhuman savagery of it hidden by the jolt of pure adrenaline i lost myself with piscarys thoughts and strength flooding me but i know how to wield it now rachel i can be both his scion and a just person i can be his enforcer and a gentle lover i know i can walk the balance hes punishing me right now but hell take me back and when he does ill be ready what the hell was i doing here so i said hearing my voice tremble thats it yeah thats it he said flatly the first was under piscarys orders to make an example of someone luring underage kids it was excessive but i was young and stupid trying to prove to piscary that id do anything for him and he took enjoyment from seeing me agonize about it later the last time was to stop a new camarilla from forming they were advocating a return to preturn traditions of abducting people no one would miss the woman his eyes flicked to me thats the one that haunts me thats when i decided to be honest when i could i swore id never end another innocents life again it doesnt matter that she lied to me his eyes closed and his grip on the wheel trembled the light from across the median showed the lines of pain on his face oh god he had killed someone in a passionate rage and then i ended sixteen lives tonight he whispered i was so stupid he admitted to killing peoplepeople the is probably would thank him for getting rid of but people nevertheless i had come into this knowing he wasnt the safe boyfriend but id had the safe boyfriend and always ended up hurt and despite the brutality he was capable of he was being honest people had died tonight in a horrible tragedy but that hadnt been his intent kisten my eyes dropped to his hands his short round nails carefully kept clean and close to his fingertips i had the bomb set he said guilt making his voice harsh i hesitantly reached to take his hands from the wheel my fingers felt cold against his you didnt kill them lee did his eyes were black in the uncertain light when he turned to me i sent my hand behind his neck to pull him closer and he resisted he was a vampire and that wasnt an easy thing to beit wasnt an excuse it was a fact that he was being forthright meant more to me than his ugly past and he had sat there while he thought i was turning him in and did nothing he had ignored what he believed and trusted me i would try to trust him i couldnt help but feel for him watching ivy i had come to the conclusion that being a master vampires scion was very much like being in a mentally abusive relationship where love had been perverted by sadism kisten was trying to distance himself from his masters masochistic demands he had distanced himself he had distanced himself so far that piscary had dumped him for a soul even more desperate for acceptance my roommate swell kisten was alone he was hurting he was being honest with mei couldnt walk away we had both done questionable things and i couldnt label him as evil when i was the one with the demon mark circumstances had made our choices for us i did the best i could so did he it wasnt your fault they died i said again feeling as if i had found a new way to see before me lay the same world but i was looking around corners what was i becoming was i a fool to trust or a wiser person finding the capacity to forgive kisten heard the acceptance of his past in my voice and the relief reflected in his face was so strong that it was almost painful my hand on his neck slid forward drawing him closer over the console its okay i whispered as his hands slipped from my fingers and took my shoulders i understand i dont think you can he insisted then well deal with it when i do tilting my head i closed my eyes and leaned to find him his grip on my shoulder eased and i found myself reaching after him drawn in as our lips touched my fingers pressed into his neck urging him closer a jolt struck through me bringing my blood to the surface tingling through me as his kiss deepened promising more it didnt stem from my scar and i drew his hand to it almost gasping when his fingertips traced the light almost unseen scar tissue the thought of ivys dating guide flitted through me and i saw it all in an entirely new way oh god the things i could do with this man maybe i needed the dangerous man i thought as a wild emotion rose in me only someone who had done wrong could understand that yes i did questionable things too but that i was still a good person if kisten could be both then maybe that meant i could be too and with that i abandoned all pretense of thought his hand feeling my pulse and my lips pulling on his i sent my tongue hesitantly between his lips knowing a gentle inquiry would strike a hotter chord than a demanding touch i found a smooth tooth and i curled my tongue around it teasing kistens breath came fast and he jerked away i froze as he was suddenly not there the heat of him still a memory on my skin im not wearing my caps he said the black swelling in his eyes and my scar pulsing in promise i was so worried about you i didnt take the time toim not he took a shaking breath god you smell good heart pounding i forced myself back into my seat watching him as i tucked my hair behind an ear i wasnt sure i cared if he had his caps on or not sorry i said breathlessly blood still pounding through me i didnt mean to go that far but you just sort of pull it out of me dont be sorry youre not the one whos been neglectingthings blowing his breath out kisten tried to hide his heady look of want under the rougher emotions was a soft look of grateful understanding and relief i had accepted his ugly past knowing his future might not be any better saying nothing he put the car in first and accelerated i held the door until we slid back onto the road glad nothing had changed though everything was different why are you so good to me he said softly as we picked up speed and passed a car because i think i could love you i thought but i couldnt say it yet thirty my head came up at the faint sound of knocking giving me a warning look ivy stood stretching for the kitchens ceiling ill get it she said its probably more flowers i took a bite of cinnamon toast and muttered around my full mouth if its food bring it back will you sighing ivy walked out both sexy and casual in her black exercise tights and a thighlength baggy sweater the radio was on in the living room and i had mixed feelings about the announcer talking about the tragedy of the boat explosion early last night they even had a clip of trent telling everyone i had died saving his life this was really odd i thought as i wiped butter from my fingers things had been showing up on our doorstep it was nice to know i would be missed and i hadnt known i had touched so many lives it wasnt going to be pretty when i came out of the closet as being alive thoughkind of like standing someone up at the altar and having to give all the presents back course if i died tonight id go to my grave knowing just who my friends were i kinda felt like huck finn yeah ivys wary voice came back through the church im david david hue came a familiar voice and swallowing the last bite of toast i ambled up to the front of the church i was starving and i wondered if ivy was slipping brimstone into my coffee to try to build my bodys reserves after that dunk in the river who is she ivy asked belligerently as i entered the sanctuary and found them on the landing the lowering sun coming in past their feet im his secretary a tidy woman at davids side said smiling can we come in my eyes widened whoa whoa whoa i said waving my hands in protest i cant watch two of you and bring in lee david ran his eyes down my casual sweater and jeans his eyes thick with a calculating evaluation they lingered on my shortened hair dyed a temporary brown just this afternoon as he had suggested over the phone mrs aver isnt going to come with us he said making what was probably an unconscious nod of approval i thought it prudent that your neighbors see me arrive with a woman as well as leave with one youre close to the same body build oh idiot i thought why didnt i think of that mrs aver smiled but i could tell she thought i was an idiot too ill just pop into your bathroom and change and then ill go she said brightly taking a step into the room she set her slim briefcase beside the piano bench and hesitated ivy started this way she said indicating that the woman should follow her thank you youre so kind making a small face for all the hidden undercurrents i watched mrs aver and ivy leave the former making a lot of noise in her bland black heels the latter silent in her slippers their conversation ended with the click of my bathroom door shutting and i turned to david he looked like a completely different were outside of his spandex running pants and shirt and nowhere near the same person the time i saw him leaning against a park tree in a duster that went to his boot tops and a cowboy hat pulled over his eyes his heavy stubble was gone to leave sunroughed cheeks and his long hair was styled and smelled of moss only the highest ranking weres could carry off polish and not look like they were trying but david managed it the threepiece suit and manicured fingernails helped he looked older than his athletic physique would testify with a pair of glasses perched on his nose and a tie snugged up to his neck actually he looked really goodin a professional educated sort of way thanks again for helping me get in to see saladan i said feeling awkward dont thank me he said im getting a huge bonus he set his expensivelooking suitcase on the piano bench he seemed preoccupiednot angry with me but wary and disapproving it made me uncomfortable sensing me watching him he looked up mind if i do a little prep paperwork i shifted back a step no go right ahead you want some coffee david looked at jenkss desk and hesitated brow furrowing he sat astride the piano bench and opened his briefcase up before him no thanks we wont be here that long okay i retreated feeling his dissatisfaction heavy on me i knew he didnt like that i had lied to my partner by omission but all i needed was for him to get me in to see lee i hesitated at the top of the hallway ill go change i wanted to see what you were wearing david looked up from his paperwork his brown eyes distant as he tried to do two things at once youll be wearing mrs avers clothes my eyebrows rose youve done this before i told you the job was a lot more interesting than you would think he said to his papers i waited for him to say something more but he didnt so i went to find ivy feeling awkward and depressed he hadnt said a word about jenks but his disapproval was clear ivy was busy with her maps and pens when i entered saying nothing as i poured a cup of coffee for me and then her what do you think of david i asked setting her cup beside her her head went down and she tapped a colored pen on the table i think youll be okay he seems to know what hes doing and its not like i wont be there leaning against the counter i held my mug with both hands and took a long sip coffee slid down easing my jitters something in ivys posture caught my attention her cheeks were a shade red i think you like him i said and her head jerked up i think you like older men i added especially older men in suits that bite and can plan better than you at that she did flush and i think you should shut up we both started at the soft knock on the archway to the hall it was mrs aver and it was embarrassing that neither of us had heard her come out of the bathroom she was dressed in my robe her clothes over one arm here you go honey she said as handed me her gray suit thanks i set my coffee down and took it if you would drop them off at weresntears dry cleaners they do a good job getting out blood and stitching up small rips do you know where that is i looked at the matronly woman standing before me in my fuzzy blue robe her long brown hair down about her shoulders she looked to be about the same size as me if a bit hippy my hair was a shade darker but it was close enough sure i said she smiled ivy was back at her maps ignoring us her foot silently moving great the were said im going to change and say bye to david before i leave on four feet flashing me a toothy grin she sashayed to the hallway hesitating wheres your back door ivy stood up with a noisy scrape of a chair its broken ill get it for you thank you she said with that same polite smile they left and i slowly i brought the womans clothes to my nose they were still warm from her body heat and the faint scent of musk mixed with a light meadowy smell my lips curved downward at the idea of wearing someone elses clothes but the entire idea was to smell like a were and it wasnt as if she had brought me rags to put on the lined wool suit must have cost her a bundle steps slow and measured i went to my room that dating guide was still out on my dresser and i looked at it with a mix of depression and guilt what had i been thinking wanting to read it again with the idea to drive kisten wild miserable i shoved it in the back of my closet god help me i was an idiot resigned i slipped out of my jeans and sweater soon the clack of nails in the hallway intruded and as i put on my nylons there was the pained sound of nails being pulled from wood the new door wouldnt be in until tomorrow and it wasnt as if she could slip out a window i was feeling very unsure about this and it wasnt anything i could really pinpoint it wasnt going in charmless i thought as i shimmied into the gray skirt and tucked the white blouse in ivy and kisten would be bringing in everything i needed my duffel bag of spells was already packed and waiting in the kitchen and it wasnt because i was going up against someone better in ley line magic i did that all the time i shrugged into the jacket slipping the warrant for lee into an inner pocket wedging my feet into the low heels i had pulled from the back of my closet i stared at my reflection better but still it was me and i reached for the contact lenses that david had couriered over earlier as i blinked and teared the thin brown bits of plastic into place i decided that my unease was because david didnt trust me he didnt trust my abilities and he didnt trust me id never had a partner relationship where i was the one under doubt i had been thought of as an airhead before and a flake even incompetent but never untrustworthy i didnt like it but looking back over what i had done to jenks it was probably deserved movements slow and depressed i styled my shorter hair up into a spare businesslike bun i put my makeup on heavy using a base that was too dark and so having to give my hands and neck a good layer as well it covered my freckles though and with an unhappy feeling i twisted my wooden pinky ring off the charm was broken with the darker makeup and the brown contact lenses i looked different but the clothes really turned the trick and as i stood before my mirror and looked at myself in my dull boring suit and a dull boring hairstyle and a dull boring look on my face i didnt think even my mother would recognize me i dabbed a drop of ivys expensive perfume on methe one that hid my scentthen followed it up with a splash of a musky perfume jenks once said smelled like the underside of a log earthy and rich clipping ivys phone onto my waist i went into the hall my heels making an unusual amount of noise the soft sound of ivy and david in conversation pulled me into the sanctuary where i found them at her piano i really wished jenks were with us it was more than needing him for reconnaissance and camera detail i missed him david and ivy looked up at the sound of my feet ivys mouth dropped open bite me and slight me she said that is the most godawful thing i think ive seen you wear you actually look respectable i smiled weakly thanks i stood there gripping my hands in a figleaf posture as david ran his gaze over me the slight easing of his brow the only sign of his approval turning away he tossed his papers into his briefcase and snapped it shut mrs aver had left hers behind and i picked it up when david indicated i should youll bring my spells i asked ivy she sighed turning her gaze to the ceiling kisten is on his way over ill go over it with him one more time then we lock up the church and leave ill give you a ping when were in place she looked at me you do have my spare phone ah i touched it on my waist yes good go she said as she turned and walked away before i do something stupid like give you a hug depressed and unsure i headed out david was behind me his pace silent but his presence obvious by the faint scent of fern sunglasses he murmured when i reached for the door handle and i paused to put them on i pushed the door open squinting from the late sun as i picked my way through the sympathy offerings ranging from professional flower arrangements to crayonbright pages torn from coloring books it was cold the crisp air refreshing the sound of kistens car pulled my head up and my pulse jackhammered i froze on the steps and david almost ran into me his foot bumped a squat vase and it rolled down the steps to the sidewalk spilling water and the single budded red rose it held someone you know he asked his breath warm on my ear its kisten i watched him park and get out god he looked good all trim and sexy davids hand went onto my elbow pushing me into motion keep going dont say anything i want to see how your disguise holds up my car is across the street liking the idea i continued down the stairs stopping only to pick up the vase and set it on the lowest stair it was actually a jellyjar glass with a pentagram of protection on it and i made a soft sound of recognition as i tucked the red rose back into it and straightened i hadnt seen one of those in years i felt a flutter in my stomach when kistens steps grew loud bless you he said as he passed me thinking i had put the flower there not just picked it up i opened my mouth to say something closing it as david pinched my arm ivy kisten shouted hammering on the door lets go were going to be late david escorted me across the street and to the other side of his car his hand firmly under my elbowit was slick and the heels i had on werent made for ice very nice he said sounding begrudgingly impressed but its not as if youve slept with him actually i said as he opened the door for me i have his eyes jerked to mine and a shocked look of revulsion crossed him from inside the church came a faint youre fucking kidding that was her no fucking way i pushed my fingers into my forehead at least he didnt swear like that when i was around my eyes went to david the width of the door between us its the species thing isnt it i said flatly he said nothing jaw clenched i told myself that he could think what he wanted i didnt have to live up to his standards lots of people didnt like it lots of people didnt give a flip who i slept with should have nothing to do with our professional relationship mood worsening i got in and closed my door before he could do it my belt clicked shut and he slid behind the wheel and started his little gray car up i didnt say a word as he pulled out and headed for the bridge davids cologne became cloying and i cracked the window you dont mind going in without your charms david asked his tone lacked the expected disgust and i seized on that ive gone in charmless before i said and i trust ivy to get them to me his head didnt move though his eyes tightened in the corners my old partner never was without his charms id laugh at him when wed go in and hed have three or four of them hanging around his neck david hed say this ones for seeing if theyre lying this ones for knowing if theyre under a disguise and this ones for telling me if theyre carrying a bunch of energy around in their chi and are ready to blast us all to hell i glanced at him my mood softening you dont mind working with witches no he took his hand off the wheel when we rumbled over a railroad track his charms saved me a lot of pain but i cant tell you the number of times he spent fumbling for the right spell when a good right cross would have settled things faster we crossed the river into cincinnati proper and the buildings made flickering comeandgo shadows on me he was prejudiced only when sex came into the picture i could handle that im not going in completely helpless i said warming slightly i can make a protection circle around myself if i have to but im really an earth witch which might make things difficult as its harder to bring someone in if you cant do the same magic i made a face he didnt see then again theres no way i can beat saladan at ley line magic so its just as well im not even going to try ill get him with my earth charms or my foot in his gut david brought the car to a slow halt at a red light face showing the first signs of interest he turned to me i heard you brought down three ley line assassins oh that i warmed i had help with that the fib was there you brought piscary down yourself the light changed and i appreciated him not creeping up on the car ahead of us until it moved trents security officer helped me i admitted he distracted him david said softly you were the one who clubbed him into unconsciousness pressing my knees together i turned to look at him straight on how do you know davids heavy jaw tightened and relaxed but he didnt look from the street i talked to jenks this morning what i exclaimed almost hitting my head on the ceiling is he okay what did he say did you tell him i was sorry will he talk to me if i call him david glanced askance at me as i held my breath saying nothing he made a careful turn onto the parkway no to everything hes very upset i settled in my seat flustered and worried you need to thank him if he ever talks to you again david said tightly he thinks the world of you which is the main reason i didnt go back on my agreement to get you in to see saladan my gut twisted what do you mean he hesitated while he passed a car hes hurt you didnt trust him but he didnt say one bad word about you even stood up for you when i called you a flighty airhead my throat tightened and i stared out the passengerside window i was such an ass hes of the backward opinion that he deserved being lied to that you didnt tell him because you felt he couldnt keep his mouth shut and that you were probably right he left because he thought he let you down not the other way around i told him you were a fool and that any partner who lied to me would end up with their throat torn out david made a puff of scorn he kicked me out fourinch man kicked me out told me if i didnt help you like i said i would hed track me down when the weather broke and give me a lobotomy when i slept he could do it i said my voice tight i could hear the threatened tears in it i know he could but thats not why im here im here because of what he didnt say what you did to your partner is deplorable but so honorable a soul wouldnt think highly of someone who didnt deserve it i cant see why he does though ive have been trying to talk to jenks for the last three days i said around the lump in my throat im trying to apologize im trying to fix this thats the other reason im here mistakes can be fixed but if you do it more than once its no longer a mistake i said nothing my head starting to hurt as we passed a riveroverlook park and pulled onto a side street david touched his collar and i read in his body posture that we were almost there and it was sort of my fault it came out he said softly bane has a tendency to make you loose in the lips im sorry about that but it was still wrong of you it didnt matter how it came out jenks was furious with me and i deserved it david signaled and turned into a cobbled drive i tugged at my gray skirt and adjusted my jacket wiping my eyes i sat upright and tried to look professional not like my world was falling down around me and all i had to depend on was a were who thought i was the lowest of the low id have given anything to have jenks on my shoulder making wisecracks about my new haircut or how i smelled like the bottom of an outhouse anything id keep my mouth shut if i were you david said darkly and i bobbed my head thoroughly depressed my secretarys perfume is in the glove box give your nylons a good spray the rest of you smells okay i obediently did as he said my usual hot abhorrence to take direction from someone squelched in that he thought so little of me the musty scent of the perfume overpowered the car and david rolled his window down grimacing well you did say i muttered when the cold air pooled at my ankles its going to be quick once we get in there david said his eyes watering your vamp partner has five minutes tops before saladan gets angry about the claim and kicks us out i held mrs avers briefcase on my lap tighter shell be there davids only response was a muttered rumble we wound up a short drive that looped about itself it had been plowed and swept and the red clay bricks were damp with snowmelt at the top of it was a stately house painted white with red shutters and tall narrow windows it was one of the few older mansions that had been refurbished without losing its charm the sun was behind the house and david parked in the shadows behind a black pickup truck and cut the engine a curtain at a front window shifted your name is grace he said if they want identification its in your wallet inside your briefcase here he handed me his glasses wear them thanks i set the plastic lenses on my nose learning that david was farsighted my head started to hurt and i pulled them lower so i could look at the world over them instead of through them i felt awful the butterflies in my stomach as heavy as turtles a sigh shifted him and he reached between our seats for his briefcase in the back lets go thirtyone david hue david said coolly sounding bored and a little irritated as we stood in the entryway of the old mansion i have an appointment i not we i thought keeping my eyes down and trying to stay in the background while candice the vamp that had been all over lee on his boat cocked her jeansclad hip and looked at his business card there were two more vamps behind her in black suits that screamed security i didnt mind playing the meek subordinate if candice recognized me it would get really bad really quick that was me you talked to the shapely vampire said around a bothered sigh but after the recent ugliness mr saladan has retired toa less public environment hes not here much less taking appointments smiling to show her teeth in a politically polite threat she handed his card back ill be glad to talk to you though my heart pounded and i stared at the italian tile he was herei could almost hear the rattle of chipsbut if i didnt get in to see him this was going to be a lot more difficult david looked at her the skin about his eyes tightening then picked up his briefcase very well he said shortly if i cant speak with mr saladan my company has no recourse but to assume our understanding of terrorist activity is correct and we will deny payment on the claim good day maam he barely glanced at me come on grace lets go breath catching i felt my face pale if we walked out of here kisten and ivy would be headed into a trap davids steps were loud as he went for the door and i reached out after him candice came lees irate buttery voice from the secondstory railing above the grand staircase what are you doing i spun david taking my elbow in warning lee stood by the upper landing a drink in one hand a folder and pair of wirerimmed glasses in the other he was wearing what looked like a suit without the coat his tie loose about his neck but still tidy stanley honey candice purred falling into a provocative slump against the small table by the door you said no one besides its just a little boat how much could it be worth lees dark eyes pinched as he frowned almost a quarter milliondear theyre insurance agents not is operatives do a spell check on them and show them up theyre required by law to keep everything confidential including that they were even here he looked at david and tossed his surferboy bangs out of his way am i right david smiled up at him with that shared goodoldboys look that i hated yes sir he said his voice echoing against the flat white of the open vestibule we couldnt do our work without that little constitutional amendment lee put his hand up in acknowledgment turned and vanished down the open hall a door creaked shut and i jerked as candice grabbed my briefcase adrenaline pulled me straight and i clutched it to me relax grace david said patronizingly as he took it from me and handed it to candice this isnt unusual the two vamps in the background came forward and i forced myself to not move youll have to forgive my assistant david said while he put our cases on the table by the door and opened first his and spun it around then mine breaking in a new assistant is hell candices expression went mocking were you the one to give her the black eye i flushed my hand going to touch my cheekbone and my gaze falling to my ugly shoes apparently the darker makeup didnt work as well as i thought you have to keep your bitches in line david said lightly but if you hit them right you only have to hit them once my jaw clenched and i warmed as candice laughed i watched from under my lowered brow while a vamp pawed through my briefcase it was full of stuff only an insurance adjustor would have a calculator with more tiny buttons than a leprechauns dress boots notepads coffeestained folders useless little calendars to stick on your fridge and pens with smiley faces on them there were receipts from places like sub shops and office depot god it was awful she glanced at my fake business cards with an absentminded interest while davids briefcase got the same scrutiny candice sauntered into a back room she came back with a pair of wirerimmed glasses with which she made a show of scrutinizing us through my heart pounded as she then brought out an amulet it was glowing a warning red chad honey she murmured back up your spell is interfering one of the vamps flushed and retreated i wondered what chadhoney had a spell for that would turn his ears that particular color my breath slipped from me when the amulet shifted green making me grateful that id gone in under a mundane disguise beside me davids fingers twitched can we move this faster he said i have other people to see candice smiled and twirled the amulet on her finger right this way with a quickness seemingly born from irritation david snapped his briefcase closed and dragged it from the small table i did the same relieved when the two vamps vanished into a back room following the smell of coffee candice headed up the stairs with a slow pace her hips going as if they were going to gyrate off her trying to ignore her i followed the house was old and now that i was getting a better look at it not wellmaintained upstairs the carpet was thinning and the pictures hanging in the open hallway overlooking the vestibule were so ancient they probably came with the house the paint above the wainscoting was that icky green popular before the turn and it looked repulsive someone with little imagination had used it to cover the eightinch floorboards carved with ivy and hummingbirds and i spared a pained thought at the grandeur hidden behind ugly paint and synthetic fibers mr saladan candice said in explanation as she opened a blackvarnished door her smile was catty and i followed david in keeping my eyes down when i passed her i held my breath praying that she couldnt tell it was me hoping she wouldnt come in but why would she lee was an expert in ley line magic he didnt need protection from two weres it was a goodsized office done in oak paneling high ceilings and the thick framework about the tall block of windows was the only evidence that the room had started out as a bedroom before becoming an office everything else had been covered and disguised with chrome and light oak that was only a few years old i was a witch i could tell the windows behind the desk went to the floor and the low sun spilled in over lee as he rose from his desk chair a bar cart was in one corner and an entertainment center took up most of the opposite wall two comfortable chairs were arranged before his desk leaving one ugly one in a far corner there was a huge wall mirror and no books my opinion of lee hit rock bottom mr hue lee said warmly as he extended his tanned hand over the expanse of the modernlooking desk his suit coat was hanging from a nearby hat tree but he had at least snugged his tie up ive been expecting you sorry about the mixup downstairs candice can be protective at times you can understand seeing as boats seem to be exploding around me david chuckled sounding a little like a dog not a problem mr saladan i wont take much of your time its a courtesy call to let you know how your claim is being processed smiling lee held his tie to himself and sat indicating we should do the same can i get you a drink he asked as i settled myself in the supple leather chair and put my briefcase down no thank you david said lee hadnt given me more than a cursory glance not even offering to shake my hand the mens club air was thick enough to chew on and whereas i normally would have charmingly asserted myself this time i gritted my teeth and pretended i didnt exist like a good little bitch at the bottom of the hierarchy while lee added ice to his drink david donned a second pair of glasses and opened his briefcase atop his lap his cleanshaven jaw was tight and i could smell his leashed excitement growing well he said softly bringing out a sheaf of papers i regret to inform you that after our initial inspection and our preliminary interviews with a survivor my company has declined making a settlement lee dropped a second cube of ice into his drink excuse me he spun on a shiny heel your survivor has too much at stake to come forth with any information contrary to it being an accident and as for your inspection the boat is at the bottom of the ohio river david bobbed his head quite so but the boat was destroyed during a citywide power struggle and thus its destruction falls under the terrorism clause making a bark of disbelief lee sat behind his desk that boat is brandnew ive only made two payments on it im not going to take the loss thats why i insured it david put a stapled pack of papers on the desk peering over his glasses he dug out a second paper closed his briefcase and signed it this is also notice that your premiums on your other properties we insure will be increasing by fifteen percent sign here please fifteen percent lee exclaimed retroactive to the beginning of the month if you would like to cut me a check i am prepared to accept payment damn i thought davids company played hardball my thoughts shifted from lee to ivy this was going south really fast where was her call they had to be in place by now lee wasnt happy jaw tight he laced his fingers together and set them on the desk his face went red from behind his black bangs and he leaned forward you need to look in your briefcase little pup and find a check in there for me he said his berkeley accent growing pronounced im not accustomed to being disappointed david snapped his briefcase shut and set it gently on the floor you need to broaden your horizons mr saladan it happens to me all the time not me round face wrathful lee got to his feet the tension rose i eyed lee then david looking confident even though he was seated neither man was going to back down sign the paper sir david said softly im just the messenger dont get the lawyers into this then theyre the only ones who get any money and you become uninsurable lee took a hasty breath his dark eyes pinched in anger i jumped at the sudden ring of my phone my eyes widened it was playing the theme to the lone ranger i scrambled to turn it off not knowing how god help me grace david barked and i jumped again the phone slipped from my fingers i fumbled after it face flaming my emotions warred between panic that they were both looking at me and my relief that ivy was ready grace i told you to turn that phone off when we were in the drive david yelled he stood and i looked at him in helplessness he snatched the phone out of my hands the music cut off and he threw it back at me my jaw clenched as it hit my palm with a sharp snap id had enough seeing my hot anger david moved between me and lee gripping my shoulder in warning ticked i knocked his arm away but my anger caught when he smiled and winked at me youre a good operative he said softly as lee punched a button on his intercom and had a hushed conversation with what sounded like a very upset candice most of the people i work with would have gone for my throat at the front door with that subordinatebitch comment dig your feet in we can get a few more minutes out of this conversation and i still need him to sign my form i nodded though it was hard the compliment helped still standing lee reached for his coat and slipped his arms into it im sorry mr hue we will have to continue this at another opportunity no sir david stood unmoving we will finish this now there was a commotion in the hallway and i rose when chad the vampire with the charm stumbled in seeing david and me he swallowed down his first probably frantic words chad lee said the faintest bother in his expression as he took in the vamps disheveled appearance will you see mr hue and his assistant to their car yes sir the house was quiet and i stifled a smile ivy once took out an entire floor of fib agents unless lee had a hell of a lot of people hidden about it wouldnt be long until i had my charms and lee would be wearing handcuffs david didnt move he stood before lees desk his were mien growing mr saladan he pushed the form forward with two fingers if you would red spots started on lees round cheeks taking a pen from an inner jacket pocket he signed the paper making his name big and unreadable tell your superiors that i will be compensated for my loss he said leaving it on the desk for david to pick up it would be a shame if your company found itself in financial straits by a number of your more expensive properties becoming damaged david picked up the paper and tucked it in his briefcase standing beside and a little behind him i felt his tension rise and saw him shift his balance to the balls of his feet is that a threat mr saladan i can transfer your claim to our complaint department a soft boom thumped against my inner ear and chad jiggled on his feet it was a distant explosion lee looked at a wall as if he could see through it my eyebrows rose ivy just one more signature david brought out a trifolded paper from a coat pocket our time is done mr hue david stared at him and i could almost hear the growl it wont take buta moment grace i need your signature here then mr saladanshere surprised i stepped forward head lowered to the paper david smoothed out on the desk my eyes widened it stated that i was a witness to seeing the bomb on the boiler i thought it wrong that davids company was more worried about the boat than the people who died on it but that was insurance for you i took the pen glancing up at david he made a small shrug a new hard glint to his eyes despite his anger i think he was enjoying this heart pounding i signed it as rachel i listened for any sound of battle as i handed the pen to david they had to be close and there might not be any indication that they were in the house if all went well outside lee was tense and my stomach tightened and you sir it was sarcastic and david turned the paper to him sign and i can close your file and youll never have to see me again i wondered if that was his standard line as i reached into an inner pocket of my borrowed jacket and pulled out the warrant edden had brought over that afternoon motions rough and belligerent lee signed the paper beside me i heard the softest rumble of satisfaction from david it was only then that lee looked at my signature the man went white under his tan his thin lips parted son of a bitch he swore his eyes rising to me then chad in the corner smiling i gave lee my warrant this ones from me i said cheerfully thanks david do you have what you need david took a step back tucking his form away hes all yours son of a bitch lee said again a disbelieving smile quirking his lips you just dont know when to stay dead do you my breath hissed in and i jerked as i felt him tap a line get down i shouted shoving david out of the way and lurching back pinwheeling david hit the floor i slid almost to the door the air crackled and a thump reverberated through me on all fours i jerked my gaze to the ugly purple stain dripping to the floor what the turn was that i thought scrambling up and tugging my skirt to my knees lee gestured to chad who looked cowed well get them he said sounding disgusted chad blinked then strode to david not him you idiot lee shouted the woman chad yanked himself to a stop turned then reached for me where in hell was ivy my demon scar flamed to pleasure and while it was rather distracting i nevertheless had no problem jamming the heel of my palm into chads nose jerking back when the cartilage tore i hated the feel of breaking noses it gave me the willies chad cried out in pain hunching over and holding his bloodsoaked hands to his face i followed him down giving him an elbow on the back of his neck which he conveniently put in my reach in three seconds chad was down rubbing my elbow i looked up to find david watching in wideeyed interest i was between lee and the door smiling i tossed the hair that had escaped my bun out of my eyes lee was a ley line witch chances were that he was a coward when it came to physical pain he wouldnt jump out that window unless he had to lee thumbed an intercom candice his voice was a mix of anger and threat panting i licked my thumb and pointed to lee david you might want to leave this is going to be dicey my good mood grew when kistens voice came out of the speaker along with the pained sounds of a catfight candice is busy old man i recognized the sound of ivys attack and kisten made a noise of sympathy sorry love you shouldnt have strayed oh that had to hurt then he was back his fake accent heavy and amused perhaps i could help you lee clicked off the intercom he adjusted his coat watching me he looked confident not good lee i said we can do it easy or hard there was a thumping of feet in the hallway and i fell back to david when five men came spilling in ivy wasnt with them neither were my charms they did have a lot of guns though all pointed at us damn lee smiled and came out from behind his desk im all for easy he said so smug i wanted to slap him chad was starting to move and lee nudged him in the ribs get up he said the were has a paper in his jacket get it stomach churning i backed up as chad staggered to his feet blood dripping on his cheap suit just give it to him i warned when david tensed ill get it back no i dont think you will lee said as david handed it to chad and the vamp passed the now bloodsmeared paper to lee white teeth gleaming he tossed his hair and smiled sorry to hear about your accident i glanced at david hearing our coming death in his words lee wiped the blood off on chads coat folding it twice he tucked it in a jacket pocket headed for the door he said casually shoot them take out the bullets then dump them under the ice downriver from the dock clean up the room im going out for an early dinner ill be back in two hours chad come with me we need to talk my heart pounded and i could smell davids rising tension his hands were opening and closing as if they hurt maybe they did i gasped at the sound of safeties going off rhombus i shouted my word lost in the thunder of weapons discharging i staggered as my thoughts tapped the nearest line it was the universitys and it was huge i smelled gunpowder straightening i patted at myself frantically nothing hurt but my ears davids face was white but there was no pain in his eyes a shimmer of moleculethin everafter shone around us the four men were straightening from their own crouches i had gotten the circle up in time and their bullets had ricocheted right back at them what do we do now one asked hell if i know the tallest said from the floor of the vestibule came lees shout just fix it you came ivys faint demand wheres rachel ivy frantic i looked at my circle it was a trap can you take two of them i asked give me five minutes to were and i can take them all david all but growled the noise of fighting drifted up it sounded like there were a dozen people down there and one angry vampire one of the men looked at the others and ran out three left the pop of a gun downstairs brought me straight we dont have five minutes ready he nodded face twisting i broke my link to the line and the circle fell go i exclaimed david was a blur beside me i went for the smallest knocking his weapon aside with a foot as he tried to backpedal it was my training against his slower magic and my training won his gun skittered across the floor and he dove for it idiot following him down i elbowed his kidney he gasped and turned to face me far short of the gun god he looked young teeth gritted i picked up his head and slammed it into the ground his eyes closed and his body went slack yeah it was crude but i was in kind of a hurry the crack of a weapon discharging pulled me around im fine david barked popping up with a weres quickness from a crouch and jabbing a small powerful fist at the last witch standing eyes rolling to the back of his head the witch dropped the gun from slack fingers and toppled to fall on the first man david had downed damn he was fast my heart pounded and my ears rang we had brought them down with only one shot fired you got two i said exhilarated at the joined effort thanks breathing hard david wiped his lip and swooped to get his briefcase i need my paper we stepped over the downed witches david went out before me he stopped eyes narrowing at the man on the balcony taking aim at ivy grunting he swung his briefcase it smacked into the witchs head staggering the man turned i spun on one foot slamming my foot into his solar plexus his arms pinwheeled as he fell back into the railing i didnt stop to see if he was down or not leaving david to wrestle for the gun i ran down the stairs ivy was fending off candice my bag of charms was at ivys feet there were three bodies sprawled on the tile floor poor chad wasnt having a very good day ivy i called when she threw candice into the wall and had a moment wheres lee her eyes were black and her lips were pulled back from her teeth with a high scream of outrage candice came at her ivy jumped for the chandelier her foot connecting with candices jaw to rock the vampire back there was a creak from the ceiling look out i cried from the bottom step as ivy swung to land with an unreal grace and the chandelier fell it shattered sending broken glass and crystal everywhere kitchen ivy panted from a hunched crouch hes in the garage with kisten candice looked at me hatred in her black eyes blood ran from her mouth and she licked it her gaze went to the duffel bag of spells she tensed to run for itand ivy jumped go ivy shouted grappling with the smaller vampire i went heart pounding i ran around the ruin of the chandelier scooping up my charms in passing from behind me came a scream of terror and pain i skidded to a stop ivy had candice pinned to the wall my face went cold id seen it before god help me id lived it candice bucked and fought a new frenzy in her motions as she tried to get free ivy held her still as unmoving as a steel girder piscarys strength made her unstoppable and candices fear was feeding her blood lust a rattle of gunfire came from the unseen garage i tore my gaze from them frightened ivy had vamped out absolutely and totally she had lost herself mouth dry i ran through the empty kitchen to the garage door candice screamed again the terrifying sound ending in a gurgle i hadnt wanted this i hadnt wanted this at all i spun at a scuffling noise behind me but it was david his face was white and he never slowed down as he paced to me there was a weapon in his grip is she i asked hearing my voice shake his hand went on my shoulder and he pushed me into motion lines marked his face and he looked old just go he said raggedly shes got your back the sound of mens voices in the garage rose then fell there was a spat of gunfire crouched by the door i shuf fled through my duffel bag i put a slew of amulets around my neck and tucked my cuffs into my waistband my splat gun was heavy in my hand fourteen little babies in a row ready for sleep in the reservoir enough propellant to shoot them all david peeked around the door then ducked back five men with saladan behind a black car on the far end of the garage i think theyre trying to get it started your boyfriend is around the corner we can reach him with a quick run he looked at me as i fumbled at my charms good god what are all those for my boyfriend i thought crawling to the doorway with my charms dragging under me well i had slept with him one is for pain i whispered one is for slowing down bleeding one is for detecting black charms before i walk into them and one my words cut off as the car started shit sorry i asked david muttered close behind me heart pounding i risked an upright hunched walk taking a deep breath of the dark garagecold air as i ducked behind a bulletdinged silver jag kistens head swung up he was on the floor with a hand pressed to his lower chest pain glazed his eyes and his face was pale under his blonddyed hair blood seeped from under his hand and i went cold from more than the unheated garage four men were down beside him one moved and he kicked him in the head until he didnt move anymore better and better i whispered making my way to kisten the garage door whined into motion and the shouts from the car were loud over the revving engine but kisten was the only thing i cared about right now are you okay i dropped two charms over his head i felt sick he wasnt supposed to have gotten hurt ivy wasnt supposed to have been tripped into draining someone nothing was supposed to have gone this way get him rachel he said managing a painedlooking grimace ill live the cars tires squealed as it backed up panicking i looked from kisten to the car torn get him kisten insisted his blue eyes crinkled in pain david eased kisten to the garage floor one hand pressing kistens hand against the wound he sent the other searching his jacket pulling out his phone david flipped it open and punched kisten nodded his eyes closing as i stood the car had backed up into the turnaround spot and was jerking into motion it stalled mad as all hell i stomped out after it lee i shouted the cars engine sputtered and caught its wheels spinning on the wet cobbles my jaw gritted tapping a line i clenched my fist line energy coursed through me filling my veins with the staggering feeling of strength my eyes narrowed rhombus i said fingers splayed as i gestured my knees buckled and i screamed when the pain from the line energy required to make such a large circle raged through me burning when i couldnt channel it all at once there was an ugly noise of folding metal and squealing tires the sound raked through me fixing in my memory to haunt my nightmares the car had hit my circle but the car broke not me i caught my balance and continued forward as men piled out of the smashed vehicle never slowing i took aim with my splat gun squeezing the trigger with a methodical slowness two went down before the first of the bullets went cutting through the air beside my head you shooting at me i screamed you shooting at me i dropped the gunman with a charm leaving lee and two men one put his hands in the air lee saw him then with no hesitation shot him the pop of the gun jerked through me as if i had been hit the witchs face went ashen and he collapsed to the cobbled drive leaning against the car and trying to hold his blood into him anger shocked through me and i halted seething i aimed at lee and squeezed drawing himself up he whispered latin and gestured i lurched to the side but he had been going for the ball and it deflected to the right still crouched i shot again lees eyes went patronizing as he deflected it too the movements of his hands took on a more sinister mien and my eyes widened shit i had to end this now i lunged at him yelping when the last vampire slammed into me we went down in a tangle me fighting furiously to keep him from getting a hold on me with a last grunt and savage kick i broke free rolling to my feet panting i backed away my sparring with ivy came back in a mixed slurry of hope and despair i had never managed to best her not really silent the vampire attacked i dove to the side skinning my elbow as mrs avers suit tore through he was on me and i rolled head covered with my arms kicking him off when i caught my breath the tingle of my circle zinged through me i had run into it and it had fallen immediately i lost connection with the line making me feel empty i jumped to my feet swerving to avoid the vamps leg swing damn it he wasnt even trying my splat gun was behind him and when he came at me i collapsed out of his reach rolling to get it fingers grasping my breath exploded out as the cool metal settled in my grip got you you bastard i shouted spinning to plug him right in the face his eyes widened then rolled up stifling a shriek i rolled out of the way as his momentum tipped him forward there was a sodden thump as he hit the cobbled drive blood seeped out from under his cheek hed broken something sorry you work for such a dick i breathed as i got up then did a double take my face went slack and i let my gun slip to dangle from a finger i was surrounded by eight men all of them a good ten feet back lee stood behind them looking obnoxiously satisfied as he adjusted the button on his coat i grimaced and tried to catch my breath oh yeah i had broken the circle shit on crap how many times did i have to tag this guy panting and hunched in pain i saw david and kisten unmoving under three guns in the garage there were eight surrounding me add in the five id just downed kisten had gotten at least four mustnt forget the original guys upstairs i didnt even know how many ivy had taken out the man was ready for a freaking war slowly i straightened i could handle that ms morgan lees voice sounded odd among the dripping snowmelt coming off the garages overhang the sun was behind the house and i shivered now that i wasnt moving anything left in your little gun i looked at it if i had counted rightand i thought i hadthere were eight charms in there eight charms that were useless as lee could deflect them all and even if he didnt i stood little chance in taking that many men without getting nailed if i played by the rules im dropping the gun i said then carefully slowly opened the reservoir and dumped the blue splat balls out before i tossed it to him seven tiny spheres bounced rolling in the cracks of the red cobbled drive to come to a stop seven in the open one in my hand god this had to work just dont bind my hands i had to keep my hands shaking i put my hands in the air and backed away a tiny splat ball dropping down my sleeve to make a cold spot at my elbow lee gestured and the surrounding men converged one grabbed my shoulder and i struggled not to hit him placid meek no need to tie me up lee got in my face stupid stupid girl he sneered touching his forehead under his short dark bangs where a new cut spread he pulled his hand back and i forced myself to not move taking it as he backhanded me seething i pulled myself straight where the momentum had shifted me the surrounding men laughed but my hands behind my back were moving the splat ball rolling to find my palm as i finished my eyes flicked from lee to my splat balls on the cobbles someone bent to pick one up youre wrong i said to lee breathing hard im a stupid stupid witch lees attention followed mine to the splat balls consimilis i said tapping a line get down lee exclaimed pushing the men around him out of the way calefacio i shouted elbowing the witch holding me and rolling to the ground my circle snapped into existence around me with a quick thought there was a sharp pop and a scattering of bluecolored shrapnel peppered the outside of my bubble the plastic balls had burst from the heat sending superheated sleep potion everywhere i looked up from between my arms everyone was down but lee having put enough men between him and the flying potions in the garage ivy stood panting over the last three vamps we had gotten them all that was left was lee and he was mine a smile curved over me as i stood and broke my circle taking the energy back into my chi just you and me surfer boy i said tossing the splat ball i had used for a focusing object and catching it care to throw the dice lees round face went still he held himself unmoving and then without a glimmer of emotion tapped a line son of a bitch i swore lunging i slammed into him knocking him flat on the cobbles teeth gritted he gripped my wrist squeezing until the splat ball rolled from me you will shut up i shouted from atop him jamming my arm into his throat so he couldnt speak he fought me bringing his hand up to smack my cheek my breath hissed out in a pained gasp as he hit the bruise al gave me catching his wrist i snapped my cuffs on him spinning him over i wrenched his arm out from under him knee on his back pinning him to the pavement i snapped the other ring about his other wrist i am tired of your crap i exclaimed nobody tries to put a black charm on me and nobody traps me in a boat with a bomb nobodyyou hear me who in hell do you think you are coming into my city and trying to take over rolling him over i snatched davids paper from behind his coat and this isnt yours i said holding it high like a trophy ready for a little trip witch lee said his eyes dark with hate and blood leaking from his mouth my eyes widened as i felt him pull more from the ley line he was already linked to no i shouted realizing what he was doing the cuffs were fib issue i thought kicking myself they were fib issue lacking the core of solid silver that the is issue cuffs came standard with he could jump he could jump to a line if he knew how and apparently he did rachel ivy shrieked her voice and the light cutting off with a terrifying suddenness a sheet of everafter coated me i choked pushing lee away clawing at my mouth unable to breathe my heart beat wildly as his magic raced through me etching the lines both physical and mental that defined me the blackness of never flooded me and i panicked as i felt myself exist in splinters everywhere but nowhere sure i teetered on madness unable to breathe unable to think i screamed as i snapped back into myself with a wrench and the blackness retreated to the pit of my soul i could breathe lee kicked at me and i rolled away to my hands and knees thanking god i had them again cold rock bit through my nylons and i sucked in the air gasping gagging at the choking smell of ash the wind whipped my hair into my face my exposed skin went icy heart pounding i looked up knowing by the ruddy light coating the rubble i knelt in that we werent in lees drive anymore ohcrap i whispered as i took in the setting sun glowing through the remains of shattered buildings i was in the everafter thirtytwo the frostrimmed rocks beside me slid and i jerked out of the way before lees foot could connect with my ribs again red and small the sun crept behind the shadow of a broken building it looked like carew tower nearby were the remnants of what might be a fountain we were at fountain square lee i whispered frightened we have to get out of here there was a ping and lee brought his arms out from behind his back his suit was dirty and it looked out of place amid the destruction the soft and certain clink of a falling rock pulled my head around and he threw the handcuffs at it we werent alone damn lee i hissed oh god if al found me i was dead can you get us home he smiled brushing the hair out of his eyes slipping on the loose rubble he scanned the ragged horizon you dont look well he said and i winced at how loud his voice was against the cold rocks first time in the everafter yes and no shivering i got up and felt my scraped knees id put a run in my nylons and blood was seeping out i was standing in a line i could feel it humming could almost see itit was that strong clasping my arms about myself i jerked at the sound of sliding rock i wasnt thinking of tagging him i was thinking of escape but i couldnt travel the lines another rock fell bigger i spun eyes searching the frostsmeared rubble hands on his hips lee squinted up at the redbottomed clouds as if the cold didnt bother him lesser demons he said fairly harmless unless youre hurt or ignorant i inched away from the fallen rock this isnt a good idea lets go back and we can finish this like normal people he brought his gaze to me what will you give me he mocked thin eyebrows high i felt like the time my date drove me to a farmhouse and stranded me telling me if i didnt put out i could find my own way back i broke his finger to get the key for his truck and cried all the way home my mom called his mom and that was the end of it except for the endless ribbing i took at school maybe id have gotten some respect if my dad had beat up his dad but that hadnt been an option at that point i didnt think breaking lees finger would get me home this time i cant i whispered you killed all those people shaking his head he sniffed you hurt my reputation im going to be rid of you my mouth went dry when i realized where this was headed he was going to give me to algaliarept the bastard dont do this lee i said frightened my head jerked up at the rapid scrabbling of claws we both owe him i said he can take you just as easily lee kicked chunks of rock from his feet to make a clear spot noooo the word on both sides of the lines is he wants you eyes black in the red light lee smiled but just in case im going to soften you up a little first lee i whispered hunched from the cold as he started to mutter latin the glow of the line energy in his hand lit his face with ugly shadows i tensed in sudden panic there was nowhere to run in the three seconds i had my breath caught at the sudden clatter of things hiding i jerked my attention up to see a sphere of energy headed right for me if i made a circle al would feel it if i deflected it al would know so like an idiot i froze and it smacked right into me fire rippled over my skin my head flung back mouth open as i fought for air it was simply line energy overflowing my chi tulpa i thought as i fell giving it somewhere to go immediately the fire died racing to the sphere already up and waiting in my head something in me seemed to shift and i knew i had made a mistake the things around us squealed and vanished i heard a gentle pop heart pounding i straightened my breath caught and i slowly let it out in a steaming ribbon of white moisture als jaunty silhouette was black against the setting sun as he stood atop a broken building his back to us shit lee swore what the hell is he doing here already i spun to lee and the soft hiss of metallic chalk against pavement it was a ley line witchs version of duct tape and it would make a very secure circle my heart pounded as a shimmer of black and purple rose between us blowing hard lee tucked his chalk away and smiled confidently at me shivering violently i looked over the sunsetred slumps of broken rock i didnt have anything to make a circle with i was a dead witch i was on als side of the lines my previous contract didnt mean anything al turned at the sensation of lees circle going up but it was to my eyes that his fixed on rachel mariana morgan he drawled clearly pleased as a cascade of ley line energy washed over him and his attire shifted to what i thought was an english riding outfit complete with whip and shiny calfhigh boots what did you do to your hair hi al i said backing up i had to get out of there theres no place like home i thought feeling the hum of the line i was standing in and wondering whether it would help if i clicked my heels lee had flown over the rainbow why oh why the hell couldnt i satisfaction all but glowed from lee my gaze went from him to al as the demon carefully picked his way down the slide of rubble to the floor of the large square the square i thought hope catching in my throat spinning i tried to place myself tripping as i pushed rocks with my foot searching if this was a mirror of cincinnati then this was fountain square and if this was fountain square then there was a humdinger of a circle all laid out between the street and the parking garage but it was really really big my breath came fast when my foot revealed a battered arc of purple inlay it was the same it was the same frantic i realized al was almost to the floor of the square i quickly tapped the nearby line it flowed into me with the mirrorbright taste of clouds and tinfoil tulpa i thought desperate to gather enough power to close a circle this size before al realized what i was doing i stiffened as a torrent of line energy flooded me groaning i dropped to one knee his aristocratic face going slack al drew himself upright he saw my intent in my eyes no he cried lunging forward as i reached to touch the circle and say my word of invocation a gasp slipped from me as with the feeling of being poured out of myself a shimmering wave of translucent gold swam up from the ground bisecting rocks and slumped rubble arching to a humming close high over my head staggering i fell back my mouth gaping open as i stared up at it holy crap i had closed fountain square circle i had closed a circle thirty feet across that had been designed for seven witches to set comfortably not one though apparently one could do it if properly motivated al skidded to a halt arms swinging to avoid running into the circle a faint bong of reverberation echoed in the dusky air crawling over my skin like dust my eyes widened and i stared bells big deep resonant bells there really were bells and my circle had rung them adrenaline shook my knees and they rang again al stood to look peeved a mere three feet from the edge head cocked and thin lips pressed tight as he listened to the third peal die away the power of the line running through me ebbed settling into a soft hum the silence of the night was frighteningly profound nice circle al said sounding impressed bothered and interested youre going to be grand fun at tractor pulls thanks i twitched when he took off his glove and tapped my circle to make rippled dimples waver across it dont touch it i blurted and he chuckledtapping tapping ever moving looking for a weak spot it was a huge circle he might find one what had i done my hands tucked into my armpits for warmth i looked at lee still in his circle doubly safe within mine we can still get out of here i said hearing my voice tremble neither one of us needs to be his familiar if we how stupid can you be lee edged his foot across his circle dissolving it i want to be rid of you i want to pay off my demon scar why on gods green earth would i save you shivering i felt the wind bite at me lee i said turning to keep al in my sight as he moved to the back of my circle still testing we have to get out of here his small nose wrinkling at the scent of burnt amber lee laughed no im going to beat you into a pulp and then im going to give you to algaliarept and hes going to call my debt paid cocky and selfassured he looked at al who had stopped pushing at my circle and was now standing with a beatific smile is that satisfactory a lump of fear settled heavy in my belly as a wicked contriving smile spread over als chiseled face an elaborately detailed rug and a maroon velvet chair from the eighteenth century appeared behind him and still smiling al settled himself the last of the sun making him a red smear among the broken buildings crossing his legs he said stanley collin saladan we have an agreement give me rachel mariana morgan and i will indeed call your debt paid i licked my lips and they went cold in the bitter wind around us came the soft scrabblings as things crept closer called by me ringing the citys bells and lured by the promise of darkness a soft plink of stone brought me spinning around something was in here with us lee smiled and i wiped my hands off on my borrowed dress suit and stood straighter he was right to feel confidenti was an earth witch without her charms up against a ley line masterbut he didnt know everything al didnt know everything hell i didnt know everything but i knew something they didnt and when that ugly red sun set behind the broken buildings it wasnt going to be me who was als familiar i wanted to survive right now it didnt matter if giving lee to al in my stead was right or not later when i was curled up with a cup of cocoa and shaking with the memory of this would be soon enough to decide but to win id first have to lose this was really going to hurt lee i said trying one last time take us out of here god please let me be right youre such a girl he said tugging his dirtstained suit straight always whining and expecting to be rescued lee wait i shouted as he took three steps and threw a ball of purple haze i dove to the side it skimmed past at chest height to hit the remnants of the fountain with a rumble a section of it cracked and broke away dust rose red in the darkening air when i turned lee had my business card in his gripthe one i had given the bouncer at his boat shit he had a focusing object dont i said you wont like how it ends lee shook his head his lips moving as he whispered doleo he said clearly the invocation word vibrating the air and with my card in his grip he gestured jerking straight i caught my harsh gurgle before it came from me guttwisting pain doubled me over breathing through it i staggered to my feet i couldnt think to come back with anything i staggered forward to try to free myself from pain if i could hit him it might stop if i could get my card he couldnt target me but would have to throw his spells i crashed into lee we went down stones jabbing me lee kicked out and i rolled as al applauded whitegloved hands a soft patting pain clouded me thinking was impossible illusion i told myself it was a ley line charm only earth magic could inflict real pain it was an illusion panting i forced the charm from me with pure will i wouldnt feel it my bruised shoulder throbbed hurting worse than it actually did i fastened on the real pain willing the phantom agony away hunched i saw lee from around my hair now completely fallen out of that stupid bun inflex lee said grinning as his moving fingers finished his spell and i cringed waiting for something to happen but nothing did oh i say al exclaimed from his rock first rate capital i wove on my feet fighting the last shadows of pain i was in the line again i could feel it if i knew how to trip the lines i could end this right now bibbity bobbity boo i thought alakazam hell id even twitch my nose if i thought it would work but it didnt the rustle around me grew they were becoming bolder as the sun threatened to set a rock fell behind me and i spun my foot slipped crying out i went down nausea hit me as my ankle twisted gasping i clutched at it feeling tears of pain start brilliant al applauded bad luck is extremely difficult take the charm off her i dont want a klutz in my kitchen lee gestured and a brief whirlwind smelling of burnt amber lifted through my hair my throat tightened as the charm broke my ankle throbbed and the cold rocks bit at me he had cursed me with bad luck son of a bitch jaw gritted i reached for a rock to pull myself up i had blasted ivy before with raw everafter and i didnt need a focusing object if i threw it at him anger growing i pulled upright reaching into my memory for the how of it it had always been instinctive before the fear and anger helped and as i staggered to my feet i pushed the everafter from my chi into my hands they burned but i held it pulling more energy off the line until my outspread hands felt like they were charring furious i compressed the raw energy in my hands to baseball size bastard i whispered stumbling as i threw it at him lee dived to the side and my gold ball of everafter hit my circle my eyes widened when a cascade of tingles raced through me as my bubble broke damn it all to hell i shouted not having thought ahead enough to realize my auralaced spell would break my circle terrified i spun to al thinking if i couldnt get it back up in time id be fighting both of them but the demon was still seated staring over my shoulder with his goatslitted eyes wide he looked over his glasses mouth hanging open i spun in time to see my spell hit a nearby building a faint boom shook my feet i put a hand to my mouth as a chunk the size of a bus flaked off and fell with an unreal slowness you stupid witch lee said its coming right for us i turned and ran hands reaching as i scrabbled my way across the rubble hands numb on the frostcracked rocks the ground shook dust rose thick in the air i staggered and fell hacking and coughing i got up shaking my fingers hurt and i couldnt move them i turned to find lee on the other side of the new rockfall hatred and a touch of fear in his eyes latin came from him my eyes were fixed upon the card in his moving fingers heart pounding as i waited helpless he gestured and my card burst into flame it flashed like gunpowder i cried out and turned away hands over my eyes the shrieks of the minor demons beat upon me i reeled backward balance gone red smears coated my vision my eyes were open and tears streamed down my face but i couldnt see i couldnt see there was the sound of sliding rocks and i yelped as someone cuffed me i blindly lashed out almost falling as the heel of my hand met nothing fear settled into me debilitating i couldnt see he had taken my sight a hand shoved me over and i fell swinging my leg i felt it hit him and he went down bitch he gasped and i shrieked when he yanked out a handful of my hair and scrabbled away more al said cheerfully show me your best he encouraged lee i cried dont do this the red wasnt clearing please please let it be illusion dark words came from lee sounding obscene i smelled a strand of my hair burn my heart clenched in sudden doubt i wasnt going to make it he was going to all but kill me there was no way to win this oh godwhat had i been thinking you gave her doubt al said wonderingly from the blackness thats a very complex charm he breathed what else can you divine i can look backward lee said nearby panting oh al said gleefully i have a marvelous idea make her recall her fathers death no i whispered lee if you have any compassion please but his hated voice started whispering and i groaned falling into myself as a mental pain cut through the physical my dad my dad gasping his last the feel of his dry hand in mine the strength gone i had stayed refusing to leave for anything i was there when his breaths stopped i was there when his soul was freed leaving me to fend for myself far far too early it had made me strong but it had left me flawed dad i sobbed my chest hurting he had tried to stay but couldnt he had tried to smile but it was broken oh dad i whispered softer as the tears welled i had tried to keep him there with me but i hadnt been able to a black depression rose from my thoughts pulling me into myself he had left me i was alone he had gone no one had ever come close to filling the void no one ever would sobbing the miserable memory of that awful moment when i realized he was gone filled me it wasnt when they pulled me from him at the hospital but two weeks later when i broke the schools eight hundred meters record and i looked into the stands for his proud smile he was gone and that was when i knew he was dead brilliantal whispered his cultured voice soft beside me i did nothing as a gloved hand curved under my jaw and tilted my head up i couldnt see him as i blinked but i felt the warmth of his hand you broke her utterly al said in wonder lees breathing was harsh clearly it had taken a lot out of him i couldnt stop crying the tears dribbling down my cheeks cold in the wind al let go of my jaw and i curled into a ball in the rubble at his feet uncaring of what might happen next oh god my dad shes yours lee said take my mark off i felt als arms go around me lifting me up i couldnt help but press into him i was so cold and he smelled like old spice though i knew it was als twisted cruelty i clutched at him and sobbed i missed him god i missed him rachel came my dads voice pulled from my memory and i cried all the harder rachel it came again is there nothing left nothing i said around my sobbing breaths are you sure my dad said gentle and caring you tried so hard my little witch you really fought him with everything and failed i failed i said between my sobs i want to go home shhhh he soothed his hand cool against me in my darkness ill get you home and put you to bed i felt al shift into motion i was broken but i wasnt done my mind rebelled wanting to sink deeper into nothingness but my will survived it was either lee or me and i wanted my cup of cocoa on ivys couch and a theme book of rationalizations al i whispered lee should be dead it was easier to breathe the memory of my fathers death was slipping back into the hidden folds of my brain they had been buried there so long that they found their places easily one by one filed away for lonely nights by myself hush rachel al said i see what you intended by letting lee trounce you but you can kindle demon magic fully there has never been a witch that can do that he laughed his glee chilling me and youre mine not newts not anyone elses but mine what about my demon mark lee protested several steps back and i wanted to cry for him he was so dead and he didnt know it yet lee can i whispered i could see the sky blinking profusely i saw a dark shadow of al holding me silhouetted against the redsmeared clouds relief slipped into me pushing out the last of my doubt to leave a shimmer of hope underneath ley line charms of illusion only worked shortterm unless they were given a permanent place to reside in silver taste him i said taste his blood trents father fixed him too he can kindle demon magic al jerked to a stop bless me thrice there are two of you i shrieked as i fell crying out as my hip hit a rock from behind me i heard lees shout of fear and shock turning where al had dropped me i peered over the rubble and rubbed my eyes to make outal drawing a sharp nail across lees arm blood welled and i felt sick im sorry lee i whispered hugging my knees to myself im so sorry al made a low sound deep in his throat of pleasure shes right he said as he brought a finger from his lips and youre better at ley line magic than she is ill take you instead no lee screamed and al jerked him closer you wanted her i gave you her you gave her to me i took off your demon mark and now im taking you you can both kindle demon magic al said i could spend decades fighting a scrawny highmaintenance familiar like her and never wedge the spells you already know into her cottonfluffed head ever try twisting a demon curse no lee cried fighting to get away i cant you will here al said dropping him down onto the ground hold this for me i covered my ears and curled into myself as lee screamed then screamed again it was high and raw scraping across my skull like a nightmare i felt like i was going to vomit i had given lee to al to save my life that lee tried to do the same to me didnt make me feel better lee i said tears leaking out im sorry god im sorry lees voice cut off as he passed out al smiled turning on a heel to me ta love i dont like to be on the surface when it gets dark all the best of luck to you my eyes widened i dont know how to get home i cried not my problem bye now i sat up chilled as the stones i was sitting on seemed to soak into me lee came to with an ugly gibbering sound tucking him under an arm al gave me a nod and vanished a stone slid down to roll to my feet i blinked wiping my eyes to only get rock dust and chips of stone in them the line i whispered remembering maybe if i got into the line lee had jumped from outside of a line but maybe i had to learn to walk before i could run a movement at the edge of my awareness caught my attention heart pounding i whipped my head around seeing nothing steadying myself i wedged myself up gasping when whitehot knives stabbed my ankle to take my breath away i slipped back to the ground jaw gritted i decided i would just crawl over there i reached out seeing mrs avers business suit coated in the dust and frost it had scraped from the surrounding rocks gripping an outcrop i pulled myself forward managing a halfway upright position my body was shaking with cold and fading adrenaline the sun was almost down a sliding of rocks urged me on they were getting closer a soft pop pulled my head up a tumble of pebbles and rocks came from everywhere as the lesser demons scrambled into hiding my breath slipped from me as from around my hair i saw a small figure in dark purple sitting crosslegged before me a narrow staff as long as i was tall laying across its lap a robe draped it not a bathrobe but a classy mix of a kimono and something a desert sheik would wear all billowy with the suppleness of linen a round hat with straight sides and a flat top was perched on its head squinting in the fading light i decided there was an inch or so of air between the gold trim and the ground now what who in hell are you i said pulling myself forward another step and will you be taking me home instead of al who in hell are you it echoed its voice a mix of rough lightness yes that fits it wasnt hitting me with that carved black stick or putting a charm on me or even making ugly faces so i ignored it and dragged myself forward another foot there was a crackle of paper and wondering i tucked davids trifolded paper into my waistband yeah hed probably want this back im newt it said seemingly disappointed i was ignoring it there was a rich accent that i couldnt place an odd way of saying the vowels and no im not taking you home i already have a demon familiar algaliarept is right youre almost worthless right now a demon for a familiar ooooh that had to be good grunting i pulled myself forward my ribs hurt and i pressed a hand into them panting i looked up a smooth face not young not oldsort ofnothingmet me ceri is afraid of you i said i know shes very perceptive is she well fear slid through me leave her alone i said jerking back as it pushed my hair out of my eyes its touch seemed to sink into me though i felt fingertips firm on my forehead i stared at its black eyes as it peered at me unruffled and curious your hair ought to be red it said smelling of crushed dandelions and your eyes are green like my sisters not brown sisters i wheezed considering i might give it my soul if it would give me a pain amulet god i hurt all over inside and out i sat back on my heels out of its reach newt had an eerie grace its outfit giving no hint to gender there was a necklace of black gold about its neckagain the design neither masculine nor feminine my gaze dropped to its bare feet hovering above the rubble they were narrow and slim somewhat ugly masculine are you a boy or a girl i finally asked not sure newts brow furrowed it makes a difference muscles trembling i pulled my hand to my mouth and sucked at a spot where the rock had pinched me it did to me dont get me wrong but why are you just sitting there the demon smiled making me think the reason couldnt be good there are a few side bets as to whether you will learn how to use the lines before sunset im here so no one cheats a stab of adrenaline cleared my head what happens when the sun goes down anyone can have you a rock slid from a nearby pile and i pushed into motion but you dont want me it shook its head drifting back maybe if you told me why al took the other witch instead of you i might idont remember newts voice sounded worried making me wonder too much everafter in the brainpan perhaps i didnt have time to deal with a crazy demon no matter how powerful it was read the papers im busy i said pulling myself forward i jerked when a boulder the size of a car fell two feet in front of me the ground shook and bits of rock chips stung my face i stared at it then newt who was smiling as it adjusted its grip on its staff to look pleasant and innocuous my head hurt okay maybe i had a little time ah lee can kindle demon magic i said not seeing any reason to tell it i could too newts black eyes widened already it said then its face clouded not angry with me but at itself i waited for it to move the rock it didnt taking a deep breath i started to go around newt as it seemed the demon had forgotten i was there the sense of danger flowing from the slight figure was growing building on itself to tighten my gut and make my skin crawl i was getting the distinct impression that i was still alive because a very powerful demon was curious nothing more hoping newt would forget about me i inched myself forward trying to ignore the pain in my ankle i slipped sucking in my breath as the flat of my arm hit a rock sending a shiver of pain up it the boulder was right in front of me and gathering myself i wedged my knees under me my ankle was burning agony as i gained my feet and held the rock for balance there was a brush of air and newt was beside me do you want to live forever the question sent a shiver through me damn it newt was becoming more interested not less no i whispered hand outstretched i limped from the rock i didnt either until i tried it the redwood staff clunked to the ground as newt moved to keep even with me black eyes eerily more alive than anyone elses id ever seen my skin crawled something was wrong with newtreally wrong i couldnt put my finger on it until i realized that the minute i took my attention from newt i forgot what the demon looked like apart from those eyes i know something algaliarept doesnt newt said i remember now you like secrets youre good at keeping them too i know all about you youre afraid of yourself i gritted my jaw as my ankle gave a twinge as i slipped on a rock the line was just ahead i could feel it the sun had sunk below the horizon halfway gone it took seven minutes to sink once it touched the earth three and a half minutes i could hear a gathering of breath from the lesser demons god help me find a way out of this you should be afraid of you newt said want to know why i pulled my head up newt was bored out of his or her mind and looking for amusement i didnt want to be interesting no i whispered becoming more frightened an evil smile crossed newt emotions shifting faster than a vampire hyped up on brimstone i think i will tell algaliarept a joke and when hes done ripping that witch apart for what he lost ill trade for that mark you owe him and make it mine i started to shake unable to stop my hands from trembling you cant do that i can i might newt twirled the staff idly hitting a rock so it ricocheted into the dark there was a catlike yelp of pain and a scattering of sliding rock and then ill have two the demon said to itself because you wont be able to figure out how to travel the lines and will have to buy a trip out of here from me there was a cry of outrage from the watchers behind the rocks quickly squelched horrified i came to a jerky stop feeling the line right ahead of me you want to survive newt intoned its voice dropping in pitch youll do anything for it anything no i whispered terrified because newt was right i saw lee do it i can do it too black eyes glinting newt set the butt of its staff down you wont figure it out you wont believe not yet you have to make a dealwith me frightened i wavered on my feet and with the next step i stumbled into the line feeling as if it was a stream warm and generous filling me up almost panting i teetered seeing the eyes around me narrow with greed and anger i hurt i had to get out of there the power of the line hummed through me peaceful and comforting theres no place like home newts expression went mocking its pupilblack eyes spiteful you cant do it i can i said my vision darkening as i almost passed out from the deepest shadows glittered green eyes close very close the power of the line hummed through me theres no place like home theres no place like home theres no place like home i thought desperately pulling energy into me spindling it in my head i had traveled the lines with lee i had seen how he had done it all it took was him thinking about where he wanted to be i wanted to be home why wasnt it working my knees shook as the first dark shape came out to stand with an unreal thinness slow and hesitant newt looked at it then turned slowly to me one eyebrow raised one favor and ill send you back oh god not another one leave me alone i shouted the rough edges of a rock scraping my fingers as i flung it at an approaching form and almost fell over a gasp sounding like a sob came from me as i caught my balance the lesser demon ducked then straightened three more pairs of eyes glowed behind it i jumped as newt suddenly was before me the light was gone black eyes slammed into me delving into my soul and clenching until fear squeezed out to bubble up you cant do it no time to learn newt said and i shuddered here was power raw and swirling newts soul was so black it was almost unseen i could feel its aura press against me starting to slip into mine with the force of newts will it could take me over if it wanted i was nothing my will was nothing owe me or die in this squalid pile of broken promises newt said but i cant send you through the lines with a thin tie called home home wont do it think on ivy you love her more than that damn church it said its honesty more cutting than any physical pain crying out in angry high voices the shadows bunched and lunged ivy i shouted accepting the bargain and willing myself to her the smell of her sweat when we sparred the taste of her brimstone cookies the sound of her steps and the rise of her eyebrows when she was trying not to laugh i recoiled as newts black presence was suddenly in my head how many mistakes can one life survive echoed crystallinelike in my mind but whose thought it was i didnt know newt pressed the air from my lungs and my mind shattered i was everywhere and nowhere the perfect disconnection of the line raced through me making me exist in every line on the continent ivy i thought again starting to panic until i remembered her fastening on her indomitable will and the tragedy of her desires ivy i want to go to ivy with a savage jealous thought newt snapped my soul back together gasping i covered my ears as a loud pop shook me i fell forward my elbows and knees smacking into gray tile people screamed and i heard the crash of metal papers flew and someone shouted to call the is rachel ivy cried i looked up past my falling hair to see i was in what looked like a hospital hallway ivy was sitting in an orange plastic chair her eyes red and her cheeks blotchy shock in her wide brown eyes david was beside her dirty and disheveled kistens blood on his hands and chest a phone rang and went unanswered hi i said weakly my arms starting to tremble uh could one of you maybe check me in i dont feel so good ivy stood reaching out i tipped forward my cheek hit the tile the last thing i remember was my hand touching hers thirtythree coming i called out my pace quickening as i strode through the dusky sanctuary to the door my snow boots thumping to leave small inverse divots of snow behind the huge dinner bell that was our doorbell clanked again and i picked up the pace im coming dont ring the bell again or the neighbors will call the is for gods sake the reverberations were still echoing when i reached for the handle the nylon of my coat making a sliding sound my nose was cold and my fingers were frozen the warmth of the church not having had enough time to warm them up david i exclaimed opening the door to find him on the softly lit stoop hi rachel he said looking comfortably attractive with his glasses long coat thick stubble and his cowboy hat dusted with snow the bottle of wine in his hand helped an older man stood beside him in a leather jacket and jeans he was taller than david and i eyed his lightly wrinkled but trim physique in question a wisp of snowwhite hair peeped from under his hat there was a twig in his grip unquestionably a symbolic offering for the solstice bonfire out back and i realized he was a witch davids old partner i thought a limo idled softly behind them but i was guessing they had come in the blue fourdoor parked in front of it rachel david said drawing my gaze back to them this is howard my old partner pleased to meet you howard i said extending my hand the pleasure is mine smiling he slipped off a glove to extend a softly wrinkled freckled hand david told me all about you and i invited myself i hope you dont mind not at all i said earnestly the more the merrier howard pumped my hand up and down three times before releasing it i had to come he said green eyes glinting the chance to meet the woman who can outrun david and put up with his working style doesnt come along very often you two did good with saladan his voice was deeper than i expected and the feeling of being evaluated strengthened thank you i said mildly embarrassed i shifted back from the doorway in invitation were all back by the fire come on in its easier to go through the church than stumble through the garden the back way howard slipped inside in a whiff of redwood while david knocked the snow from his boots he hesitated looking up at the new sign above the door nice he said just get it yeah mood going soft i leaned out to look up at it the deeply engraved brass plaque had been bolted to the front of the church above the door it had come with a light and the single bulb lit the stoop in a soft glow its a solstice gift for ivy and jenks david made a sound of approval laced with understanding i flicked my attention from him back to the sign vampire charms llc tamwood jenks and morgan i loved it and i hadnt minded paying extra to make it a rush order ivys eyes had gotten very wide when i pulled her out on the stoop that afternoon to see it i thought she was going to cry id given her a hug right there on the landing as it was obvious she wanted to give me one but was afraid id take it the wrong way she was my friend damn it i could hug her if i wanted im hoping it helps stop the rumors about me being dead i said ushering him in the paper was really quick to print my obituary but because im not a vamp they wont put anything in the risenagain announcements unless i pay for it imagine that david said i could hear the laughter in his voice and i gave him a dry look as he stomped his boots a final time and came in you look good for a dead witch thanks your hair is almost back to normal how about the rest of you i shut the door flattered at the sound of concern in his voice howard stood in the middle of the sanctuary his eyes ranging over ivys piano and my desk im doing okay i said my stamina is shot but its coming back my hair though i tucked a curl of reddishbrown hair behind an ear and the soft knit hat my mother had given me that afternoon the box said it washes out in five shampoos i said sourly im still waiting somewhat peeved at the reminder of my hair i led the way into the kitchen the two men trailing behind actually my hair was the least of my worries yesterday i had found a scar with a familiar circleandslash pattern on the arch of my left foot newts claim of a favor i owed two demons but i was alive i was alive and was no ones familiar and finding the mark there had been better than waking up with a big n tattooed on my forehead davids steps faltered as he saw the plates of goodies laid out on the table ivys workspace had been pushed into a threebythreefoot section the rest was full of cookies fudge cold cuts and crackers help yourself i said refusing to get worked up about things currently out of my control do you want to nuke your wine before we go out i asked eating a slice of salami ive got a pitcher to warm it up in i could use my new charm but it wasnt reliable and i was tired of burning my tongue the clunk of the wine as it hit the table was loud you drink it warm david said sounding appalled as he looked at the microwave ivy and kisten do seeing the were hesitate i gave the pot of spiced cider on the stove a quick stir we can warm up half and put the rest in a snow bank if you want i added sure david said his short fingers manipulating the foilwrapped top howard began filling a plate but at davids pointed look he started mmmm the older witch said abruptly plate in hand mind if i go out back and introduce myself he wiggled the twig sandwiched between his hand and the foam plate in explanation i havent been to a solstice burning in a long time a smile came over me go right on out the door is through the living room david and howard exchanged another look and the witch found his way i heard a soft rise of voices in greeting as he opened the door david exhaled slowly something was up rachel he said ive got a paper for you to sign my smile froze what did i do i blurted was it breaking lees car no he said and my chest tightened when his eyes dropped oh god it must be bad what is it i set the spoon in the sink and turned gripping my elbows david unzipped his coat and pulled out a trifolded paper and handed it to me taking his bottle he started to open it you dont have to sign it if you dont want to he said glancing at me from under his cowboy hat i wont be offended really you can say no its okay i went cold then hot as i read the simply worded statement wonder in me as i looked up and met his anxious eyes you want me to be a member of your pack i stammered i dont have one he rushed to explain youd be the only one in it im a registered loner but my company wont fire someone with tenure if theyre an alpha male or female i could say nothing and he rushed to fill the silence i uh feel bad for trying to bribe you he said its not like were married or anything but it gives you the right to get your insurance through me and if either of us is hospitalized we have access to the medical records and have a say as to what happens if the other is unconscious i dont have anyone to make those kind of decisions for me and id rather have you than a court or my siblings he shrugged with one shoulder you can come to the company picnic too my gaze fell to the paper then rose to his stubbled face then back to the paper what about your old partner he peeked over the paper to look at the print it takes a female to make a pack oh i stared at the form why me i asked honored hed ask but bewildered there must be lots of were women who would jump at the chance there are and thats just it dropping back he rested against the island counter i dont want a pack too much responsibility too many ties packs grow and even if i went into this with another were with the understanding that it was an agreement on paper and nothing else she would expect certain things and so would her kin he looked at the ceiling his eyes showing his age and when those things werent provided they would start to treat her like a whore instead of an alpha bitch i wont have that problem with you he met my eyes will i i blinked starting slightly ah no a smile quirked the corner of my mouth alpha bitch that sounded about right gotta pen i asked david exhaled with a soft puff relief in his eyes we need three witnesses i couldnt stop grinning wait until i told ivy shed have kittens we both spun to the window as a whoosh of flame and a shout rose high ivy threw a second bough of evergreen on the bonfire and the fire billowed up again she was taking to my familys tradition of a solstice fire with an unsettling enthusiasm i can think of three people off the top of my head i said jamming it into a back pocket david nodded we dont have to do it tonight but the fiscal year is coming up and well want to file it before then so you can start your benefits and get a line in the new catalog i was on tiptoe to reach a pitcher for the wine and david reached up and got it for me theres a catalog i asked as i dropped to my heels his eyes were wide you want to remain anonymous that costs extra but okay i shrugged not knowing whats everyone going to say when you show up at the company picnic with me david poured half the wine into the pitcher and set it to heat in the microwave nothing they all think im rabid anyway the smile wouldnt leave me as i ladled out a mug of spiced cider his motive might be slantedwanting the extra security for his jobbut we would both benefit so it was with a much improved mood that we headed for the back door his warmed wine and halfempty bottle in his hands and my spiced cider in mine the heat of the church had taken the chill from me and i led the way into the living room davids steps slowed while he took in the softly glowing room ivy and i had decorated and purple red gold and green were everywhere her leather stocking had looked lonely on the mantel so i had bought a red and green knit one with a bell on the toe embracing any holiday that got me presents ivy had even hung a little white stocking for jenks that she had taken from her sisters doll collection but the jar of honey wouldnt come close to fitting in it ivys christmas tree glowed in the corner looking ethereal id never had one before and i felt honored she had let me help her decorate it with tissuepaperwrapped ornaments we had made a night of it as we listened to music and ate the popcorn that never made it onto a string there were only two things under it one for me one for ivy both from jenks he was gone but his presents to us had been left behind in opposite bedrooms i reached for the handle of the new door a lump in my throat we had opened them alreadyneither one of us were good at waiting ivy had sat and stared at the bitemebetty doll her jaw clenched and her breathing almost nonexistent i hadnt been much better all but crying upon finding the pair of cell phones in their foam box one was for me the other much smaller one was for jenks according to the receipt still in the box he had activated it last month and even put himself on speed dial on mine yanking open the door i held it for david my jaw clenched id get him to come back if i had to hire a pilot to write my apology in the sky i would get him to come back david i said as he passed if i give you something will you take it to jenks he glanced at me from the first step down maybe he said warily i grimaced its just some seeds i couldnt find anything in my language of flowers book that said im sorry im an ass so i went with forgetmenots okay he said sounding more sure i can do that thanks it was a whisper but i was sure he heard me over the calls at his arrival i took the heated wine from david and placed it near the fire howard looked content talking to keasley and ceri sneaking unsure glances at takata lurking in the morecertain shadows of the oak tree come on over i said to david as kisten tried to get his attention ivys sister was prattling next to him and he looked exhausted i want you to meet takata the midnight air was crisp almost painfully dry and i smiled at ivy when i saw her trying to explain to ceri the art of making a smore the puzzled elf didnt understand how layering chocolate between a sugary grain product and spun confection could possibly taste good her words not mine i was sure her opinion would change after she ate one i felt kistens eyes on me from around the lowering flames and i stifled a shiver the comeandgo light played on his face not unattractively thinner after his stint in the hospital my thoughts of nick had waned to a soft ache under the living vamps attentions kist was here and nick wasnt the reality was nick hadnt truly been here for months he hadnt called or sent a solstice card and he had intentionally left no way for me to reach him it was time to move on takata shifted his perch atop the picnic table in case we wanted to sit the concert earlier tonight had gone off without a hitch and since lee wasnt around ivy and i watched from backstage takata had dedicated red ribbons to our firm and half the crowd had waved their lighters in tribute thinking i was still dead i had only been joking when i invited him to my bonfire but i was glad he came he seemed to relish that no one was fawning over him as he sat contentedly in the background i recognized that distant look on his lined face from when ivy was planning a run and wondered if his next album might have a song about sparks among the frostblackened arms of an oak takata i said as we approached and he came back to himself id like you to meet david hue hes the insurance adjustor who helped me get to saladan david takata said taking off his glove before extending his thin long hand nice to meet you it looks like you escaped unscathed from rachels latest run david smiled warmly without showing his teeth pretty much he said as he released his hand and rocked back a step though i wasnt sure when those handguns showed up making a mock shudder he shifted so his front would be warmed by the flames too much for me he said softly i was glad he wasnt wideeyed and stammering or squealing and jumping up and down like erica had done until kisten collared her and dragged her away david kisten called when my thoughts pulled my eyes to him can i talk to you about my boat how much do you think it would cost to insure her through you a sound of pain slipped from david the price of being in insurance he said softly my eyebrows rose i think he just wants to get someone between him and erica the girl does not shut up david pushed himself into motion you wont leave me alone too long will you i grinned is that one of my responsibilities as a member of your pack i said and takatas eyes widened as a matter of fact it is raising his hand to kisten he ambled to him stopping to nudge a log back into the flames with the toe of his boot as he went howard was laughing at him from across the fire his green eyes glinting i looked to find takatas thick eyebrows high member of his pack he questioned nodding i sat beside takata on top of the picnic table for insurance purposes setting my spiced cider down i put my elbows on my knees and sighed i loved the solstice and not just for the food and parties cincinnati dropped all of its lights from midnight until sunrise and it was the only time i ever saw the night sky as it was supposed to be anyone thieving during the blackout was dealt with hard curtailing any problems how are you doing takata said surprising me i had almost forgotten he was there i heard you were hospitalized i smiled sheepishly knowing i was starting to look tired after screaming for twoplus hours at takatas concert im okay they werent ready to release me but kisten was just down the hall and after they caught us ah experimenting with the controls for the bed they decided we both were well enough to be on the streets crabby old night nurse by the amount of fuss she made one would have thought we were committing some kind of kinkywell crabby old night nurse anyway takata eyed me as i flushed and pulled my knit hat down lower over my ears theres a limo out front i said to change the subject want me to tell them to go away his gaze went up into the black branches they can wait they have food in there nodding i relaxed you want some warm wine he started his wide eyes looking shocked no no thanks more spiced cider then i offered here i havent had any of mine just put a swallow in there he said extending his empty cup and i poured half of my drink into his i felt kinda special sitting next to takata with half my drink in his mug but i stiffened as a faint twang reverted through me i froze not knowing what it was and takatas eyes met mine you felt it too he said and i nodded feeling uneasy and a little worried what was it takatas wide mouth turned into a huge smile as he laughed at me the circle at fountain square happy solstice he raised his cup and i automatically touched mine to it happy solstice i echoed thinking it odd that i had felt it i never had before but then maybe having closed it myself once made me sensitive to it feeling as if all was right with the world i sipped my cider finding davids eyes pleading with me over the rim of my mug ericas mouth was going nonstop and kisten was gripping his shoulder trying to have a conversation around her excuse me i said as i slid from the table david needs rescuing takata chuckled and i made my unhurried way past the fire though he never stopped talking to david kistens eyes were on me and i felt a warm spot start in my middle erica i said coming even with them takata wants to play a song for you takata jerked upright giving me a panicked look when the young woman squealed both kisten and david slumped in relief as she darted around the fire to him thank god kisten whispered and i sat down in her spot that girl never shuts up snorting i eased closer pushing into his thigh hinting he curved an arm around me as i wanted pulling me close kisten exhaled softly and a shiver rippled over me i knew he felt it when my scar started tingling stop it i whispered embarrassed and his grip tightened i cant help it he said on an intake of breath when is everyone going to be leaving sunup i said setting my drink down absence makes the heart grow fonder its not my heart that misses you he breathed and a second shiver passed through me so kisten said loudly when david started to look uncomfortable rachel tells me you asked her to be your absent partner so you could get two salaries and she could get a good rate on her insurance ah yes david stammered looking down so his hat hid his eyes about that i jumped as kistens cold hand worked its way under my coat and touched the skin at my waist i like that he murmured not talking about how his fingers were tracing small circles to warm my middle inventive my kind of man davids head came up would you excuse me he muttered sending a quick hand to fiddle with his glasses i havent said hello to ceri and keasley yet i chuckled and kisten pulled me closer you do that mr peabody kisten said the short were jerked to a stop gave him a warning frown then continued stopping to get a glass of his wine on the way my smile slowly faded the scent of leather became obvious mixing with the hard aroma of burning ash and i snuggled closer into kisten hey i said softly my gaze fixed on the fire david wants me to sign a paper make me part of his pack his breath caught youre kidding he said pushing me away so he could focus on me his blue eyes were wide and his face surprised and wondering looking at my cold fingers i slipped them into his id like you to witness it oh his gaze went to the fire and he shifted his arm to lean a smidgen away i grinned in understanding and laughed no you idiot i said pushing on his arm its a pack membership not an interspecies bond im not marrying the guy for the turns sake its only a legal agreement so i can get my insurance through him and his company wont fire him hed ask a were woman but he doesnt want a pack and thats what hed get if he asked one kisten exhaled long and slow and i could feel the softness return to his grip good he said pulling me closer cause youre my alpha bitch babe and no one elses i gave him a telling look which was hard to do seeing as i was almost in his lap babe i said dryly you know what i did to the last guy who called me that kisten jerked me closer maybe later love he whispered to start a delicious tingle in me we dont want to shock your friends he added and i followed his gaze to where howard and keasley were laughing while ceri tried to eat her smore without getting messy will you witness the paper for me i asked sure his grip around me tightened i think making ties is a good thing his arm slipped from me and i followed his gaze to see ivy glaring at us ivy might not though suddenly concerned i pulled away ivy got to her feet and with steps quick and long she strode up the porch steps and into the church the back door shut hard enough to make the wreath fall off not noticing erica sprang into a flurry of motion to move a bench closer to the fire the conversation grew excited and keasley and ceri drifted over when takata finally pulled out the guitar he brought with him but had been ignoring he settled himself long fingers moving slowly from the cold as he strummed it was nice really nice the only thing missing was jenkss wiseass remarks and a sprinkling of pixy dust i sighed and kistens lips brushed my ear youll get him back he breathed surprised he knew where my thoughts were i said are you sure i felt him nod come springtime and he can get out again hell be back he thinks too much of you to not listen once his pride starts to heal but i know all about big egos rachel youre going to have to grovel i can do that i said in a small voice he thinks its his fault kisten continued ill convince him otherwise his breath was a puff behind my ear thats my girl i smiled at the stirring of feelings he was instilling in me my gaze went to the shadow of ivy in the kitchen then back to the impromptu music one down two more to go and they were likely going to be the hardest ones it wasnt as if i could ask ceri or keasley there was a spot on that form for a social security number ceri didnt have one and i knew without asking keasley wouldnt want to put his down i had a suspicion by the lack of government checks that he was playing dead could you excuse me i murmured as ivys shadow behind the glass was eclipsed by a swirl of mist from the hot water she was running into the sink kistens hold loosened takatas blue eyes met mine before i turned away an unknown emotion in them i paused to put the cedar wreath back on its hook before i went in the warmth of the church hit me and i took my hat off and tossed it to the black hearth i entered the kitchen to find ivy leaning against the counter her head down and her hands gripping her elbows hi i said hesitating in the threshold let me see the contract she said extending her hand and her head coming up my lips parted how did i stammered a faint sour smile crossed her and was gone sound carries well over flame embarrassed i pulled it out of my pocket feeling it both cold from the night and warm from my body she took it her brow furrowed turning her back on me she unfolded it i fidgeted um i need three witnesses i said id like you to be one of them why she didnt turn around and her shoulders were tense david doesnt have a pack i said its harder to fire him if he does he gets to keep his job working solo and i can get my insurance through him its only two hundred a month ivy hes not looking for anything more than that or he would have asked a were woman i know my question is why do you want my signature paper in hand she turned the empty look on her face making me uncomfortable why is it important to you that i sign it i opened my mouth then shut it my thoughts touched on what newt had said home hadnt been a strong enough pull but ivy was because youre my partner i said warming because what i do affects you ivy silently plucked a pen from her pencil cup and clicked it open i suddenly felt awkward realizing that davids little paper granted him something she wanted a recognizable connection with me i did a background check on him when you were in the hospital she said hes not hooking up with you to help him out with a preexisting problem my eyebrows rose i hadnt thought about that he said this was a nostringsattached affair i hesitated ivy i live with you i said trying to reassure her that our friendship didnt need a paper or signature to be real and both our names were above the door both of them she was silent her face empty of emotion her brown eyes still you trust him i nodded i had to go with my gut feeling here the barest smile appeared on her me too pushing a plate of cookies aside she wrote her name on the first line in a careful but almost illegible signature thanks i said and she handed it back my gaze went past her as the back door opened ivy looked up and i recognized a softening in her gaze when kistens familiar footsteps thumped on the rug beside the door knocking off the snow he came into the kitchen david on his heels are we signing the paper or not kisten said the tension in his voice telling me he was ready to argue with ivy if she was balking ivy clicked her pen open and shut so fast that it hummed i already did your turn he squared his shoulders grinning as he took the pen when she extended it adding his masculine signature under hers his social security number was next and he handed the pen to david david edged between them looking small beside their tall grace i could see his relief as he wrote his full name my pulse increased and i took the pen pulling the paper closer so kisten said when i signed it who are you going to ask to be the third witness jenks ivy and i said together and i looked up our eyes met and i clicked the pen closed will you ask him for me i said to david the were picked up the paper carefully folding it and tucking it away in an inner coat pocket you dont want to ask someone else he might not i glanced at ivy and straightened tucking a curl of hair behind my ear hes a member of this firm i said if he wants to spend the winter sulking in a weres basement thats fine with me but he had better get his little pixy butt back here when the weather breaks or im going to be royally pissed i took a deep breath adding and maybe this will convince him hes a valued member of the team and that im sorry kisten took a shuffling step back ill ask him david said the back door opened and erica tumbled in her cheeks red and her eyes snapping hey come on hes ready to play god save you hes warmed up and ready to play and youre inside eating get your asses out here ivys attention went from the snow she had tracked in to my eyes david lurched into motion pushing the flighty goth vamp out before him kisten followed the noise of their conversation heady with the sound of companionship takatas music rose and my eyes widened when ceris ethereal voice was set to a carol older than even she she indeed sang in latin my eyebrows rose and i looked at ivy ivy zipped her coat up and got her mittens from the counter you really okay with this i asked her she nodded asking jenks to sign that paper might be the only way to hammer it into his thick skull that we need him i made a face and went before her as i tried to come up with a way to convey to jenks how wrong i had been to not trust him i had slipped algaliarepts snare managing to not only get rid of one of my demon marks but also break my familiar bond with nick toonot that it mattered now i had gone out on a date with the citys most powerful bachelor and had breakfast with him i had rescued a thousandyearold elf learned how to be my own familiar and discovered i could throw a mean craps game not to mention i found you could have sex with a vampire and not get bitten why did i have the feeling that getting jenks to talk to me was going to be harder than all that put together well get him back ivy murmured behind me we will get him back thumping down the snowcovered stairs and going into the music and starfilled night i swore we would
